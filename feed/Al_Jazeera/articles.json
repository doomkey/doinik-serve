The Punjab-born opener has yet to appear in Test or one-day international cricket for India, but has already recorded two centuries and eight fifties for his country in the shortest format.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4290828\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4290828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4290828\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-09-24T154543Z_1902624916_UP1EL9O17S34H_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-ASIACUP-IND-BGD-1770310206.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India's Abhishek Sharma \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4290828\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India’s Abhishek Sharma made his international debut in 2024 [Satish Kumar/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"sikandar-raza-zimbabwe\">Sikandar Raza – Zimbabwe</h2><p>An elder statesman at the tournament, Sikandar Raza commands huge respect not only in Zimbabwe but also in Pakistan. Born in Punjab, the 39-year-old switched Asia for Africa with his family just after the turn of the century.</p><p>The right-handed batter, who also bowls both off and leg-break, made his debut for Zimbabwe in 2013 and has 152 appearances across all formats on arrival at the T20 World Cup. It is in the shortest format where he has achieved the most success, becoming a gun player for numerous T20 sides the world over.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291220\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291220\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291220\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25324512211826-1770324530.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe's Sikandar Raza plays a shot during the tri-series T20 cricket match between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza has one T20 international century and 16 fifties to his name [Anjum Naveed/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"abrar-ahmed-pakistan\">Abrar Ahmed – Pakistan</h2><p>Wrist spinners have long been regarded as the key to any successful T20 side and, in Abrar Ahmed, Pakistan have a player capable of turning a match on sixpence. The 27-year-old leg-break bowler only made his Test debut in 2022 and had to wait until 2024 to make his bow in both white-ball formats.</p><p>Then, 116 wickets for his country followed, including 46 in T20 internationals at an average of 17 with an economy just below seven. The greatest challenge for Abrar in his career has sadly been persistent back injuries, which slowed his early years and delayed his international debut. Both he and Pakistan will hope those problems are long behind him now.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291226\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291226\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291226\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26029509272229-1770324612.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan's Abrar Ahmed celebrates after the dismissal of Australia's Josh Philippe during the first T20 cricket match between Pakistan and Australia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed took six wickets in the recent 3-0 T20 series win against Australia [K M Chaudary/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"harry-brook-england\">Harry Brook – England</h2><p>Arguably England’s most exciting talent, Harry Brook certainly has the ability to be their most explosive. The 26-year-old batter already has 134 caps for his country, with 13 centuries in that time, and claimed a T20 World Cup winners’ medal at the 2022 edition.</p><p>The right-hander was the first Englishman to score a triple century in Test cricket since Graham Gooch’s 333 against India in 1990. Brook’s effort came in Pakistan in 2024 and was achieved at nearly a run-a-ball. He has already represented three teams in the IPL and has 169 T20 appearances to his name in total, with three centuries and 16 fifties at a strike rate of 152.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291237\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291237\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291237\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-01T151224Z_1006274158_UP1EM21168NWU_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-T20-LKA-ENG-1770324832.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"England's Harry Brook in action against Sri Lanka\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">England’s Harry Brook in action [Lahiru Harshana/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"glenn-maxwell-australia\">Glenn Maxwell – Australia</h2><p>Maxwell has long been the darling of white-ball cricket the world over. The best example of his incredible talent came when, severely hampered by injury, he dragged Australia into the semifinals of the 2023 Cricket World Cup with an unbeaten double century.</p><p>The 37-year-old had the nickname “The Big Show” long before that knock, and has been a near ever-present – and one of the highest earners – in the Indian Premier League. Maxwell arrives in India and Sri Lanka with 281 international appearances under his belt, and – even with age against him – one of cricket’s greatest game changers could well have another trick up his sleeve for Australia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291257\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291257\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291257\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/13266290-1770325404.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Australia's Glenn Maxwell\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn Maxwell made his Australia debut in 2012 [Darren England/EPA]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>My name is Krishna Nandi. I am a Hindu. I am a businessman. I am also a parliamentary candidate of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>For many readers, this combination appears unusual. For me, it reflects a deeper truth about politics in Bangladesh that has long been obscured by fear, misinformation and political convenience.</p><p>My nomination has generated national debate because it challenges a long-held assumption that an Islamic political party cannot genuinely represent religious minorities. I welcome this debate. My candidacy exists precisely to confront this assumption directly and openly.</p><p>I want to state clearly what I have said repeatedly to people across my constituency. If Jamaat-e-Islami comes to power, no Hindu will have to leave Bangladesh. No Hindu will be forced to go to India. Instead, Hindus will live in this country with dignity, safety and respect. When I say that Hindus will be treated with honour, I am not speaking symbolically. I am talking about concrete guarantees of security, justice and equal citizenship under the law.</p><p>For decades, fear has been deliberately planted in the minds of minority communities. Hindus have been told that Islamic politics automatically means their persecution. This narrative has been politically useful for some but deeply harmful for national unity. My nomination itself is a living contradiction of this claim, and it has already restored confidence among many who had lost faith in politics altogether.</p><p>I joined Jamaat-e-Islami in 2003, not out of convenience but out of conviction. I found discipline, accountability and moral clarity within the party. Jamaat does not buy votes with money. It does not rely on intimidation, extortion or violence.</p><p>These are not rhetorical claims. They are principles enforced internally. That is why many ordinary citizens, including minorities, are now reassessing their political choices.</p><p>People are losing confidence in traditional political parties. This includes parties that once spoke the language of democracy but gradually normalised corruption, violence and impunity. Citizens are not simply voting against something. They are searching for an alternative that is serious about justice, governance and moral responsibility.</p><p>Jamaat is increasingly being seen as that alternative. In my constituency of Khulna-1, people have suffered for years due to extortion, political violence and fear. Hindus, in particular, have faced targeted attacks, discrimination and economic marginalisation. Many have lost jobs unfairly. Families have lived under constant pressure.</p><p>I have said clearly that these injustices will not be ignored. Those dismissed unfairly will receive justice through lawful procedures. Violence and intimidation against any community will not be tolerated.</p><p>I do not believe in broker-based politics. I do not operate through intermediaries. My phone number is with the people, and it will remain so. Representation should be direct, accountable and continuous — not something activated only during election seasons.</p><p>There have been attempts to intimidate me. Local power structures, including figures linked to established parties, have tried to apply pressure. My response has been firm. I cannot be silenced and I cannot be pushed aside. Fear has dominated our politics for too long. If we surrender to it, nothing will change.</p><p>Another issue that deserves honesty is history. I do not deny that minorities in Bangladesh have suffered at different moments under different governments. That suffering cannot be erased by rhetoric. What matters is whether a political movement is willing to confront injustice rather than deny it.</p><p>My presence within Jamaat-e-Islami is not an attempt to rewrite history but to shape the future. Many ask whether Jamaat is only for Muslims. My answer is straightforward. Jamaat is an Islamic party in values but a national party in responsibility. Justice, accountability and human dignity are not owned by any one religion.</p><p>During the July 2024 uprising in Bangladesh, naturally many amongst minority religious communities felt unsafe and insecure. However, it was members of organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami who gave us protection and safe guarded our temples and places of worship.</p><p>A state governed by justice protects minorities better than a state governed by slogans. When families fall into poverty, Jamaat-linked welfare networks step in without asking about religion or political loyalty. This culture of service explains why many citizens see Jamaat not as a party of slogans but as a party of discipline, structure and responsibility.</p><p>For international observers, I want to be equally clear. This election is not about importing ideology or exporting fear. It is about restoring trust between citizens and the state.</p><p>Bangladesh is a plural society by reality, not by charity. Any political force that ignores that fact cannot govern sustainably. My candidacy is not only about winning a seat, it is also about opening a new political conversation in Bangladesh. A conversation beyond fear, beyond communal suspicion and beyond the idea that identity must divide us.</p><p>I stand as a Hindu candidate, not in spite of Jamaat-e-Islami but because I believe its principles can help build a safer, fairer Bangladesh for all. This country belongs to all of us.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Relations between the two countries have been rocky, however, and last year, Trump instigated a bitter trade <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">war</a> with Beijing.</p><p>“The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump wrote in his post on Wednesday.</p><p>The two leaders were understood to have discussed a planned trip by the US president to Beijing later this year, Trump said, adding that he was “looking forward to it”.</p><p>China reacted in a more muted manner to the call, with state media reporting that both sides discussed opportunities to meet in the coming year. There was no mention of Trump’s visit to Beijing, nor of buying soya beans.</p><p>According to China’s state news agency Xinhua, Xi told Trump that he was willing to “work with you to steer the giant ship of China-US relations steadily forward through winds and storms, and accomplish more big things and good things”.</p><p>While the call indicates that both sides wish to keep talks on an even keel, it does not disguise the competing interests of each, analyst Manoj Kewalramani of the India-based Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Implicit in this is the understanding the relationship is likely to remain difficult owing to the underlying strategic competition (between them),” he added.</p><p>Beijing is set to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Meeting in November. The US, meanwhile, is hosting the G20 Summit in December.</p><p>The two leaders last held a phone call in November to discuss several topics, including trade, amid the US’s tariff war. Trump’s erratic trade policies caused Chinese exports to the US to fall, but also saw Beijing’s exports to other countries <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/chinas-trade-surplus-hits-new-heights-in-2025-despite-us-tariff-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soar last year.</a></p><p>Here’s what we know about the latest phone call and what it means for US-China relations:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203187\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203187\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203187\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-30T041747Z_802381822_RC2RQIALJQYG_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS-1767075756.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C573&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Taiwan Coast Guard vessel travels near a China Coast Guard vessel as China conducts military drills around Taiwan, in this handout image provided December 30, 2025.

Past administrations have maintained a “strategic ambiguity” position, which does not clearly rule in or out that Washington would step in to defend Taipei in case of a Chinese attack – leaving Beijing guessing.</p><p>Unlike previous governments, however, Trump has not prioritised support for Taiwan and has instead focused on making deals.</p><p>The US’s 2026 National Defense Strategy, published last month, made no mention of Taiwan, although earlier versions of it noted China’s “provocative” overtures in the waters close to Taiwan. Most recently, China held <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/how-are-chinas-new-war-games-around-taiwan-different-from-earlier-drills\">military drills</a> in the waters and airspace around Taiwan’s main island in late December last year.</p><p>In December, the US announced a huge arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $10bn, including medium-range missiles, drones and howitzers, drawing anger from China.</p><p>Xi told Trump on the Wednesday phone call to handle any weapons sales to Taiwan with “prudence”, according to Chinese state media.</p><p>The Chinese leader also warned that Taiwan was part of “China’s territory”, and that China “must safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p>“China will never allow Taiwan to be separated,” state broadcaster CGTN quoted Xi as saying.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-persuaded-china-to-buy-more-us-goods\">Has Trump persuaded China to buy more US goods?</h2><p>China and the US are the world’s largest economies and are also important trading partners. However, the US imports more from China than it exports to the country, with the trade deficit reaching about $300bn by 2024. This trade imbalance is what Trump sought to change when he slapped tariffs on China of 145 percent last year.</p><p>The US’s top export to China is soya beans. Following his call with Xi on Wednesday, the US president claimed the two had discussed Beijing’s purchase of US oil, increased purchase of US soya beans and the delivery of aeroplane engines. However, this has not been specifically confirmed by China since the call between Trump and Xi.</p><p>China has shown some willingness to cede to these sorts of demands from Trump, however. The country’s state-run Sinograin and COFCO have already bought about 12 million tonnes of US soya beans since October trade talks with the US, paying close to $100m more than they would have done for Brazilian beans.</p><p>“Is there a market logic at the moment for China procuring a bunch more US soya beans, just as Brazil’s harvest comes in? No,” Even Rogers Pay, director of Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, told the Reuters news agency on Thursday. “But could it smooth the path for an even more productive and lucrative state visit by Trump in April? Perhaps.”</p><p>Last year’s trade war between Washington and Beijing saw both sides increase tariffs in a series of announcements. US tariffs on Chinese imports reached 145 percent, while China’s retaliatory taxes reached 125 percent. Following negotiations and an in-person meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea in October, the US reduced tariffs to 47.5 percent while China lowered them to 31.9 percent.</p><p>“Beijing is particularly pleased with its own handling of the trade war with the United States, which Chinese analysts largely view as having played out to China’s advantage,” said analyst Patricia Kim of the Brookings Institution.</p><p>“From their perspective, President Trump’s evident desire to reach a trade deal with China, combined with the expectation of multiple leader-level engagements over the course of the year, has effectively bought China time and strategic breathing room from the most hawkish policy impulses in Washington,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-bones-of-contention-exist-between-trump-and-xi\">What other bones of contention exist between Trump and Xi?</h2><h3>Iran</h3><p>Trump said the two leaders discussed “the situation in Iran” among other topics.</p><p>Tensions between Washington and Tehran are currently high due to the Iranian government’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deadly crackdown on wide antigovernment demonstrations</a> that were held between December and early January.</p><p>Trump has also said he’s considering military action in Iran that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysts say</a> could lead to government change there. Since late January, the US has been amassing military forces in the Arabian Sea, triggering concerns of a potential Venezuela-style US invasion that saw President Nicolas Maduro abducted and taken to the US to be tried on guns-and-drugs charges in December.</p><p>The US, which <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-nuclear-sites-how-big-are-radiation-risks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacked</a> three Iranian nuclear sites during last July’s Iran-Israel war, has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pressing</a> Tehran to abandon its nuclear programs and not enrich uranium at all, even for civilian purposes.</p><p>Iran has repeatedly resisted US orders, insisting it doesn’t have plans to manufacture military-grade nuclear weapons. US and Iranian officials are expected to hold talks in Oman on Friday on the issue.</p><p>Last week, the US announced sanctions on unnamed Iranian government officials it said were responsible for the crackdowns on protesters. Washington has long imposed sanctions on Tehran, which have significantly weakened the Iranian economy.</p><p>In January, Trump announced a new 25 percent trade tariff on countries trading with Iran, in a bid to pressure and isolate Tehran.</p><p>China is Iran’s largest trading partner and buys most of Iran’s oil. It’s unclear, however, if Trump directly asked Xi to stop buying Iranian oil in the way he has pressured India to stop buying Russian oil. China has not commented on this.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4289851\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4289851\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4289851\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698462ae-1770283694.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Firefighters work near a building damaged in a Russian overnight drone attack, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in a place given as Kyiv, Ukraine February 5, 2026, in this screengrab from a handout video.

Both have sought to present a strong front, and Beijing has never denounced the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, is attempting to secure a permanent ceasefire to the four-year Ukraine war. This week, Russian and Ukrainian officials are meeting in Abu Dhabi in talks brokered by the US.</p><p>Beijing imports Russian oil, coal, timber and copper. Amid Western sanctions on Russia, Beijing’s trade with Moscow has proven an economic lifeline, particularly as Washington has successfully used tariffs to force countries like India to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/trump-to-slash-us-tariffs-on-india-from-50-percent-to-18-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stop buying Russian oil</a>.</p><p>Both are founding members of the BRICS economic bloc, which stands for the original member countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Iran, which also joined, participated last month, together with Russia and China, in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/why-is-south-africa-upset-about-iran-joining-brics-naval-drills\">military training</a> in South Africa.</p><p>President Xi separately held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin also on Wednesday and said both sides would continue working together strategically, although neither went into details. There was no mention of Ukraine.</p><p>Beijing has so far shown no signs of scaling back its trade relations with Russia or Iran, experts say, and is not likely to do so.</p><p>“Chinese officials frame its economic relationships as matters of sovereignty and principle, and insist they will continue trading with partners of their choosing,” Kim of the Brookings Institution said.</p><p>The Trump administration has not explicitly tied progress in the two countries’ trade negotiations to exerting economic pressure on Moscow or Tehran, and that “makes it easier for Beijing to disregard those requests”, Kim said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Critical minerals</h3><p>Critical minerals have been a recurring source of tension between the two countries. Important minerals, which include rare earth metals like samarium and promethium, are important for the manufacture of high-tech gadgets and devices, from smartphones and electric cars to fighter jets.</p><p>China currently dominates the mining and processing of such minerals, but the US wants to break that hold. Last year, China tightened export controls on rare-earth metals amid its tense trade war with the US. The move dealt a blow to US supplies and affected US industries that are highly reliant on Chinese supplies.</p><p>Following a truce called by Trump and Xi in October last year, Beijing has paused some of these restrictions, but experts say its dominance remains a key leverage in dealing with the US.</p><p>On Monday, Trump announced a new $12bn US critical mineral reserve – <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Project Vault”</a>, in a bid to boost US stockpiles. He has also held a critical minerals “ministerial” with representatives from 50 countries in Washington this week, to discuss ways to diversify supply chains and break China’s stranglehold.</p><p>On Wednesday, during that ministerial, US Vice President JD Vance proposed a critical mineral trading bloc, with South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/we-are-exploited-congolese-fear-losing-out-as-us-makes-minerals-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, among others, in attendance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’re preparing for festivities that have long been a central facet of life in Lahore, but were banned in 2007.</p><p>Now, Basant, as the three-day festival is called, is returning, starting on Friday. The historic Mochi Gate, one of old Lahore’s 13 gates that date back to the Mughal era, is bustling once again with shops selling kites along narrow, dimly lit streets.</p><p>For the past six days, thousands of people have poured in to buy kites and related paraphernalia. Historically rooted in Vasant Panchami, Basant marks the arrival of spring on the fifth day of the month of Magh in the Hindu lunar calendar. Across Punjab, in both India and Pakistan, people celebrate with singing, dancing and — historically — with kite flying.</p><p>But for 18 years, the festival was not allowed. Several deaths linked to accidents while retrieving kites and to the use of chemical-coated kite strings caused public outrage. Despite attempts by successive governments, Basant remained shelved until now.</p><p>Its return has triggered a surge in business, boosting the local economy. Kite sellers report sales nearing one billion rupees ($3.5m) for kites and string alone.</p><p>Khalid and his cousin were among the buyers.</p><p>“We have spent a total of at least 500,000 rupees ($1,780) in the last one week on kites and strings,” he said exuberantly, clutching his prized purchases as passersby asked about their price.</p><p>Mohammad Amir Rafique Sheikh, spokesperson for the All Pakistan Kite Flying Association, said the decision to allow Basant had given local industries a much-needed lift. He predicted that total economic activity generated by the three-day festival would run into several billion Pakistani rupees, speaking between phone calls.</p><p>“Once it ends on February 8, only after that we will be able to put together a comprehensive analysis of the kind of money that was generated, but with [the hotel] business, catering business, public excitement to celebrate, all of that has contributed massively,” he added, praising the government’s decision to allow the return of the festival.</p><h2 id=\"ban-to-boom\">Ban to boom</h2><p>Basant has long been a shared legacy of subcontinental Punjab. After partition in 1947, it continued in Lahore, especially within Androon Lahore, the Walled City.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291541\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291541\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_093308438-1770344906.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"dancers in Mochi Gate\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">As buyers thronged the Mochi Gate market, musicians kept the crowd entertained by playing dhol drums and dancing [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>From the 1980s onward, the festival grew in popularity, reaching its peak in the mid to late 1990s. A one-day celebration at the time, it featured daytime and nighttime kite flying from rooftops and open grounds.</p><p>Prime rooftops overlooking the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore Fort and surrounding areas commanded hefty rents, running into hundreds of thousands of rupees.</p><p>This year, rents have soared further. Some prime rooftops are reportedly going for between 1.5 million ($5,300) and 2.5 million rupees ($8,900) for three days.</p><p>A senior official at a local bank in Lahore, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said his bank paid nearly three million rupees to secure a rooftop near Heera Mandi.</p><p>“The roof we have managed to acquire would be able to accommodate around 150 to 200 people or so, and it would oversee the Lahore Fort. We have arranged for food stalls, music performances and kite flying for our staff for three days,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Marriyum Aurangzeb, senior minister in the Punjab government and a close aide to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, told Al Jazeera that authorities spent nearly five months preparing to ensure Basant’s safe return.</p><p>Measures included enforcing a strict regulatory framework, including “revised Basant Act 2025 legislation, detailed transport and operational planning, and pre, during and post-festival arrangements”.</p><p>“Technology is at the centre of enforcement,” she said. Surveillance, she added, would be carried out through cameras, “thermal drones, and district administration monitoring systems.</p><p>“The city is draped in Basant themes, rooftops are booked and decorated, and the tallest kite ever stands proudly at the heart of the city. The atmosphere is magical, festive, and almost unreal, combining tradition, celebration and safety in a way never seen before,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"supply-meets-demand\">Supply meets demand</h2><p>Mochi Gate remains the epicentre of Basant-related activity. Business gathers pace after midday, when shops open, and continues until midnight.</p><p>Thousands stream through the congested lanes. Those fortunate enough to secure kites carry them carefully above their heads to avoid damage.</p><p>Among the crowd on Thursday were two young women — a rarity in the male-dominated bazaar — accompanied by their brother.</p><p>“We actually took a day off from our office to be able to come here and buy kites, but so far we are not happy with the quality of kites available, plus the prices are just exorbitant,” said Amina Farooq, 26, who works in a local factory.</p><p>Farooq said her father and uncles were avid kite flyers. Watching social media buzz and hearing friends talk about Basant made her want to take part.</p><p>“I don’t know how to fly a kite or anything about it, to be honest,” she confessed, adding, “but it is about being able to participate in the joyous festivities, that is what matters,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Complaints about quality and pricing were widespread. Buyers accused shopkeepers of exploiting high demand and selling substandard products.</p><p>With the government allowing only three specific kite sizes, the production cost should not exceed 100 to 150 rupees per kite — less than a dollar — depending on materials, said Ustad Javed Bhatti, a former kitemaker with nearly four decades in the trade.</p><p>“What we are seeing right now in the market is completely fraud, with shopkeepers charging margins which are 5 to 10 times more than the cost,” he said.</p><p>On February 1, a small kite sold for 120 rupees ($0.40). By February 4, the price had risen to 300 rupees ($1). The most popular medium-sized kite climbed from 200 ($0.7) to 600 rupees ($2). The largest size, initially priced between 400 ($1.4) and 500 rupees ($1.8), was selling for between 1,200 ($4.2) and 1,400 ($5) rupees when Al Jazeera visited Mochi Gate.</p><p>Ammad Ali, a wholesaler, said he ordered more than 600,000 kites in January, supplying 500,000 to retailers and keeping 100,000 for his own shop.</p><p>“We have sold out the medium and large-sized kite completely, while we still have around a few hundred left of the small-sized kites,” he said.</p><p>“Thank God, the business has been incredible,” he added with a smile.</p><p>But many prospective buyers remained frustrated. Some accused traders of hoarding and said the government had failed to regulate prices.</p><p>Ali Ahmad, a 19-year-old mobile repair technician, said he had visited the market for three days without buying anything.</p><p>Kite string isn’t available in the regular market any more, he said. “What is still available is being sold in black, and is very substandard quality,” he said.</p><p>He added that a set of two one-kilometre string rolls was selling for more than 14,000 rupees ($50), compared with a typical price of about 4,000 rupees ($14).</p><p>Sheikh, from the kite-flying association, blamed the shortage on what he described as the government’s “abundance of caution”, saying manufacturing was permitted only in January.</p><p>“We have been in the conversation with the government for months, but they decided that since it is returning after almost two decades, they allowed manufacturing only last month. Naturally, the producers in Lahore were unable to meet the demand,” he said.</p><p>Authorities said strict oversight was essential. They issued licences to 350 manufacturers in Lahore, along with 536 sellers and 127 trader groups.</p><p>The aim, officials said, was close monitoring of production and sales to prevent accidents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291545\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_105611757-1770344960.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Safety rods on Motorocyles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Punjab government has made it mandatory for motorcycles to install safety rods to avoid any injury due to kite strings [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Aurangzeb said the government ran extensive awareness campaigns. Traffic police installed more than 1.4 million safety rods on motorcycles to reduce the risk posed by kite strings. The idea: as a rider drives forward, a string sagging dangerously low hits the rod, instead of the driver.</p><p>“The aim is simple celebrate Basant safely, responsibly and within the law,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"future-of-basant\">Future of Basant</h2><p>As Lahore witnesses a cultural revival, hotels report occupancy rates nearing 95 percent, with remaining rooms priced at three to four times their usual rates.</p><p>Airfares have also surged. Return tickets from Karachi to Lahore, typically between 40,000 ($143) and 50,000 rupees ($178), climbed to more than 110,000 rupees ($392) in early February.</p><p>Amjad Parvez, a former Punjab University professor and veteran kite flyer who has written extensively on Basant’s history and kite design, praised the government for reviving the festival but urged it to preserve its essence.</p><p>“This festival was all about joy for everybody, regardless of their class or social status. Kite flying, in fact, was a great equaliser because of the skill that was required to be able to fly the kite well, and this should be the most important thing,” he said.</p><p>Abdul Mustaqeem, 30, who works in the transport sector, echoed the concern. He said the “gentrification and commodification” of Basant had dampened his enthusiasm.</p><p>“I have been a big kite flyer, but look at the way it is being promoted, as if this is meant for the elites of the society, and not us. They are now trying to rent our roofs and come to our side of town just because they want to be seen participating in Basant, which was our thing, but because of this, the prices have shot up,” he said.</p><p>Still, Mustaqeem acknowledged the government’s move as positive. If the festival passes without incident, he hopes it could pave the way for year-round kite flying.</p><p>“This was a sport, and it was affordable to us. But keeping it to only Basant will make it accessible to only the rich people, not us,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Before the tariffs, he had sales of roughly $5m and $8m to the US and Mexico, respectively. But those have since been halved.</p><p>“I have lost 50 percent of my business in Mexico and the US since the tariffs came into effect. It is a severe blow to my business as I was focusing on Mexico after the US tariffs, but the future looks bleak there also now,” he said.</p><p>US President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed</a> a 25 percent tariff on India in August and soon tacked on another 25 percent as punishment for its continuing purchase of Russian oil, which, he said, was helping to fund Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Now, within months of those punishing tariffs devastating businesses and jobs across industries in India, including diamond cutting, shrimp farming, and carpet manufacturing, businesses are dealing with equally high tariffs from Mexico, a double whammy, they say.</p><p>On January 1, Mexico implemented steep import tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent on more than 1,400 products from non-free trade nations, including India, Brazil, China, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p><p>Mexico has free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, and countries in the European Union, Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America.</p><p>The North American nation contends that the tariffs have been hiked to boost domestic production, address trade imbalances, and safeguard local employment.</p><p>However, Indian businesses have put it down to Mexico safeguarding itself from US wrath over trans-shipment and supply-chain diversion – issues that businesses from countries like China, which are dealing with high US tariffs, can undertake.</p><p>Such practices could be used by the US against Mexico in the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/13/trump-says-trade-agreement-with-mexico-canada-irrelevant-to-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming review</a> of the trade pact the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And this could push Mexico to align its tariff policy with US sensitivities.</p><p>The steep hike, however, has the Indian business community worried about its future, especially after years of investments in building those supply chains.</p><p>Chadha describes the Mexican tariffs as more disheartening than the ones slapped on by the US, which, Trump said this week, will be <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lowered to 18 percent</a> at some point, though it’s not clear when.</p><p>“The US tariffs were also imposed on our competitors,” said Chadha. “But Mexican tariffs are uneven as they have been implemented on only non-FTA nations, which has put us at a complete disadvantage with our competitors, who have an FTA with Mexico.”</p><p>To help alleviate some of the pain, the Indian government in its annual budget, presented on February 1, allowed the manufacturing units in special economic zones (SEZs) to sell a limited portion of their output to domestic buyers at concessional duty rates. Such sales typically attract the high tariff that is imposed on imports of these products, including textiles and leather goods.</p><p>The move is an attempt to address drop in demand that these exports-focused manufacturing units have been hit by on account of the punishing US tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"mexican-blow\">Mexican blow</h2><p>India exported goods worth $5.6bn to Mexico in 2024, the latest full year data available, led by vehicles and components and followed by electronic equipment. It imported goods worth $4.07bn in that period, with oil and mineral fuels being the lead imports.</p><p>India’s steel exports are facing the steepest hike of 50 percent, followed by auto and auto components that have been hit by 35 percent tariffs.</p><p>Even labour-intensive sectors like garments and ceramics will face tariffs from 25 percent to 35 percent. The plastic, aluminium and chemicals industries have been affected by tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent.</p><p>The decision has drawn severe criticism from affected countries and industry groups, while China has formally protested by raising concerns about higher consumer prices and supply-chain disruption.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>India has so far warned of “appropriate action for the unilateral” tariff hike by Mexico.</p><p>Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), told Al Jazeera that India is likely to focus on export diversification, treating the tariff hike as another sign of accelerating erosion of global trade rules rather than a dispute to be fought bilaterally.</p><p>The automobile sector, which has a strong market in Mexico, has been badly affected by the tariff hike.</p><p>Indian automobile companies exported passenger vehicles worth around $938.35m and motorcycles valued at $390.25m in the financial year ending March 31, 2025.</p><p>Even the auto components, which are predominantly used in vehicles meant for export to the US, have been slapped with tariffs of 35 percent, pointed out Vinnie Mehta, director-general of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA).</p><p>Last year, India exported auto components worth $835m to Mexico.</p><p>“Undoubtedly, the exports are clearly suffering due to the tariffs by the US, and the addition of Mexico has created a new challenge. The visible impact would be clear after the end of the second fiscal cycle in March,” Mehta told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The automobile industry, however, is shifting gears and pinning its hopes on a strong domestic demand driven by a recent reduction in India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 28 percent to 18 percent, a government move to soften the US tariff blow.</p><p>For now, various industry bodies have written to the government to sign a preferential trade agreement with Mexico to provide quick relief for the Indian business sector.</p><p>Ajay Sahai, director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), has, however, called the tariff hikes a push for the industry to increase domestic demand and look for diversification.</p><p>“The tariffs have proved that excessive dependence on single or two countries could be harmful,” he said, “and diversification is the only solution for survival and market expansion.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But a recent rise and spike in the price of <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/3/gold-and-silver-prices-soared-then-plummeted-whats-going-on\">gold and silver</a> has thrown many in the industry for a loop. By Wednesday, the gold price hovered at about $5,000 per troy ounce (31.1g), somewhere in between the recent high of $5,595 and the low of about $4,600.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We cannot predict anything,” Simon said. “It’s crazy.”</p><p>“Have you seen a 20 percent fluctuation in one day before?” Simon asked, turning to Aziz, incredulously. Aziz works in commodities, such as wheat and other perishable items.</p><p>“Only once,” Aziz replied sombrely. “Chornobyl.”</p><p>The disaster concerning a nuclear power plant in Ukraine shot wheat prices up in 1986. But unlike in that infamous incident, there is still no single widely understood and identifiable act or reason as to why gold and silver have gone through such a radical fluctuation in such a short period of time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"nobody-understands-this\">‘Nobody understands this’</h2><p>Since 2019, Lebanon has been in one of modern history’s worst economic and banking crises. But even before then, many Lebanese have looked to invest in precious metals, particularly gold, as a way to protect their money from inflation.</p><p>Whereas banks have lost the public’s trust, gold has widely been seen as a safe investment whose value has grown steadily. Precious metals have historically gained buyers during periods of geopolitical or economic uncertainty.</p><p>The last year has witnessed plenty of instability around the world, and particularly in the Middle East. Donald Trump’s return to power in the United States, his leveraging of tariffs, his pressure on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to take over Greenland, intervention in Venezuela, and threats of a war with Iran have all contributed to a volatile cocktail of instability.</p><p>When asked about the serious fluctuations, one Beiruti jeweller, who didn’t want to give his name, responded with a pithy statement. “Go ask Trump,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Nobody understands this,” said Khodr, who only wished to give his first name. Seated behind a table at a jewellery store in Beirut, gold rings were visible next to him in a glass case on a perpendicular table.</p><p>He said the effects of the sharp fluctuation<strong> </strong>in costs are still being understood, but admitted that there has been an impact on his business.</p><p>“Work has slowed down,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-no-logic\">‘There’s no logic’</h2><p>Analysts are split on the cause of the rapid change in valuation. Some speculate that more stable economic conditions and the dollar’s rise led investors to sell when the valuation was at a high.</p><p>Others disagree. They say the drop was a course correction and reflected that the commodity had become overvalued.</p><p>Going forward, however, some financial analysts said they expect gold to continue rising, with JP Morgan analysts saying it could increase in value by 30 percent before the end of 2026.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273149\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273149\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-28T135342Z_134723574_RC2CAJAZKM4M_RTRMADP_3_GLOBAL-PRECIOUS-GERMANY-GOLD-1769662398.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gold\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4273149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gold bars are stored in a safe deposit room in Munich, Germany, January 28, 2026 [Angelika Warmuth/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>But it may still take some time before buyers, or jewellers, feel comfortable buying gold again.</p><p>“It makes no sense,” Simon, the jeweller, said. “The price shouldn’t be this high. The cost of mining and turning it into bars did not change.</p><p>“There’s no logic,” Aziz added. “It’s all speculation.”</p><h2 id=\"affecting-business\">Affecting business</h2><p>Lebanon is currently debating a gap law that would, in theory, return to depositors some of the money they have been <a href=\"/opinions/2022/11/18/lebanon-bank-holdups-who-is-the-real-criminal\">prevented from accessing</a> by banks since 2019.</p><p>Since then, the country has had a severe liquidity crisis, and the currency has depreciated by more than 90 percent. Today, many rely on remittances from family working abroad. From 2020 to 2024, Lebanon averaged $6.38bn per year on remittances. That figure dropped to $5.8bn in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But many in Lebanon have long held a fragile trust in banks and the financial system, even before the crisis. For an older generation of Lebanese, 2019 was not the first time the currency spiralled in their lifetime. Many who had invested in the country lost money during the civil war when the Lebanese lira fell from about three to the US dollar to more than 1,000.</p><p>Gold has therefore been seen as a relatively safe investment for Lebanese.</p><p>Seeing the sharp spike in cost per ounce will have led some in the country to try to sell some of their gold. But jewellers like Simon are hesitant to buy at the moment.</p><p>“It’s definitely affecting business,” Simon said. “Yesterday, a customer wanted to sell me something with gold, but I couldn’t buy it. What if I bought it from him for a certain price, and the second day it costs 10 to 20 percent less?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It follows years of tightly managed polls, opposition boycotts and allegations of repression under Hasina that left many voters at home disillusioned and deepened frustration among Bangladeshis overseas who had long been excluded from the ballot.</p><p>Bangladesh’s politics has long been shaped by rivalry between the Awami League, led for years by Hasina, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), founded by former military ruler Ziaur Rahman and later led by his widow, Khaleda Zia. Under Hasina, Bangladesh saw rapid economic growth alongside deepening accusations of authoritarianism and repression.</p><p>The BNP, sidelined for much of the past decade, is seeking to reassert itself under the leadership of Khaleda Zia’s son, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/why-bnp-leader-tarique-rahmans-return-to-bangladesh-matters-ahead-of-vote\">Tarique Rahman</a>. Supporters portray Rahman, who spent 17 years in exile in London, as a symbol of resistance to one-party dominance; critics point to past convictions and accusations of corruption. The election will be the first since Khaleda Zia’s <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">death in December</a>, lending additional emotional and symbolic weight to the contest.</p><p>Meanwhile, the interim administration under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which took charge after Hasina’s ouster, has banned her Awami League from electoral politics.</p><p>Amid all of that flux, Bangladeshis living abroad have, for the first time, won the right to vote. “For years we’ve been campaigning for this moment,” Noor said. “People wanted recognition.”</p><p>But at neighbouring tables in the cafe, several people decline to speak, wary of sharing political views publicly. Noor, a former local councillor, said some Bangladeshi citizens in the UK who are technically eligible to vote but lack secure immigration status are among the most cautious.</p><p>“They’re watching the elections very closely,” he said, “but they don’t want to draw attention to themselves.”</p><p>For decades, overseas Bangladeshis, despite sending <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/top-news/remittance-inflow-hits-317bn-january-third-highest-record-1349646\">billions of dollars</a> home in remittances, had no formal say in national elections. Campaigners argued that excluding the diaspora was both undemocratic and politically expedient, particularly as many Bangladeshis abroad had left amid political <a href=\"/news/2024/1/5/bangladesh-elections-a-timeline-of-controversy\">violence or repression</a>.</p><p>Following sustained pressure, electoral authorities expanded overseas voter registration, allowing expatriates to participate remotely for the first time. According to Bangladeshi election authorities, more than seven million expatriates worldwide have registered since overseas voting was introduced — making them a substantial 5 percent of the total electorate of about 127 million.  Bangladesh’s election authorities estimate there are roughly 15 million Bangladeshis living abroad in all.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, however, just over 32,000 Bangladeshi citizens are registered to vote, a modest figure given the size of the wider community. According to the 2021 census, about <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/bulletins/ethnicgroupenglandandwales/census2021\">645,000 people</a> in England and Wales identify as Bangladeshi or British Bangladeshi, with the largest concentration in East London. In Tower Hamlets alone, Bangladeshis make up nearly 35 percent of residents, with significant communities also in Newham, and Barking and Dagenham.</p><p>The disparity highlights a central tension running through the diaspora: cultural identity does not always align with citizenship or eligibility. These demographics help explain why events in Bangladesh ripple so strongly through everyday life in East London, but they do not guarantee political engagement.</p><p>Some analysts point out that expatriate Bangladeshis could still be significant in close contests. Bangladesh’s election authorities estimate that in some constituencies overseas voters may represent nearly a fifth of registered voters, a share that <a href=\"/features/2025/10/28/bangladesh-expats-win-means-to-vote-could-they-sway-the-next-election\">could influence outcomes</a> in a first-past-the-post system.</p><p>In practice, however, eligibility to vote is limited to Bangladeshi citizens holding a national identity card (NID). Many British Bangladeshis, particularly those born in the UK,  identify strongly with Bangladesh but do not hold citizenship documents and are therefore excluded from the ballot.</p><p>Bangladeshis have lived in Britain for more than a century, but large-scale migration began only in the mid-20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s, economic hardship in what was then East Pakistan, combined with labour shortages in the UK, drew Bengali men, many from Sylhet, to London and Birmingham.</p><p>The 1971 Liberation War prompted another wave, as people fled political instability and sought work abroad. Family reunification followed, reshaping neighbourhoods like Tower Hamlets in the decades that followed.</p><p>These layered histories help explain why events in Bangladesh continue to ripple so strongly through everyday life here, but they do not guarantee political engagement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291751\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Casablanca-Cafe-interior-1770358169.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C580&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Casablanca Cafe in East London, a popular haunt among the Bangladeshi diaspora, where chatter about the upcoming election is hard to miss [Indlieb Farazi Saber/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Casablanca Cafe in East London, a popular haunt among the Bangladeshi diaspora, where chatter about the upcoming election is hard to miss [Indlieb Farazi Saber/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"between-paperwork-and-disengagement\">Between paperwork and disengagement</h2><p>Earlier in the day, in Whitechapel Road Market, two young women browse a rack of brightly coloured jalabiyas, pausing to check the stitching. Asked about the election, they shrug. They had heard older relatives talking about it, one said, but it felt distant.</p><p>“It doesn’t affect us, does it?” she asked. “We live here.” Politics in Britain, she added, felt more pressing, mentioning Labour’s struggles and the rise of Reform.</p><p>Noor explained that such apathy was common among younger British Bangladeshis. Years of disputed polls had left many hopeful but cautious, he said, while practical barriers had discouraged wider participation.</p><p>“To vote, you need a national identity card, biometrics, and then another digital process through a mobile app,” he said. “For many people, especially older voters, it’s simply too complicated.”</p><p>Patterns elsewhere underscore the contrast. <a href=\"https://www.ecs.gov.bd//?lang=en\">Election commission figures</a> show far higher participation in Gulf states, with more than 239,000 registered voters in Saudi Arabia and about 76,000 in Qatar.</p><p>Back at his office in Tower Hamlets, Noor said the difference reflected lived realities. Migrants in the Gulf are often single men with families back home and limited political or social rights in their host countries, keeping their ties to Bangladesh immediate and practical. In the UK and United States, by contrast, many Bangladeshis are settled with families, careers and children, their daily concerns anchored firmly where they live.</p><p>That divide, between older migrants invested in events back home and younger British Bangladeshis rooted firmly in the UK, runs through conversations across East London.</p><p>Several said they had registered to vote. Many arrived in Britain decades ago and still hold Bangladeshi passports. For them, the election carries the weight of memory: of the Liberation War, of years of military rule, of elections that once felt either dangerous or meaningless.</p><p>Above a convenience store on a side street close to the mosque, a narrow, worn staircase leads to the small office of Bangla Sanglap, a bilingual weekly newspaper. Its editor, Moshahid Ali, scrolls through messages from readers debating the election, correcting rumours and sharing registration information.</p><p>“People are excited about having the right to vote,” he said. “But it hasn’t been clear or straightforward.”</p><p>Many complained of limited outreach by authorities, he added. The process itself put others off: the need for an NID card, biometric registration at the High Commission with long waiting lines, followed by a further digital application through a mobile app, a series of bureaucratic thickets that sap enthusiasm.</p><p>Some learned about postal voting too late. One man said he rushed to apply for his NID card days before the deadline, only for it to arrive after registration closed.</p><p>Others said the technology itself proved daunting, particularly for older voters. “Everything is on apps now,” one older would-be voter said. “If something goes wrong, who do you ask?”</p><p>Mizanur Khan, 44, a community volunteer and hijama (cupping therapy) practitioner, said he wanted to vote but missed the registration deadline. He is now considering travelling to Bangladesh to vote in person.</p><p>“There wasn’t enough awareness,” he said. “But the main thing is free and fair elections. If they can even manage that, Bangladesh has a chance.”</p><p>The Bangladesh High Commission in London was contacted for comment, but did not respond.</p><p>Not everyone who could vote chose to. At an electrical goods stall in Whitechapel Market, as February rain began to fall, Radwan Ahmed, 23, a student in London, said he holds an NID card but decided to boycott the election. He described his decision as a protest against what he sees as a compromised political process, saying the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">ban on the Awami League</a> had undermined the vote’s legitimacy.</p><p>Across the borough, the mood remains unsettled.</p><p>A man in his forties said the election felt overdue. Bangladesh, he said, had been run by the same two parties, and the same families, for too long. He did not want his name in print, but his eyes lit up when he spoke of change. “If change doesn’t happen now, then when will it happen?” For the first time in Bangladesh’s electoral history, the Jamaat-e-Islami — the country’s largest religious party — is a serious contender to win the vote. It is in an alliance with the National Citizen Party (NCP), a group formed by leaders of the student-led uprising against Hasina.</p><p>Britain’s political significance is underscored by the presence of influential figures on both sides of Bangladesh’s political divide. Tarique Rahman’s long exile in London remains a sore point among some who were interviewed in East London. His UK presence did not necessarily translate into trust or recognition. Several people described him as distant from everyday community life, saying he rarely engaged beyond party circles.</p><p>“He’s just one man,” said one voter who declined to be named. “Part of the same system.” Another said Rahman’s long stay in the UK passed without meaningful contact with working-class Bangladeshis. “He met elites otherwise; he remained hidden,” he said. “There was no connection with people like us.”</p><p>Britain is also home to prominent figures linked to the Awami League. Among them is <a href=\"/news/2025/1/15/who-is-tulip-siddiq-and-why-has-she-resigned-as-uk-minister\">Tulip Siddiq</a>, a Labour MP and Hasina’s niece. Siddiq was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/bangladesh-court-sentences-ex-pm-hasina-uk-lawmaker-niece-in-graft-case\">recently sentenced</a> in absentia to two years’ imprisonment and a 100,000 Bangladeshi taka ($818) fine by a Bangladeshi court, a move criticised by UK-based lawyers and rights groups as politically motivated, a claim Bangladeshi authorities reject.</p><p>Several UK-based local politicians of Bangladeshi origin, including Tower Hamlets councillors Sabina Khan and Ohid Ahmed, are also standing in the Bangladesh elections, drawing criticism both in Britain and in Bangladesh over questions of accountability and dual political loyalties.</p><p>The issue is further complicated by Bangladesh’s approach to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/20/dual-citizenship-bangladeshs-latest-political-flashpoint-before-elections\">dual nationality</a>. While dual citizenship is permitted in practice, constitutional provisions restrict those who acquire foreign citizenship or pledge allegiance to another country from standing for parliament, a distinction that is often poorly understood.</p><p>Legal experts note that under UK law, for instance, a declaration of renunciation must be formally registered with the Home Office before it takes effect; until then, the applicant remains a British citizen.</p><p>“How much do they really know about politics back in Bangladesh if they’ve been living over here?” one woman asked.</p><p>For most of those Al Jazeera spoke to, however, daily concerns, jobs, family, security and life in Britain loomed far larger than the intricacies of elite politics in Bangladesh.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291756\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291756\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291756\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nargis-Akhtar-L-Romina-Khatun-R-1770358252.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C347&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Romina Khatun (R) with her daughter Nargis Akhtar.

Unlike her mother, Akhtar isn’t enthused about the elections [Indlieb Farazi Saber/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"mixed-sentiments\">Mixed sentiments</h2><p>Those priorities become clearer a few miles away, in another part of the borough.</p><p>On a quiet, tree-lined street minutes from the glass towers of Canary Wharf, the Isle of Dogs Bangladeshi Association and Cultural Centre sits almost hidden beside the local library. Once a stronghold of far-right politics, the area now reflects a different chapter in East London’s migrant history.</p><p>Inside, a small group has gathered for tea and butter biscuits. Conversation drifts between translating documents, navigating an increasingly digital world and plans for afternoon prayers.</p><p>Here, too, the election is on people’s minds.</p><p>Muhammad Saiful Miah, 44, who works in the emergency services, said he had not voted — because he doesn’t have an NID card. But he is following the election closely.</p><p>“The elections matter because that’s where my family comes from,” he said. “I’m British and Bangladeshi, so of course I care.”</p><p>Across the room, Jahanara Begum, 58, from Cumilla near Dhaka, speaking in Bangla through a translator, said she was “very happy” to have voted and had already sent her postal ballot.</p><p>“I waited years for this,” she says, hands wrapped around her teacup. “This is the first time in a long time it feels like it matters,” said Begum, who arrived in Britain just three years ago.</p><p>As a former primary school teacher and election monitor, she recalled travelling long distances, sometimes 30km by rickshaw, to count votes, often missing the chance to cast her own. The last time she voted, she said, was in 1991.</p><p>She spoke vividly of the 2008 general election when the Awami League came to power. She claimed the results recorded locally were later altered. “We saw BNP winning in many areas, but the figures announced were different.”</p><p>Now living in Britain, she still cares deeply about the outcome. “I have four children there,” she said. “It’s my country. I want peace. I want them to be safe.”</p><p>Her friend, Romina Khatun, 69, who has lived in the UK since 1985 and has also voted, nodded in agreement. For her too, the election represents a tentative hope after years of violence and uncertainty.</p><p>But Romina’s daughter, Nargis Akhtar, 45, who volunteers as the centre’s manager, remains unconvinced. Born in Sylhet but raised in London, she did not vote and does not have an NID card.</p><p>Akhtar grew up in a politically engaged household. She remembers hearing the names Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina and Hussain Muhammad Ershad — a military ruler who led Bangladesh for most of the 1980s — spoken with intensity. “I must have been seven or eight,” she said, laughing, recalling a political cartoon that once enraged her father. “I didn’t even know who Ershad was; I just knew it mattered to my parents.”</p><p>But, she said, she does not “have much faith that elections alone will change things”.</p><p>“There’s no proper welfare system, no employment rights [in Bangladesh],” Akhtar said. “People talk about creating jobs, but without protections, what difference does that make?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some 400 constituency seats will be elected by a first-past-the-post system, while 100 seats are to be allocated through proportional representation or on a party-list basis.</p><p>The newly elected lower house will then select the next prime minister. A candidate requires 251 votes to take office as prime minister.</p><p>Unlike in 2019 and 2023, the appointed Senate, which is dominated by conservative lawmakers, will have no role in choosing the new prime minister.</p><p>Voters will receive three ballot papers: two for the parliamentary election and one for a referendum on whether to rewrite the constitution.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-we-know-the-results\">When will we know the results?</h2><p>Polling stations will open at 8am (01:00 GMT) and close at 5pm (10:00 GMT). Vote counting will begin shortly after, and results will be announced as tallies are completed.</p><p>The leading party is likely to become clear by the early hours of Monday.</p><p>Turnout is expected to be high. During early voting in the capital Bangkok earlier this week, some 87 percent of registered advance voters turned out to cast their ballots.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-main-contenders\">Who are the main contenders?</h2><h3>Bhumjaithai</h3><p>Led by Anutin, Bhumjaithai rose to prominence in 2019 with its support for <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/2/as-thailand-does-u-turn-on-legal-cannabis-businesses-scramble-to-survive\">medical marijuana</a>. It has transformed from a mid-sized kingmaker – which won 51 seats in 2019 and 71 in 2023 – into a conservative force now vying to become one of parliament’s largest parties.</p><p>Bhumjaithai formed the current government with support from the People’s Party, after the country’s top court removed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the Pheu Thai, over her handling of Thailand’s border crisis with Cambodia.</p><p>Anutin initially promised constitutional reform and elections within four months, but the People’s Party in December accused him of reneging on their deal. Facing the risk of a no-confidence vote, he <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/thailand-pm-moves-to-dissolve-parliament-paving-way-for-election\">dissolved</a> the House and called the snap poll.</p><p>Bhumjaithai has now rebranded itself as a staunch defender of the monarchy and has been bolstered by defections, attracting 64 of the 91 lawmakers who have switched parties since 2023.</p><p>Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at think tank Thailand Future, said Bhumjaithai is seen as “pragmatic” and has now “claimed the conservative mantle” from political parties run by former generals.</p><h2 id=\"people-s-party\">People’s Party</h2><p>The People’s Party is the third iteration of a reformist movement whose previous incarnations – most recently <a href=\"/news/2023/5/13/move-forward-galvanises-thai-voters-with-vows-of-royal-reforms\">Move Forward</a> – were dissolved by the courts. The party campaigns on reducing the political power of unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.</p><p>While it was once outspoken in calling for changes to Thailand’s lese-majeste law – under which defaming or insulting the monarchy is a criminal offence – it has softened its stance since the court action.</p><p>Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of international relations at Chulalongkorn University, described the group as “strange and unprecedented” in Thai politics.</p><p>“It was the first party not driven by patronage or money politics, but by reform ideas and policies rather than personalities or provincial bosses,” he said.</p><h3>Pheu Thai</h3><p>Pheu Thai and its predecessors dominated Thai politics for much of the past 25 years through populist policies that secured working-class support as well as a formidable electoral machinery, particularly in the north and northeast.</p><p>Despite Thaksin’s imprisonment and the court’s removal of its prime ministers, the party has prevented mass defections and remains competitive. It is campaigning on Shinawatra nostalgia, with Thaksin’s nephew Yodchanan Wongsawat as its primary representative.</p><p>Napon of Thailand Future said he expected “a significant decline compared to the previous election”, with Pheu Thai potentially falling to third place. Still, he said the party may regain some seats from the progressive camp in its northern strongholds.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-polls-suggesting\">What are the polls suggesting?</h2><p>A January 30 survey by the National Institute of Development Administration put People’s Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut in first place for prime minister at 29.1 percent, followed by Anutin at 22.4 percent. Yodchanan trailed in fourth place.</p><p>For party lists, People’s Party led with 34.2 percent, followed by Bhumjaithai at 22.6 percent and Pheu Thai at 16.2 percent.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues\">What are the key issues?</h2><p>The People’s Party has proposed more than 200 policies, including abolishing military conscription, drafting a new democratic constitution, overhauling the bureaucracy and launching state-backed programmes to support small businesses.</p><p>Bhumjaithai has focused on economic stimulus and security, pledging to lift annual growth to 3 percent, expand welfare schemes, build border walls and make military service more attractive through paid volunteer posts.</p><p>Anutin has also promised to protect the monarchy, saying at a Bangkok rally that amending lese-majeste laws “will never happen and will never succeed because you have us”.</p><p>Pheu Thai has meanwhile centred its campaign on debt relief, as well as income support for low earners and subsidies for transport. It has also announced a “millionaire maker” programme that will award nine daily prizes of one million baht ($31,556) each.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-cambodia-factor-in\">How does Cambodia factor in?</h2><p>The clashes between Cambodia and Thailand erupted at their contested border in July and ended following <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-on-ceasefire-cambodia-defence-ministry-says\">a second ceasefire</a> in December.</p><p>The clashes have stoked nationalist fervour, strengthening Bhumjaithai’s appeal, according to Punchada Sirivunnabood, associate professor of social sciences and humanities at Mahidol University in Bangkok.</p><p>“They use this [nationalism] as a concept for support in these elections, and a lot of legislators from different political parties have moved to Bhumjaithai. This guarantees that they’re going to win a lot of seats from the district level,” she said.</p><p>On the other hand, the conflict has “hurt Pheu Thai a lot,” she said.</p><p>Paetongtarn of the Pheu Thai, who is also the daughter of its founder, Thaksin, was removed as prime minister in September over a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen, in which she was heard pandering to him and criticising a Thai commander.</p><p>Punched said questions over the Shinawatra family’s connections to Hun Sen have dogged Pheu Thai candidates on the campaign trail.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-constitutional-reform\">What about constitutional reform?</h2><p>Alongside the parliamentary election, voters will also be asked whether to replace the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule following a coup in 2014.</p><p>Even if approved, the process would be long and uncertain, according to analysts. It would require parliamentary action, Senate support to amend key clauses, and at least two further referendums.</p><p>While polls suggest overwhelming support for the “yes” vote, the referendum will not guarantee a new charter or a democratic one.</p><p>“It depends entirely on the post-election balance of power,” said Napon. “A more conservative parliament could still produce a conservative constitution.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-end-thailand-s-political-turmoil\">Will this end Thailand’s political turmoil?</h2><p>With no party expected to win an outright majority, coalition formation will be essential.</p><p>But any resulting government is “very likely to be unstable”, Napon said, noting that coalitions between any two of the big three parties would fall short of a majority if one partner withdrew.</p><p>Thitinan of the Chulalongkorn University said Thailand’s electoral history offered little encouragement.</p><p>Only once in 25 years have voting results been fully honoured, he noted. All other elections were overturned by military coups or judicial interventions.</p><p>“Establishment forces and biases are so entrenched and run so deep that the party of reform and progress would have to win a big, convincing margin of victory to have a chance at governing,” Thitinan said.</p><p>“Such a large enough margin looks like a slim chance, unless Thai voters are fed up enough to see through all the charade and shenanigans that have kept Thailand backwards and falling increasingly behind its peers,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Originally from Jabalia in northern Gaza, she now shelters in a classroom at a school in central Gaza’s Nuseirat.</p><p>Widowed in early 2023 and without children, she said displacement revives the trauma she inherited from her parents.</p><p>“History repeats itself now,” she said. “My parents lost all their money when they were forced to flee. We also used to have money, but now we are displaced and have lost everything.”</p><p>When Kefaya was a child, her family lived in tents in Gaza’s refugee camps, before they became more permanent structures in later decades. Now, she says that she is reliving that same fate.</p><p>“I don’t want to repeat history, I want to die in my own country,” she said. “Even here, being in Nuseirat, I feel like a stranger. I wish I could go back to Jabalia.”</p><p>Her home in Jabalia was destroyed during the war, meaning that, for now, she is staying in Nuseirat. But she is still adamant that it will not mean her departure from Gaza.</p><p>“I will not leave for medical treatment outside … I choose to die on my own land rather than be treated outside,” she said.</p><p>That’s despite her own medical issues – Kefaya suffers from high blood pressure, and has not been able to receive adequate medical care because of the war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hidden-crisis\">Hidden crisis</h2><p>The Rafah crossing partially opened on Monday after being largely closed by Israel since May 2024.</p><p>The opening of the crossing is part of the second phase of the Gaza “ceasefire”, even as Israel continues to violate the agreement by regularly attacking the Palestinian enclave, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/israel-suspends-evacuation-of-palestinians-via-rafah-crossing-red-crescent\">killing hundreds</a>.</p><p>Only a few dozen Palestinians have been allowed to leave so far, all patients needing treatments accompanied by family members.</p><p>Other Palestinians have also put their names on the list, some hoping to go abroad for education or simply to escape life in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 70,000 since the war began, and destroyed the majority of buildings, meaning reconstruction will likely be a years-long process, even if Israel cooperates.</p><p>“Israel is creating unlivable conditions in Gaza, denying Palestinians all essentials of life,” said Talal Abu Rukba, a political science professor at al-Azhar University in Gaza. “When people resist and stay in their homeland, they ruin the Israeli project of creating an Israeli state on a land ‘without a people'”.</p><p>Members of the Israeli right-wing, including members of the government, have repeatedly called for illegal settlements to be established in Gaza, and for Palestinians to be forced out.</p><p>The desire to stay in Gaza on the part of elderly Palestinians is despite a largely overlooked humanitarian crisis facing the demographic.</p><p>Research by Amnesty International and HelpAge International found that Israel’s blockade of aid and medicines to Gaza had contributed to a “physical and mental health crisis”.</p><p>“During armed conflict, older people’s needs are often overlooked. In Gaza, older people are enduring an unprecedented physical and mental health collapse as a direct result of Israel’s deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director of research, advocacy, policy and campaigns, said after the publication of the report.</p><p>The two organisations found that 76 percent of the elderly people interviewed live in tents, with 84 percent saying that their living conditions harmed their health and privacy.

They mark the latest chapter in US-Iran relations during Trump’s second term, which initially saw the president seek a new agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme, before those talks were derailed by Israel’s 12-day war and the subsequent US strikes.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Recent months have seen <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/game-is-over-irans-ex-leaders-hardliners-clash-after-protest-killings\">deadly</a> anti-government protests spread across Iran as Trump repeatedly threatened more US military intervention and tightened crippling sanctions.</p><p>The US president has since <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-prepares-for-war-as-us-military-armada-approaches\">surged</a> a multibillion-dollar “armada” of US military assets off the coast of Iran, following a playbook that preceded both the previous strikes on Iran as well as the US <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trumps-abduction-of-maduro-escalates-concerns-over-potential-war-with-iran\">abduction</a> of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on January 3.</p><p>“I think that the US thinks that Iran is weakened, so this is the opportune time for going in with maximalist demands to get the most concessions that they can get,” Sina Azodi, the director of Middle East Studies at George Washington University in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Those demands include not only staunching Iran’s nuclear programme, but seeking limits on its ballistic missile programme and ending support for so-called regional “proxies”. Reports have indicated the expanded agenda pushed by the Trump administration repeatedly threatened to derail the talks, which are set to include Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said the US was “ready for talks”.</p><p>“In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include the range of their ballistic missiles, their sponsorship of terror organisations, and the treatment of their own people,” Rubio told reporters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, again threatened Iran in an NBC News interview on Wednesday, saying Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei should be “very worried”. However, he also recently appeared to present more narrow objectives for the talks.</p><p>Last week, Trump told reporters he wanted “two things” from Iran: “Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.”</p><p>On Thursday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt again renewed the threat.</p><p>“While these negotiations are taking place, ‌I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many ‌options at his disposal, aside ‌from diplomacy, ⁠as the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the ‌history of the world,” she told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-us-strategy\">What is the US strategy?</h2><p>Throughout Trump’s second term, his administration has pursued a mercurial foreign policy strategy, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/can-trumps-madman-theory-reshape-iran-and-the-middle-east\">described</a> by some analysts as a “madman theory” and others as mad-dash. That unpredictability has hung over Friday’s talks.</p><p>The administration struck Iran on June 22 after five rounds of talks in Oman, during which Witkoff held an in-person meeting with Araghchi. The attacks came after a two-month deadline imposed by Trump for Iran to halt nuclear enrichment passed, even as more talks were scheduled.</p><p>Tehran has for decades insisted its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes and had previously agreed to curtail enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which Trump withdrew in 2018.</p><p>“It’s unclear whether [US goals] are going to be limited to the nuclear issue, as the president says, or much more comprehensive demand for full capitulation, as Secretary Rubio suggests,” Ali Vaez, the Iran Project director at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If past is prelude, the US is going to walk into these talks without a negotiating strategy…and it would be a set of moving goalposts depending on what the Iranians are willing to put on the table,” he said.</p><p>In one scenario, Vaez said, Trump could use the talks to find an “off-ramp” to his current military posturing and threats to intervene in support of protesters in Iran. Demonstrations have since been stifled by the Iranian authorities, he noted, and any military escalation could spark not just a regional security crisis, but a global economic crisis felt in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump continues to be surrounded by several officials, including Rubio, likely to <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/trumps-cabinet-is-less-hawkish-will-that-affect-his-israel-iran-response\">push back</a> against anything seen as a concession at a time when the administration sees Iran’s strength as being diminished.</p><p>“I think any deal that will benefit the Islamic Republic could be perceived in Washington as saving a regime that is on the ropes,” Vaez said.  “That is unattractive.”</p><p>If the administration does hold onto its hard line – particularly on its ballistic missile – it is likely to find little cooperation, despite Iran’s desire to avoid further military action, George Washington University’s Azodi explained.</p><p>While Tehran may be open to codifying some range limits on its ballistic missile programme, further restrictions, including a stockpile reduction, would likely be a non-starter, he said.</p><p>“The strongest deterrent, and the only deterrent that Iran has right now is its missile programme,” he said. “Once that one is taken care of, Iran will be vulnerable to future Israeli attacks. Basically, it will lose its sovereignty.”</p><p>“That is the brightest red line.”</p><h2 id=\"regional-influence\">Regional influence</h2><p>Friday’s meeting comes amid calls for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">diplomatic de-escalation</a> from Gulf countries, which have repeatedly warned of the regional impact of a renewed conflict.</p><p>There are currently eight permanent US military bases located across Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. Following the US strike on Iran last year, Iran attacked Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, a major non-NATO US ally.</p><p>Khamenei has warned Washington that any attack on his country would result in a “regional war”. Earlier this week, the US military shot down an Iranian drone in the Persian Gulf and subsequently claimed Iranian boats “threatened” a US-flagged merchant ship in the Strait of Hormuz, further raising the prospect of military entanglement.</p><p>Meanwhile, US envoy Witkoff met earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pressed for military action against Iran while subverting diplomatic efforts. Netanyahu warned Witkoff to remain sceptical of any Iranian commitments, Reuters news agency reported.</p><p>Khalil Jahshan, the executive director of the Arab Center Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the US posture going into the talks shows a “synchronisation of positions” with the Israeli government, which has long viewed Iran’s ballistic programme as one of its most <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">significant</a> regional targets.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Jahshan said the talks may be “superficial argumentation” on the part of the US “to diffuse the objections from Arab allies”, but he did not see them as likely to divert another US or Israeli attack. In turn, he saw little hope of Iran acquiescing.</p><p>“There is no doubt [Iran] is exhausted because of the sanctions. It’s exhausted because of the domestic unrest,” he said.</p><p>“It’s exhausted because of several regional setbacks and would like to avert a US-Israeli attack on Iran. But at the same time, I don’t think it is necessarily responsive to these spurts of chaotic semi-diplomatic threats.”</p><p>Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, also acknowledged there is a camp inside of Iran that “believes the negotiations are a ruse and that the Trump administration’s ultimate goal is military attacks and regime change”.</p><p>Still, she assessed that both sides were entering the talks seeking de-escalation, even if dangerous gaps in their positions remained.</p><p>“A senior Iranian official told me they’re going into negotiations with seriousness, but also with a finger on the trigger,” Mortazavi told Al Jazeera. “They want to give diplomacy a chance, but they want to be clear-eyed about the threats of attacks.”</p><p>“It’s a dichotomy that’s very dangerous, because when the two sides are facing off, locked and loaded with very credible and serious threats, things can get out of hand, even by mistake,” Mortazavi added.</p><p>Crisis Group’s Vaez, meanwhile, said that the US may be overestimating its position, noting that despite being battered in recent months, Iran’s leaders continue to believe in their own resilience.</p><p>“The Iranian regime has been weakened significantly, but it is not weak,” Vaez said. “Those two things are not the same.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
