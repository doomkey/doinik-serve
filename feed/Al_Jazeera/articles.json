            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On October 14, the Swedish government announced it was nominating the CEO of IKEA, Jesper Brodin, as its candidate for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Less than a month later, as the current high commissioner, Filippo Grandi, approached the end of his mandate, Brodin resigned from his position at the Swedish furniture giant, which he had led for eight years. In January 2026, the office of the UN secretary-general is expected to present a preferred candidate to the General Assembly for what former UNHCR head of research Jeff Crisp has called a “pro forma election”. Can the former chief of an iconic multinational company become the world’s highest authority on refugees — and what will it mean if he does?</p><p>In interviews, Jesper Brodin often refers to a small pamphlet by IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, titled The Testament of a Furniture Dealer, as outlining the values that inspire his way of doing business: innovation, sustainability and collective effort over individualism. Does the UNHCR need to learn lessons from a “furniture dealer”? The question matters because Brodin’s appeal is often framed in terms of corporate values, yet it remains unclear how — or whether — these translate into the protection of refugees. Whether Brodin has any chance of making it to the Geneva post or not, the question is worth asking, for the role of IKEA as a donor and operational partner of the UNHCR is significant and is likely to grow.</p><p>While humanitarianism and business have historically been companions, particularly since the end of the Cold War, this is the first time a business leader has been proposed to head the UN refugee agency. The nomination comes at a time when the UNHCR faces a dramatic cash crunch, and when political pressures and anti-refugee sentiment are increasing globally. Many scholars and practitioners believe the future of the global refugee regime itself may be at stake. Understanding the implications of Sweden’s choice, then, requires examining how corporate humanitarianism now shapes refugee protection.</p><p>Many were taken aback by the nomination. Yet the move by Sweden is anything but surprising. Over the past three decades, corporations have taken on increased responsibility for responding to humanitarian crises, while traditional organisations compete for a rapidly diminishing pool of resources. Research on the <a href=\"https://www.commodifyingcompassion.com/publications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodification of compassion</a> has shown how, increasingly, “doing good” and “doing well” have become one and the same. This kind of “brand aid” involved both promoting commercial brands (from Toms shoes to Starbucks) through their involvement in humanitarian causes, and turning aid itself into a branded activity — something most effectively done through corporate partnerships. It began around two decades ago but has now become the dominant model of humanitarian engagement. As one major humanitarian donor in Kinshasa told us, “It’s now all about collaborations between the private sector, businesses and philanthropists.” Indeed, when the desire to help becomes something you can sell, corporations such as IKEA can profit from involvement in global helping that builds their ethical branding. But can the UNHCR profit from being led by IKEA’s CEO? The question goes to the heart of a growing unease about the direction of the refugee regime.</p><p>We see three main problems here. First, UNHCR is caught between contradictory demands from donor states in the Global North and hosting states in the South. Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism cannot reconcile these fundamental tensions over sovereignty. Jesper Brodin has been lauded as a businessman and touts his credibility as a leader and negotiator. “Trump likes people in the business world,” we are told. However, the challenges to the agency’s protection mandate require a vision that goes well beyond the smiling face of compassionate capitalism. While formally remaining the guardian of the 1951 Refugee Convention, UNHCR has been operating in what scholars such as Bhupinder Chimni have described as an “erosion” of the international refugee regime — a long-term weakening of asylum norms and burden-sharing commitments. Donor governments in the Global North have used their limited support for UNHCR’s humanitarian activities in the Global South as a way to deflect attention from the disregard for refugee rights within their own borders. How will Brodin fare in navigating these competing pressures — from containment agendas in the Global North to protection obligations that lie at the heart of UNHCR’s mandate?</p><p>Second, Brodin often mentions his experience as a supply chain manager in a company that has put logistical innovation at the core of its business strategy as an important asset for the job. Indeed, this aligns with UNHCR’s current focus on renewing its own supply chain strategy. He also talks about “bringing the values and the assets of refugees to the business community,” a phrase he uses to refer to refugees’ skills and labour potential. However, this endeavour has proved far more complex than he makes it sound. Almost 10 years after IKEA’s first attempt to integrate refugees into its own supply chains in Jordan, the number of people the programme involves remains small, and refugees in the country still face significant barriers to work and social security.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100036X\">A study we published in 2021</a> highlighted that a focus on refugee logistics actually meant working towards integrating displaced people into global supply chains rather than providing them with material support or infrastructure. Whether for business or for disaster relief, logistics depend on networks of infrastructure and rules that only function through ongoing negotiation with governments.</p><p>Finally, the contradictions of IKEA’s corporate and foundation ownership structure — what makes it work well as a business — embody the paradox of mixing public needs for refugee protection with private objectives for profit. The IKEA Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, has been working with UNHCR since 2010, supporting its operations in 16 countries. The UN agency defines the collaboration as “transformative”, highlighting how it has become a model for all its partnerships with the private sector. Moreover, the nomination comes at a time when major donor states, including the US, the United Kingdom and Germany, are slashing their budgets. In this geopolitical context, Sweden, while facing its own economic challenges, may well be seeking to stake its position as one of the last remaining humanitarian powers in the Western world. Brodin’s bid draws on Sweden’s perceived reputation for frugality and sustainability.</p><p>However, there is an unspoken yet fundamental contradiction between Brodin’s promise to address UNHCR’s crisis by “holding the purse strings” and the position of IKEA within global economic structures that have contributed to the humanitarian funding crisis in the first place. In 2017, following calls from EU parliamentary groups, the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the Netherlands — where the company is headquartered — for its tax treatment of Inter IKEA, one of the two groups operating the IKEA business. The company’s ownership structure, which benefits its commercial operations, may also reduce its tax burden, thereby reducing contributions to public finances. Here, as in many other cases, big business promises to fix global inequality it has helped create.</p><p>In the present global climate of hostility to migrants and refugees, Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism risks further hollowing out UNHCR’s protection mandate, reducing humanitarianism to a matter of well-managed supply chains. The stakes are high: when humanitarian priorities are shaped by corporate logic, core protections — from asylum access to basic assistance — risk being eroded. What benefits a business organisation does not necessarily serve the rights or needs of refugees.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It is unusual in international waters”.</p><p>“Russia has hundreds of sanctioned tankers sailing today, but they have not been boarded,” he pointed out.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">Experts say it is unclear whether the seizure was legal, partly because many details about it have not been made public.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">“In legal terms, there are really two layers here: what the United States can justify to its own courts, and what is defensible under the law of the sea,” Salvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">“Domestically, Washington has constructed a broad basis for seizing tankers linked to sanctions evasion … On that level, it is very likely that this operation will be treated as ‘legal’ in US law,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">The legality is far less certain under international law, however, Santino Regilme added.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">The US may argue that the boat was stateless. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), <a href=\"https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm#article110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ships are required to have “a nationality”</a>.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">The government of Guyana, Venezuela’s neighbour, said the Skipper was “falsely flying the Guyana flag”, adding that it is not registered in the country.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">If a vessel flies a flag it is not registered under, or refuses to show any flag at all, states have the “right of visit”, allowing their officials to stop and inspect the ship on the high seas – essentially meaning international waters.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">If doubts about a ship’s nationality remain after checking its documents, a more extensive search can follow.</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">“Statelessness clearly opens the door to boarding and identification, but it does not automatically create a general licence to enforce any unilateral regulatory regime,” said Santino Regilme. “That step from ‘right of visit’ to full seizure of ship and cargo sits in a grey zone that recent scholarship explicitly describes as a ‘jurisdictional lacuna’ [a gap in the law] rather than a settled rule.”</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">“If the tanker was indeed fraudulently flying a Guyanese flag, the US has a stronger argument that it could lawfully board to verify nationality. Whether it could then lawfully seize the vessel and its cargo to enforce purely US sanctions against foreign actors is much more contestable in orthodox law-of-the-sea terms,” Santino Regilme added.</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">In previous enforcement actions against sanctioned ships, the US has seized not the ship itself but the oil on board. In 2020, it confiscated fuel from four tankers allegedly carrying Iranian oil to Venezuela.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"1975\" data-end=\"2289\">US law also allows the Coast Guard, which carried out this operation, to conduct searches and seizures on the high seas in order to enforce US laws, <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title14/pdf/USCODE-2024-title14-subtitleI-chap5-subchapII-sec522.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stating that</a> it “may make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests upon the high seas” to prevent violations.</p><p data-start=\"1975\" data-end=\"2289\">But as Santino Regilme explained, what US law permits and what international law recognises are two different areas. “Analytically, this is why reasonable experts can disagree,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">“Legal categories such as ‘stateless vessel’, ‘narco-trafficker’, or ‘terrorist-linked shipping network’ are often used as political technologies that normalise coercive measures aimed at reshaping another country’s political economy around US strategic interests,” Santo Regilme said.</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">“From that perspective, this operation looks less like the straightforward application of a clear legal rule, and more like another move in a broader sanctions and interdiction strategy whose legality under international law remains highly contested, especially among states in the Global South.”</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">If the US continues such actions, it could raise the cost of doing business with Venezuela, said Francisco Rodriguez, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).</p><p data-start=\"2948\" data-end=\"3091\">“It could significantly increase the cost of doing business with Venezuela and precipitate a deepening of the country’s economic recession,” he warned <a href=\"https://cepr.net/publications/americas-live-updates/#dec10242pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a CEPR article</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-has-venezuela-responded-to-the-seizure\">How has Venezuela responded to the seizure?</h2><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"408\">Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry stated that “the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed”.</p><p data-start=\"410\" data-end=\"654\">“It is not migration, it is not drug trafficking, it is not

seizure could produce short-term uncertainty for Venezuelan oil exports, largely because “this has been the first time [the United States has]… seized a shipment of Venezuelan oil”, Carlos Eduardo Pina, a Venezuelan political scientist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"80\" data-end=\"543\">That may make shippers hesitate, though the broader impact is limited, Pina said, since “the US allows the Chevron company to continue extracting Venezuelan oil”, and US group Chevron holds a special waiver permitting it to produce and export crude despite wider sanctions.</p><p data-start=\"406\" data-end=\"536\">Chevron, which operates joint ventures with PDVSA, said its operations in Venezuela remain normal and continue without disruption.</p><p data-start=\"538\" data-end=\"727\">The US oil major, which is currently responsible for all Venezuelan crude exports to the US, increased shipments last month to 150,000 barrels per day (bopd), up from 128,000 bpd in October.</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">Inside Venezuela, Pina warned the move could spark financial panic, however: “It could instil fear, trigger a currency run… and worsen the humanitarian

Machado was awarded the Nobel Prize” – and calling it “a gesture of strength… to remind that [the US is present in the Latin American region].”</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">Maduro has long argued that the Trump administration’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific are not, in fact, aimed at preventing drug running, but are part of a plan to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/is-trump-pushing-for-regime-change-in-venezuela-where-else-is-he-meddling\">effect regime change in Venezuela</a>. Trump has authorised CIA operations in Venezuela and has given conflicting messages about whether he would consider a land invasion.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">Analysts see this latest action as part of a broader strategy to pressure the Maduro government.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">“This is certainly an escalation designed to put additional pressure on the Maduro regime, causing it to fracture internally or convincing Maduro to leave,” said Cancian.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">“It is part of a series of US actions such as sending the Ford to the Caribbean, authorising the CIA to move against the Maduro regime, and conducting flybys with bombers and, recently, F-18s.”</p><p data-start=\"1620\" data-end=\"1936\">Cancian added that the broader meaning of the operation depends on what comes next.</p><p data-start=\"1620\" data-end=\"1936\">“The purpose also depends on whether the US seizes additional tankers,” he said. “In that case, this looks like a blockade of Venezuela. Because Venezuela depends so heavily on oil revenue, it could not withstand such a blockade for long.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "time": "2025-12-11T13:29:31",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_693ac6cbe4288-1765459659.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"177\" data-end=\"973\">On September 2, United States President Donald Trump released grainy footage of a missile obliterating a fishing boat off Venezuela’s coast. Eleven people died instantly. The administration called them narcoterrorists. Venezuelan sources identified them as fishermen. Since then, the US military has conducted at least 22 strikes, killing 87 people, with investigations revealing that the first attack included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to wreckage — a potential war crime under international law. On Wednesday, the US went on to seize an oil tanker in Venezuelan waters, an escalation the Venezuelan government described as “blatant theft” and an “act of international piracy,” underscoring Washington’s shift towards economic coercion alongside military force.</p><p data-start=\"975\" data-end=\"1225\">The Trump administration frames all this as “counter-narcotics”. Critics call it regime change. But the most dangerous dimension of this crisis has nothing to do with Venezuela at all. It is about the consolidation of executive power at home.</p><h2 id=\"the-oil-narrative-does-not-add-up\">The oil narrative does not add up</h2><p data-start=\"493\" data-end=\"1253\">If this were about oil, nothing about the current approach makes sense. The US produces more oil than any country in history, exporting millions of barrels daily. Neither America nor Europe faces an oil shortage that would require military intervention. Venezuela, meanwhile, sits atop the world’s largest proven reserves — 303 billion barrels — but its oil infrastructure is severely deteriorated. Production has collapsed from 3.2 million barrels per day in 2000 to roughly 900,000 today. The country’s pipelines have not been updated in 50 years, and restoring peak production capacity would require an estimated $58bn in investment, underscoring how far the sector is from posing any strategic threat that might justify military force.</p><p data-start=\"1255\" data-end=\"1948\">More tellingly, legal pathways to Venezuelan oil already exist. The US could lift sanctions, expand Chevron’s operations, or reopen the energy corridor — measures that require neither warships nor circumventing Congress. In fact, Chevron’s operations in Venezuela represent 25 percent of the country’s total production, demonstrating that commercial access is entirely possible within existing frameworks. This contradiction exposes how little the current strategy has to do with securing resources. Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the complexity, describing sanctions policy as a balancing act between displacing China and providing foreign currency to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"1950\" data-end=\"2356\">The fundamental shift in Washington’s Venezuela calculus has less to do with oil companies and more to do with private equity firms and defence contractors — interests focused not on barrels but on reconstruction contracts, mineral rights and territorial leverage in a post-Maduro scenario. Together, these dynamics make clear that the logic driving US policy lies outside the economics of oil itself.</p><h2><span>What emergency powers actually enable</span></h2><p data-start=\"255\" data-end=\"800\">The Venezuela narrative serves a different function: it provides the pretext for expanded executive authority through emergency declarations. Since 2015, the US has maintained a continuous “national emergency with respect to Venezuela” under the National Emergencies Act. This declaration unlocks access to more than 120 specific statutory powers, including asset seizures, commerce regulation and military deployment — authorities that bypass normal congressional authorisation and operate with minimal legislative oversight.</p><p data-start=\"802\" data-end=\"1455\">Trump has systematically layered additional emergency measures. In March, he designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organisation, expanded the legal definition of Venezuela’s government to encompass virtually any affiliated entity — from ministries to state-owned firms — and imposed 25 percent tariffs on countries importing Venezuelan oil. In August, he signed a secret directive authorising military force against Latin American drug cartels — a decision taken without coastguard involvement and relying solely on Navy assets, breaking with decades of maritime interdiction precedent and further consolidating executive discretion.</p><p data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"2070\">Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth framed the scope clearly when he declared that alleged drug operations “will not be controlled by cartels” and promised to “map your networks, track your people, hunt you down and kill you” — language more consistent with warfare than law enforcement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio went further, stating that the Maduro regime is “not a legitimate government” but rather “a transshipment organisation” that facilitates drug trafficking — a characterisation that redefines diplomatic relations as a criminal enterprise and justifies treating state actors as targets.</p><h2 id=\"congress-abdicates-oversight\">Congress abdicates oversight</h2><p data-start=\"1828\" data-end=\"2422\">What makes this deployment unprecedented is not its size — though assembling carrier strike groups, B-52 bombers, F-35 fighters, submarines and more than 15,000 personnel represents the most significant US military presence in Latin America since the Cold War — but the absence of congressional authorisation. Lawmakers from both parties have complained they were not provided with legal justification, target lists or evidence about those killed. The Senate has twice rejected resolutions to limit Trump’s military authority on Venezuela, leaving executive power in effect, unchecked.</p><p data-start=\"2424\" data-end=\"2925\">Senator Lindsey Graham made the administration’s objective explicit, telling CBS that regime change is the goal and Trump “has all the authority in the world” to conduct strikes. Legal experts broadly characterise the maritime attacks as illegal under both US and international law. Yet classified briefings to congressional leadership — including recent sessions in which Hegseth refused to commit to releasing unedited strike footage — have produced no meaningful constraint on executive action.</p><p data-start=\"2927\" data-end=\"3291\">The pattern emerging is one of expanding presidential discretion: once invoked, emergency powers become self-perpetuating tools that normalise unilateral military action. Rather than being used for targeted interdiction, they are increasingly employed to engineer confrontation and accelerate regime change — all without a congressional declaration of war.</p><h2 id=\"the-real-cost\">The real cost</h2><p data-start=\"306\" data-end=\"681\">The most insidious aspect of this crisis is that it manufactures a threat precisely calibrated to validate expanded executive power. Oil does not provide that pretext — a foreign emergency large enough to activate military force — and label as terrorism does. This permits the exercise of authority without Congress, without oversight and, increasingly, without resistance.</p><p data-start=\"683\" data-end=\"1099\">Venezuela becomes useful not for its resources but for its role as a political prop in a constitutional drama. While Trump has openly threatened land strikes and stated that the airspace above Venezuela should be considered closed, the administration is quietly drafting day-after plans for what happens if Maduro is ousted — planning that proceeds regardless of congressional authorisation or international law.</p><p data-start=\"1101\" data-end=\"1494\">The Venezuelan people, already suffering under economic collapse and political repression, now face the prospect of becoming collateral damage in someone else’s power consolidation project. More than seven million Venezuelans have fled abroad, and those who remain endure the escalating danger of a manufactured crisis designed not to liberate them but to serve distant political calculations.</p><p data-start=\"1496\" data-end=\"1962\">This is not an oil grab. It is a power grab — one that uses Venezuela as a pawn while setting precedents that will outlast any single administration. The question is not whether Maduro’s regime deserves international condemnation; it does. The question is whether democracies should abandon their own constitutional principles to achieve regime change abroad. On the current trajectory, the answer appears to be yes — and that is the most dangerous precedent of all.</p><p data-start=\"1496\" data-end=\"1962\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukraine has also carried out regular attacks in Russian territory.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Following Wednesday’s call, the US president said the group discussed proposals in “pretty strong terms”, adding that Zelenskyy “has to be realistic” about ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Zelenskyy has said in recent days that Ukraine will not give up territory. The nation’s constitution also forbids it.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Merz described it as a “crucial moment” for Ukraine, saying “intensive work on the peace plan is to continue in the coming days”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">After meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte on Thursday, the German chancellor dismissed reports of tensions during the call with Trump, characterising it as “constructive” and noting discussions about “what territorial concessions Ukraine is prepared to make”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Merz said territorial questions were matters “the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian people must answer”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The negotiations have exposed sharp divisions over how much land Ukraine should surrender. Russia has already seized control of all of Luhansk province and occupies large portions of Donetsk, the two regions make up the Donbas, as well as Zaporizhia and Kherson, forming a stretch along Ukraine’s Black Sea coast.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">According to the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based monitoring group, Russia has gained just 0.77 percent of Ukraine’s territory so far in 2025, suggesting front lines have largely stabilised despite recent Russian momentum.</p><p>Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Russia has relayed “additional proposals” to the US regarding collective security guarantees, though he offered no details on what the Kremlin had suggested.</p><h2 id=\"war-rages-in-ukraine-s-east\">War rages in Ukraine’s east</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The diplomatic push comes as Russian forces mount intense pressure on the strategic eastern city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk, where Moscow has amassed approximately 156,000 soldiers.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Ukraine <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/ukraine-reports-large-russian-mechanised-assault-in-battle-for-pokrovsk\">reported</a> an unusually large mechanised assault on Wednesday involving a 30-vehicle convoy attempting to breach the city’s defences, the largest such attack inside Pokrovsk to date, which Russian forces have been trying to seize for months.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Capturing the former logistics hub would represent Russia’s most significant territorial gain in nearly two years, adding urgency to Kyiv’s efforts to improve the terms of a peace proposal many view as tilted towards Moscow.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Russia has paid heavily for its Pokrovsk offensive, losing more than 1,000 armoured vehicles and over 500 tanks in the area since October 2023, according to Ukraine’s army.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Meanwhile, Ukraine demonstrated its strike capabilities overnight with one of the war’s largest drone attacks, forcing Moscow’s four airports to halt flights for seven hours.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Russia’s Ministry of Defence said air defences intercepted 287 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Trump’s peace drive has created tensions with the US Congress, which passed a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/despite-opposition-us-house-passes-record-901bn-defence-spending-bill\">sweeping defence bill</a> this week that bolsters European security and restricts the president’s authority to reduce troop levels or withdraw equipment from the continent.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The bipartisan legislation sets aside $400m in security assistance for Ukraine and prevents US forces in Europe from dropping below 76,000 personnel.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Ukrainian officials have sent a revised version of the peace plan to Washington.

The US recently pressured Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to buy more weapons from it.</p><p>We take a closer look at the US-Pakistan F-16 upgrade deal and why this is significant now.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-us-agreed-with-pakistan\">What has the US agreed with Pakistan?</h2><p>Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the latest approval is part of a 2022 maintenance deal the US agreed in 2022 to sustain Pakistan’s fleet of F-16s.</p><p>“The F-16 deal remains a key part of the broader US-Pakistan bilateral relationship, which is why there has been continuity from President Biden to President Trump, despite some delays. Both sides emphasise the fleet’s utility in joint counterterrorism operations in the region.”</p><p>The latest US deal is for the sale of technology, which will support and upgrade Pakistan’s existing F-16 fleet. It was confirmed in a report sent to the US Congress by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on December 4.</p><p>Pakistan is believed to have 70 to 80 working F-16s. Some of these are older, but upgraded, Block 15 models, some are former Jordanian F-16s, and some are newer Block 52+ models.</p><p>The US offering comprises hardware and software updates for enhanced flight operations and aircraft electronic systems; the Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, which allows pilots to identify friendly aircraft from enemy ones; navigation upgrades; spare parts and repairs.</p><p>Alongside $649m-worth of support and upgrades for the F-16s, the US sale also includes major defence equipment (MDE), which are items of significant military equipment on the US munitions list, worth $37m. This includes 92 Link-16 systems.</p><p>The Link-16 is a secure military tactical data link network which allows real-time communication between military aircraft, ships and ground forces. It allows communication through text messages and images.</p><p>Six Mk-82 inert 500-pound (226.8kg) general-purpose bomb bodies are another type of MDE authorised to be sold to Pakistan. These are empty metal casings of an Mk-82 bomb, which are used for training or testing.</p><p>Instead of an explosive such as tritonal – a mixture of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and aluminium powder used in munitions – the casing is filled with a heavy material such as concrete or sand. The Mk-82 is an unguided bomb developed by the US. It can also be used as a warhead for precision-guided munitions.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-f-16-fighters\">What are F-16 fighters?</h2><p>The F-16, also called the F-16 Fighting Falcon or the Viper, is a single-engine aircraft used for air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack by the US and its allies.</p><p>The jets are currently manufactured by US defence and aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin, which took over production in 1995. It was originally developed by General Dynamics, a US industrial and technology company.</p><p>The jet was developed towards the end of the war in Vietnam, during which the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) overwhelmed heavier and slower US fighter planes. It <a href=\"/news/2024/6/18/ukraine-new-f16-fighter-jets\">first flew</a> in 1974.</p><p>The F-16 is now one of the world’s most widely used fighters. F-16s are operating in 29 countries, according to the Lockheed Martin website.</p><p>Besides Pakistan, some other countries which have F-16s are Ukraine, Turkiye, Israel, Egypt, Poland, Greece, Taiwan, Chile, Singapore, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167178\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167178\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167178\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20240316__34LM2ER__v4__HighRes__PakistanPoliticsDefence-1765447088.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"F-16\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">F-16s perform aerobatic manoeuvres during a rehearsal for Pakistan Day parade, March 16, 2024 [Aamir Qureshi/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-role-did-f-16s-play-in-the-may-conflict-between-india-and-pakistan\">What role did F-16s play in the May conflict between India and Pakistan?</h2><p>On April 22, armed attackers <a href=\"/news/2025/4/23/act-of-war-what-happened-in-kashmir-attack-that-killed-26-tourists\">killed 26 people in Pahalgam</a>, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a separatist group designated a terrorist organisation by India and the US, and which New Delhi alleges is linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) – a claim Islamabad denies.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Following the Pahalgam attack, New Delhi scaled back diplomatic ties with Islamabad and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, which ensures the appropriate sharing of the Indus River water between India and Pakistan.</p><p>On May 7, India <a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/why-did-india-strike-pakistan-all-we-know-about-operation-sindoor\">struck nine sites in Pakistan</a> and Pakistan-administered Kashmir with missiles, which Islamabad said killed dozens of civilians. Over the following three days, the countries engaged in a heated aerial war, using drones and missiles to target each other’s military bases.</p><p>During the aerial war, Pakistan deployed 42 “hi-tech aircraft”, including the F-16s, and Chinese-made JF-17s and J-10s, according to Pakistan’s Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed.</p><p>A ceasefire – for which US President Donald Trump took credit – was eventually brokered on May 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-applying-pressure-to-india\">Is the US applying pressure to India?</h2><p>Yes, for a couple of reasons.</p><p>The US approval for Pakistan’s F-16 upgrade comes as the Trump administration presses India to buy more weapons from it.</p><p>In August, New Delhi put its plans to buy US weapons and aircraft on hold, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting three unnamed Indian officials familiar with the matter.</p><p>This came just weeks before Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had been scheduled to visit Washington to announce some weapon purchases. That visit was cancelled.</p><p>India-US relations have also been tense in recent months.</p><p>On August 6, Trump imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on imports from India as a punishment for <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/how-india-plans-to-continue-buying-russian-oil-despite-sanctions\">buying cheap Russian crude oil</a>. This was on top of the existing 25 percent tariff already levied on Indian goods, bringing the total levy on Indian imports to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/trump-imposes-25-percent-tariff-on-indian-goods-over-russian-oil\">50 percent</a>.</p><p>Trump announced the tariff in an executive order, in which he wrote that Russia’s continued military actions in Ukraine constituted a “national emergency” and it was therefore “necessary and appropriate” to place heightened tariffs on India, a top consumer of its crude oil.</p><p>“I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.”</p><p>While pressure from the US has resulted in India slightly scaling back purchases of Russian oil, New Delhi plans to continue to buy from Moscow. It remains the second-largest consumer of Russian oil after China.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin met Prime Minister Modi for the annual Russia-India <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/uninterrupted-oil-shipments-key-takeaways-from-putin-modi-talks-in-delhi\">bilateral summit</a> in New Delhi last week, during which he said: “Russia is ready for uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.”</p><p>The announcement of the latest US deal to provide maintenance and upgrades for Pakistan’s F-16s is likely to be poorly received by India.</p><p>Donthi said New Delhi has previously opposed the defence cooperation between Pakistan and the US under which the two countries collaborate to maintain Pakistan’s F-16 fleet. India has claimed the F-16s are used against it.</p><p>“Washington pre-empted it this time by stating that the sale ‘will not alter the basic military balance in the region’,” Donthi said.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-does-the-us-sale-strengthen-pakistan\">How much does the US sale strengthen Pakistan?</h2><p>Donthi said that while the latest package from the US will help Pakistan maintain its fleet until 2040, it is China which has supplied more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s weapons since 2020.</p><p>This statistic is also backed by Swedish think tank SIPRI in a report this year.</p><p>“Pakistan used Chinese J-10 aircraft in the May conflict with India. Islamabad continues to balance between Washington and Beijing, benefiting from both,” Donthi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
