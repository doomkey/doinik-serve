Venezuela, Cuba’s closest ally in the region, provided the country with the much-needed fuel.</p><p>So, how dire is the situation in Cuba?

We are not going to collapse.”</p><p>The government says it will prioritise available fuel for essential services – public health, food production and defence – and push the installation of solar-based renewable energy sector and incentives therein. It will prioritise shifting energy to selected food production regions and accelerate the use of renewable energy sources, while cutting down on culture and sport activities and diverting resources towards the country’s early warning systems.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296737\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296737\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-29T170435Z_1177184829_RC25BJAOAZ3Y_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1770541300.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba oil\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on as President Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, January 29, 2026 [Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-has-the-us-blocked-oil-to-cuba\">Why has the US blocked oil to Cuba?</h2><p>Decades of strict US economic sanctions against Cuba, the largest island nation in the Caribbean, have destroyed its economy and isolated it from international trade. Cuba relied on foreign allies for oil shipments, such as Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela.</p><p>However, after the US forces abducted Venezuelan President Maduro, Washington blocked any Venezuelan oil from going to Cuba. Trump now says the Cuban government is ready to fall.</p><p>Under Trump, Washington has pivoted to the Western Hemisphere, which it wants to dominate. The military actions in Venezuela, the pledge to take over Greenland and changing the government in Cuba are part of the new policy.</p><p>Last month, Trump signed an executive order – labelling Cuba a threat to national security – imposing tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to the island nation. Further pressure on the Mexican government reportedly led to oil stocks reaching a record low in Cuba.</p><p>“It looks like it’s something that’s just not going to be able to survive,” Trump told reporters last month, when questioned about the Cuban economy. “It is a failed nation.”</p><p>Havana has rejected accusations that it poses a threat to US security. Last week, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling for dialogue.</p><p>“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence. Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law,” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/cuba-denies-security-threat-accusations-as-us-raises-pressure\">a statement from the ministry said</a> on February 2.</p><p>Trump’s goals in Cuba remain unclear; however, US officials have noted on multiple occasions that they would like to see the government change.</p><p>Responding to a question during a US Senate hearing on Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We would like to see the regime there change. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to make a change, but we would love to see a change.”</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, is one of the most powerful figures in Trump’s administration.</p><p>“The Cuban-American lobby, which Rubio represents, is one of the most powerful foreign policy lobbies in the United States today,” Ed Augustin, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera’s <em>The Take</em>.</p><p>“In the new Trump administration, [with] an unprecedented number of Cuban Americans, the lobbyists have become the policymakers,” he said, adding that Rubio has built firm control over the lobby.</p><p>On January 31, Trump told reporters, “It doesn’t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal. So Cuba would be free again.”</p><p>He said Washington would make a deal with Cuba, but offered no clarity on what that means.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-28T185841Z_1827449538_RC2FKHAQKB6K_RTRMADP_3_STORM-MELISSA-CUBA-1770541565.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"castro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman walks past a building with an image of former President Fidel Castro as people prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Melissa in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, October 27, 2025 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"history-of-us-cuba-relations\">History of US-Cuba relations</h2><p>Since Fidel Castro overthrew the pro-US regime in the Cuban revolution in 1959, the country has been under US embargo. Decades of sanctions have denied Cuba access to global markets, making even supply medicines difficult.</p><p>Castro nationalised US-owned properties, mainly the oil sector, and Washington responded with trade restrictions that soon became a full economic embargo that continues to this day, undermining Cuba’s economy.</p><p>The US also cut diplomatic ties with Havana, and three years later, a missile crisis almost brought Washington and the erstwhile USSR, an ally of Cuba, to the brink of nuclear war.</p><p>In 2014, Washington and Havana restored ties after 50 years. Two years later, US President Barack Obama travelled to Havana to meet Raul Castro.</p><p>However, during his first term as president, Trump reversed the historic move in 2017. Since then, the US has reimposed a raft of sanctions against Cuba, especially economic restrictions, leading to one of the worst economic crises in the island nation’s history. Within hours of his inauguration in January 2025, Trump reversed the previous administration’s policy of engagement with Havana.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296746\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296746\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296746\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-06T230555Z_1592351741_RC2GGJALUGP6_RTRMADP_3_CUBA-FUEL-1770541357.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People wait for transport at a bus stop as Cubans brace for fuel scarcity measures, Havana, Cuba, February 6, 2026 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-long-can-cuba-sustain\">How long can Cuba sustain?</h2><p>Until last month, Mexico reportedly remained Cuba’s major oil supplier, sending nearly 44 percent of total oil imports, followed by Venezuela at 33 percent, while nearly 10 percent was sourced from Russia and a smaller amount from Algeria.</p><p>According to Kpler, a data company, by January 30, Cuba was left with oil enough to last only 15 to 20 days at current levels of demand.</p><p>Cuba currently needs an estimated 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296772\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296772\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296772\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260206__96FF9TZ__v1__MidRes__CubaTransportFeature-1770541652.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man rides a bicycle in Havana, Cuba, on February 6, 2026 [Yamil Lage/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-has-the-un-said-about-the-cuban-crisis\">What has the UN said about the Cuban crisis?</h2><p>United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday that “the secretary-general is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet”.</p><p>Dujarric said, for more than three decades, the UN General Assembly has consistently called for an end to the embargo imposed by the US on Cuba, adding that the UN urges “all parties to pursue dialogue and respect for international law”.</p><p>Francisco Pichon, the senior-most UN official in Cuba, described “a combination of emotions” in the country – “a mix of resilience, but also grief, sorrow and indignation, and some concern about the regional developments”.</p><p>The UN team in Havana says the vast majority of Cubans are hit by rolling blackouts, with the number of people in vulnerable situations increasing significantly.</p><p>“The last two years have been quite tough,” Pichon said, adding that urgent changes are needed to sustain Cuba “in the midst of the severe economic, financial and trade sanctions”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is a logical approach, and Hamas — through mediators Qatar, Turkiye and Egypt, and through indirect dialogues with the Americans via the mediators — has reached, or there has been, an understanding of Hamas’s vision on that.

The events have strained ties between the two regional powers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The cabinet announcement has triggered mixed reactions and a war of words with some seeing a glimmer of hope and a step towards establishing government authority while others view it as a redistribution of power and wealth among the country’s rival elites.</p><p>The 35-member cabinet, which has 10 more members compared with the previous cabinet, has representations from diverse professional backgrounds, including administration, economics, law and academia.</p><p>Yaseen Al-Tamimi, a Yemeni political researcher, said the large size of the government represents a forced return to the era of what she called an “appeasement” policy, which attempts to placate different groups and regions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4243579\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4243579\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696997f8-1768527864.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yemeni Foreign Minister Shaya Mohsin Zindani attends a news conference.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani says the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens [File: Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Although such a large number of ministries places a heavy burden on the budget, the current phase in the country necessitates this type of appeasement, Al-Tamimi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The different political groups in the country need to feel that they have been given a share of power to push them to act in line with the government’s agenda, according to Al-Tamimi.</p><p>“I see this formation of the new cabinet as satisfactory. It reflected the amount of effort that was made over the past weeks to appear with this composition of competent people with a certain amount of political and national responsibility.”</p><p>In a statement on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani said the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens, combating corruption and developing institutional performance to contribute to ending Houthi control of large parts of the country, restoring state institutions and consolidating stability.</p><p>The PLC took control of southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia last month while northern Yemen, where most of the population is located, is under the control of the Iran-backed Houthi group.</p><p>The Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and toppled the UN-recognised government in February 2015. The PLC governs from the southern port of Aden.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-needed-for-the-new-cabinet-to-succeed\">What is needed for the new cabinet to succeed</h2><p>Mohammed Al-Samei, a Taiz-based political journalist, expressed hope after the new ministers were appointed. He described them as competent and deserving of their posts and said their success will depend on how united they are.</p><p>“The success of this government remains contingent on the existence of a firm political will from the prime minister, the Presidential Leadership Council and the various political forces. The new cabinet will not achieve true success unless these parties unite to serve the nation, away from side conflicts,” Al-Samei told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Beyond the cabinet’s domestic political will, Al-Samei indicated that continued Saudi financial support will be indispensable.</p><p>“Today, the new government faces serious challenges, including providing services and improving the livelihoods of citizens. Overcoming these challenges will be possible with the support of Yemen’s political process sponsors, particularly Saudi Arabia,” Al-Samei added.</p><p>A day before the announcement of the new cabinet, Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani noted that Saudi Arabia had expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in Yemen’s south, including the salaries of soldiers.</p><p>Al-Eryani said the move aims to restructure the military forces, make them subordinate to the state and receive their instructions from the supreme commander of the armed forces, Rashad Al-Alimi, who is the chairman of the PLC.</p><p>Vice Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman, who is in Doha to attend the Al Jazeera Forum, also pointed to the role Saudi Arabia is playing in providing financial help to the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The Saudi government has taken the responsibility for one year. This is not going to be enough unless we have regular functioning of infrastructure operations and security,” Noman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said the biggest challenge the government is going to face in the coming days is to restructure the security forces, which he added needed to be brought under the Ministries of Interior and Defence.</p><p>Without stability, the government cannot work smoothly, Noman said, adding that only after security is established can infrastructure and services work and government functions resume.</p><p>The diplomat said the government has to be resolute to do its job or it will face a great failure, which would create a vacuum. “And the vacuum will be filled by AQ [al-Qaeda] and ISIS [ISIL] and other nonstate actors operating in Yemen.”</p><p>The new government has to also address the mounting humanitarian challenges facing Yemen, where about 18 million Yemenis – about half the population – face acute food shortages while tens of thousands are facing famine-like conditions.</p><h2 id=\"women-s-representation\">Women’s representation</h2><p>Unlike the previous cabinets, the new cabinet includes three women, sparking positive reactions from activists and civil society members.</p><p>Afrah Al-Zuba has been named the minister of planning and international cooperation. Ishraq Al-Maqatri is the new minister of legal affairs, and Ahed Jaasous has been appointed minister of state for women’s affairs.</p><p>“Today is a significant political moment. The newly formed cabinet includes women in key and influential positions,” Najiba Al-Naggar, a Yemeni community and human rights activist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not a minor detail. It is a political indicator and a clear message about the direction of this phase. It signifies recognition of women’s competence and indicates that the state has begun to treat women’s participation as a constitutional right, not as temporary appeasement.”</p><p>Fatima Saleh, a university graduate in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that the war has marginalised women’s political role.</p><p>“I have not heard a woman minister for years. The announcement of three women ministers in this new cabinet is a proud moment for girls and women in Yemen,” Saleh said.</p><p>She acknowledged that she and millions of women in northern Yemen are unlikely to get a direct benefit, but the move is an indicator that the leadership of the UN-recognised government does not “underestimate women as other radical groups” do in Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-public-divide-in-the-south\">The public divide in the south</h2><p>In southern Yemen, where the public remains sharply divided over Saudi Arabia’s role, sentiments about the new cabinet have been mixed. Southern separatists, led by STC, have been seeking sovereignty for the south.</p><p>Ahmed Maher, a journalist from Aden, said it is too early to judge the government, indicating its performance will determine its credibility.</p><p>“The formation of the government is a new beginning, not the end,” he said. “Those who work for Yemen and its citizens will remain while those who persist in their racism and mistakes will depart.”</p><p>On Saturday, the Hadramout Tribal Confederation and the Inclusive Hadramout Conference – two tribal blocs in Hadramout governorate, which PLC forces retook from the STC in early January – expressed in a statement their disapproval of the formation of the new government, saying the cabinet formation mechanism has “failed to bring about any fundamental change to the existing reality, given the absence of a just and comprehensive political solution that addresses all pending issues”.</p><p>The two tribal groups reaffirm “their unwavering commitment to the Hadramout self-governance vision as the strategic option that establishes lasting stability and sustainable peace”.</p><p>This statement was issued after southern separatists protested on Friday in Seyoun, a city in Hadramout, calling for independence and pledging to continue their struggle against Yemen’s UN-recognised government and Saudi intervention in southern Yemen.</p><p>In December, southern separatists backed by the UAE took over the Hadramout and al-Mahra governorates, reaching the Saudi border. The kingdom considered such a move a threat to its national security. Saudi-backed fighters have ‌since largely retaken those areas.</p><p>Abdulkareem Nasser, a southern separatist in Seyoun, said the new cabinet does not represent the southern people, who have their own flag, vision and identity.</p><p>“We [southern separatists] will continue our struggle and will not accept the agenda of this government and its sponsor [Saudi Arabia],” he said.</p><p>“Our demand is clear: an independent state. We cannot abandon an independent state for water and electricity services. No government can persuade or force us to give up on our aspirations,” Nasser said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reviving-unity\">Reviving unity</h2><p>Although the members of the new cabinet belong to different regions and political groups, Al-Samei maintained that healing Yemen’s damaged unity remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>“The war has eroded the country’s unity. The status quo separation between the south and the north has been ongoing for years, and the southerners are not fully united. It is a massive mission for the new government to tackle these challenges,” Al-Samei said.</p><p>“If the new government is capable of stabilising the south and pushing into the north to recapture it from the Houthis, that could mean Yemen’s unity will be revived.”</p><p>Houthis have not recognised the authority of the PLC, saying they are the legitimate government in the country. In the Houthis’ eyes, the Saudi-backed government officials are “mercenaries”.</p><p>Abdullah Ali, a Houthi fighter in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that it is the people who grant the leaders legitimacy, not the UN or Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“Our leaders live among their people, lead from inside and bear all the hardships, so their leadership is legitimate. Any government imposed on the people by foreign players is illegitimate, and fighting it is a duty,” Ali said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_698832c3ac-1770533571.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"680\">Global markets rarely reveal their vulnerabilities quietly. They do so when shipping lanes come under threat, energy prices surge, or supply chains fracture. Few regions illustrate this reality more starkly than the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are now among the world’s most contested maritime corridors. What unfolds along these waters no longer remains local. It shapes economic security across the Arab world and far beyond.</p><p data-start=\"682\" data-end=\"793\">Yet, amid growing attention to this strategic corridor, one factor remains persistently underestimated: Somalia.</p><p data-start=\"795\" data-end=\"1287\">For decades, Somalia was viewed primarily through the lens of conflict and fragility. That narrative no longer reflects today’s reality. The country is undergoing a consequential transition, moving away from prolonged instability, rebuilding state institutions, and re-emerging as a sovereign actor with growing regional relevance. Situated at the intersection of the Arab world, Africa, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden, Somalia is not peripheral to regional stability; it is central to it.</p><p>Geography alone explains much of this significance. With the longest coastline in mainland Africa, Somalia lies adjacent to the Bab al-Mandeb passage connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian Ocean. A substantial share of global maritime trade and energy shipments passes through this corridor. Disruptions along Somalia’s coast, therefore, have immediate implications for shipping reliability, energy markets, and food security — issues of direct concern to Gulf states and Arab economies.</p><p data-start=\"1800\" data-end=\"2188\">For the Arab world, Somalia should be understood not as distant terrain but as a front-line partner in regional security. Stability along Somalia’s coastline helps contain threats before they reach the Arabian Peninsula, whether in the form of violent extremism, illicit trafficking networks, piracy, or the entrenchment of hostile external military presences along Africa’s eastern flank.</p><p data-start=\"2190\" data-end=\"2814\">Somalia is not attempting to build stability from scratch. Despite persistent challenges, tangible progress has been made. Federal governance structures are functioning. National security forces are undergoing professionalisation. Public financial management has improved. Diplomatically, Somalia has reasserted itself within the Arab League, the African Union, and multilateral forums. These gains continue to be built on daily and reflect a clear commitment to sovereign statehood, territorial unity, and partnership rather than dependency. Somalia today seeks strategic alignment grounded in mutual interest, not charity.</p><p data-start=\"2816\" data-end=\"3174\">Somalia’s relevance also extends beyond security. Its membership in the East African Community integrates the country into one of the world’s fastest-growing population and consumer regions. East Africa’s rapid demographic expansion, urbanisation, and economic integration position Somalia as a natural bridge between Gulf capital and African growth markets.</p><p data-start=\"3176\" data-end=\"3570\">There is a clear opportunity for Somalia to emerge as a logistics and transshipment gateway linking the Gulf, the Red Sea, East Africa and the Indian Ocean. With targeted investments in ports, transport corridors, and maritime security, Somalia can become a critical node in regional supply chains supporting trade diversification, food security, and economic resilience across the Arab world.</p><p data-start=\"3572\" data-end=\"4083\">At the heart of Somalia’s potential is its dynamic population. More than 70 percent of Somalis are aged below 30. This generation is increasingly urban, digitally connected, and entrepreneurial. Somali traders and business networks already operate across Southern and Eastern Africa, spanning logistics, finance, retail, and services. A large and dynamic diaspora across the Gulf, Europe, North America, and Africa further amplifies this reach through remittances, investment, and transnational expertise.</p><p data-start=\"4085\" data-end=\"4297\">None of these momentums, however, can be sustained without security. A capable, nationally legitimate Somali security sector is the foundation for durable stability, investment confidence, and regional integration.</p><p data-start=\"4299\" data-end=\"4925\">For Gulf states and the wider Arab world, supporting Somalia’s security sector is therefore not an act of altruism. It is a strategic investment in a reliable stabilising partner. Effective Somali security institutions contribute directly to safeguarding Red Sea and Gulf of Aden maritime corridors, countering transnational terrorism before it reaches Arab shores, protecting emerging logistics infrastructure, and denying external actors opportunities to exploit governance vacuums. Such support must prioritise institution-building, Somali ownership, and long-term sustainability, not short-term fixes or proxy competition.</p><p data-start=\"4927\" data-end=\"5180\">The stakes are rising. The Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are entering a period of heightened strategic contestation. Fragmentation along their African coastline poses a direct risk to Arab collective security. Recent developments underscore this urgency.</p><p data-start=\"5182\" data-end=\"5517\">Israel’s unilateral recognition of the northern Somali region of Somaliland, pursued outside international legal frameworks and without Somali consent, is widely viewed as an attempt to secure a military foothold along these strategic waters, risking the introduction of the Arab-Israeli conflict into the Gulf’s security environment.</p><p data-start=\"5519\" data-end=\"5939\">Even more troubling are emerging narratives advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, with proposals to relocate them to Somaliland against their will. Such ideas, whether formally advanced or not, represent grave violations of international law and human dignity. Exporting the consequences of occupation and war onto African soil would not resolve conflict; it would multiply it.</p><p data-start=\"5941\" data-end=\"6320\">For the Arab world, this should serve as a wake-up call. Allowing external actors to fragment sovereign states or instrumentalise fragile regions for unresolved conflicts carries long-term consequences. Somalia’s unity and stability, therefore, align squarely with core Arab strategic interests and with longstanding Arab positions on sovereignty, justice and self-determination.</p><p data-start=\"6322\" data-end=\"6620\">Somalia is ready to be part of the solution. With calibrated strategic support, particularly in security sector development and logistics infrastructure, Somalia can emerge as a cornerstone of Red Sea and Gulf of Aden stability, a gateway to East Africa, and a long-term partner for the Arab world.</p><p data-start=\"6622\" data-end=\"6814\">The question is no longer whether Somalia matters in the regional and global Red Sea and Gulf of Aden discussions and plans. It is whether the region will act on that reality before others do.</p><p data-start=\"6622\" data-end=\"6814\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"267\" data-end=\"440\">The first round of Iran-US talks in Muscat produced no breakthrough. The next few weeks will determine whether they laid foundations or merely bought time before escalation.</p><p data-start=\"442\" data-end=\"945\">When Iranian and American negotiators concluded several hours of talks in Muscat on February 6, publicly, neither side signalled any shift from its opening position. Iran insisted the discussions focus exclusively on the nuclear file. The United States arrived seeking a comprehensive framework that would also cover ballistic missiles, regional armed groups, and more broadly, issues Washington has raised publicly, including human rights concerns. Neither prevailed. Both agreed to meet again.</p><p data-start=\"947\" data-end=\"1003\">On the surface, this looks like a non-event. It was not.</p><p data-start=\"1005\" data-end=\"1440\">The Muscat round was the first high-level diplomatic engagement between the two countries since the joint US-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, an escalation that Iran later said killed more than 1,000 people and involved strikes on three nuclear sites. That the two sides returned to the same palace near Muscat’s airport where previous rounds were held in 2025, and agreed to return again is significant.</p><p data-start=\"1442\" data-end=\"1559\">But continuation is not progress. The distance between what happened in Muscat and what a deal requires remains vast.</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy-conducted-under-military-escort\">Diplomacy conducted under military escort</h2><p data-start=\"1608\" data-end=\"1932\">The most striking feature of the Muscat round was not what was said, but who sat in the room. The American delegation was led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. It also included, for the first time, Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, in full dress uniform.</p><p data-start=\"1934\" data-end=\"2196\">His presence at the negotiating table was not incidental. It was a signal. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was operating in the Arabian Sea as the talks unfolded, and days earlier, US forces had shot down an Iranian drone that approached the carrier.</p><p data-start=\"2198\" data-end=\"2550\">An Iranian diplomatic source told the Reuters news agency that Cooper’s presence “endangered” the talks. Another, quoted by Al-Araby TV, warned that “negotiations taking place under threat” could impose strategic costs rather than advance them. For Tehran, the message was unmistakable: This was diplomacy conducted in the shadow of force, not as an alternative to it.</p><p data-start=\"2552\" data-end=\"2846\">Washington, for its part, sees this as leverage. President Trump, speaking on board Air Force One after the talks, described them as “very good” and said Iran wants a deal “very badly”, adding: “They know the consequences if they don’t. They don’t make a deal; the consequences are very steep.”</p><p data-start=\"2848\" data-end=\"2996\">This is diplomacy framed as an ultimatum. It may create urgency. It is unlikely to create trust, and trust is what this process most desperately needs.</p><h2 id=\"the-structural-problem\">The structural problem</h2><p data-start=\"3026\" data-end=\"3427\">The US withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, despite international verification that Iran was meeting its obligations. That decision shattered Iranian confidence in the durability of US commitments. Tehran’s subsequent incremental breaches of the agreement, steadily increasing enrichment levels from 2019 onwards, weakened its credibility, in turn.</p><p data-start=\"3429\" data-end=\"3879\">This mutual distrust is not a negotiating obstacle that can be resolved with creative diplomacy alone. It is the defining condition under which any agreement must be built. The US has the capacity to impose enormous economic and military costs on Iran. But power does not automatically produce compliance. For commitments to hold, Iran must believe concessions will bring relief rather than new demands. That belief has been badly damaged.</p><p data-start=\"3881\" data-end=\"4391\">Consider the sequence of events surrounding the Muscat round itself. Hours after the talks concluded, the US State Department announced new sanctions targeting 14 shadow fleet vessels involved in transporting Iranian petroleum, alongside penalties on 15 entities and two individuals. The Treasury Department framed the action as part of the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Whether preplanned or timed for effect, the message was clear: Washington intends to negotiate and squeeze simultaneously.</p><p data-start=\"4393\" data-end=\"4747\">For Tehran, which has consistently demanded that sanctions relief be the starting point for progress, this sequencing confirms precisely the pattern it fears. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi identified this dynamic explicitly, telling Iranian state television that “the mistrust that has developed is a serious challenge facing the negotiations.”</p><h2 id=\"what-actually-happened-in-muscat\">What actually happened in Muscat</h2><p data-start=\"4787\" data-end=\"5156\">Beneath the competing narratives, the outlines of the substantive discussion have begun to emerge. Iran reportedly rejected a US demand for “zero enrichment”, a maximalist position it was never going to accept in a first meeting. The two sides instead discussed the dilution of Iran’s existing uranium stockpile, a more technical and potentially more productive avenue.</p><p data-start=\"5158\" data-end=\"5587\">Meanwhile, Al Jazeera reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkiye and Qatar had separately offered Iran a framework proposal: Halt enrichment for three years, transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country, and pledge not to initiate the use of ballistic missiles. Russia had reportedly signalled willingness to receive the uranium. Tehran has signalled both the enrichment halt and uranium transfer would be nonstarters.</p><p data-start=\"5589\" data-end=\"6075\">Perhaps the most important development was the least visible. According to Axios, Witkoff and Kushner met directly with Araghchi during the talks, breaking from the strictly indirect format that Iran had demanded for most of last year’s rounds of negotiations. Iran had previously insisted on communicating with the US only through Omani intermediaries. Crossing that barrier, even partially, suggests both sides recognise the limits of indirect talks once bargaining becomes technical.</p><p data-start=\"6077\" data-end=\"6311\">Oman’s framing was arguably the most honest assessment of the day. Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi described the talks as aimed at establishing “appropriate conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations”.</p><h2 id=\"what-the-next-few-weeks-will-decide\">What the next few weeks will decide</h2><p data-start=\"6354\" data-end=\"6712\">Trump said a second round of talks would take place soon. Both sides indicated to Axios that further meetings were expected within days. The compressed timeline is notable. During last year’s rounds, weeks separated each session. The pace suggests Washington believes the diplomatic window is narrowing, and Tehran is at least willing to test that claim.</p><p data-start=\"6714\" data-end=\"6789\">Several tests will show whether urgency produces substance or merely speed.</p><p data-start=\"6791\" data-end=\"7276\">First, the scope question. The fundamental dispute over what the talks are about remains unresolved. Iran won the first procedural battle: The venue moved from Turkiye to Oman, regional observers were excluded, and Araghchi claims only nuclear issues were discussed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said before the talks that the agenda needed to include “all those issues”. If the second round begins with the same fight over scope, it will signal that even the basics remain unsettled.</p><p data-start=\"7278\" data-end=\"7780\">Second, Iran’s enrichment posture. Before the June 2025 war, Iran had been enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, a short technical step from weapons-grade. Tehran has said enrichment stopped following the strikes. But Iran has also conditioned International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of the bombed sites on new inspection arrangements, raising concerns among non-proliferation experts. Conversely, reports of enrichment resumption or acceleration would likely end the diplomatic track.</p><p data-start=\"7782\" data-end=\"8270\">Third, the military environment. The US naval build-up in the Arabian Sea is not decorative. The drone shootdown near the Abraham Lincoln and Iran’s attempted interception of a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz in the days before the talks show how quickly signalling can slide into miscalculation. Whether the carrier group is reinforced, maintained or gradually drawn down in the coming weeks will reveal more about Washington’s assessment of diplomacy than any press statement.</p><p data-start=\"8272\" data-end=\"8537\">Fourth, the sanctions rhythm. The same-day announcement of shadow fleet sanctions establishes a pattern. If Washington continues to layer new economic penalties between rounds of talks, Tehran will treat it as evidence that diplomacy is performance rather than process.</p><p data-start=\"8539\" data-end=\"8876\">Fifth, backchannel activity. The most consequential diplomacy over the next few weeks may not occur in formal settings. Oman, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye have been working behind the scenes to sustain dialogue. If those intermediary contacts remain active, space for de-escalation persists. If they fall silent, the margin for error narrows.</p><h2 id=\"a-managed-deadlock-is-not-a-strategy\">A managed deadlock is not a strategy</h2><p data-start=\"8921\" data-end=\"9234\">The most probable short-term outcome remains neither breakthrough nor war, but a managed deadlock in which both sides maintain maximal public positions while avoiding steps that would make future talks impossible. In practice, this is a pause sustained by caution rather than a settlement anchored in confidence.</p><p data-start=\"9236\" data-end=\"9593\">For the broader region, the distinction matters urgently. Gulf states have no interest in becoming staging grounds for escalation. Public statements across the region have consistently emphasised de-escalation, restraint and conflict avoidance. But regional actors can facilitate, host and encourage; they cannot impose terms on either Washington or Tehran.</p><p data-start=\"9595\" data-end=\"9792\">The Muscat talks did not fail. Neither did they succeed. They established that a channel exists, that both sides are willing to use it, and that direct contact between senior officials is possible.</p><p data-start=\"9794\" data-end=\"10081\">But a channel is not a plan. The absence of war is not the presence of a deal. The period between Muscat and whatever comes next is a window in which miscalculation remains close to the surface, sustained only by the assumption that both sides are reading each other’s signals correctly.</p><p data-start=\"10083\" data-end=\"10276\">The next round of talks will not produce an agreement. But it may show whether the two sides are building a floor beneath the standoff or simply postponing the moment when that floor gives way.</p><p data-start=\"10083\" data-end=\"10276\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The two regions were geographically separated by India, and the majority Bengali population in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had been pushing for independence.</p><p>Pro-independence politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League won close to all 162 seats allocated to East Pakistan in the common Pakistani parliament. The Awami League also effectively won a majority in the then-313-seat National Assembly of Pakistan — which should have allowed it to form the national government of a united Pakistan, with Rahman as prime minister.</p><p>However, the Pakistani military government refused to allow him to become PM. Rahman delivered a fiery speech in which he declared that Bangladesh would be independent of Pakistan by March 1971.</p><p>The Pakistan army violently attacked activists, triggering the Bangladeshi Liberation War from March to December 1971, during which Bengalis in East Pakistan were ethnically cleansed. An estimated three million people were killed and 200,000 women sexually assaulted, according to the <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/50/NGO/26\">United Nations</a>.</p><p>Rahman — better known as Mujib in Bangladesh — was imprisoned at the beginning of the conflict, but a provisional government was formed in his absence in exile. It operated from nearby Kolkata in India under acting President Syed Nazrul Islam until Rahman’s release in January 1972 following independence. Rahman then served as prime minister.</p><h2 id=\"1973-first-post-independence-election\">1973 – First post-independence election</h2><p>After Bangladesh won independence from Pakistan in December 1971, a provisional government held the country’s first general election in March 1973. It was controversial, however, and has since been seen as an indicator of Mujib’s subsequent autocratic policies. While 14 political parties contested the election, the Awami League won an overwhelming 73 percent of the vote and snatched 293 of the contested 300 seats.</p><p>While the party was the favourite to dominate the elections in any case, Mujib nevertheless was alleged to have taken extra measures to consolidate power, including rigging polls through ballot-stuffing and intimidating and arresting opposition leaders.</p><p>Opposition parties Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and the Jatiya League won only one seat each.</p><p>In 1974, Mujib banned all opposition parties, ushering in a one-party state. He also restricted journalists’ access to parliament.</p><h2 id=\"1975-to-1986-an-era-of-chaotic-military\">1975 to 1986 – an era of chaotic military</h2><p>Mujib and most of his family were assassinated in August 1975 during a bloody coup organised by mid-level officials, led by Colonel Sayed Farooq-ur-Rahman. Finance Minister Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad immediately declared himself president with the army’s backing.</p><p>Ahmad undid the one-party policy, allowing opposition parties to form, but was toppled shortly after in a counter-coup in November 1975 led by General Khaled Mosharraf, an ally of Rahman. Chief Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem then ruled as president with the military’s support until he resigned on health grounds in April 1977.</p><p>Then-army chief Ziaur Rahman took over as president. Zia, as he was popularly known, had also been a major figure during the liberation struggle – he broadcast the Bangladesh Declaration of Independence at the time.</p><p>As leader, he is credited with instituting economic recovery in the struggling country by liberalising the economy. He also pushed for a national Bangladeshi identity, rather than a Bengali one, which, until then, had excluded minority ethnic groups. Most notably, he ushered in multi-party elections again.</p><h2 id=\"1979-multi-party-elections\">1979 multi-party elections</h2><p>In February 1979, Ziaur’s government organised the first polls since 1973, in which his newly formed Bangladesh National Party (BNP) participated and won 207 out of 300 parliamentary seats. The Awami League, now the major opposition, won 39 seats but claimed the elections were rigged.</p><h2 id=\"1986-and-1988-elections-discredited\">1986 and 1988 elections discredited</h2><p>After Ziaur’s assassination in an abortive military coup on May 30,1981, Vice President Abdus Sattar became acting president and conducted presidential elections in November of the same year. BNP again won 65 percent of the vote. But within months, army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad had seized power in a bloodless coup in March 1982, imposing martial law.</p><p>Ershad ruled for the next four years. When he held elections in May 1986, his Jatiya Party won 183 seats, securing a parliamentary majority. Opposition parties like the BNP had boycotted the vote, calling it a sham. Opposition parties again criticised the elections held in March 1988, when the Jatiya Party won 259 seats, as unfair and manipulated. Widespread protests calling for Ershad’s resignation broke out.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116178\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116178\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116178\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_691cebb58f10-1763503029.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"(FILES) Students chant slogans near a vandalised mural of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during a protest demanding accountability and trial against Hasina, near Dhaka University in the capital on August 12, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4116178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students chant slogans near a vandalised mural of Bangladesh’s ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during a protest demanding accountability and a trial against Hasina, near Dhaka University on August 12, 2024 [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1991-free-and-fair-elections\">1991 ‘free and fair’ elections</h2><p>The BNP, led by the late <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a> – Ziaur’s widow – and the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina – the eldest of Rahman’s two surviving daughters – joined forces to lead mass protests in December 1990, which forced Ershad’s government to resign.</p><p>A caretaker government, led by Supreme Court justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, then held new elections on February 27, 1991, which were widely regarded as legitimate.</p><p>Khaleda Zia’s BNP won 140 seats while Hasina’s Awami League took 88. The Jatiya Party won 35 seats.</p><p>Khaleda Zia became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister.</p><h2 id=\"first-win\">1996 – Hasina’s first win</h2><p>Tensions between the ruling BNP and Awami League were boiling over following a parliamentary by-election for the Magura-2 constituency. Although the BNP’s candidate had won, the Awami League claimed the vote had been rigged, and began pressing Khaleda Zia to hand power over to a caretaker government to conduct forthcoming elections.</p><p>The Awami League and other opposition parties then boycotted the February 15, 1996 election, clearing the way for the BNP to win nearly all seats in parliament. Voter turnout was one of the lowest in the country ever, at only 21 percent.</p><p>However, general strikes across Bangladesh forced the BNP to hand power to a caretaker government just 12 days after the vote. In March, a requirement that a neutral caretaker government must oversee all future general elections was written into the constitution.</p><p>More elections were held on June 12. There was a much better turnout of 75 percent, and voting was widely seen as free. Hasina won her first term as prime minister, with the Awami League securing 146 parliamentary seats, just ahead of the BNP, which won 116 seats.</p><h2 id=\"2001-elections-bnp-retakes-power\">2001 elections – BNP retakes power</h2><p>Another caretaker government oversaw the next general election in October 2001. This time, the opposition BNP surged in popularity and won 193 parliament seats, ahead of the ruling Awami League, which secured 62 seats.</p><p>The elections were mostly peaceful, although there were some reports of violence towards the country’s minority Hindu population. Khaleda Zia of the BNP was able to form a government for a second time.</p><h2 id=\"2006-election-crisis-and-a-failed-vote\">2006 – Election crisis and a failed vote</h2><p>A dispute erupted between the ruling BNP, opposition Awami League, and other major players over who would lead the next caretaker government ahead of the January 2007 elections.</p><p>Riots broke out after the BNP named a retired chief justice with ties to then-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.</p><p>The BNP-appointed president, Iajuddin Ahmed, ultimately declared himself leader of the caretaker government after no consensus was reached.</p><p>In December, revelations that <a href=\"/news/2006/12/2/bangladesh-voters-list-criticised-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fake names</a> had been included on the list of candidates sparked riots. Thousands of protesters <a href=\"/news/2006/11/21/bangladesh-election-protests-resume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blockaded</a> the transport system and shut down schools and offices. The country descended into a political crisis that would last for several months.</p><p>Ahmed declared a national emergency, allowing the military to intervene. In protest, the Awami League withdrew from the planned elections. The elections failed to be held.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"2008-hasina-s-return\">2008 – Hasina’s return</h2><p>The delayed election eventually took place on December 29, 2008, with an 80 percent turnout – the highest the country had ever seen. It was also largely seen as fair.</p><p>The Awami League, led by Hasina, allied with several other opposition groups to form the Grand Alliance. The coalition ended up winning a majority of 230 seats. The BNP took just 30 seats. A new government was formed in January 2009. Hasina returned to power for the second time.</p><h2 id=\"2014-opposition-boycotts-and-crackdowns\">2014 – Opposition boycotts and crackdowns</h2><p>Hasina’s Awami League government was highly critical of the military intervention that had delayed the 2009 election.</p><p>Upon her return to power, she moved to amend the constitution to get rid of the caretaker government requirement. However, the BNP boycotted a June 2011 parliamentary session where lawmakers voted on the amendment. The amendment to the constitution was passed by parliament by a vote of 291 to 1.</p><p>Hasina’s government also began to crack down on opposition leaders. Ahead of elections slated for January 5, 2014, opposition BNP leader Khaleda Zia was placed under house arrest, and there were widespread reports of violence against other opposition members. On election day, the BNP and its supporters refused to participate.</p><p>Hasina’s Awami League, therefore, won the elections again, securing 234 seats in parliament, in a vote widely panned — in Bangladesh and internationally — as illegitimate.</p><h2 id=\"2018-awami-league-wins-supermajority\">2018 – Awami League wins supermajority</h2><p>The next general election was held on December 30, 2018, amid major technological upgrades. For the first time, voters could participate in electronic voting.</p><p>However, the BNP and other opposition parties accused the ruling Awami League-Jatiya Party coalition of rigging, despite the upgrades. There were again reports of violence against opposition BNP members and the party’s supporters, as well as allegations of vote rigging.</p><p>The Awami League government had also banned the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamic party and a BNP ally at the time. Several Jamaat leaders were executed after convictions by a Hasina-appointed tribunal for alleged war crimes in 1971.</p><p>The government also <a href=\"/news/2018/12/29/bangladesh-shuts-down-mobile-internet-in-lead-up-to-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shut down mobile internet</a> ahead of the vote to stop the spread of fake news, it claimed. Khaleda Zia of BNP was outright barred from running after she was convicted and handed a 17-year jail term in a corruption case. The BNP maintained that the trial was politically motivated.

Anutin dissolved parliament in December to call a snap election after he was threatened with a no-confidence vote.</p><p>He has centred his campaign on economic stimulus and national security, tapping into nationalist fervour stoked by deadly border clashes with neighbouring Cambodia.</p><p>The third major contender, Pheu Thai, represents the latest incarnation of political movements backed by jailed former Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/9/9/thai-court-says-ex-premier-thaksin-shinawatra-must-serve-1-year-in-prison\">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, and trades on the populist policies of the Thai Rak Thai party, which held power from 2001 until 2006, when it was ousted by a military coup.</p><p>The party has campaigned on economic revival and populist pledges like cash handouts, nominating Thaksin’s nephew, Yodchanan Wongsawat, as its lead candidate for prime minister.</p><p>Sunday’s voting also includes a referendum asking voters whether Thailand should replace its 2017 military-drafted constitution.</p><p>Pro-democracy groups view a new charter as a critical step towards reducing the influence of unelected institutions, such as the military and judiciary, while conservatives warn that it could lead to instability.</p><p>Some 53 million people are eligible to vote in Sunday’s election, and the Election Commission said more than 2.2 million voters had already cast ballots during an early voting period that began on February 1.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng, reporting from Bangkok, said voters in Thailand were viewing this election with a sense of weary familiarity.</p><p>“It’s only three years since we had an election. We weren’t supposed to have another one for a couple of years yet,” he said. But the outcome is likely to be similar to the last vote, with the People’s Party again expected to finish first.</p><p>“What Thai voters really want to know is whether the next government will moves things forward. They’ve seen growth slowing and slowing while the rest of this dynamic region surges ahead. And there’s a feeling that things really need to change.”</p><p>But whether voters will get what they voted for remains uncertain.</p><p>“We’ve seen parties come into power only to have prime ministers knocked out with military coups and court interventions. And we keep hearing from the institutions that Thailand is not quite ready for democracy,” Cheng said. “But the truth is those institutions have never allowed democracy to truly flourish. And so people keep voting for parties that are never fully able to take power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
