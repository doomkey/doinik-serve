Ukraine has also carried out regular attacks in Russian territory.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Following Wednesday’s call, the US president said the group discussed proposals in “pretty strong terms”, adding that Zelenskyy “has to be realistic” about ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Zelenskyy has said in recent days that Ukraine will not give up territory. The nation’s constitution also forbids it.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Merz described it as a “crucial moment” for Ukraine, saying “intensive work on the peace plan is to continue in the coming days”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">After meeting NATO chief Mark Rutte on Thursday, the German chancellor dismissed reports of tensions during the call with Trump, characterising it as “constructive” and noting discussions about “what territorial concessions Ukraine is prepared to make”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Merz said territorial questions were matters “the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian people must answer”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The negotiations have exposed sharp divisions over how much land Ukraine should surrender.

The US recently pressured Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to buy more weapons from it.</p><p>We take a closer look at the US-Pakistan F-16 upgrade deal and why this is significant now.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-us-agreed-with-pakistan\">What has the US agreed with Pakistan?</h2><p>Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the latest approval is part of a 2022 maintenance deal the US agreed in 2022 to sustain Pakistan’s fleet of F-16s.</p><p>“The F-16 deal remains a key part of the broader US-Pakistan bilateral relationship, which is why there has been continuity from President Biden to President Trump, despite some delays. Both sides emphasise the fleet’s utility in joint counterterrorism operations in the region.”</p><p>The latest US deal is for the sale of technology, which will support and upgrade Pakistan’s existing F-16 fleet. It was confirmed in a report sent to the US Congress by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on December 4.</p><p>Pakistan is believed to have 70 to 80 working F-16s. Some of these are older, but upgraded, Block 15 models, some are former Jordanian F-16s, and some are newer Block 52+ models.</p><p>The US offering comprises hardware and software updates for enhanced flight operations and aircraft electronic systems; the Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, which allows pilots to identify friendly aircraft from enemy ones; navigation upgrades; spare parts and repairs.</p><p>Alongside $649m-worth of support and upgrades for the F-16s, the US sale also includes major defence equipment (MDE), which are items of significant military equipment on the US munitions list, worth $37m. This includes 92 Link-16 systems.</p><p>The Link-16 is a secure military tactical data link network which allows real-time communication between military aircraft, ships and ground forces. It allows communication through text messages and images.</p><p>Six Mk-82 inert 500-pound (226.8kg) general-purpose bomb bodies are another type of MDE authorised to be sold to Pakistan. These are empty metal casings of an Mk-82 bomb, which are used for training or testing.</p><p>Instead of an explosive such as tritonal – a mixture of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and aluminium powder used in munitions – the casing is filled with a heavy material such as concrete or sand. The Mk-82 is an unguided bomb developed by the US. It can also be used as a warhead for precision-guided munitions.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-f-16-fighters\">What are F-16 fighters?</h2><p>The F-16, also called the F-16 Fighting Falcon or the Viper, is a single-engine aircraft used for air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack by the US and its allies.</p><p>The jets are currently manufactured by US defence and aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin, which took over production in 1995. It was originally developed by General Dynamics, a US industrial and technology company.</p><p>The jet was developed towards the end of the war in Vietnam, during which the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) overwhelmed heavier and slower US fighter planes. It <a href=\"/news/2024/6/18/ukraine-new-f16-fighter-jets\">first flew</a> in 1974.</p><p>The F-16 is now one of the world’s most widely used fighters. F-16s are operating in 29 countries, according to the Lockheed Martin website.</p><p>Besides Pakistan, some other countries which have F-16s are Ukraine, Turkiye, Israel, Egypt, Poland, Greece, Taiwan, Chile, Singapore, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167178\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167178\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167178\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20240316__34LM2ER__v4__HighRes__PakistanPoliticsDefence-1765447088.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"F-16\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">F-16s perform aerobatic manoeuvres during a rehearsal for Pakistan Day parade, March 16, 2024 [Aamir Qureshi/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-role-did-f-16s-play-in-the-may-conflict-between-india-and-pakistan\">What role did F-16s play in the May conflict between India and Pakistan?</h2><p>On April 22, armed attackers <a href=\"/news/2025/4/23/act-of-war-what-happened-in-kashmir-attack-that-killed-26-tourists\">killed 26 people in Pahalgam</a>, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a separatist group designated a terrorist organisation by India and the US, and which New Delhi alleges is linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) – a claim Islamabad denies.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Following the Pahalgam attack, New Delhi scaled back diplomatic ties with Islamabad and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, which ensures the appropriate sharing of the Indus River water between India and Pakistan.</p><p>On May 7, India <a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/why-did-india-strike-pakistan-all-we-know-about-operation-sindoor\">struck nine sites in Pakistan</a> and Pakistan-administered Kashmir with missiles, which Islamabad said killed dozens of civilians. Over the following three days, the countries engaged in a heated aerial war, using drones and missiles to target each other’s military bases.</p><p>During the aerial war, Pakistan deployed 42 “hi-tech aircraft”, including the F-16s, and Chinese-made JF-17s and J-10s, according to Pakistan’s Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed.</p><p>A ceasefire – for which US President Donald Trump took credit – was eventually brokered on May 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-applying-pressure-to-india\">Is the US applying pressure to India?</h2><p>Yes, for a couple of reasons.</p><p>The US approval for Pakistan’s F-16 upgrade comes as the Trump administration presses India to buy more weapons from it.</p><p>In August, New Delhi put its plans to buy US weapons and aircraft on hold, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting three unnamed Indian officials familiar with the matter.</p><p>This came just weeks before Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had been scheduled to visit Washington to announce some weapon purchases. That visit was cancelled.</p><p>India-US relations have also been tense in recent months.</p><p>On August 6, Trump imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on imports from India as a punishment for <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/how-india-plans-to-continue-buying-russian-oil-despite-sanctions\">buying cheap Russian crude oil</a>. This was on top of the existing 25 percent tariff already levied on Indian goods, bringing the total levy on Indian imports to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/trump-imposes-25-percent-tariff-on-indian-goods-over-russian-oil\">50 percent</a>.</p><p>Trump announced the tariff in an executive order, in which he wrote that Russia’s continued military actions in Ukraine constituted a “national emergency” and it was therefore “necessary and appropriate” to place heightened tariffs on India, a top consumer of its crude oil.</p><p>“I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.”</p><p>While pressure from the US has resulted in India slightly scaling back purchases of Russian oil, New Delhi plans to continue to buy from Moscow. It remains the second-largest consumer of Russian oil after China.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin met Prime Minister Modi for the annual Russia-India <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/uninterrupted-oil-shipments-key-takeaways-from-putin-modi-talks-in-delhi\">bilateral summit</a> in New Delhi last week, during which he said: “Russia is ready for uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.”</p><p>The announcement of the latest US deal to provide maintenance and upgrades for Pakistan’s F-16s is likely to be poorly received by India.</p><p>Donthi said New Delhi has previously opposed the defence cooperation between Pakistan and the US under which the two countries collaborate to maintain Pakistan’s F-16 fleet. India has claimed the F-16s are used against it.</p><p>“Washington pre-empted it this time by stating that the sale ‘will not alter the basic military balance in the region’,” Donthi said.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-does-the-us-sale-strengthen-pakistan\">How much does the US sale strengthen Pakistan?</h2><p>Donthi said that while the latest package from the US will help Pakistan maintain its fleet until 2040, it is China which has supplied more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s weapons since 2020.</p><p>This statistic is also backed by Swedish think tank SIPRI in a report this year.</p><p>“Pakistan used Chinese J-10 aircraft in the May conflict with India. Islamabad continues to balance between Washington and Beijing, benefiting from both,” Donthi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Up to 150mm (5.9 inches) of rain is estimated in some coastal areas, with wind gusts of up to 90km/h (56mph).</p><p>The Israeli army chief, Eyal Zamir, issued safety guidelines for the military, cancelling all leave until 6am on Friday, prohibiting all outdoor training activities and limiting soldiers to “operational” and “essential” activities.</p><p>Israel has been on high alert. Cities across the country have taken measures to prepare for the storm, reinforcing emergency teams and opening shelters in case they are needed.</p><p>Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Eli Cohen assessed the situation with various government bodies to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply during the storm.</p><p>In contrast, unrecognised Bedouin communities in southern Israel are bracing for disaster, hoping for a miracle. Close to 30,000 Palestinian citizens of Israel live in those communities without any basic services, including electricity, water, or infrastructure.

On Wednesday, Omar al-Asam, head of the Tal al-Sabe Council, announced a strike to protest against the police blocking off the town’s only entrance and assaulting one of the residents.</p><p>“The police’s racist and aggressive conduct is unacceptable, and it goes to show the police’s racist attitude towards <a href=\"/news/2018/7/19/five-ways-israeli-law-discriminates-against-palestinians\">Arab citizens</a> across the country, especially in the Negev,” al-Asam told local media.</p><p>This tension is a mainstay in Israel’s relationship with its non-Jewish citizens. In 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Israel is not a state of all its citizens.”</p><p>“According to the basic nationality law we passed, <a href=\"/news/2019/3/11/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-is-a-state-only-of-the-jewish-people\">Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people</a> – and only it,” Netanyahu wrote on Instagram in response to criticism from Israeli actor Rotem Sela.</p><p>This attitude is part of Israel’s institutional discrimination against non-Jewish citizens, amounting to apartheid according to experts and human rights organisations. In the past two years, right-wing politicians have advocated for the expulsion of Palestinian citizens of Israel or conditioning nationality on loyalty. Some have repeatedly attempted to outlaw non-Jewish parties and expel members of Knesset, the Israeli parliament, most recently in June 2025.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"byron-poses-lot-of-challenges\">Byron poses ‘lot of challenges’</h2><p>Meanwhile, the occupied West Bank also faces serious challenges from the storm.</p><p>Youssef Abu Saadah, the head of the meteorological service in Palestine, told Al Jazeera, “The expected rain from Storm Byron is more than a third of the average yearly rainfall. This poses a lot of challenges.”</p><p>He clarified that flood warnings in the Negev are partly because of the downstream from the Hebron hills in the West Bank.</p><p>Since the start of the occupation in 1967, Israel has barred Palestinians in the West Bank from collecting rainwater. This means that much of the downpours in the Hebron area will find their way to the Negev.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that it was Gaza which was facing a threat from Israel, and “not from Gaza, whose disarmament they demand”.</p><p>Hamas was founded in the late 1980s during the first Intifada, a widespread Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, was formed shortly afterwards and has been central to the group’s identity, fighting Israeli forces since the early 1990s. Hamas’s political wing has governed Gaza since 2007 after being elected in 2006.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A key <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">element</a> of Trump’s phased peace plan, agreed in early October, calls for Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups to surrender their weapons to an international peacekeeping force, ending the group’s nearly two-decade rule over the enclave. Senior Israeli officials have <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/trump-says-hamas-has-three-or-four-days-to-respond-to-gaza-proposal?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">described</a> it as a crucial war aim, warning that failure to achieve it could cause the truce to collapse.</p><p>Though Israel has violated the agreement more than 700 times – <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/hamas-leader-vows-to-curb-gaza-attacks-on-israel-but-rejects-disarmament\">killing 377 people –</a> the ceasefire has largely held, with Israel still occupying more than half of the devastated Gaza Strip. Over the course of Israel’s genocidal war, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 170,000 injured, according to records by Gaza health officials.</p><p>The body of only one captive abducted during the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel in October 2023 remains in Gaza, while hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including the remains of some who died in Israeli detention, have been returned.</p><p>Many of the returnees, including those who were deceased, have shown signs of torture, mutilation and execution, according to officials in Gaza.</p><p>Mediators have <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/hamas-leader-vows-to-curb-gaza-attacks-on-israel-but-rejects-disarmament\">emphasised</a> the need for a coordinated effort as the ceasefire enters what Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani called a “critical moment.”</p><p>A US official confirmed to Al Jazeera that intense negotiations are under way to move to phase two, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the first phase is nearing completion.

Israel has rejected any Ankara involvement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meshaal said Hamas is not opposed to the presence of international peacekeepers, such as United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) forces in Lebanon, despite criticising the United Nations Security Council’s endorsement of Trump’s plan, and expressed confidence that the force could prevent “military escalation against Israel from inside Gaza”.</p><p>He also shared his vision for Gaza’s future governance, reiterating that Hamas would hand control to technocrats while emphasising that “we want the Palestinian to govern the Palestinian, and for he, himself to decide who governs him”.</p><p>He criticised Trump’s so-called “board of peace,” a body the US president said he hopes would supervise the territory’s governance, saying it was fraught with risks and would amount to “a form of guardianship” over the territory.</p><p>Meshaal told Al Jazeera that talks in Egypt had brought together various Palestinian factions to form a representative group for Gaza, with eight members selected, but added that the process was “being obstructed by Israel”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The African continent is home to some 415,000 elephants of the world’s 460,000 elephants. The rest of the world’s elephants are in Asia.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In 2019, the government lifted a five-year moratorium on elephant hunting to keep the elephant population in check and help generate revenue from trophy hunters for rural communities.</p><p>However, conservationists and scientists warn that the sharp increase in quota numbers recently announced risks undermining the long-term health of elephant populations as well as exacerbating human-wildlife conflict.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Oaitse Nawa, founder of the Botswana-based Elephant Protection Society (EPS), said the number of elephants being hunted is “too high” and called on the government to revisit this issue.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-botswana-s-new-trophy-hunting-quota\">What is Botswana’s new trophy-hunting quota?</h2><p>A preliminary government draft indicates that the quota for trophy hunting for 2026 has been raised to 430 elephants, up from 410 in 2025.</p><p>Trophy hunting refers to the practice of legally killing wild animals, such as elephants, lions, and rhinoceroses, and taking a highly valued part of their bodies, such as a tusk or horn. Botswana’s expansive, yet sparsely inhabited landscapes have long drawn foreigners who wish to visit its wildlife.</p><p>The move reflects Botswana’s general approach to the conservation of elephant herds.</p><p>In 2014, the country imposed a complete ban on trophy hunting but reversed that decision five years later, saying elephant numbers had risen too high and were threatening farmers’ livelihoods.</p><p>Now, the government allocates annual hunting quotas for more than a dozen species, including elephants, rhinos, and hippopotamuses.</p><p>Other African nations, including Namibia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania, also have trophy-hunting quotas to manage their elephant and other wildlife populations.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-the-government-allow-trophy-hunting\">Why does the government allow trophy hunting?</h2><p>The Botswana government argues the practice is important to keep the population of the large animals in check, as they are increasingly coming into conflict with humans. Climate change and logging, which encroach on elephants’ natural habitat and food sources, have also forced elephants to look elsewhere for habitat and food.</p><p>As a result, elephants in several African countries have been known to enter private homes and villages, trampling crops, eating stored grain, and damaging homes, fences and water infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Botswana’s former President Mokgweetsi Masisi last year slammed the <a href=\"/news/2024/4/3/botswana-threatens-to-send-20000-elephants-to-germany-in-conservation-row\">German government for a proposed ban</a> on the import of elephant parts.</p><p>Many other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands, have also imposed restrictions on the import of parts of endangered species, including elephants, lions, hippopotamuses and rhinos.</p><p>Masisi said Germans should “try living among elephants”. He claimed that an explosion in the number of the mammals roaming his country had produced a “plague”.</p><p>Moreover, the Botswanan government says regulated hunting provides a highly valuable revenue stream. Earlier this year, Minister of Environment Wynter Mmolotsi said the country earned more than $4m from the sale of hunting licences in 2024, compared with $2.7m in 2023, and that this money was used to support conservation and community-led projects.</p><p>Depending on the animal being hunted, hunting licences can cost up to $10,000.</p><h2 id=\"is-trophy-hunting-a-serious-threat-to-elephants\">Is trophy hunting a serious threat to elephants?</h2><p>Amy Dickman, a professor of wildlife conservation and director of WildCRU at the University of Oxford, said, while trophy hunting may be “contentious”, it is not a key threat to any species, including elephants, and that “revenue from legal hunting helps maintain large areas of wildlife habitat and can be very important for local people”.</p><p>“Botswana – the leading country in the world for large mammal conservation – has a thriving elephant population, and both the government and local communities need to see financial benefits from that presence,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They have long used trophy hunting to generate some of those benefits, and their sovereign decisions should be trusted and respected.”</p><p>Al Jazeera contacted Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks and the Ministry of Environment for comment, but received no reply.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-critics-of-the-trophy-hunting-quota-system-say\">What do critics of the trophy hunting quota system say?</h2><p>According to Will Travers, cofounder and executive president of Born Free, a wildlife charity, Botswana’s expanded elephant trophy hunting quota “raises deep biological concerns”, however.</p><p>“Biological, because, as the name suggests, trophy hunters target individual animals they regard as ‘trophies’ … in the case of elephants, those with the largest tusks, the mature males,” he told Al Jazeera in an emailed statement.</p><p>“These long-lived ‘elders’ are repositories of vital survival knowledge within elephant society, are desired by female elephants, and can successfully reproduce, passing on their genes well into old age. They are targets for poachers and trophy hunters, adding even more pressure on this tiny demographic of animals, which some estimate may represent just 1 percent of Botswana’s national elephant herd.”</p><p>Moreover, experts also say that removing elephants changes how they behave, which can actually exacerbate, rather than reduce, conflict with nearby human communities.</p><p>“Since the community lives within the same environment as these animals, they often encounter wildlife that can be provoked or become aggressive,” EPS’s Nawa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“When people go to the fields or search for their cattle, they may come across breeding herds of elephants, and that’s where problems begin.</p><p>“The elephants may run up and down, destroying crops as they flee for their lives – after all, they are living creatures, and if they feel threatened, they must escape,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-alternatives\">What are the alternatives?</h2><p>Nawa said authorities should take a community-based approach to controlling interaction with elephants by equipping residents with the knowledge and skills to live alongside wildlife.</p><p>“The community need to be trained since they live with these animals,” he said, about what to do “if they encounter an elephant”.</p><p>Nawa also said communities in Botswana could benefit from living alongside elephants if the government adopts a policy that links water boreholes to tourism. “We can have lots of boreholes and tourism facilities around those boreholes, whereby the community can benefit directly from the funds,” he said.</p><p>Citing the example of one local elephant resort, he explained that they drilled a lot of boreholes around the area, attracting elephants, and many people come to watch the elephants “at a very close range”.</p><p>“The community needs to be educated to understand the role of elephants, especially in the ecosystem, and how they can benefit directly from elephants without killing them or obstructing them,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The government says the ECHR, particularly its protections against torture and family separation, makes it too difficult to “control our borders to protect our democracies”.</p><p>But Starmer’s message marks a significant shift in his Labour Party’s traditional approach to human rights law and asylum policy.</p><p>Furthermore, migration experts and rights groups are warning that weakening ECHR protections could expose vulnerable people to serious harm.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-starmer-and-other-european-leaders-pushing-for\">What are Starmer and other European leaders pushing for?</h2><p data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"752\">Ahead of the Strasbourg meeting on Wednesday, Starmer urged European governments to agree to modernise the ECHR, arguing that current interpretations of the treaty make it too difficult for states to remove people who arrive irregularly, via routes which are not approved by the government.</p><p data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"752\">This would most likely be achieved by carving out exceptions to provisions in the ECHR which protect specific rights, or changing the legal interpretation of these rights. The main articles that European leaders want to modernise are Article 3, which covers people fearing torture or inhuman treatment in their home countries, and Article 8, which protects family life and can be used by refugees to support family members being reunited.</p><p data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"752\">They say they need to make these changes if they have any hope of stemming the tide of migrant inflows.</p><p data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"752\">In particular, the UK – which was one of the countries which drafted the ECHR in the wake of World War II – has grappled with a rising number of refugees and migrants arriving on small boats across the English Channel from France, and this has become a major point of concern among voters.</p><p data-start=\"510\" data-end=\"752\">This year, Starmer reached a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/10/whats-in-the-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-between-the-uk-and-france\">“one in one out” deal</a> with France to send back one undocumented migrant without ties to the UK in return for keeping one who comes in on an approved route and who does have ties. However, so far, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/24/how-effective-is-uks-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-so-far\">only a handful of people</a> have been sent back and at least one has returned to the UK since being deported.</p><p>In October, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood dispatched officials to study the workings of the Danish immigration and asylum system, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/why-does-the-uk-want-to-copy-denmarks-stringent-immigration-policies\">widely considered the toughest in Europe</a>. The officials are reportedly looking to review British immigration rules on family reunion and limit refugees to a temporary stay.</p><p>Denmark has made family reunions much tougher, keeping the bar of conditions comparatively higher than in other European countries. Permanent residency is possible only after eight years under very strict criteria, including full-time employment.</p><p>Those who live in estates designated as “parallel societies”, where more than 50 percent of residents are from so-called “non-Western” backgrounds, are barred from being granted family reunion. This has been decried by rights groups as racist and constituting ethnic profiling.</p><p>In November, the UK announced plans for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/uks-sweeping-asylum-law-changes-how-will-they-impact-refugees\">sweeping changes</a> to legal rights for refugees. Most importantly, the changes will end the automatic path to settled status for refugees after five years. They will also remove state benefits from those who have the right to work and can support themselves.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-uk-pushing-for-a-change-to-the-echr-treaty-now\">Why is the UK pushing for a change to the ECHR treaty now?</h2><p data-start=\"1315\" data-end=\"1763\">In short, Starmer is attempting to face down strong pressure from the far right in the UK to withdraw completely from the ECHR treaty. Instead, he is calling for the treaty to be modernised in the hope that this will placate right-wing concerns, which have become more mainstream in the UK.</p><p>In a joint article with the Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen, published in the UK’s Guardian newspaper this week, Starmer argued that curbing the ECHR would be the best way to deter voters from supporting far-right political parties in Europe.</p><p>“The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division, is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem,” he wrote.</p><p data-start=\"1315\" data-end=\"1763\">According to analyst Susan Fratzke of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), Starmer’s stance also reflects broader concerns among European governments about the ECHR’s impact on the removal of “illegally present foreign nationals”.</p><p>Fratzke told Al Jazeera that these governments, including the UK and Denmark, believe that the ECHR, under its current interpretations, restricts their ability to carry out returns.</p><p>She added that, under the ECHR, many officials perceive a challenge in distinguishing “who genuinely has a protection need and right to stay, and who doesn’t”.</p><p>Furthermore, they argue that, over time, domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights have “widened the definitions of some aspects of human rights law to such an extent that it makes it difficult to return people, even when there aren’t truly serious human rights concerns present”.</p><p data-start=\"2232\" data-end=\"2427\">Fratzke said Starmer and his counterparts want “to return to a narrower core understanding of what constitutes a protection need on human rights grounds”.</p><p>Politically, this push comes amid a surge in popularity for the far right, especially the party Reform UK, which wants to withdraw from the ECHR.</p><p>Fratzke said migration policy is very much being “driven by concerns about the strength of Reform and fears that it could dominate at the next elections”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-would-this-mean-for-migrants-and-asylum-seekers-in-the-uk\">What would this mean for migrants and asylum seekers in the UK?</h2><p data-start=\"3180\" data-end=\"3837\">Starmer’s push to curb the ECHR could have significant consequences for people seeking asylum in the UK.</p><p>If the UK and its European partners succeed in tightening the treaty’s interpretations, the people most affected would be those who currently rely on Article 3, covering torture or inhuman treatment, or Article 8, which protects family life, to argue against removal.</p><p>These safeguards could become harder to invoke, raising the likelihood of removals even in cases involving complex humanitarian or family circumstances.</p><p>However, Fratzke said that the degree to which the ECHR currently prevents removals is often overstated. She said that appeals on human rights grounds do occur, typically under Article 3 or under Article 8, which protects family life, and that such appeals “can and have been used to delay returns”.</p><p>However, she said that “fewer than 5 percent of successful appeals against returns have been on human rights grounds”. Most deportation cases are not stopped by the ECHR, even though public debate and media coverage frequently suggest otherwise.</p><p data-start=\"3839\" data-end=\"4484\">According to Fratzke, “the public perception of the ECHR and the idea that it forms a barrier have outstripped reality and become the crux of the challenge in itself”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-criticisms-of-labour-s-approach-to-the-echr\">What are the criticisms of Labour’s approach to the ECHR?</h2><p>There are three main reasons that Starmer is facing criticism for his stance towards immigration and refugee rights.</p><h3 data-start=\"4537\" data-end=\"5070\">Undermining human rights</h3><p data-start=\"4537\" data-end=\"5070\">Human rights groups and some Labour figures have warned that the prime minister’s stance on the ECHR risks undermining fundamental protections that have been in place for decades.</p><p>Major rights organisations, including Amnesty International UK, Freedom from Torture and Reprieve, have echoed that concern, arguing that carving out exceptions to Article 3 would erode one of the most fundamental guarantees in European human rights law.</p><p>“Human rights were built for hard times, not rewrites when it suits the Government,” Amnesty said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>“Pushing to water down the European Convention on Human Rights on International Human Rights Day is a moral retreat, not a solution,” it said. “The lives of real people depend on those protections, we must not sacrifice dignity for political convenience.”</p><h3>Emulating the far right</h3><p>Several left-leaning Labour Party MPs have condemned the “far-right”, “racist” approach of the British government’s moves to adapt the Danish model.</p><p>Last month, Nadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, told BBC Radio 4 Today: “This is a dead end – morally, politically and electorally.</p><p>“I think these are policies of the far right,” she said. “I don’t think anyone wants to see a Labour government flirting with them.”</p><p>Whittome argued that it would be a “dangerous path” to take and that some of the Danish policies, especially those around “parallel societies”, were “undeniably racist”.</p><p>Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said: “Denmark’s Social Democrats have gone down what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration. They’ve adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right.</p><p>“Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters, but you can’t do that at the cost of losing progressive votes,” he added</p><p>In October, Lucy Powell, who won the Labour deputy leadership contest, challenged Starmer to soften his stance on immigration. “Division and hate are on the rise,” Powell said. “Discontent and disillusionment are widespread. We have this one big chance to show that progressive mainstream politics really can change people’s lives for the better.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Reversing traditional Labour values</h3><p>Critics also say Starmer has moved away from the social justice messages which once shaped the Labour Party’s approach to migration.</p><p>Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said Labour was simply “reheating” the previous Conservative government’s rhetoric when it pledged tougher removals.</p><p>“This ‘securitised’ approach to asylum and immigration will simply deter and punish many of the people most in need of crossing borders, people who are therefore often most vulnerable to criminal exploitation,” he said.</p><p>Fratzke said that instead of developing a tougher stance on human rights, governments should seek to balance deterrence with legal pathways and social protections.</p><p>“Deterrence is part of the picture,” she said, “but the question is how it is applied and alongside what other interventions.”</p><p>She noted that the UK is also exploring new legal pathways, including humanitarian sponsorship programmes and regulated routes from France, but cautioned that “they will need to find a balance between the two … to be effective”.</p><h2 id=\"is-the-far-right-a-political-threat-to-labour-in-the-uk\">Is the far right a political threat to Labour in the UK?</h2><p data-start=\"5970\" data-end=\"6501\">Yes, and this threat is the driving force behind Labour’s approach, experts say.</p><p>In July this year, the polling group YouGov said Reform UK, the far-right political party led by Nigel Farage, who spearheaded Brexit, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">would win an election</a> if one were held now. Much of its rise in popularity is down to its tough stance towards asylum seekers and on immigration generally.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Reform’s rise has unsettled both Labour and the former ruling Conservative Party, and has triggered a reckoning among liberals and centrists on migration policy. Starmer’s government appears aware that migration is a key issue and that adopting a tougher stance may prevent a further rise in the popularity of parties like Reform.</p><p>But Fratzke said fear of Reform has limited the government’s room to explore more thoughtful migration policies, keeping the debate focused on enforcement and deterrence.</p><p>Across Europe, similar pressures are shaping politics as centre and left-wing governments continue to toughen migration policies in a bid to slow far-right parties from gaining ground. This approach has had mixed effects, however, experts say.</p><p>In countries such as Denmark, the Social Democrats have taken a much harder line on immigration and have managed to limit the rise of the far-right Danish People’s Party for a period.</p><p>But in places like France and Italy, similar tactics have helped normalise far-right ideas and have in fact contributed to the growing influence of parties such as Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a 2023 report by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, the citation focused on how much Italians value the everyday rituals around food: the big Sunday lunch, the tradition of nonnas teaching kids how to fold tortellini just right, and simply sitting down together to enjoy a meal.</p><p>“Cooking is a gesture of love; it’s how we share who we are and how we look after each other,” said Pier Luigi Petrillo, part of Italy’s UNESCO campaign and a professor at Rome’s La Sapienza University.</p><p>In its announcement, UNESCO described Italian cuisine as a “cultural and social blend of culinary traditions”.</p><p>“Beyond cooking, practitioners view the element as a way of caring for oneself and others, expressing love and rediscovering one’s cultural roots. It gives communities an outlet to share their history and describe the world around them,” it added.</p><p>The UNESCO listing could deliver further economic benefits to a country already renowned for its cooking and where the agri-food supply chain accounts for about 15 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>It could also bring some relief to traditional family-run restaurants, long the backbone of Italian dining, which are facing a harsh economic climate in a market increasingly polarised between premium and budget options.</p><figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4166569\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-10T194336Z_378683136_RC2TDIAME9M3_RTRMADP_3_ITALY-CUISINE-UNESCO-1765422640.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C511&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Colosseum is illuminated during a special light installation\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Colosseum is illuminated during a special light installation, after Italy won a place on UNESCO’s cultural heritage list [Remo Casilli/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p><span>Honouring cultural expressions</span></p><p data-start=\"110\" data-end=\"378\">Italy is not the first country to see its cuisine honoured as a cultural expression.</p><p data-start=\"110\" data-end=\"378\">In 2010, UNESCO inscribed the “gastronomic meal of the French” on its intangible heritage list, calling out France’s tradition of marking life’s important moments around the table.</p><p data-start=\"110\" data-end=\"378\">Other food traditions have been added in recent years, too, including the cider culture of Spain’s Asturian region, Senegal’s Ceebu Jen dish, and the traditional cheese-making of Minas Gerais in Brazil.</p><p data-start=\"110\" data-end=\"378\">UNESCO reviews new candidates for its intangible-heritage lists every year under three categories: a representative list; a list for practices considered in “urgent” need of safeguarding; and a register of effective safeguarding practices.</p><p data-start=\"110\" data-end=\"378\">At this year’s meeting in New Delhi, the committee evaluated 53 proposals for the representative list, which already includes 788 entries.

It also includes measures to improve living conditions for American troops, including an almost 4 percent pay rise and improvements in military base housing.</p><p>Lawmakers also forced the inclusion of several provisions cementing Washington’s commitment to Europe’s defence in the face of Russian aggression, including $400m in military assistance to Ukraine in each of the next two years to help <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">repel Russia’s invasion</a>.</p><p>Another measure requires the Pentagon to keep at least 76,000 troops and major equipment stationed in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted.</p><p>This year’s bill, however, also cut several programmes reviled by Trump, including about $1.6bn in funding to initiatives focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as climate change.</p><p>The legislation will now head to the Senate, with leaders aiming to pass the bill before lawmakers depart for a holiday break.
