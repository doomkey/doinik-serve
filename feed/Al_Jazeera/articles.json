Everyone knows we have no military targets. There has been serious damage. I ‌have been out to look around,” Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.</li>\n<li>Two people were hurt in a Russian overnight drone attack in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.</li>\n<li>Klitschko said the attack caused damage in residential buildings in one district, and in another, debris from a destroyed drone fell on the roof of an office building, causing a fire. Debris also fell close to a shopping centre and caused damage to a kindergarten.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched two ballistic missiles and 183 drones at Ukraine overnight on Thursday, with air defence units shooting down 156 of the unmanned aerial vehicles.</li>\n<li>The Russian Ministry of Defence said its air defences downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight across several regions inside Russia as well as over the Azov Sea and the Russian-annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea.</li>\n<li>Russia carried out a “massive” drone attack on railway infrastructure in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said. Railway energy infrastructure was also targeted in the attack, Kuleba said.</li>\n<li>“The enemy is trying to stop train traffic,” Kuleba said, describing the attack as “another act of terrorism” against Ukrainian logistics.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military said it carried out a series of “successful” strikes in January on a launch site for Russian intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The strikes hit a complex of hangar-type buildings used for the prelaunch preparation of intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Ukraine’s General Staff said on Telegram without specifying the date of the attack.</li>\n<li>In his nightly address on Thursday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referred to the “good results” from the Security Service of Ukraine, singling out an attack by Ukrainian-made long-range Flamingo missiles on the testing ground for Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic missiles near the Caspian Sea.</li>\n<li>Starlink internet terminals used by Russian forces in Ukraine have been deactivated, Kyiv’s defence minister said.</li>\n<li>Russian military bloggers on Thursday reported sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, after network owner Elon Musk shut them down following a plea from Kyiv.</li>\n<li>At least nine bloggers close to the Russian army said connections had been lost, adding that this could weaken Moscow’s ability to wage drone warfare and hinder coordination between units. Moscow does not have a home-produced alternative to the satellite internet terminals.</li>\n<li>Ukraine is now registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Peace talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/russia-ukraine-talks-end-with-agreement-on-prisoner-swap\">Ukraine and Russia agreed</a> on Thursday, after two days of trilateral talks with the United States in Abu Dhabi, to hold further discussions in the coming weeks, according to a communique issued by Ukraine’s top negotiator. The communique expressed thanks to the United Arab Emirates for organising the meeting and to US President Donald Trump for “his leadership in advancing efforts to end the war”.</li>\n<li>Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the delegations from the US, Ukraine and Russia had <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/5/sorry-for-being-away-ukraine-russia-swap-prisoners-of-war\">agreed to an exchange of 314 prisoners of war</a>, which took place on Thursday. It was the first such swap in five months.</li>\n<li>Russia and Ukraine exchanged 157 prisoners of war each, the Russian Defence Ministry said. Three civilians from the Kursk region were also returned to Russia.</li>\n<li>President Zelenskyy said some of the released POWs had been held for nearly four years. He said the next round of talks would be held soon, likely in the US.</li>\n<li>Witkoff, writing on the X social media platform, said: “The discussions were constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace.”</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Poland is preparing a new 200 million zloty ($55.9m) aid package for Ukraine, mainly made up of armoured equipment, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday during a visit to Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Tusk also said that Poland could give Ukraine MiG-29 fighter jets at any time, but that Zelenskyy had told him Kyiv may need other air-defence equipment as a higher priority, and that he would discuss this with Polish officials and get back to the Ukrainian president.</li>\n<li>After his talks with Tusk, Zelenskyy repeated his pleas for air-defence missiles and said Kyiv was ready to swap its drones, in which it has become a global leader, for missiles from allies or for Poland’s Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets.</li>\n<li>Slovak prosecutors on Thursday shut down investigations initiated by Prime Minister Robert Fico’s government that claimed donations of fighter jets and air defence systems by the previous Slovak administration to Ukraine were a crime.</li>\n<li>Bratislava regional prosecutor Rastislav Remeta said that the dozen Soviet-era MiG-29 jets and the S-300 and KUB air defence systems donated to Ukraine were outdated, not fully operational and lacked missiles as well as pilots. He said their donation was not a crime, as alleged by Fico and his aides.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old Ukraine war.</li>\n<li>Bessent said he would consider new sanctions against Russia’s shadow fleet – a step Trump has not taken since returning to office in January 2025. “I will take it under consideration. We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal warned households that planned blackouts could worsen in the coming days and Russian forces could launch a new air attack to further disable power and heating networks.</li>\n<li>More than 200 emergency crews are at work in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv restoring heating to apartment buildings after a series of mass Russian attacks in January, the minister said.</li>\n<li>A Ukrainian power plant that was damaged in Russian strikes and that supplied heating to more than 1,100 apartment buildings in Kyiv may need two months to repair, Mayor Klitschko said. The Darnytsia thermal power plant, the capital’s most important, was battered in Russia’s massive barrage on Tuesday.</li>\n<li>Sweden’s government said it will provide aid to Ukraine’s energy system worth one billion Swedish crowns ($111.1m).</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russia is ready for international cooperation over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, including with the US, a senior Russian nuclear official was quoted as saying. But the facility must be Russian, said Alexei Likhachev, head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. Russian forces have controlled the plant in southern Ukraine since shortly after the start of the war in 2022.</li>\n<li>Russia has expelled a German diplomat in response to what it said was Berlin’s groundless expulsion of a Russian diplomat last month and accused Germany of being in the grip of “spy mania”.</li>\n<li>Trump said Thursday he was giving right-wing ally Prime Minister Viktor Orban his full-throated endorsement in Hungary’s upcoming general election.</li>\n<li>“Victor Orban is a true friend, fighter, and WINNER,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, adding he “has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election” as premier. Orban responded swiftly to Trump, posting on Facebook: “Thank you Mr President!”</li>\n</ul><h3>Regional security</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Trump has rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the New START treaty that held them in check for 15 years expired on Thursday.</li>\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to proposals from Russian President Vladimir Putin.</li>\n<li>Only about a third of countries attending a summit on the military use of artificial intelligence agreed on Thursday to a declaration on how to govern the deployment of AI technology in warfare, with China and the US opting out. Just 35 out of 85 countries attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI, according to reports.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

new website that he says will lower the cost of prescription medicines, which have long stood out for their sky-high prices in the US compared with similar products around the world.</p><p>Trump announced the launch of the new website called TrumpRx, which allows consumers to buy discounted drugs directly from pharma companies, at an event at the White House on Thursday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“People are going to save a lot of money and be healthy,” Trump said, stating that some of the world’s largest drug producers have agreed to bring down prices under “Most Favoured Nation” agreements in exchange for avoiding US tariffs.</p><p>The website is launching with savings on more than 40 popular drugs, the White House said.</p><p>Users can search the site for the medication they want, then print out a coupon and present it at a pharmacy to buy at the discounted price.</p><p>The Trump administration has pitched the initiative as a populist attack on powerful pharmaceutical companies amid growing discontent over the state of the economy.</p><p>A group of 16 drug companies have agreed to discount deals, under which they will offer lower prices for certain drugs to government programmes such as Medicaid and, via TrumpRx, to US consumers.</p><p>The TrumpRx site, which promises “the world’s lowest prices on prescription drugs”, showcases more than 40 medications, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, and calls the effort “the most impactful prescription price reset in the history of our country”.</p><p>“Thanks to President Trump, the days of Big Pharma price-gouging are over,” the website states.</p><p>But analysts <a href=\"/news/2025/10/3/what-is-trumps-new-trumprx-website-and-will-it-bring-medicine-prices-down\">have questioned</a> whether the effort will substantively address US drug prices or shake up the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“There is a real question about the value of this for people with insurance,” Juliette Cubanski, deputy director for Medicare policy at health policy organisation KFF, told the news agency Reuters.</p><p>“In some cases, we could be looking at out-of-pocket costs that are still relatively unaffordable for a lot of people,” Cubanski said.</p><p>TrumpRx is representative of the US president’s personalistic style of shaping policy, seeking to cut <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\">individual deals</a> to advance his own priorities rather than using traditional regulatory and legislative means.</p><p>A previous analysis by KFF stated that the details of the Most Favoured Nation agreements with the firms “remain confidential, which means that very little is known publicly about what exactly has been agreed to”.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies remain a powerful force in US politics, with the watchdog group <a

Other footage shows masked agents deploying chemical agents and beating civilians who were documenting their activities or protesting – activities protected under the US Constitution.</p><p>To protect civil liberties and avoid further bloodshed, Democrats on Wednesday night released a series of <a href=\"https://jeffries.house.gov/2026/02/04/leaders-jeffries-and-schumer-deliver-urgent-ice-reform-demands-to-republican-leadership/\">10 demands</a>.</p><p>Many pertain to agent transparency. One of the demands was a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, and another would require them to prominently display their identification number and agency.</p><p>Body cameras would also be mandated, though the Democrats clarified that the footage obtained through such devices should only be used for accountability, not to track protesters.</p><p>Other proposed rules would codify use-of-force policies in the Homeland Security Department and prohibit entry into households without a judicial warrant, as has been common practice under US law. They would also outlaw racial profiling as a metric for conducting immigration stops and arrests.</p><h2 id=\"political-battle-over-funding\">Political battle over funding</h2><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “astounded to hear” that Republicans considered the demands to be unreasonable.</p><p>“It’s about people’s basic rights. It’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. He called on Republicans to “explain why” they objected to such standards.</p><p>In a joint statement with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Schumer appealed to members of both parties to coalesce around what he described as common-sense guardrails.</p><p>“Federal immigration agents cannot continue to cause chaos in our cities while using taxpayer money that should be used to make life more affordable for working families,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote.</p><p>“It is critical that we come together to impose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people are demanding.”</p><p>Already, Democrats succeeded in separating Homeland Security funding from a spending bill passed on Tuesday to prevent a partial government shutdown.</p><p>Some Democrats and Republicans have pushed for a second split in order to vote on funding for ICE and CBP separately from FEMA and TSA spending.</p><p>But Republican leaders have opposed holding separate votes on those agencies, with Thune arguing it would amount to giving Democrats the ability to “defund law enforcement”.</p><p>Thune added that he would encourage Democrats to submit their reforms in legislation separate from Homeland Security funding.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the two parties can agree to a compromise before the February 13 deadline. Democrats, meanwhile, have continued to push for other measures, including the removal of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p></div></div></body></html>"

he wants negotiators from both countries to sit down and hammer out a new agreement, calling the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/last-us-russia-nuclear-treaty-is-expiring-does-it-really-matter\">old

we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump said on his social media network, Truth Social.</p><p>Trump has previously stated that he would like China to be involved in the new treaty, but authorities in Beijing have shown little interest in doing so.</p><p>The expiration of the New START pact means fewer limits on the massive nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, spurring concerns over a potential arms race at a time of resurgent anxiety over nuclear weapons.</p><p>Putin stated last year that he would abide by the treaty for another year if Washington would commit to doing the same.</p><p>The US, which has previously grumbled that the treaty limited its ability to deploy more missiles against Russia and China, has ignored the Russian offer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Moscow expressed regret on Thursday over the expiration of the treaty.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/russia-says-will-act-responsibly-despite-new-start-nuclear-treaty-expiry\">Russia</a> will continue with a “responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons”, adding that “of course, it will be guided primarily by its national interests”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said US and Russian delegations, who were in Abu Dhabi to discuss the war in Ukraine, reportedly also discussed extending the New START treaty for six months.</p><p>“It would be an informal handshake deal as the treaty itself doesn’t allow for any further extensions,” Rattansi said.</p><p>“Once that extension is in place, though, the aim is to begin formal discussions to craft an updated nuclear deal between the two countries,” he said.</p><p>Recent bouts of fighting between nuclear-armed states such as India and Pakistan have unnerved analysts, who worry about the erosion of taboos and treaties meant to restrain the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/5/4/putin-expresses-hope-that-nuclear-weapons-will-not-be-needed-in-ukraine\">Putin</a> also previously suggested that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to Western efforts to support Ukraine, causing alarm among observers.</p><p>The first START agreement was signed by the US and the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p><p>A treaty titled New START was signed by former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, limiting each country to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles and bombers deployed and ready for use.</p><p>That deal was extended for another five years in 2021, following an agreement between Putin and then US-President Joe Biden.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The opposition, however, obtained copies of nearly 80 percent of the tallies, which contradicted the government’s claims that Maduro had won a third six-year term.</p><p>After Maduro’s abduction last month, the remnants of his government remained in power.</p><p>Within days, his vice president – Delcy Rodriguez, the sister of the National Assembly leader – was sworn in as interim president.</p><p>She used her inaugural speech to denounce the “kidnapping of two heroes who are being held hostage: President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores”.</p><p>Rodriguez has nevertheless cooperated with US demands, including by supporting a bill to open Venezuela’s nationalised oil industry to foreign investment.</p><p>On the floor of the National Assembly on Thursday, her brother Jorge raised a photo of Chavez holding a crucifix while he spoke. Maduro’s son, National Assembly member Nicolas Maduro Guerra, also presented remarks.</p><p>“Venezuela cannot endure any more acts of revenge,” Maduro Guerra said as he appealed for “reconciliation”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-s-opposition-reacts\">Venezuela’s opposition reacts</h2><p>Still, opposition members in the National Assembly expressed optimism about the bill.</p><p>National Assembly representative Tomas Guanipa, for instance, called it the start of a “new, historic chapter” in Venezuelan history, one where political dissidents would no longer be “afraid to speak their minds for fear of being imprisoned”.</p><p>Nearly 7.9 million Venezuelans have left the country in recent decades, fleeing political persecution and economic instability.</p><p>But there have been lingering concerns about the human rights situation in Venezuela in the weeks following Maduro’s abduction – and <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/2/4/these-exiled-venezuelans-dream-of-returning-home-whats-stopping-them\">whether it is safe to return home</a>.</p><p>President Rodriguez has pledged to <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/2/venezuela-rights-activist-freed-after-amnesty-announcement\">release political detainees</a> and close the infamous El Helicoide prison, where reports of torture have emerged. But some experts say the number of people released does not match the number the government has reported.</p><p>The human rights group Foro Penal, for instance, has documented 383 releases since January 8.</p><p>That figure, however, is lower than the 900 political prisoners the government has claimed to have released. Foro Penal estimates 680 political prisoners remain in detention.</p><p>Opposition figures also allege that the government continues to intimidate and harass those who voice support for Maduro’s removal and other opinions that run contrary to the Chavismo movement.</p><p>Still, the head of Foro Penal, Alfredo Romero, applauded the initial passage of the amnesty law as a step forward.</p><p>“Amnesty is the framework that will ensure … that the past does not serve to halt or derail transition processes,” Romero told the news agency AFP.</p><p>A second vote is expected to be held on Tuesday next week.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Orban, for instance, has restricted asylum policies, and his government has been accused of investigating dissidents under the guise of rooting out threats to “national sovereignty”.</p><p>But there have been growing signs of discontent with those policies.</p><p>Despite a government ban on Pride events last year, tens of thousands of Hungarians rallied on the streets of Budapest in June, waving rainbow flags to show their support for the LGBTQ community. The march was considered one of the largest Hungary has seen in recent history.</p><p>The government, however, has taken punitive action in the aftermath of that march. Late last month, prosecutors <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/hungary-charges-budapest-mayor-for-allowing-banned-pride-march\">filed criminal charges</a> against Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony for organising the parade.</p><h2 id=\"support-for-right-wing-victories\">Support for right-wing victories</h2><p>Still, Trump has supported Orban and embraced his platform, while condemning other European countries for allegedly censoring right-wing voices.</p><p>Both leaders have both faced criticism for their nationalistic, anti-immigrant agenda, including comments that appear to demonise foreign nationals.</p><p>Trump recently hosted Orban at the White House in November, where their delegations discussed increasing trade between their two countries.</p><p>Orban’s visit to Washington, DC also included a sit-down with Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazil’s former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been convicted of plotting a coup.</p><p>Like Trump, Orban has publicly denounced the charges against the elder Bolsonaro as politically motivated. The former Brazilian president is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence.</p><p>“We stand firmly with the Bolsonaros in these challenging times — friends and allies who never give up,” Orban <a href=\"https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1986574557243711633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> online after the November 6 meeting. “Keep fighting: political witch-hunts have no place in democracy, truth and justice must prevail!”</p><p>More recently, Trump and Orban met again in Davos, Switzerland, where Trump invited Hungary to join his newly created Board of Peace.</p><p>Thursday’s endorsement from Trump is the latest example of the US president taking an active role in foreign elections.</p><p>In October, for instance, Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/14/not-going-to-waste-our-time-trump-hinges-us-aid-to-argentina-on-election\">threatened to withhold aid</a> from Argentina if its voters failed to back the party of libertarian President Javier Milei in its midterm elections.</p><p>Trump also extended financial support to Argentina in the lead-up to the race, which saw Milei’s party triumph.</p><p>Then, in November, Trump publicly backed the far-right candidate in Honduras’s election, once again threatening to sever aid if the election did not go his way. There, too, the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-backed-conservative-nasry-asfura-wins-honduras-election-authorities\">Trump-backed candidate won</a>.</p><p>Trump’s endorsements and threats, however, have raised concerns that the US might be using its economic heft and political influence <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/honduran-presidential-candidate-says-trump-interfered-in-election-report\">to influence elections</a> abroad, thereby undermining foreign democracies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Currently, the federal interest rate sits around 3.6 percent.</p><p>Experts say a sudden drop in that percentage could trigger a short-term market surge, as loans become cheaper and money floods the economy. But that excess cash could drive down the value of the dollar, leading to higher prices in the long term.</p><p>Traditionally, the Federal Reserve has served as an independent government agency, on the premise that monetary decisions for the country should be made without political interference or favour.</p><p>But Trump, a Republican, has sought to bring the Federal Reserve under his control, and his critics have accused him of using the threat of legal action to pressure Federal Reserve members to comply with his demands.</p><p>In August, for instance, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/17/us-fed-governor-cook-offers-detailed-defence-in-mortgage-fraud-case\">Lisa Cook</a> based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she has denied.</p><p>Cook had been appointed to the central bank by Trump’s predecessor and rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and she has accused Trump of seeking her dismissal on political grounds. The Supreme Court is currently <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\">hearing the case</a>.</p><p>Then, in early January, the Department of Justice opened a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\">criminal investigation</a> into Powell, echoing accusations Trump made, alleging that Powell had mismanaged renovations to the Federal Reserve building.</p><p>Powell issued a rare statement in response, accusing Trump of seeking to bully Federal Reserve leaders into compliance with his interest rate policy.</p><p>“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4290910\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4290910\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4290910\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-05T160559Z_378277446_RC2SFJAW0ATL_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-BESSENT-SENATE-1770314594.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Thom Tillis speaks on a Senate panel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4290910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is not seeking reelection, has been critical of the probe of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"bipartisan-scrutiny-of-powell-probe\">Bipartisan scrutiny of Powell probe</h2><p>Given the string of aggressive actions against Powell and Cook, Trump’s joke about suing Warsh fuelled rumours that the Federal Reserve’s independence could be in peril.</p><p>Within hours of making the joke on January 31, Trump himself faced questions about how serious he might have been.</p><p>“It’s a roast. It’s a comedy thing,” Trump said of his remarks as he spoke to reporters on Air Force One. “It was all comedy.”</p><p>Warren, however, pressed Bessent about Trump’s remarks and chided the Treasury chief for not rejecting them.</p><p>“I don’t think the American people are laughing,” Warren told Bessent. “They’re the ones who were struggling with the affordability.”</p><p>The prospect of Trump exerting undue influence over the Federal Reserve even earned a measure of bipartisan criticism during Thursday’s council meeting.</p><p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, opened his remarks to Bessent with a statement denouncing the probe into Powell, even though he acknowledged he was “disappointed” with the current Fed chair.</p><p>Still, Tillis emphasised his belief that Powell committed no crime, and that the investigation would discourage transparency at future Senate hearings.</p><p>He imagined future government hearings becoming impeded by legal formalities, for fear of undue prosecution.</p><p>“They’re going to be flanked with attorneys, and anytime that they think that they’re in the middle of a perjury trap, they’re probably just going to say, ‘I’ll submit it to the record after consultation with my attorneys,'” Tillis said, sketching out the scenario.</p><p>“Is that really the way we want oversight to go in the future?”</p><p>For his part, Bessent indicated that he backed the Federal Reserve’s long-term goal to keep interest rates at about 2 percent.</p><p>“It is undesirable to completely eliminate inflation,” Bessent said. “What is desirable is to get back to the Fed’s 2 percent target, and for the past three months, we’ve been at 2.1 percent.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4290944\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4290944\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4290944\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-05T152712Z_489764452_RC2RFJANFASG_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-BESSENT-SENATE-1770315394.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A screen shows Scott Bessent testifying at a Senate committee hearing.

The IRS itself was not the source of the leak, but rather a former government contractor named Charles Littlejohn, who was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><p>Bessent was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, though he currently serves both as the Treasury secretary and the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>Critics have argued that Trump’s lawsuit amounts to self-dealing: He holds significant sway over the Justice Department, which would defend the federal government against such lawsuits, and he could therefore green-light his own settlement package.</p><p>In Thursday’s exchange with Gallego, Bessent acknowledged that any damages paid to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.</p><p>“ Where would that $10bn come from?” Gallego asked.</p><p>“ It would come from Treasury,” Bessent replied. He then underscored that Trump has indicated any money would go to charity and that the Treasury itself would not make the decision to award damages.</p><p>Still, Gallego pressed Bessent, pointing out that the Treasury would ultimately have to disburse the funds — and that Bessent would be in charge of that decision.</p><p>That circumstance, Gallego argued, creates a conflict of interest, since Bessent is Trump’s political appointee and can be fired by the president.</p><p>“Have you recused yourself from any decisions about paying the president on these claims?” Gallego asked.</p><p>Bessent sidestepped the question, answering instead, “I will follow the law.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

By 2024, that number rose to 49.  But it was in 2025 – the year the siege reached its suffocating zenith – that the death toll exploded, reaching 422 deaths in a single year.</p><p>This represents a staggering 760 percent increase in starvation deaths in just 12 months.</p><p>UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qTyMV3sFSzw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Fakhri told</a> Al Jazeera in August 2025 that the global standard for famine analysis, known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), tends to be “conservative”.</p><p>“The reality on the ground was unequivocal. We raised the alarm when we started seeing the first children dying,” Fakhri explained, noting that the crisis met the strict technical <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/what-has-led-to-a-famine-being-confirmed-in-gaza\">criteria for famine</a>.</p><p>The Health Ministry in Gaza gave the breakdown of the victims: 40.63 percent were elderly (over 60), and 34.74 percent were children. In 2025 alone, cases among children under five spiked from 2,754 in January to 14,383 in August.</p><p>Legal experts said that what occurred in Gaza wasn’t just “food insecurity”; it met the strict technical criteria for famine, a designation often delayed by political bureaucracy.</p><p>“In the human rights community, we don’t wait as long … we don’t have to focus on measuring pain, suffering, and death,” Fakhri explained. “We raised the alarm when we started seeing the first children dying … because when a parent is holding their child in their arms, and that child is wasting away, that means an entire community is under attack.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3712352\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Interactive_Gaza_food_IPC_report_May13_2025-05-1747298369.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C963&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Gaza_food_IPC_report_May13_2025 starvation hunger famine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"anatomy-of-a-strategy\">Anatomy of a strategy</h2><p>Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and other parts of the occupied Palestinian territory have accused consecutive Israeli governments of a decades-old policy to use food and aid as a weapon of war.</p><p>Suleiman Basharat, a Palestinian commentator and researcher on Israeli affairs, traces this strategy to the blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel in 2007.</p><p>“It was based on the idea of starvation and narrowing daily life,” Basharat noted. This doctrine was infamously summarised in 2006 by <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/israeli-government-documents-show-deliberate-policy-to-restrict-food-to-gaza/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dov Weisglass</a>, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister, who said the goal was “to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger”, adding that the war marked a shift from “management” to “elimination”.</p><p>Senior Israeli ministers made their intentions clear at the very start of the genocidal war on Gaza. Former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had declared a complete siege against “<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2023/10/9/israeli-defence-minister-orders-complete-siege-on-gaza\">human animals</a>“.  His remarks were quickly reinforced by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who argued that blocking aid to Gaza was “<a href=\"/news/2024/8/8/palestine-urges-icc-arrest-warrant-for-smotrich-over-call-to-starve-gaza\">justified and moral</a>“, even if it meant starving millions.</p><p>Israel’s moves to ramp up this policy were thorough. Before the war on Gaza began in 2023, the United Nations said 500 trucks carrying aid and food were needed to keep the people in Gaza sustained.</p><p>But during the war, an average of 19 trucks a day were allowed in the Strip – a 96 percent reduction – which some Israeli media have referred to as the “calorie collapse”.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>The Calorie Collapse:</strong> Before the war, 500 trucks sustained Gaza daily. During the conflict, this dropped to an average of 19 trucks a day – a 96 percent reduction.</li>\n<li><strong>The Thirst War:</strong> Water availability plummeted from 84 litres per person to just 3 litres during the siege.</li>\n<li><strong>Scorched Earth:</strong> Israel systematically destroyed infrastructure for agricultural production. By August 2025, 90 percent of agricultural land was razed, 2,500 chicken farms were destroyed (killing 36 million birds), and the fishing port was obliterated.</li>\n</ul><p>“If Israel wanted to do it, every child in Gaza could have breakfast tomorrow,” de Waal observed. “All they need to do is to open the gates”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4039441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4039441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4039441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-02-1760613587.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-01-1760613556\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4039441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to food, people in Gaza witnessed a sharp decrease in water releases from Israel. Rights group Oxfam said that, 100 days into the “ceasefire”, Gaza is still deliberately deprived of water as aid groups are forced to scavenge under an illegal blockade.</p><p>Israel also employed a “<a href=\"/news/longform/2024/7/2/how-israel-destroyed-gazas-ability-to-feed-itself\">scorched earth</a>” policy, systematically destroying the infrastructure for agricultural production.</p><p>By August 2025, estimates suggest that the Israeli army had destroyed 90 percent of agricultural land and 2,500 chicken farms. The army focused its campaign on areas near the security barrier in the north, south and east of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The spokesperson for Gaza’s Ministry of Agriculture, Mohammed Abu Odeh, has warned that the Israeli army’s destruction and control of the farmland will affect the chain of food and supply of vegetables for nearly two million people in the Strip.</p><h2 id=\"the-illusion-of-aid\">The illusion of aid</h2><p>Palestinian officials and analysts suggest Israel has had a strategy of blocking aid and, at times, manipulating how it is delivered.</p><p>Political analyst Abdullah Aqrabawi told Al Jazeera Arabic that Israel and the US have tried to create their own aid-delivering system, such as the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/what-is-the-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-and-why-has-it-been-criticised\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF), but failed. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed at GHF sites trying to access food.</p><p>“The United States came with a pier and contracted companies … and failed,” Aqrabawi said. He noted that these initiatives were attempts to “support criminal pockets” or specific families to distribute aid, “thereby isolating Hamas – the resistance”.</p><h2 id=\"re-engineering-society\">Re-engineering society</h2><p>Analysts say that the starvation tactics were used, not just for military leverage, but also to create an “anti-resistance” sentiment in Gaza.</p><p>“The goal is to break the Palestinian resistance by affecting the social base that embraces it,” Basharat explained. He argues that Israel aimed to “re-engineer the Palestinian human” into a being whose sole cognitive focus is basic survival, rendering them incapable of political thought.</p><p>Analysts described a host of policies adopted by Israeli officials to push Palestinians out of Gaza, cloaking them in misleading terms, such as encouraging “<a href=\"/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza\">voluntary migration</a>“.</p><p>Israeli affairs expert Mohannad Mustafa said this was a cynical euphemism for forced displacement. “You starve the people, destroy the infrastructure … and in the end, you ask them: ‘Do you want to emigrate?'” Mustafa <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XDreVKe4mmM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Al Jazeera Arabic Channel. “This is forced displacement, not voluntary migration.”</p><p>Israeli rights activists have repeatedly pointed out the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to pressure people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to leave.</p><p>Alice Rothchild, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, described the policies as “humiliating mechanics”. She <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YeQD6spHyEU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed</a> how the system forced starving civilians to walk miles to feeding centres, “herding them into cages” to receive aid. “It’s all part of this attempt to destroy Gaza,” she said.</p><p><strong>Future defined by hunger</strong></p><p>Today, despite the ongoing Gaza “ceasefire” – which continues despite Israel’s regular attacks – the destruction of Gaza’s agricultural backbone means the Strip remains entirely dependent on external aid, giving Israel permanent control.</p><p>The 475 officially recorded deaths are merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>For many Palestinians, the war may be “paused” in theory, but for a generation of Palestinians, the man-made hunger, physical and political scars could take decades to heal.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title='\"Everyone in Gaza is starving\" | The Listening Post' src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YeQD6spHyEU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p></div></div></body></html>"
