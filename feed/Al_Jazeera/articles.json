Since the launch of Zepbound in late 2023, Lilly has gained more than 75 percent, compared with a more than 50 percent rise in the S&amp;P 500 over the same period.</p><p>In the latest reported quarter, Lilly posted combined revenue of more than $10.09bn from its obesity and diabetes portfolio, accounting for more than half of its total revenue of $17.6bn.</p><p>“They are doing so many things outside of obesity, but to suggest anything is driving share price beyond obesity at this point, I don’t know if that would be a factual statement,” said Kevin Gade, chief operating officer at Lilly shareholder Bahl and Gaynor, in advance of the milestone.</p><h2 id=\"sales-phenomenon\">‘Sales phenomenon’</h2><p>Wall Street estimates the weight-loss drug market to be worth $150bn by 2030, with Lilly and Novo together controlling the majority of projected global sales.</p><p>Investors are now focused on Lilly’s oral obesity drug, orforglipron, which is expected to be approved early next year.</p><p>In a note last week, Citi analysts said the latest generation of GLP-1 drugs have already been a “sales phenomenon”, and orforglipron is poised to benefit from the “inroads made by its injectable predecessors”.</p><p>Lilly’s recent <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/6/weight-loss-drug-makers-announce-pricing-agreement-with-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deal with the White House to cut prices for its weight-loss drugs</a>, as well as planned investments to expand drug production, augur well for its growth.</p><p>Lilly is starting to resemble the “Magnificent Seven” again, said James Shin, director of Biopharma Equity Research at Deutsche Bank, referring to the seven tech heavyweights, including Nvidia and Microsoft, that have powered much of the market’s returns this year.</p><p>At one point, investors viewed it as part of that elite group, but after some disappointing headlines and earnings, it slipped out of favour.</p><p>Now, however, it seems poised to rejoin that circle, possibly even as an alternative for investors, especially given recent concerns and weakness in some AI stocks, he added.</p><p>Still, analysts and investors are watching whether Lilly can sustain its current growth as prices of Mounjaro and Zepbound come under pressure, and whether its scale-up plans, along with its diversified pipeline and dealmaking, will offset margin pressure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">The frameworkd agreement</a> was the latest in a series of documents signed in recent months as part of efforts, backed by the United States and Qatar, to end decades of fighting in eastern DRC that has been an enduring threat to regional stability.</p><p>The framework was described by the US and Qatari officials as an important step towards peace, but one of many that lie ahead.</p><p>Sheikh Tamim arrived in the DRC a day after visiting Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.</p><p>Rwanda has long denied allegations that it has helped M23, which has seized more territory in the DRC than it has ever previously held.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, reporting from Kinshasa, said the emir wrapped his brief state visit to the country after meeting the Congolese president at the airport and then at the presidential palace.</p><p>Vall said that Qatar signed a number of protocols on economic and political cooperation with the DRC.</p><p>He also said, “The emir of Qatar has made his first stop in Kigali overnight, before he arrived here this morning, and the understanding is that that’s a symbolic move to link the two capitals and show that there is no alternative to rapprochement between the two countries.”</p><p>Qatar’s acting charge d’affaires in the capital Kinshasa, Shafi bin Newaimi al-Hajri, said Sheikh Tamim’s visit to the DRC was of special importance for bilateral relations.</p><p>Al-Hajri said diplomatic ties between the sides expanded in recent years, noting that a DRC embassy was opened in Doha in 2022 and Qatar opened its mission in Kinshasa in May 2025.</p><p>Al-Hajri also stressed that Qatar’s mediation efforts aimed at stabilising eastern DRC played a key role in strengthening dialogue between the two governments.</p><h2 id=\"trade-of-barbs\">Trade of barbs</h2><p>In eastern DRC, violence has continued despite the various diplomatic processes in Washington and Doha, with Congolese authorities and M23 trading blame for violating the principles of earlier agreements and deliberately delaying <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/dr-congo-m23-rebels-resume-talks-in-qatar-after-renewed-violence-in-east\">talks</a>.</p><p>And the prolonged negotiations do not address the threat from a multitude of other armed groups operating in the volatile east.</p><p>M23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.</p><p>The two sides <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\">agreed</a> in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.</p><p>The July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier,

Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">Eurovision </a><a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">singing contest</a> and European football have lost momentum.</p><p>On Monday, Germany announced it was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/germany-lifts-curbs-on-arms-exports-to-israel-citing-gaza-ceasefire\">lifting restrictions</a> on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.</p><p>“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.</p><p>Jubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza <a href=\"/news/2019/3/30/gazas-great-march-of-return-protests-explained\">from 2006 onwards</a> enabled the genocide.</p><p>“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Despite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.</p><p>“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.</p><p>“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly all of the fishermen, along with their families and descendants, have now returned to European shores, but the statue of the Virgin remained – and, every year on August 15, it is carried in procession out of the church.</p><p>“It’s a unique event,” Hatem Bourial, a Tunisian journalist and radio presenter, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He went on to describe how, in the procession’s heyday in the early 20th century, native Tunisians, Muslims and Jews alike, would join Tunisian-Sicilian Catholics in carrying the statue of the Virgin Mary from the church down to the sea.</p><p>There, participants would ask Mary to bless the fishermen’s boats. Many residents would shout “Long live the Virgin of Trapani!”, Bourial said, while others threw their chechia, a traditional red cap worn in the Maghreb, in the air.</p><p>As well as its religious significance – for Catholics, August 15 marks the day that Mary was taken up into heaven – the feast also coincides with the Italian mid-August holiday of Ferragosto, which traditionally signals the high point of the summer.</p><p>Silvia Finzi, born in Tunis in the 1950s to Italian parents, described how, after the statue had been brought down to the sea, many of La Goulette’s residents would declare that the worst of the punishingly hot Tunisian summer was over.</p><p>“Once the Virgin had been taken down to the water, it was as if the sea had changed”, Finzi, a professor of Italian at the University of Tunis, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“People would say ‘the sea has changed, the summer’s over’, and you wouldn’t need to go swimming to cool down any more”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1763692311.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Canal port of La Goulette, late 19th century\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The canal port of La Goulette, in the late 19th century [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"european-exodus\">European exodus</h2><p>The first European immigrants began to arrive in La Goulette in the early 19th century. Their numbers rapidly increased after 1881, when Tunisia became a French protectorate. At its height in the early 1900s, the number of Italian immigrants – who were largely Sicilians – across the whole of Tunisia is estimated to have been more than 100,000.</p><p>In the decade after 1956, when Tunisia gained its independence from France, the vast majority of its European residents left the country, as the new government pivoted towards nationalism.</p><p>In 1964, the Vatican signed an agreement with Tunisia, transferring control of the majority of the country’s churches – now largely empty – to the government for use as public buildings. The agreement also put an end to all public Christian celebrations, including the procession in La Goulette.</p><p>For more than half a century, August 15 was marked only with a Mass inside the church building, and the statue of Our Lady of Trapani remained immobile in its niche. The date remained important for La Goulette’s much-reduced Catholic population, but it largely ceased to be an important event for the wider community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120855\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120855\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3419-1763692569.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Catholic Church Saint Augustine-and Saint-Fidèle\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Catholic Church of Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele [Joseph Tulloch/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nostalgia\">Nostalgia</h2><p>In 2017, the Catholic Church received permission to restart the procession, initially just inside the church compound. This year, when Al Jazeera visited, the procession left the church property but only travelled as far as the square outside.</p><p>Many attendees were young Tunisian Muslims, with little connection to La Goulette’s historic Sicilian population.</p><p>A major reason for this is undoubtedly the high status accorded to the Virgin Mary in Islam – an entire chapter of the Quran is dedicated to her.</p><p>Other participants seemed to be drawn by a feeling of nostalgia for La Goulette’s multiethnic, multireligious past.</p><p>“I love the procession”, Rania, 26, told Al Jazeera. “Lots of people have forgotten about it now, but European immigration is such an important part of Tunisia’s history”.</p><p>Rania, a student, told Al Jazeera of her love for the 1996 film, Un ete a La Goulette (A Summer in La Goulette).</p><p>Featuring dialogue in three languages, and evocative shots of sunlit courtyards and shimmering beaches, the film is an ode to La Goulette’s past.</p><p>Directed by the renowned Tunisian filmmaker Ferid Boughedir, it follows the lives of three teenage girls – Gigi, a Sicilian, Meriem, a Muslim, and Tina, a Jew – over the course of a summer in the 1960s.</p><p>The film ends, however, on a bleak note, with the outbreak of the 1967 War between Israel and several Arab states, and the subsequent departure of almost all of Tunisia’s remaining Jewish and European residents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120861\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120861\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-1763692837.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C506&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette, 1950s\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette in the 1950s [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"new-migrations\">New migrations</h2><p>As Tunisia’s European population declined, the country has seen an influx of new migrant communities from sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The majority of these new migrants, who number in the tens of thousands, hail from Francophone West Africa. Many come to Tunisia in search of work; others hope to find passage across the Mediterranean to Europe.</p><p>Many of the sub-Saharan migrants – who face <a href=\"/news/2023/7/14/black-tunisians-lie-low-violence-against-black-people-worsens\">widespread discrimination in Tunisia</a> – are Christian, and as a result, they now make up the vast majority of Tunisia’s churchgoing population.</p><p>This fact is reflected in a mural in the church in La Goulette, inspired by the feast of Our Lady of Trapani. Painted in 2017, it depicts the Virgin Mary sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.</p><p>The air around the Virgin in the mural is full of passports. The church’s priest, Father Narcisse, who hails from Chad, told Al Jazeera that these represent the documents that immigrants throw into the sea while making the journey from North Africa to Europe in the hope of evading deportation.</p><p>The mural highlights the fact that the Madonna of Trapani, once considered the protector of Sicilian fishermen, is today called upon by immigrants of far more varied backgrounds.</p><p>“This celebration, in its original form, marked the deep bonds between the two shores of the Mediterranean,” Archbishop of Tunis Nicolas Lhernould told Al Jazeera. “Today, it brings together a more diverse group – Tunisians, Africans, Europeans; locals, migrants, and tourists.”</p><p>“Mary herself was a migrant,” Archbishop Lhernould said, referring to the New Testament story which narrates Mary’s flight, together with the child Jesus and her husband Joseph, from Palestine to Egypt.</p><p>From a Christian perspective, he suggested, “we are all migrants, just passing through, citizens of a kingdom which is not of this world”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120866\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120866\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3658-1763692934.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A mural of the Virgin Mary with migrants and passports around her\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A mural of the Virgin Mary in the Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele church sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians, and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.

The vast majority of these structures – modest buildings built by the newly-arrived fishermen – have been torn down and replaced, and little more than the church remains to testify to the area’s once significant Sicilian presence.</p><p>As of 2019, there were only 800 Italians descended from the original immigrant community left in the whole of Tunisia.</p><p>“There are so few of us left”, said Rita Strazzera, who was born in Tunis to Sicilian parents. The Tunisian-Sicilian community meets very rarely, she explained, with some members coming together for the celebration on the 15th August, and holding occasional meetings in a small bookshop opposite the church.</p><p>Still, the spirit of Little Sicily has not entirely vanished. Traces of the old La Goulette linger – in memory, in film, and, Strazzera told Al Jazeera, in other, more surprising ways as well.</p><p>“Every year, on All Saints’ Day, I go to the graveyard”, said Strazzera, referring to the annual celebration when Catholics remember their deceased loved ones.</p><p>“And there are Tunisians there, Muslims, people who maybe had a Sicilian parent, or a Sicilian grandparent, and have come to visit their graves, because they know it’s what Catholics do.”</p><p>“There have been lots of mixed marriages”, Strazzera added, “and so, every year, there are more of them visiting the graves.

LOCK THEM UP???”</p><p>An hour later, Trump appeared to suggest sentencing the Democrat lawmakers to death because of their behaviour and wrote on Truth Social: SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Asked by White House reporters if the president would actually sentence the congresspeople to death, press secretary Leavitt said, “No.”</p><p>However, she insisted that none of the President’s orders or policies so far had been against the law.</p><p>“Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander-in-chief and through this chain of command – through the secretary of war – is lawful,” she told a news briefing on Thursday.</p><p>“We do things by the books. And to suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do,” she said, adding that the Democrats “should be held accountable” for “their dangerous rhetoric”.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-mean-by-illegal-orders\">What do Democrats mean by ‘illegal orders’?</h2><p>The six Democrats did not specify which orders they were referring to as being “illegal” or against the Constitution.</p><p>Before Trump responded to the video, Republican Representative of Arizona Eli Crane <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385324906112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Fox News that if the Democrats could not “name the unlawful orders”, it would be cowardly.</p><p>“If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” he said.</p><p>In a separate segment of Fox News, also on Thursday, anchor Martha MacCallum grilled Colorado Democratic Representative Crow about what orders they considered illegal.</p><p>Referring to the unrest which took place after the killing of Black man George Floyd by a police officer in 2020 during Trump’s first term as president, Crow responded, “The protests at Lafayette Square, where he said, ‘Can’t you just shoot them in the legs or something’, that’s his direct quote.”</p><p>MacCallum said it was not an order, but “a comment”.</p><p>Crow replied: “That’s coming from the president of the US to your generals … he’s also threatened to send the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/chicago-braces-for-possible-national-guard-deployment-what-we-know\">military into Chicago</a> and other cities and go to war with those cities. That is a very disturbing thing.”</p><p>Crow added that Trump had also alluded to sending troops to polling stations during elections and said that would be a violation of US law.</p><p>“US criminal law prohibits troops from going to polling stations,” he added.</p><p></p><p>In a separate post on X on Wednesday, Crow pointed out that the recent <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">US bombing campaign</a> of alleged Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/can-us-strikes-on-suspected-drug-boats-off-venezuela-be-legally-justified\">drug trafficking boats</a> in the Caribbean Sea also violates US law.</p><p>“The President is trampling on the Constitution,” Crow wrote. “Stop politicizing our troops. Stop illegal military strikes. Stop pitting our servicemembers against the American people.”</p><p></p><p>More than 60 people have been killed in US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said: “These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.”</p><p>The Trump administration has argued that the strikes are necessary for anti-drug and counterterrorism operations, but Volker added that operations to counter illicit drug trafficking must adhere to international law.</p><p>“Under international human rights law, the intentional use of lethal force is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life,” he said and called on the US to stop what he said were “extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats”.</p><p>In a joint statement late on Thursday, the Democrats in the video <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1991568438804763103?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>: “No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”</p><p>“What’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” they said and added that Americans should unite and “condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence”.</p><p>“This is a time for moral clarity. In these moments, fear is contagious, but so is courage. We will continue to lead and will not be intimidated. Don’t Give Up the Ship!”</p><p></p><p>Referring to Trump’s threats against them, Pennsylvania Representative Deluzio told US broadcaster NBC News on Thursday: “It’s a dark day in the country for any president to say such a thing.”</p><p>“We have to end this scourge. And yet Donald Trump is the person with the most power who can bring the temperature down, and instead, he threatens to have us killed,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the Senate on Thursday that what the president wrote “is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious”.</p><p>“When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen,” Schumer added. “He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-us-military-oath-of-enlistment-say-about-following-legal-and-illegal-orders\">What does the US military oath of enlistment say about following legal and illegal orders?</h2><p>Article 92 of the US Uniform Code of Military Justice states that any person who “violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation” or has “knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces” and fails to obey it, or “is derelict in the performance of his duties”, shall be punished.</p><p>The US Code of Military Justice is a federal law enacted in 1951 and applies to all active armed forces members, armed forces students, as well as active National Guard members.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ucmjlaw.com/courts-martial/military-crimes/failure-to-obey-order-or-regulation/#:~:text=An%20experienced%20military%20defense%20lawyer,for%20up%20to%206%20months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to</a> the office of US Attorney Peter Kageleiry Jr, who specialises in military law, failure to obey lawful orders can lead to punishments like “dishonourable discharge (from duty) and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.”</p><p>However, an order is considered unlawful if it violates the US Constitution.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-given-any-illegal-orders\">Has Trump given any illegal orders?</h2><p>It is debatable. Some judges have said some of Trump’s policies or orders in the recent past do violate US law.</p><p>Earlier this month, federal Judge Karin Immergut <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/us-judge-rules-trump-illegally-ordered-national-guard-troops-to\">ruled</a> that Trump had unlawfully ordered National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.</p><p>Immergut, a Trump appointee, rejected the administration’s claim that protesters at an immigration detention facility were waging a rebellion that legally justified sending troops.</p><p>On Friday this week, federal Judge Jia Cobb said Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/can-donald-trump-take-federal-control-of-washington-dc\">military takeover</a> of Washington, DC, in August – to combat violent crime there, he said – violates the Constitution and ordered the president to end the deployment of troops there.</p><p>Cobb ruled that the president cannot deploy soldiers for “whatever reason” he wants, and gave his administration 21 days to appeal the order before it goes into effect.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In October, a federal judge in Chicago temporarily blocked Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/8/trump-calls-to-jail-chicago-mayor-illinois-governor-in-immigration-dispute\">deployment of hundreds</a> of National Guard soldiers in Illinois. That ruling was upheld by the Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit later in the month.</p><p>In response, Trump threatened to use the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority\">Insurrection Act</a> to send soldiers to US cities, as the states of Illinois and Oregon continue to fight federal military deployments in court.</p><p>“We have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.</p><p>Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said the maritime strikes on Venezuelan boats by US forces amount to “extrajudicial killings”.</p><p>“US officials cannot summarily kill people they accuse of smuggling drugs,” said Sarah Yager, Washington director at HRW. “The problem of narcotics entering the United States is not an armed conflict, and US officials cannot circumvent their human rights obligations by pretending otherwise.”</p><p>Salvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University, told Al Jazeera in October that under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the use of force by one state against another is prohibited except when authorised by the UN Security Council or exercised in legitimate self-defence under Article 51.</p><p>And the US claim that strikes against “drug traffickers” near Venezuela amount to self-defence “appears legally untenable”, Regilme said.</p><p>But Trump has often indicated that he considers himself above the law.</p><p>In February, he wrote on X: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”</p><p></p><p>In April 2020, during his first term as president, when the US was under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump told reporters that only he and no public health expert or local leader had the authority to lift lockdown orders.</p><p>“When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be … It’s total,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For far too long, African youth have been told that democracy is something imported, something borrowed, something foreign to their identity. But history gives us a very different truth. Democracy is not an idea that arrived from the West. It is a human idea. And Africa practised it long before modern states existed.</p><p>Africa’s democratic inheritance is older than the colonial borders that sliced the continent into fragments. In the Somali shir, every man could stand, argue, and vote in open councils that decided collective affairs. The Oromo Gadaa system developed rotating leadership and fixed term limits centuries before they became fashionable anywhere else. Igbo communities governed through village assemblies that rejected kings and insisted on consensus. The Ashanti used councils of elders to check the power of chiefs and remove them when they broke trust. In Botswana, the Tswana kgotla provided public debate forums where leaders listened more than they spoke. These systems did not look identical to modern democracies, but the principle was unmistakable: power must serve the community, and the community must hold power accountable.</p><p>Democratic ideas are not confined to any one civilisation. Ancient Athens developed its own form of citizen rule. Islamic governance emphasised shura, consultation. Confucian models in East Asia built a meritocratic civil service long before Europe did. And when modern democracy regained momentum in the 18th century, America made a historic contribution by not only establishing it but sustaining it through institutions that could survive war, crisis, and political division. That legacy is real and should never be dismissed. But democracy’s story is not Western. It is human. And Africa’s contribution to it is undeniable.</p><p>Today, young Africans face a new challenge. They are living in the attention economy, where anger spreads faster than reason and where misinformation travels in seconds. This environment creates enormous pressure on leaders to react rather than reflect. It rewards the strongman’s sprint instead of the institution’s marathon. But democracies win marathons, not sprints. The short-term appeal of authoritarian certainty can never match the long-term stability of accountable institutions. Africa cannot afford to trade long-term freedom for short-term frustration.</p><p>Modern African societies are not starting from zero. Botswana’s democratic resilience, Senegal’s peaceful transfers of power, Ghana’s strengthening institutions, and Kenya’s judicial independence show that African democracies can adapt, evolve, and correct themselves. At the same time, other countries face real challenges: contested elections, corruption, political exclusion, and the weaponisation of identity. Naming these problems honestly is not a weakness. It is how democracies grow.</p><p>Reclaiming democracy today must also mean expanding it. The systems of the past often excluded women and marginalised groups. A modern African democracy must belong equally to women, young people, minorities, and all those whose voices were historically silenced. Reclaiming an inheritance does not mean returning to the past. It means carrying it forward with greater justice.</p><p>Technology is Africa’s new multiplier. Artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and open learning resources can give young Africans something no previous generation ever had: the ability to learn globally and compete globally without asking permission from any gatekeeper. Connectivity is still uneven. Infrastructure is still expensive. Policies lag behind innovation. But the potential is unmistakable. Every major leap in human history rewarded the adopters: the printing press, steam power, electricity, the green revolution, the internet, and now AI. Africa has a young population. If it embraces AI early, with strong civic values and clear safeguards, the continent can achieve a leap no region has ever achieved.</p><p>Democracy is not protected by slogans. It is protected by habits. Young Africans can strengthen democracy not only in elections but in everyday practice. Reviving local consultative forums. Creating student parliaments. Running community debates. Challenging misinformation. Defending independent journalism. Building digital literacy campaigns. These small habits create big cultures. And perhaps most importantly, Africans must reject the narrative that democracy belongs to somebody else. Authoritarianism is not African. Silence is not African. The continent’s heritage is debate, dialogue, consensus, accountability, and community decision-making. To reclaim democracy is to reclaim what Africa has always known: that power must be held in trust, not taken by force.</p><p>The future belongs to the young. If African youth defend their voice, their freedom, their diversity, their truth, and their dignity, they will build institutions stronger than any individual. They will build a continent where unity does not erase nations and where sovereignty does not silence citizens. A continent where Africa rises not as a copy of another model but as itself. Democracy is not something Africa must borrow. It is something Africa is ready to lead.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The plan, which has been heavily criticised as far too favourable to Russia by many observers, is in its draft stage and has yet to be made public. However, a Ukrainian official is understood to have provided the details to international media.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Here is a closer look at the points and the significance of this plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-28-points-of-trump-s-proposal-for-ukraine\">What are the 28 points of Trump’s proposal for Ukraine?</h2><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">2. A comprehensive, non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighbouring countries and NATO will not expand further.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the US, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">6.

Ukraine is eligible for European Union (EU) membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the EU market while this issue is being considered.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">12. A powerful global package of measures will be provided to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centres and artificial intelligence.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The US will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernise and operate Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Joint efforts to rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction and modernisation of cities and residential areas.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Infrastructure development.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Extraction of minerals and natural resources.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The World Bank will develop a special financing package to accelerate these efforts.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The lifting of sanctions will be discussed and agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis.</li>\n<li>The US will enter into a long-term economic cooperation agreement for mutual development in the areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities.</li>\n<li>Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">14.

Europe will add $100bn to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">16. Russia will enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">17.

Both countries undertake to implement educational programmes in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Ukraine will adopt EU rules on religious tolerance and the protection of linguistic minorities.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">All Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibited.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">21. Territories:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian, including by the US.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact, which will mean de facto recognition along the line of contact.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Russia will relinquish other agreed territories it controls outside the five regions.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">22. After agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Any security guarantees will not apply in the event of a breach of this commitment.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">23. Russia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnipro River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">24.

Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">26. All parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">27. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN \">28. Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-ukraine-reacted-to-these-proposals\">How has Ukraine reacted to these proposals?</h2><p>Zelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.</p><p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan\">said</a> in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”</p><p>Zelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”</p><p>The Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mean-ukraine-and-its-allies-will-accept-the-proposal\">Does this mean Ukraine and its allies will accept the proposal?</h2><p>No.</p><p>“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.</p><p>While European leaders have not reacted to the 28-point plan, they have indicated that they would not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such concessions.</p><p>“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”</p><p>For now, Ukraine’s allies are not commenting. European Council President Antonio Costa said that the EU has not yet been officially informed about the US plan, so “it makes no sense to comment” on it.</p><p>More reactions from Europe might come starting from Saturday, when Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak at the G20 summit.</p><p>“A 28-point plan was made public. We will discuss the situation both with European leaders and with leaders here on the sidelines of the G20,” von der Leyen said, according to UK media.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-russia-and-the-us-saying-about-this-plan-now\">What are Russia and the US saying about this plan now?</h2><p>The US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.</p><p>Russia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.</p><p>“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.</p><p>In an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.</p><p>“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-do-analysts-say-about-these-proposals\">What do analysts say about these proposals?</h2><p>Experts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.</p><p>“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.</p><p>For instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.</p><p>Giles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-us-be-compensated-for-security-guarantees\">How would the US be ‘compensated’ for security guarantees?</h2><p>It is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.</p><p>Point 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.</p><p>Point 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.</p><p>The plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.</p><p>The plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.</p><p>Giles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>In October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.</p><p>Giles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.</p><p>Giles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.</p><p>However, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.</p><h2 id=\"would-the-proposal-give-russia-amnesty-for-war-crimes\">Would the proposal give Russia amnesty for war crimes?</h2><p>Point 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.</p><p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href=\"/news/2023/3/17/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-russias-putin-over-ukraine-crimes\">issued an arrest warrant</a> for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.</p><p>The US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.</p><p>“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.</p><p>He added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.</p><p>“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.</p><h2 id=\"what-territory-would-ukraine-have-to-concede\">What territory would Ukraine have to concede?</h2><p>The plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.</p><p>Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.</p><p>Crimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.</p><p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Russia also controls 75 percent of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/russia-gains-ground-in-zaporizhzhia-in-southeastern-ukraine\">Zaporizhia</a> and <a href=\"/features/2025/9/15/russian-occupiers-brought-death-and-intimidation-to-kherson-ukrainian-teen\">Kherson</a> in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. The plan says that the current battle lines will be frozen in these regions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1763294067.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1763294067\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-would-russia-be-brought-back-into-the-international-fold\">How would Russia be brought back into the international fold?</h2><p>Parts of the proposal aim to bring Russia out of the isolation imposed on it by the Western world since it started the Ukraine war.</p><p>Point 12 states that Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.</p><p>The G8 – <a href=\"/news/2025/6/15/g7-summit-who-is-attending-and-whats-on-the-agenda\">currently the G7</a> – was an unofficial forum for the leaders of eight major industrialised nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.</p><p>Russia was part of the G8 but was ejected following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p><p>The plan also mentions the establishment of a US-Russian investment vehicle that would implement joint projects in specific areas.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In an astonishing victory, 34-year-old state legislator <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/zohran-mamdani-elected-as-new-york-mayor-in-historic-win\">Zohran Mamdani won</a> New York City’s mayoral election. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07-V2rCebw\">Defeating</a> former state Governor Andrew Cuomo, who enjoyed strong backing from US President Donald Trump and the political establishment, Mamdani became the city’s first Muslim immigrant mayor and its youngest in more than a century. The democratic socialist’s victory sent shock waves through national politics, emboldening progressives across the country to run and to win on agendas as unapologetically ambitious as the moment demands.</p><p>Campaigning across the city, Mamdani reached out to various social groups, including African Americans, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, East Africans and South Asians, and especially the youth, many of whom had grown politically disengaged after the Democratic Party’s demoralising performance in recent years. He brought people back into the political process, mobilising voters who otherwise might have stayed home.</p><p>Running on a platform calling for a more equitable distribution of wealth through higher taxes on the super-wealthy, a more affordable and accessible housing market, a free and faster public bus system, and universal, no-cost childcare for children from six weeks to five years old, Mamdani has brought into the mainstream a political discourse centred on equity, one the nation has arguably not witnessed since Eugene V Debs, the early 20th-century socialist organiser and five-time presidential candidate who championed workers’ rights and economic justice.</p><p>When asked live on television what “democratic socialist” means, Mamdani replied: “When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’”</p><p>But what, really, is “democratic socialism”? To many, the term “socialism” evokes the economic system of the former Soviet Union, characterised by inefficient allocation of resources, state control and ownership of productive assets, and political repression under a brutally totalitarian regime. Yet that is not what socialism means.</p><p>As the late Erik Olin Wright, one of the most influential sociologists of the past half-century and a pioneering scholar of class analysis in capitalism, detailed, what was practised by the Soviet Union was not socialism but “statism”, an economic system in which state incumbents control investment and production through a centralised planning <a href=\"https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/sage_wright_presidential_address.pdf\">apparatus</a>. Indeed, in common parlance, most people use the term “socialism” to describe what is most accurately referred to as statism.</p><p>Over the past century, struggles for more equal alternatives to capitalism have been waged under the banner of “socialism”. Yet the term itself has long been contested, its precise meaning the subject of intense debate both within and without the academic and policy circles.</p><p>If nothing else, Karl Marx himself saw socialism as grounded in two essential principles. First, it required the democratisation of not only political life, which refers to the procedural democracy exercised in most developed countries, but also economic life, so that ordinary workers have a voice in how economic resources are distributed. Second, socialism envisioned a reduction in working hours, so that people could cultivate their creative capacities outside the workplace. Indeed, Marx’s critique of capitalism stemmed largely from his belief that it curtails “human flourishing and self-actualisation”.</p><p>Yet the socialist experiments of the 19th and 20th centuries across the world bore no resemblance to these humanistic ideals. Socialism, once seen as an economic system that would extend democracy into realms capitalism would never allow, turned into a centralised, grossly inefficient, and authoritarian state apparatus of command and control of both the economy and society. Soviet-style dictatorships rife with corruption and venality turned socialism into a vehicle for state domination rather than human liberation. With shortages, rationing, and long lines in stores, socialism came to be seen by the 1980s as a failed project of social transformation in the places where it was implemented.</p><p>So, what is “democratic socialism”?</p><p>The term is composed of two words: “democratic” and “socialism”. Democracy is fundamentally a socialist principle. Indeed, democracy is the most effective political mechanism we know for ensuring that the state serves as an agent of the people. If “democracy” is the term to signify the subordination of state power to people’s power, “socialism” is the term to signify the subordination of economic power to people’s power. In democratic socialism, control over investment and production is organised through genuinely democratic means. The central moral objective of democratic socialism is that a national economy should be organised in such a way as to serve the needs and aspirations of ordinary people, not those of elites.</p><p>Democratic socialism thus represents an attempt to reconcile the egalitarian goals of socialism with the institutions of liberal democracy. It envisions an economy where markets still allocate resources, but the ownership of productive assets and the distribution of wealth are subject to participatory and democratic decision-making. The goal is not to abolish markets, but to make them answer to the public, to ensure that economic outcomes reflect shared values rather than private power.</p><p>It is now well understood that capitalism grants prosperity to some while consigning many others to <a href=\"https://www.aacademica.org/erik.olin.wright/11.pdf\">poverty</a>. It denies the conditions for genuine human flourishing and development from vast segments of the world’s population, even within the most advanced economies. “Freedom of choice,” often celebrated by capitalism’s defenders as its central moral virtue, is in fact only partial. The stark inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity that capitalism produces narrow what might be called “real freedom”: the genuine ability of people to pursue their life plans and act on the choices that truly matter to them.</p><p>The promise of democratic socialism is not simply greater equality, but greater freedom. Its goal is to give all people the ability to truly shape their own lives. That’s what Zohran Mamdani’s platform represents. His policies, such as a rent freeze, fare-free buses and universal childcare, are not merely economic measures; they are instruments of real freedom for ordinary people. When most of one’s paycheque disappears into rent, freedom is constrained. Housing stability helps people feel secure, make long-term plans, and avoid the stress of potential eviction. Housing stability is tied to human dignity. Fare-free public transit extends the freedom of mobility across the city. Free buses make mobility a right, not a privilege, and open up the physical and social space of freedom itself. And universal childcare liberates parents, especially women, from an impossible trade-off between childcare and participation in society. When the burden of childcare is shared by society, everyone gains the freedom to work, study, and engage in public life on equal terms. These policies redefine freedom not as the privilege of the few to accumulate without limit, but as the shared capacity of all to live with security, opportunity, and power over their own lives. That is the freedom democracy promises, and the one democratic socialism delivers.</p><p>Among capitalist countries today, the social democracies of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) come closest to the ideals of democratic socialism. A much stronger working class, and its insistence on a firm commitment to social welfare over the narrow interests of elites, has long distinguished these nations from other varieties of capitalism. Yet in social democracies, <a href=\"https://fabianpfeffer.com/wp-content/uploads/PfefferWaitkus2021.pdf\">wealth inequality</a> remains strikingly high, despite a more even distribution of income compared to the other parts of the developed world.</p><p>Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City is a glimmer of hope that democratic processes can still serve the many rather than the few. His equity-centred platform, once dismissed as naive, won the confidence of a diverse majority yearning for justice and dignity. That victory, achieved in the face of relentless racism and Islamophobia, marks a collective triumph.</p><p>Yet elections are only beginnings. The hard work now lies ahead: translating promises into policy and hope into tangible change for a more humane and equal distribution of economic resources. The people have spoken; now it is time to deliver.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
