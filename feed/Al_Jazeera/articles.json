By 2024, that number rose to 49.  But it was in 2025 – the year the siege reached its suffocating zenith – that the death toll exploded, reaching 422 deaths in a single year.</p><p>This represents a staggering 760 percent increase in starvation deaths in just 12 months.</p><p>UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qTyMV3sFSzw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Fakhri told</a> Al Jazeera in August 2025 that the global standard for famine analysis, known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), tends to be “conservative”.</p><p>“The reality on the ground was unequivocal. We raised the alarm when we started seeing the first children dying,” Fakhri explained, noting that the crisis met the strict technical <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/what-has-led-to-a-famine-being-confirmed-in-gaza\">criteria for famine</a>.</p><p>The Health Ministry in Gaza gave the breakdown of the victims: 40.63 percent were elderly (over 60), and 34.74 percent were children. In 2025 alone, cases among children under five spiked from 2,754 in January to 14,383 in August.</p><p>Legal experts said that what occurred in Gaza wasn’t just “food insecurity”; it met the strict technical criteria for famine, a designation often delayed by political bureaucracy.</p><p>“In the human rights community, we don’t wait as long … we don’t have to focus on measuring pain, suffering, and death,” Fakhri explained. “We raised the alarm when we started seeing the first children dying … because when a parent is holding their child in their arms, and that child is wasting away, that means an entire community is under attack.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3712352\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Interactive_Gaza_food_IPC_report_May13_2025-05-1747298369.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C963&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Gaza_food_IPC_report_May13_2025 starvation hunger famine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"anatomy-of-a-strategy\">Anatomy of a strategy</h2><p>Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and other parts of the occupied Palestinian territory have accused consecutive Israeli governments of a decades-old policy to use food and aid as a weapon of war.</p><p>Suleiman Basharat, a Palestinian commentator and researcher on Israeli affairs, traces this strategy to the blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel in 2007.</p><p>“It was based on the idea of starvation and narrowing daily life,” Basharat noted. This doctrine was infamously summarised in 2006 by <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/israeli-government-documents-show-deliberate-policy-to-restrict-food-to-gaza/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dov Weisglass</a>, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister, who said the goal was “to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger”, adding that the war marked a shift from “management” to “elimination”.</p><p>Senior Israeli ministers made their intentions clear at the very start of the genocidal war on Gaza. Former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had declared a complete siege against “<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2023/10/9/israeli-defence-minister-orders-complete-siege-on-gaza\">human animals</a>“.  His remarks were quickly reinforced by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who argued that blocking aid to Gaza was “<a href=\"/news/2024/8/8/palestine-urges-icc-arrest-warrant-for-smotrich-over-call-to-starve-gaza\">justified and moral</a>“, even if it meant starving millions.</p><p>Israel’s moves to ramp up this policy were thorough. Before the war on Gaza began in 2023, the United Nations said 500 trucks carrying aid and food were needed to keep the people in Gaza sustained.</p><p>But during the war, an average of 19 trucks a day were allowed in the Strip – a 96 percent reduction – which some Israeli media have referred to as the “calorie collapse”.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>The Calorie Collapse:</strong> Before the war, 500 trucks sustained Gaza daily. During the conflict, this dropped to an average of 19 trucks a day – a 96 percent reduction.</li>\n<li><strong>The Thirst War:</strong> Water availability plummeted from 84 litres per person to just 3 litres during the siege.</li>\n<li><strong>Scorched Earth:</strong> Israel systematically destroyed infrastructure for agricultural production. By August 2025, 90 percent of agricultural land was razed, 2,500 chicken farms were destroyed (killing 36 million birds), and the fishing port was obliterated.</li>\n</ul><p>“If Israel wanted to do it, every child in Gaza could have breakfast tomorrow,” de Waal observed. “All they need to do is to open the gates”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4039441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4039441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4039441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-02-1760613587.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-01-1760613556\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4039441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to food, people in Gaza witnessed a sharp decrease in water releases from Israel. Rights group Oxfam said that, 100 days into the “ceasefire”, Gaza is still deliberately deprived of water as aid groups are forced to scavenge under an illegal blockade.</p><p>Israel also employed a “<a href=\"/news/longform/2024/7/2/how-israel-destroyed-gazas-ability-to-feed-itself\">scorched earth</a>” policy, systematically destroying the infrastructure for agricultural production.</p><p>By August 2025, estimates suggest that the Israeli army had destroyed 90 percent of agricultural land and 2,500 chicken farms. The army focused its campaign on areas near the security barrier in the north, south and east of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The spokesperson for Gaza’s Ministry of Agriculture, Mohammed Abu Odeh, has warned that the Israeli army’s destruction and control of the farmland will affect the chain of food and supply of vegetables for nearly two million people in the Strip.</p><h2 id=\"the-illusion-of-aid\">The illusion of aid</h2><p>Palestinian officials and analysts suggest Israel has had a strategy of blocking aid and, at times, manipulating how it is delivered.</p><p>Political analyst Abdullah Aqrabawi told Al Jazeera Arabic that Israel and the US have tried to create their own aid-delivering system, such as the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/what-is-the-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-and-why-has-it-been-criticised\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF), but failed. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed at GHF sites trying to access food.</p><p>“The United States came with a pier and contracted companies … and failed,” Aqrabawi said. He noted that these initiatives were attempts to “support criminal pockets” or specific families to distribute aid, “thereby isolating Hamas – the resistance”.</p><h2 id=\"re-engineering-society\">Re-engineering society</h2><p>Analysts say that the starvation tactics were used, not just for military leverage, but also to create an “anti-resistance” sentiment in Gaza.</p><p>“The goal is to break the Palestinian resistance by affecting the social base that embraces it,” Basharat explained. He argues that Israel aimed to “re-engineer the Palestinian human” into a being whose sole cognitive focus is basic survival, rendering them incapable of political thought.</p><p>Analysts described a host of policies adopted by Israeli officials to push Palestinians out of Gaza, cloaking them in misleading terms, such as encouraging “<a href=\"/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza\">voluntary migration</a>“.</p><p>Israeli affairs expert Mohannad Mustafa said this was a cynical euphemism for forced displacement. “You starve the people, destroy the infrastructure … and in the end, you ask them: ‘Do you want to emigrate?'” Mustafa <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XDreVKe4mmM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Al Jazeera Arabic Channel. “This is forced displacement, not voluntary migration.”</p><p>Israeli rights activists have repeatedly pointed out the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to pressure people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to leave.</p><p>Alice Rothchild, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, described the policies as “humiliating mechanics”. She <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YeQD6spHyEU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed</a> how the system forced starving civilians to walk miles to feeding centres, “herding them into cages” to receive aid. “It’s all part of this attempt to destroy Gaza,” she said.</p><p><strong>Future defined by hunger</strong></p><p>Today, despite the ongoing Gaza “ceasefire” – which continues despite Israel’s regular attacks – the destruction of Gaza’s agricultural backbone means the Strip remains entirely dependent on external aid, giving Israel permanent control.</p><p>The 475 officially recorded deaths are merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>For many Palestinians, the war may be “paused” in theory, but for a generation of Palestinians, the man-made hunger, physical and political scars could take decades to heal.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title='\"Everyone in Gaza is starving\" | The Listening Post' src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YeQD6spHyEU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p></div></div></body></html>"

But chief among the claims against Mandelson now are the suggestions he received payments from the late financier and may have shared market-sensitive information with him that was of financial interest to Epstein.</p><p>Epstein died in prison by suicide in 2019 before his trial stemming from his second prosecution for sex offences, including allegations of trafficking dozens of girls, could take place.</p><p>On Thursday, Starmer apologised to victims of Epstein for appointing Mandelson as ambassador to the US despite knowing of his ties to the disgraced financier.</p><p>“It had been publicly known for some time that Mandelson knew Epstein, but none of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship,” Starmer said.</p><p>“I am sorry. Sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you, sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointing him.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-is-peter-mandelson-and-what-is-he-accused-of\">Who is Peter Mandelson and what is he accused of?</h2><p>Since the release on Friday of the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/more-than-a-million-epstein-related-documents-discovered-release-delayed\">latest tranche</a> of Epstein files, including emails between Epstein and Mandelson, UK media have widely reported that the government suspects Mandelson may have illegally shared market-sensitive information with Epstein 15 years ago.</p><p>The newly released files include more than 3 million pages of documents and more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.</p><p>As a life peer, Mandelson, 72, was a member of the House of Lords before he resigned this week. He was a veteran Labour politician who served in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 1997 to 2010. After Labour swept back into power after 14 years in the opposition in 2024, he was appointed ambassador to the US, taking up his post on February 10 last year.</p><p>He <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/uks-ex-ambassador-mandelson-quits-labour-over-epstein-links-reports-say\">resigned</a> from the Labour Party on Sunday.</p><p>“I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this,” Mandelson said in a letter reported by British media.</p><p>“While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party.”</p><p>Alleged leaks of sensitive information by Mandelson took place in 2009 when he was serving as the UK’s business secretary in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>This is not the first time that Mandelson has been embarrassed by his friendship with Epstein. On September 11, the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/uk-fires-ambassador-to-us-peter-mandelson-over-links-to-epstein\">UK fired Mandelson</a> as ambassador to the US over emails between the two men, the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said.</p><p>On Tuesday, UK police launched a criminal investigation into Mandelson over suspected misconduct in public office linked to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/uk-police-to-review-misconduct-claims-after-mandelsons-leaks-to-epstein\">his relationship with Epstein</a>.</p><p>Misconduct in public office is punishable in the UK with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>Besides his sacking as ambassador, Mandelson has previously been forced to resign from ministerial posts for alleged misconduct on two occasions – in 1998 and 2001.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-was-jeffrey-epstein\">Who was Jeffrey Epstein?</h2><p>Epstein was a billionaire financier born and raised in New York who was known for socialising with celebrities and politicians.</p><p>Criminal investigations indicated he may have abused hundreds of girls over the course of his high-profile career. He was arrested in 2019 on federal criminal charges relating to alleged exploitation of underage girls dating back two decades. He died in prison before he could come to trial.</p><p>He also was previously accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 2005 after her parents made a report to the police. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor in relation to a single victim.</p><p>He spent 13 months in prison on a work-release programme, which allowed him to leave jail to go to work during the day and return at night.</p><p>The US attorney in Manhattan also prosecuted Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell as a <a href=\"/news/2021/11/29/maxwell-epstein-partners-in-crime-us-prosecutor-says\">coconspirator</a> in his sexual abuse scheme. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is currently serving a <a href=\"/news/2022/6/28/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-to-20-years-for-sex-crimes\">20-year prison sentence</a>, which she received in 2022.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-mandelson-s-relationship-with-epstein\">What do we know about Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein?</h2><p>When Mandelson was fired as ambassador to the US in September, the FCDO wrote: “In light of the additional information in emails written by Peter Mandelson, the prime minister has asked the foreign secretary to withdraw him as ambassador.</p><p>“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”</p><p>These particular emails were obtained and published by the UK’s Sun newspaper in September. In them, Mandelson told Epstein to “fight for early release” shortly before he was sentenced in 2008.</p><p class=\"p1\">“I think the world of you,” Mandelson told Epstein before his sentence began.</p><p>“I can still barely understand it. It just could not happen in Britain,” Mandelson wrote. “You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.”</p><p>It is now clear from the latest tranche of Epstein files that Mandelson continued his friendship with Epstein for some time after the financier had been convicted of sex offences.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-the-new-epstein-files-reveal\">What do the new Epstein files reveal?</h2><p>From 2003 to 2004, bank records indicated that Epstein made three payments totalling $75,000 to accounts connected to Mandelson or his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Mandelson has said he does not recall receiving any such funds and has pledged to examine whether the documents are genuine.</p><p>According to these documents, in 2009, Epstein sent da Silva 10,000 pounds ($13,607, or $20,419 today after inflation) to pay for an osteopathy course. This week, Mandelson told The Times of London: “In retrospect, it was clearly a lapse in our collective judgement for Reinaldo to accept this offer.”</p><p>Emails revealed in the latest tranche of files from the US Justice Department also shine a light on the close friendship between the two men.</p><p>In October 2009, Epstein wrote in an email to Mandelson: “You can marry princess beatrice, the queen would have a queen as a grandson,” referring to the daughter of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince whose royal titles were stripped last year over his own links to Epstein and allegations of the sexual abuse of Virginia Giuffre, who successfully sued Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>“does that make it incest, how exciting,” Epstein wrote.</p><p>In 2010, Lesley Groff, known to have been Epstein’s long-term executive assistant, emailed his boss: “Mandelson’s holiday plans arc still being sorted out. They hope to be in touch soon.”</p><p>In 2013, Epstein emailed Mandelson, saying he knew Mandelson was visiting St Petersburg, Russia. Mandelson described the city as “a rave”, to which Epstein asked whether “its for gays”. Mandelson responded, “Er no, tastey [sic] models and dancing.”</p><p>But the emails also suggested Mandelson passed sensitive information to the financier.</p><p>On May 9, 2010, Mandelson emailed Epstein, saying: “Sources tell me 500 b euro bailout, almost compelte [sic].” The next morning, European governments approved a 500-billion-euro bailout for banks in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p><p>Also in May 2010, Mandelson emailed Epstein, saying, “Finally got him to go today.” It is believed that Mandelson was referring to former Labour Prime Minister Brown.</p><p>Epstein replied to this email: “I have faith, the value of some chapters in your book should now increase.”</p><p>Brown announced his resignation just hours after this email exchange.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-starmer-said\">What has Starmer said?</h2><p>Under mounting pressure from opposition politicians and within his own party this week, Starmer agreed to release information about the process through which Mandelson was appointed ambassador in 2024.</p><p>At a question and answer session on Wednesday in the House of Commons dominated by the Epstein revelations, Starmer admitted that he knew of Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein but said Mandelson had “lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador”.</p><p>“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer said. “I regret appointing him. If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.”</p><p>Starmer said he would ensure that “all of the material” is published, except for documents that compromise Britain’s national security, international relations or the police investigation into Mandelson’s activities.</p><p>On Tuesday, Starmer told his cabinet he was “appalled by the information” regarding Mandelson and was concerned more details could come to light, according to a Downing Street readout of the cabinet meeting.</p><p>Starmer also said he had ordered the civil service to conduct an “urgent” review of all of Mandelson’s contacts with Epstein while he was in government.</p><p>“The alleged passing on of emails of highly sensitive government business was disgraceful,” Starmer said, adding that he was not yet “reassured that the totality of information had yet emerged”.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-affect-starmer\">How will this affect Starmer?</h2><p>Members of parliament expressed their dismay and called on him to step down.</p><p>Conservative MP Luke Evans said: “At the end of the day, he [Starmer] made the decision to appoint Mandelson to the post of ambassador, so he must explain his decision-making process.”</p><p>Alex Burghart, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: “There is no doubt that the prime minister’s judgement is being called sharply into question at this moment. It is becoming harder to see how any of us can rely on his judgement in future.”</p><p>Conservative MP Graham Stuart added: “The fact is that he appointed a person who had already broken all the Nolan Principles before his appointment as well as doing so after it. I think that makes the prime minister’s position untenable.”</p><p>The Nolan Principles are a set of ethical standards for all public office holders in the UK.</p><p>“I would say that today is the crumbling of Starmer. His judgement is poor, and it is ruining this country and the Labour Party,” Conservative MP Esther McVey said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-how-mandelson-was-approved-as-us-ambassador\">What do we know about how Mandelson was approved as US ambassador?</h2><p>Facing questions from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in the House of Commons in September, Starmer maintained that “full due process was gone through” for the purposes of Mandelson’s appointment.</p><p>Mandelson’s ties to Epstein, who is said to have nicknamed him “Petie”, had been publicly known for years.</p><p>But The Times of London reported that Starmer received just a two-page vetting note from the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team about Mandelson’s appointment.</p><p>That document suggested that while Epstein was in prison in 2009, Mandelson stayed at Epstein’s townhouse in Manhattan. The report also contained a photograph of Mandelson and Epstein together.</p><p>This indicated that by late 2024, the UK government had documentation showing Mandelson had remained close to Epstein even after his 2008 conviction.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"184\" data-end=\"570\">Trump’s presence at last month’s World Economic Forum in Davos was about one thing: showing the rich and powerful who is boss. As his commerce secretary made clear in the Swiss resort: “With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town.”</p><p data-start=\"572\" data-end=\"927\">In the run-up to the summit, Trump ramped up threats against Greenland, forcing Western leaders to finally recognise that underneath the bluster, Trump may be serious about shaking up their world. Taken together with Trump’s invasion of Venezuela and ongoing tariff wars, the United States president’s actions suggest an emerging model of capitalism built less on market rules and more on direct state coercion and geopolitical competition.</p><p data-start=\"929\" data-end=\"1300\">Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney put it eloquently when he said that Trump represented “a rupture, not a transition”. The international rules-based order is shot through with hypocrisy and double standards, Carney argued, but still, this American-dominated economy has delivered a degree of stability for countries like Canada; today, “this bargain no longer works”.</p><p data-start=\"1302\" data-end=\"1434\">Carney is right. Trump is leading an attempt to transform the international order. And that means changing the way capitalism works.</p><p data-start=\"1436\" data-end=\"1908\">For decades, we have lived under a neoliberal form of capitalism. In theory, this system was based on the rule of the free market. In reality, it was a highly monopolistic system, with major decisions about how we live being taken by an ever more concentrated group of business leaders and wealthy investors. Such a system has driven historically unprecedented levels of inequality and environmental destruction and eroded democracy to the point where it barely functions.</p><p data-start=\"1910\" data-end=\"2210\">We have been here before. In the late 19th century, a globalised “free market” economy also created massive inequality, dominated by a small number of robber baron industrialists and financiers. As these business empires worked with nation-states to expand their markets across the world, war became inevitable.</p><p data-start=\"2212\" data-end=\"2781\">In some countries, fascist leaders came to power, clearing away democratic opposition to the business titans, merging them into an aggressive nationalist project, using the full force of the state to drive corporate profits and incorporate that profit-making into a world-dominating project. In many ways, fascism was the ultimate expression of monopoly power. Fascist economies were characterised by the fusion of state power with corporate monopolies, the mobilisation of industry for nationalist expansion, and the suppression of democratic economic oversight.</p><p data-start=\"2783\" data-end=\"3029\">Trump represents something similar. He will use economic or military warfare to get his way and is explicitly using state power to enrich the biggest corporations in history, boosting state subsidies and public protection to unprecedented levels.</p><p data-start=\"3031\" data-end=\"3298\">But Trump is not controlled by business leaders; rather, he wants to change the way they function. Trump often clashes with the “woke” corporate bureaucrats, bullying them into integrating with his political project, just as fascist leaders did a hundred years ago.</p><p data-start=\"3300\" data-end=\"3746\">Hence, Trump’s interest in intervening in countries in ways that many in the business world find perplexing. Trump said that his invasion of Venezuela was about oil. And yet, many oil companies seem reluctant to invest. Trump’s United Nations ambassador said his interest in Greenland is about controlling the critical minerals required to make military and other high-tech products. But digging them up seems too difficult for many in the business world to contemplate.</p><p data-start=\"3748\" data-end=\"4301\">Some argue that Trump is simply interested in enriching the speculators who surround him. And there is surely some of that – just look at the hedge funds that reportedly made a killing as Trump threatened intervention in Venezuela. But there is something deeper, too. Trump sees the world as one of great power rivalry, in which China is America’s chief competition, but Europe also needs to know its place. To maintain US dominance, control of resources is vital, even those buried deep beneath the ground, not least because someone else might grab them.</p><p data-start=\"4303\" data-end=\"4717\">Trump’s plan – albeit one open to change, and applied in a deeply erratic, sometimes contradictory fashion – is for a world where international law is replaced entirely with the rule of the bully. In turn, this is a reaction to unsustainable dynamics in the global economy. As such, it will likely outlive Trump. So we cannot wait for an election to save us. If we want to defeat Trump’s politics, we need to stand up to him.</p><p data-start=\"4303\" data-end=\"4717\">Carney suggested as much in Davos, proposing a new coalition of “middle powers” to replace dependence on the US. This is undoubtedly important, but it is only part of the answer. Carney’s vision of this alternative coalition is centred on signing yet more deregulatory, free-market trade deals, replacing one form of globalisation with another.</p><p data-start=\"5051\" data-end=\"5521\">It is time for Western leaders to learn that you cannot beat fascist economics with neoliberalism. We need a genuinely democratic form of economics. This means building systems where public investment, democratic accountability and economic sovereignty take precedence over corporate concentration and speculative finance. And that is possible, because in retaliating against Trump and breaking with US dependence, countries can begin rewriting the rules of the economy.</p><p data-start=\"5523\" data-end=\"6196\">Retaliation against Trump should not be viewed simply through the lens of escalating tariffs. Limiting access of US corporations to procurement contracts, refusing to cooperate on intellectual property rules, and regulating finance and technology will all hurt Trump’s friends while also helping our countries develop sovereign economic policies that can centre the needs of ordinary citizens. Remarkably, such policies have been explicitly put on the table in discussions over the European Union’s so-called “trade bazooka”, threatened over Greenland.</p><p data-start=\"6198\" data-end=\"6738\">This would represent the beginning of something genuinely different. Trump’s rise is frightening, yet it presents an opportunity, which should have been seized long ago, to move towards a more democratic economy, to halt and reverse inequality, to restore our environment. Trump’s politics are not an anomaly but a symptom of deep failures within the global economic system. And that path is the only way to prevent fascism, because economic systems that concentrate power and wealth inevitably create fertile ground for authoritarian rule.</p><p data-start=\"6198\" data-end=\"6738\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "time": "2026-02-05T14:02:42",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6984a2bcef9b-1770300092.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"955\">Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the United States has, over the past year, consistently violated international norms and laws. The rollercoaster of tariff barriers, the sham negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and the declaration of a false “ceasefire” with Israel, all while openly musing about turning Gaza into “oceanfront property”, would have been bad enough on their own.</p><p data-start=\"957\" data-end=\"1254\">But in just the past couple of months, the US has bombed Nigeria to “defend” Christians, invaded Venezuela and arrested its president, Nicolás Maduro, after months of blowing up Venezuelan boats in international waters, and openly threatened Iran, Greenland, and Mexico with military intervention.</p><p data-start=\"1256\" data-end=\"1830\">Within the US, Trump’s ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has continued to carry out extralegal harm in the process of fulfilling his promise of mass deportations. Since the start of 2026, federal immigration officers have shot and killed at least three US citizens: 43-year-old Keith Porter Jr. in California, and 37-year-olds Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Both Good and Pretti were killed on camera, in incidents recorded from multiple angles, intensifying public outrage over the expanding use of lethal force by federal immigration agencies.</p><p data-start=\"1832\" data-end=\"2388\">If this were almost any other country, like Iran, with its repressive and indiscriminate killing of thousands of protesters over the past month, the Western-led international community would already be calling for sanctions and embargoes against the US. But in light of US threats and actions at home and abroad, the world now needs to take a page from the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s leadership in the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. The world needs to boycott and divest from US corporations, US-made products, and US-led events.</p><p data-start=\"2390\" data-end=\"2878\">Short of civil strife, civil war, or military action, there is no other way for the world to disrupt US aggression except through massive economic pressure. While on a considerably smaller scale, King and so many other Black people in the 1950s understood that hitting the wallets of those who had long benefited from Black labour and pain could be effective in the US. It was one of the few tools available in their struggle against the daily onslaught of violent racist segregation.</p><p data-start=\"2880\" data-end=\"3369\">The 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama was a response to decades of segregated public transport, not simply to Rosa Parks refusing to give up a “whites-only” seat at the front of a bus on December 1, 1955. During the year-long protest, some 40,000 Black Montgomery residents either carpooled or walked to school, work, church, and elsewhere. <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/statement-ending-bus-boycott\">Defending the boycott</a>, King said, “We came to see that, in the long run, it is more honourable to walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.”</p><p data-start=\"3371\" data-end=\"4045\">White Montgomery residents responded with mass arrests, threats, and other acts of intimidation, including the bombing of King’s home on January 30, 1956. A month after the US Supreme Court affirmed <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/browder-v-gayle-352-us-903\">Browder v. Gayle</a>, the decision outlawing segregation on public transportation, with the now-deceased activist Claudette Colvin among the plaintiffs, Montgomery formally ended its bus segregation policies on December 17, 1956, though white residents continued to harass, attack, and even lynch Black bus riders and civil rights activists for years afterwards. “Our aim has never been to put the bus company out of business, but rather to put justice in business,” King said.</p><p data-start=\"4047\" data-end=\"4680\">Putting “justice in business” in the case of the US will require a global effort. The world should build on the Palestinian-led BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement against Israel and apply those lessons to the US. BDS was launched in July 2005 with the support of 170 Palestinian organisations as a nonviolent effort to apply economic and cultural pressure on Israel to end its apartheid rule over Gaza and the West Bank. BDS founders Omar Barghouti and the late Ingrid Jaradat Gassner drew inspiration from the global anti-apartheid boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p data-start=\"4682\" data-end=\"5120\">BDS has three objectives in its two-decade-long push against Israeli oppression and systematic genocide: “ending [Israel’s] occupation and colonisation of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; recognising the fundamental rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.”</p><p data-start=\"5122\" data-end=\"5713\">It is true that powerful lobbies and other Western supporters of Zionism have labelled BDS “anti-Semitic”. But it is also true that those opposed to social justice will go to great lengths to discredit and destroy movements that challenge their power. Over the years, BDS has helped raise global awareness of the everyday, systemic destruction of Palestine and the lives of Palestinians living under Israel’s apartheid and occupation. The movement is also likely a key reason why the ongoing genocide in Gaza never garnered broad international support or sustained backing among ordinary Americans.</p><p data-start=\"5715\" data-end=\"6414\">As for a global boycott movement against US oppression and aggression, some have already begun calling for a boycott of the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup this summer, with most scheduled matches set to take place in stadiums across the US. <a href=\"https://x.com/medickimw/status/2009009043655020678\">Social media posts</a> urging people to cancel World Cup tickets and travel plans to the US, and to sanction its athletes and businesses, have gone viral in the aftermath of ICE agent Jonathan Ross’s gunning down of Renée Nicole Good on January 7. Given the increase in xenophobic, queerphobic, and racist civil strife and persecution at home and abroad, a backlash against US tourism now looms as the world approaches the June dates for the tournament’s matches.</p><p data-start=\"6416\" data-end=\"7285\">But the stakes for the US and the world at this moment are high, and boycotting the globe’s largest sporting event, though significant, is hardly enough to pressure an increasingly belligerent and autocratic regime. Boycotting and divesting from US businesses that support the oppression of marginalised people, especially companies such as Google, Amazon, and Palantir, with their surveillance investments in Israel, would be one place to start. Disinvesting from US-based media monopolies, whether News Corp, The Washington Post, or Paramount Global, would go a long way towards loosening the stranglehold US monopolies exert over Western media. Boycotting the America250 celebrations scheduled for July, the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and annual US-based international cultural events such as Coachella and the Met Gala would also exert pressure.</p><p data-start=\"7287\" data-end=\"7609\">Boycotting high-profile US supporters of oppression and militarism, whether Trump, Bari Weiss, or Elon Musk, would draw further attention. If the world wants the US to do better by its own people and to act as a better nation-state on the global stage, it must act collectively to boycott and divest from US influence.</p><p data-start=\"7611\" data-end=\"7956\">It was not all that long ago that the old Soviet Union regularly labelled Americans as “capitalist pigs” or “imperialist pigs”. Such Cold War propaganda was accompanied by films portraying the once self-proclaimed “leader of the free world” as a society riven by racist civil strife and violent repression against those who challenged injustice.</p><p data-start=\"7958\" data-end=\"8547\">Years after King gave his first public address galvanising the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where he described the “weapon of protest” as “the glory of America, with all of its faults”, he came to understand that much of what had been dismissed as Soviet propaganda was, in fact, bedrock reality. “The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and racism. The problems of racial injustice and economic injustice cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power,” King said in 1967. This is something the world needs to remind the US of in 2026.</p><p data-start=\"7958\" data-end=\"8547\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
