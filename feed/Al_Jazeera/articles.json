They revealed that Mandelson had maintained a close friendship with the disgraced financier even after Epstein had pleaded guilty to solicitation of sex with a minor and was jailed in 2008.</p><p>They include documents and emails that suggest Mandelson may have received payments from Epstein and passed sensitive information to him during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.</p><p>Since then, Starmer has admitted that he knew of the pair’s friendship when he appointed Mandelson as ambassador but said the peer had lied about the extent of it. The affair has caused outrage in parliament. Two key members of Starmer’s inner circle have resigned and a third is under pressure to go. On Monday, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for the prime minister to do the same.</p><p>While Starmer’s position has been shored up for now by a rally of support from his cabinet on Monday night, just how badly has this affair shaken his government?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301900\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96PW8A3__v1__MidRes__BritainScotlandUsPoliticsLabourEpsteinMandelson-1770714191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C526&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"anas sarwar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301900\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘The distraction needs to end,’ Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says at a news conference in Glasgow on February 9, 2026, at which he called for Starmer to step down [Andy Buchanan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-did-anas-sarwar-call-for-starmer-to-resign\">Why did Anas Sarwar call for Starmer to resign?</h2><p>Sarwar said at a news conference early on Monday afternoon that he had called Starmer and told him it was time for him to resign. “I spoke to the prime minister earlier today, and I think it’s safe to say he and I disagreed,” Sarwar said.</p><p>He said “too many mistakes” had been made in relation to the appointment of Mandelson.</p><p>“The distraction needs to end, and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,” Sarwar said as he became the first Labour heavyweight to stand against the prime minister.</p><p>While Sarwar said he believed Starmer to be a “decent man”, the fury over the Epstein files had severely damaged the government’s support and wrecked its chances in the upcoming Scottish parliament elections. Opinion polls put Scottish Labour some distance behind the Scottish National Party, followed by the far-right Reform party, led by Nigel Farage.</p><p>But cabinet members came out in support of Starmer, ultimately ending the coup that never was. Angela Rayner, former deputy prime minister and a senior member of the Labour Party, was the first to show him support. She said in a post on X that while she did not defend Starmer’s judgement, “the worst possible response [to the scandal] would be to play party politics or factional games.”</p><p>“I urge all my colleagues to come together, remember our values and put them into practice as a team,” she wrote on X. “The Prime Minister has my full support in leading us to that end.”</p><p>Within hours, nearly every minister had followed suit. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, urged people to “give Keir a chance”. Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, said he hoped the prime minister would stay on, and Douglas Alexander, Scotland secretary, said he “respected” Sarwar’s stance but backed the prime minister.</p><p>On Monday night, Starmer addressed more than 400 MPs and peers at a Labour Party meeting. “I have won every fight I’ve ever been in. I fought to change the Labour Party to allow us to win an election again,” he told them.</p><p>“But I’ll tell you this, after having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I’m not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301896\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301896\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96P79VC__v1__MidRes__BritainUsPoliticsEpsteinMandelson-1770714140.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C501&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"starmer\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Journalists gather outside 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain’s prime minister, on February 9, 2026, as Starmer was ‘getting on with the job of delivering change across the country’, a spokesman told them.

A parliamentary by-election is also due on February 26.</p><p>“The immediate danger [to Starmer] is that [Labour] suffers catastrophic losses in a by-election and then a big set of elections in May,” Bale said. “That will reignite calls for Starmer to resign and, if he doesn’t, a challenge from one or more of his colleagues.”</p><p>Among the top runners to replace Starmer are Rayner, his former deputy prime minister who resigned from the cabinet last year over a tax scandal.</p><p>A website pitching Rayner as leader, angelaforleader.co.uk, went live in January briefly, The Guardian newspaper reported. Rayner has denied any links to the website.</p><p>Another politician gearing up to replace Starmer is Wes Streeting, the health secretary.</p><p>Streeting, 43, has also been called out for his ties with Mandelson. In a bid to distance himself from the former ambassador, Streeting this week shared private chats he had with Mandelson that questioned the government’s growth plan.</p><p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, 45, is another possible successor to Starmer. She has grown popular among several right-aligned leaders of the Labour Party with her moves to tighten border controls and crack down on unauthorised immigration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4106258\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4106258\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4106258\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/epa_6917070ad630-1763116810.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C620&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12520210 British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer departs 10 Downing Street for Prime Minister's Questions at parliament in London, Britain, 12 November 2025.

However, the prime minister has since had a difficult time in Downing Street.</p><p>In the 2024 elections, Reform UK, the right-wing, populist, anti-immigration party led by Farage, won just five of the 650 seats in parliament. However, it has gone on to become one of the best polling British parties. In July, a YouGov <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">poll</a> put Reform in the lead, predicting it could win 271 seats if elections were held then.</p><p>In his speech on Monday, Starmer called the challenge posed by the rise of the Reform party, which has won over a number of high-profile defectors from the Conservative Party in recent weeks, “a fight for our lives”.</p><p>Starmer is also facing domestic pressure to put a stop to undocumented immigration to the UK. More than 32,000 people tried to cross the English Channel from France in small boats last year. These crossings are dangerous and have resulted in many deaths.</p><p>The UK and France have laid the blame on each other for the rising numbers. This led to a “<a href=\"/news/2025/9/24/how-effective-is-uks-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-so-far\">one-in-one-out</a>” migrant deal signed between the UK and France last year, under which the UK returns one migrant to France for each accepted refugee. The scheme has had little success, however, with only a handful of migrants returned.</p><p>Starmer himself has dropped in popularity by 20 percentage points from July 2024 to January this year, according to YouGov.</p><p>“Reform has obviously spooked some in the Labour Party,” Bale said, adding, however, that Reform is eating into the Conservatives’ base more. “And Labour probably needs to worry more about the Greens and the Liberal Democrats at this stage.”</p><p>“The break-up of the two-party duopoly that has dominated British politics for a century is no longer simply an aspiration among challenger parties but an ongoing reality,” Bale said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She found her husband screaming, but of Saad, there was no trace.</p><p>“I went into the mosque and found myself stepping on flesh and blood,” Mahani told Al Jazeera Arabic for an investigation that aired on Monday. She searched hospitals and morgues for days. “We found nothing of Saad. Not even a body to bury.

Unlike conventional explosives, these weapons disperse a cloud of fuel that ignites to create an enormous fireball and a vacuum effect.</p><p>“To prolong the burning time, powders of aluminium, magnesium and titanium are added to the chemical mixture,” Fatigarov said. “This raises the temperature of the explosion to between 2,500 and 3,000 degrees Celsius [4,532F to 5,432F].”</p><p>According to the investigation, the intense heat is often generated by tritonal, a mixture of TNT and aluminium powder used in United States-made <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-made-bombs-used-in-deadly-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-schools-hrw-says\">bombs</a> like the MK-84.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3172453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3172453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INTERACTIVE-Israel-2000lbs-mk-84-mk-84-bomb-1726052230.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel 2000lbs mk 84 mk-84 bomb-1726052230\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Dr Munir al-Bursh, director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, explained the biological impact of such extreme heat on the human body, which is composed of roughly 80 percent water.</p><p>“The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius [212F],” al-Bursh said. “When a body is exposed to energy exceeding 3,000 degrees combined with massive pressure and oxidation, the fluids boil instantly.

It has a steel casing and a delayed fuse, burying itself before detonating a PBXN-109 explosive mix. This creates a large fireball inside enclosed spaces, incinerating everything within reach.</li>\n<li><strong>GBU-39:</strong> This precision glide bomb was used in the al-Tabin school attack. It uses the AFX-757 explosive. “The GBU-39 is designed to keep the building structure relatively intact while destroying everything inside,” Fatigarov noted. “It kills via a pressure wave that ruptures lungs and a thermal wave that incinerates soft tissue.”</li>\n</ul><p>Basal of the Civil Defence confirmed finding fragments of GBU-39 wings at sites where bodies had vanished.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2474448\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/INTERACTIVE-Israels-precision-guided-missiles-1699530503.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1069&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -Israels precision guided missiles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"a-global-genocide-not-just-an-israeli-one\">A ‘global genocide, not just an Israeli one’</h2><p>Legal experts said the use of these indiscriminate weapons implicates not just Israel but also its Western suppliers.</p><p>“This is a global genocide, not just an Israeli one,” said lawyer Diana Buttu, a lecturer at Georgetown University in Qatar.</p><p>Speaking at the Al Jazeera Forum in Doha, Buttu argued that the supply chain is evidence of complicity. “We see a continuous flow of these weapons from the United States and Europe.

He highlighted that the war has continued through siege, starvation and strikes. “The blockade on medicine and food is itself a crime against humanity.”</p><p>Shandab pointed to the “impunity” granted to Israel by the US veto power at the UN Security Council. However, he noted that universal jurisdiction courts in countries like Germany and France could offer an alternative path to justice, provided there is political will.</p><p>For Rafiq Badran, who lost four children in the Bureij refugee camp during the war, these technical definitions mean little.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Just over two years in power, and the United Kingdom’s Labour government is facing an existential crisis.</p><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Disclosures linked to the Epstein files have triggered intense criticism of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s appointment of Peter Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, prompting senior resignations and fuelling speculation about Starmer’s political survival. But even if Starmer weathers the immediate political storm, a more profound challenge is looming: the steady fracturing of the political centre that has defined his leadership and electoral appeal.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">UK politics has been marked by years of churn, volatility, and repeated shocks. Yet, through that instability, the political centre largely kept control of the steering wheel – presenting itself as the only credible governing alternative and containing pressure from both flanks. That dominance reinforced the view, particularly abroad, that the UK was largely insulated from the destructive polarisation reshaping other Western democracies, most notably the US.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">Starmer is perhaps the clearest and most explicit embodiment of that centrism, having won the 2024 election on a promise of competence and restraint at a moment when the Conservative Party had lost much of its own reputation for managerial authority and “grown-up” government.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">That centrist settlement is now beginning to fracture.</p><p data-start=\"1677\" data-end=\"2073\">The strain is now visible across multiple fronts. It is visible in polling, electoral behaviour, policy choices, and the tone of public debate. For Starmer, this creates a governing dilemma: how to hold the centre when the forces pulling away from it are becoming louder, sharper, and more confident – and when the authority of the centre itself looks increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2075\" data-end=\"2613\">On the right, Reform UK has emerged as a persistent and disruptive force. Its significance is not primarily electoral – it is unlikely to form a government – but discursive. Reform has succeeded in dragging political debate towards its framing on immigration, borders, and sovereignty. Recent defections and polling momentum have amplified its presence, forcing mainstream parties to respond to its agenda rather than define their own. Even where Reform does not win seats, it shifts the conversation, narrowing the space for moderation.</p><p data-start=\"2615\" data-end=\"3183\">Labour’s response illustrates the bind. Starmer’s leadership has been built around restoring credibility after years of Conservative turmoil: fiscal discipline, institutional stability, and reassurance to voters and markets. But this caution has its limits. Under pressure from the right, Labour has overseen tougher immigration enforcement and deportation rhetoric, moves that signal responsiveness to public anxiety but risk reinforcing Reform’s framing rather than displacing it. The centre adapts, but in doing so, it appears reactive rather than authoritative.</p><p data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3779\">Pressure from the left is no less significant. The Green Party is no longer a marginal protest movement confined to environmental activism. Its growing visibility in local elections and national debates reflects a broader appetite – particularly among younger voters – for sharper positions on climate change, civil liberties, and foreign policy. Where Labour emphasises managerial competence, the Greens speak the language of moral urgency. This contrast matters. Politics is not only about governing capacity, it is about meaning – and on that terrain, the centre increasingly looks hesitant.</p><p data-start=\"3781\" data-end=\"4215\">This tension is now being mirrored inside Labour itself. Recent internal upheaval – including the resignation of Starmer’s chief of staff amid controversy and criticism over appointments and strategy – has exposed unease within the governing project. The centre is no longer just under attack from the outside; it is being questioned from within. That internal turbulence weakens the claim that stability alone can anchor authority.</p><p data-start=\"4217\" data-end=\"4666\">Starmer’s governing style reflects this broader moment. His approach prioritises calm, caution, and predictability – virtues in a country fatigued by crisis. But managerial politics, by definition, struggles to inspire loyalty when social, economic, and geopolitical pressures feel unresolved. The more politics is framed as administration rather than direction, the more space opens for challengers on both flanks to claim clarity and conviction.</p><p data-start=\"4668\" data-end=\"5170\">This dynamic is increasingly visible in the UK’s foreign policy too. Starmer has sought to reposition the UK as a pragmatic global actor, signalling openness to engagement with China while maintaining transatlantic ties. Diplomatically, this is defensible. Domestically, it is harder to sell nuance in a fragmented political environment. Foreign policy, once buffered by elite consensus, is now pulled into domestic culture wars and moral disputes, further narrowing the centre’s room for manoeuvre.</p><p data-start=\"5172\" data-end=\"5568\">Polling reinforces the sense of drift. Surveys showing greater openness to electoral coalitions and rising support for smaller parties point to a loosening grip of the traditional centre. Voters appear less committed to inherited alignments and more willing to experiment – not necessarily out of ideological zeal, but out of frustration with a politics that feels risk-averse and unresponsive.</p><p data-start=\"5570\" data-end=\"5900\">None of this means the UK is on the brink of US-style polarisation. But it does suggest that the old assumptions underpinning centrist dominance no longer hold. The post-war consensus that once stabilised UK politics has eroded. What remains is a thinner centre that must be actively argued for, not simply occupied.</p><p data-start=\"5902\" data-end=\"6255\">The danger is gradual hollowing out rather than sudden collapse. If the centre comes to be seen as evasive, overly technocratic, or morally cautious, it risks losing legitimacy, even as it retains power. In that scenario, politics becomes less about governing choices and more about symbolic confrontation, with the centre permanently on the defensive.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\">For Starmer, the challenge is therefore not just electoral management, but narrative reconstruction. Governing from the centre can no longer mean merely avoiding extremes. It must articulate why the centre is a destination in its own right – capable of leadership, not just restraint. Whether the UK’s political centre can make that transition may determine not only the future of this government, but the shape of UK politics in the years ahead.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A potential famine in Somalia was narrowly averted through increased international aid.</p><p>The Horn of Africa has endured four consecutive failed wet seasons. The latest October-December wet period ranked among the driest ever recorded with eastern Kenya experiencing its worst drought for that season since 1981, according to UN health officials.</p><p>Kenya’s National Drought Management Authority reported drought conditions in 10 counties. Mandera County, near the Somalia border, has reached “alarm” status with severe water shortages leading to livestock deaths and child malnutrition.</p><p>Neighbouring countries are facing similar challenges. The UN’s World Health Organization reported comparable conditions across Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda in late January.</p><p>Islamic Relief’s assessment in southern Somalia revealed “shocking food shortages as families flee the region’s worsening drought”. More than three million Somalis have been displaced to camps, where 70 percent of those in Baidoa survive on one meal or less per day as children exhibit “visible signs of malnutrition and wasting”.</p><p>Experts attributed these conditions largely to climate change. The warming of the Indian Ocean has generated more destructive tropical storms while droughts have grown longer and more severe.</p><p>These changes are devastating African communities reliant on rain-fed agriculture. Farmers said rising temperatures are destroying their livestock pastures and ruining crops.</p><p>Africa is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather due to limited disaster preparedness infrastructure. Despite contributing only 3 to 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN, the continent bears a disproportionate burden of climate change impacts.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also explored “ways to reach a balanced and just agreement between the two sides, and emphasised the importance of returning to the table of dialogue and negotiation”, according to the Omani agency.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was also due to meet Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, the chief intermediary in the US-Iran talks.</p><p>The Iranian state-run IRNA news agency said “discussions over the latest regional and international developments” were on the agenda for Larijani’s visit to Muscat, “as well as ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation between Iran and Oman”.</p><p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said some analysts were interpreting the visit, on the back of the recent talks in the country, “as a positive sign indicating a sort of progress” in efforts to advance the negotiations.</p><p>Oman hosted talks on Iran’s nuclear programme last week aimed at avoiding a conflict between Tehran and Washington, amid surging tensions and a growing United States military build-up in the region.</p><p>It was an outcome of concerted diplomatic efforts in the region to avert a conflict. A second round of talks has been confirmed, but a date has not been announced.</p><p>IRNA reported on Tuesday that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had held a series of phone calls with his counterparts in Turkiye, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to brief them on the latest developments in the negotiations with Washington in Muscat.</p><h2 id=\"tehran-condemns-israeli-influence\">Tehran condemns Israeli influence</h2><p>At a news briefing on Tuesday, Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Larijani’s visit was part of regional consultations in line with Tehran’s policy of strengthening relations with neighbouring countries, and had been planned in advance.</p><p>Regarding the negotiations with the US, Baghaei said Washington “must act independently, free from the destructive pressures being exerted that harm the region and American interests”.</p><p>He urged the US to resist Israeli pressure over the nuclear issue, claiming that “one of the United States’ problems in the region is its subservience to the demands of the Zionist entity, which is the primary factor destabilising security in the region.</p><p>“Israel has turned our nuclear programme into an artificial crisis and is trying to raise unfounded fears about a nuclear bomb that does not exist in Iran,” he said.</p><p>Speaking on the progress of the talks to date, Baghaei said that after the collapse of the diplomatic process last year, it was “unrealistic to expect detailed discussions in the very first meeting”.</p><p>“The Muscat meeting itself was brief, lasting about half a day, and from our perspective was mainly aimed at assessing the other side’s seriousness and exploring how the process might proceed,” he said.</p><p>The focus, he said, had been on general principles, and Iran’s “core positions” were clear – “securing the Iranian people’s interests based on international law and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy”.</p><p>He added that European countries had “missed past opportunities to play a constructive role and failed to act independently or positively in diplomatic processes, choosing instead to follow others and making serious miscalculations”.</p><p>He said recent moves by the European Union to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-slams-selective-outrage-after-eu-labels-irgc-a-terrorist-group\">designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps</a> as a terrorist organisation were “both illegal and a strategic mistake”.</p><p>“Rather than persisting in such actions and media rhetoric, they should reflect on how to restore Europe’s role in regional and international affairs,” he said.</p><p>He added that Larijani would visit Qatar after his trip to Oman.</p><h2 id=\"iran-hints-at-uranium-dilution\">Iran hints at uranium dilution</h2><p>Both sides have given mixed signals about their progress in the negotiations.</p><p>However, on Monday, Iran’s atomic energy chief <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/iran-suggests-it-could-dilute-highly-enriched-uranium-for-sanctions-relief\">Mohammad Eslami said</a> Tehran was open to diluting its highly enriched uranium if the US ends sanctions, signalling flexibility on a key US demand.</p><p>Eslami said the prospects of Iran diluting its 60 percent enriched uranium, a threshold close to weapons-grade, would hinge on “whether all sanctions would be lifted in return”, IRNA reported.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Iran to be subject to a total ban on enrichment, a condition unacceptable to Tehran.</p><p>Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile – estimated last year by the United Nations nuclear agency at more than 440kg (970lb) – of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90 percent ⁠that is considered weapons-grade.</p><p>Araghchi, speaking to diplomats at a summit in Tehran on Sunday, had signalled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be allowed to enrich uranium.</p><p>“The Americans are now saying that they are looking for a package of comprehensive negotiations to include other controversial issues such as the ballistic missiles, defence capabilities, regional activities of the country,” said Al Jazeera’s Asadi.</p><p>“Meanwhile, Tehran is saying it wants talks to be focused and concentrated around the nuclear policy, and for the knots to be untangled one by one.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"further-talks-expected\">Further talks expected</h2><p>The date of the next round of talks has yet to be announced, although Trump has said they will be held this week.</p><p>Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process stalling largely owing to disputes over uranium enrichment.</p><p>Washington then joined Israeli strikes on Iran in June, targeting the Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan nuclear facilities with bunker-buster hits.</p><p>Since those strikes, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity.</p><p>It has always maintained that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-to-meet-trump\">Netanyahu to meet Trump</h2><p>Larijani’s Oman trip comes as Benjamin Netanyahu left for the United States <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-in-us-to-discuss-iran-says-israeli-pm\">for a meeting with Trump</a> to discuss Washington’s ongoing negotiations with Iran, the Israeli prime minister’s office said on Monday.</p><p>The planned meeting will be the seventh between Trump and Netanyahu since the US president returned to office last year.</p><p>During his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu will highlight Israel’s concerns over Iran’s missile arsenal, and not just the nuclear programme, the Israeli prime minister’s office said over the weekend.</p><p>He “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”, said Netanyahu’s office, referring to Iran’s allies in the region such as Hezbollah.</p><p>Analysts have said Netanyahu will likely urge Trump to push Tehran on its ballistic missile programme, seen as a red line by Tehran.</p><p>The US has sought to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out, with Araghchi insisting its missile programme is “non-negotiable”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His return brought his authority closer to the ground, but it also exposed the difficulty of converting symbolic leadership into effective organisational control.</p><p>One of the immediate challenges the BNP faced was enforcing discipline within the party. Some 92 candidates are contesting against official BNP nominees in 79 of the country’s 300 constituencies, highlighting persistent factionalism at the local level.</p><p>“This seems higher than at any previous time,” said Al Masud Hasanuzzaman, an analyst and professor of political science at Jahangirnagar University.</p><p>Moreover, a recent study by Transparency International Bangladesh found that 91 percent of political violence recorded since August 5, 2024, involved BNP activists, a statistic that raises further questions about the party’s internal control.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299734\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Leaders-since-1971-1770627773.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Leaders since 1971\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Political analyst Dilara Chowdhury, who has studied the nationalist politics of Rahman’s parents, said the lack of discipline within the BNP became increasingly visible during this year’s <a href=\"/features/2026/2/3/jobs-cash-loans-can-bangladeshs-parties-deliver-on-election-promises\">election campaign</a>.</p><p>“This is a major weakness,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “He [Rahman] has not been able to establish discipline within the party so far. Rebel candidates have emerged and, in many cases, they are openly challenging the central leadership.”</p><p>While Hasanuzzaman frames Rahman’s reliance on family legacy as an advantage in the election, Chowdhury sees it as a source of heightened expectation – and pressure.</p><p>“To outshine leaders like Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman is never easy,” Chowdhury said. “I do not think he has yet demonstrated that level of charisma.”</p><p>Chowdhury said the election is the first decisive test of Rahman’s leadership. “If he can lead the party to victory despite all these challenges, that would mark his first real success as a leader in his own right.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"very-little-homework\">‘Very little homework’</h2><p>Rahman’s public messaging has also drawn scrutiny. Analysts say his speeches, often combining ambitious promises with factual inaccuracies, erode confidence, especially among undecided voters.</p><p>Fact-checks of several of his claims have been widely shared online.</p><p>At a rally in the southern district of Faridpur, Rahman said the area produces large quantities of soya beans. The claim was quickly challenged, as soya bean is not a major crop there, with cultivation concentrated mainly in Bangladesh’s southern coastal belt.</p><p>In another instance, a viral graphic mocked several of his pledges as either already implemented or recycled from the 2001-2006 BNP-Jamaat-led government, including declaring the coastal city of Chattogram as the country’s “commercial capital”.</p><p>Analysts and party insiders say such episodes point to gaps in Rahman’s research and leadership, and complicate his efforts to project himself as a national leader who is prepared.</p><p>“Yes, he makes mistakes in speeches,” admitted a BNP leader in southern Bangladesh, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But he was outside the country for a long time. We believe he will improve.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Analyst Chowdhury said his lack of preparation was an issue.</p><p>“He has taken charge of the campaign, but there is very little homework,” she said. “He ends up saying many things that are simply wrong, like claiming he will plant 500 million trees. That is not a credible proposition.”</p><p>Chowdhury also questioned the feasibility of Rahman’s flagship policy proposals, including a “family card” to provide monthly cash to women and the unemployed. “Once you talk about family cards, the obvious question is where the money will come from,” she said. “And if you provide allowances to the unemployed indefinitely, there is a risk the economy becomes less productive.”</p><p>Rahman’s anticorruption rhetoric has also failed to instill confidence among people, Chowdhury said. “He is saying he will eliminate corruption, while he has nominated 23 loan defaulters for the election.”</p><p>In a televised address to the nation on Monday evening, Rahman sought to address such concerns, acknowledging past failures under the BNP’s government and pledging a hard line on corruption.</p><p>“There is no alternative to making the state and government accountable to the people,” he said. “If entrusted with power, a BNP government will be as firm as possible in controlling corruption and restoring the rule of law – this is our commitment to the nation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Khan Sobayel bin Rafiq, a political commentator and former military officer, pointed to the gap between Rahman’s personal appeal and the BNP’s ability to counter longstanding narratives about corruption within its ranks.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Young voters aged between 18 and 26 did not witness BNP rule,” Sobayel told Al Jazeera. “Many of them have internalised the idea that BNP represents corruption and ‘chandabazi’ [extortion]. The party has not been able to decisively turn that perception around.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Sobayel, who describes himself as a victim of Hasina’s hardline policies, himself spent 11 years in forced exile in Malaysia after he, as a member of a military committee investigating a 2009 mutiny by soldiers from the Bangladesh Rifles regiment, refused to endorse what he called a “fabricated investigation report” pushed by the government.</p><p>Thomas Kean, a consultant for Bangladesh and Myanmar at the International Crisis Group, thinks Bangladesh is unlikely to return to the kind of repression seen during Hasina’s long years in power. But he also warned that perceptions about the BNP at the grassroots level continue to shape the public’s trust.</p><p>“The leadership appears to recognise that something has fundamentally changed in Bangladesh,” Kean said. “At the same time, allegations of extortion and criminal activity – whether accurate or not – have damaged the party’s image, particularly among younger voters.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299914\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299914\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299914\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26040342415742-1770631988.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"BNP leader Tarique Rahman Bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rahman waves to supporters during an election rally in Dhaka, on February 9, 2026 [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"loyalty-over-meritocracy\">‘Loyalty over meritocracy’</h2><p>On Friday, while unveiling the BNP’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/analysis-bangladeshs-bnp-seeks-hasinas-liberal-mantle-before-elections\">election manifesto</a> at a luxury hotel in Dhaka, Rahman spoke about the importance of placing “the right person in the right position”.</p><p>Analysts, as well as some party insiders, said they were unsure about whether that principle was reflected in how his campaign team was assembled.</p><p>A BNP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of internal party matters during an election, said Rahman’s public communication shifted after his return, shaped by advisers who accompanied him during his years in exile.</p><p>“He brought his close aides from London, who, like him, had been away from Bangladesh for 17 years,” the leader told Al Jazeera. “A lot has changed in that time, and there is a perception that they have struggled to grasp the changed realities.”</p><p>The party insider said Rahman’s interactions with people are being tightly managed, limiting his exposure to grassroots feedback despite his extensive travels across the country. “Although he is travelling all over Bangladesh, he remains isolated from ground reality,” the BNP leader said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The party insider also alleged that Rahman “opted for loyalty over meritocracy”.</p><p>“You can run a party with people who are loyal to you, but not a government. This is his biggest challenge. If he wants to govern, he will need to promote meritocracy and bring in professionals who can offer sound advice – and that has been missing so far.”</p><p>Analyst Chowdhury agreed, saying the issue has created tensions within the BNP, with many local leaders who endured arrests and hardships during Hasina’s government feeling sidelined. This could undermine Rahman’s appeal, particularly among younger voters.</p><p>“While he was in London, the people around him there are now being given more importance than those who stood by him inside the country,” she told Al Jazeera. “There is a conflict between these groups.”</p><h2 id=\"will-dynasty-undermine-political-legitimacy\">Will dynasty undermine political legitimacy?</h2><p>Asif Mohammad Shahan, a professor of development studies at Dhaka University, thinks Rahman is in “a difficult position”.</p><p>“If the party does not win by a landslide, he will be blamed. If it wins comfortably, people will say it was expected. There is no clear win for him,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Central to both his appeal and the criticism he faces is Rahman’s lineage.</p><p>As the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and three-time leader Khaleda, he embodies a political dynasty that many younger voters say they want to move beyond, even as that legacy continues to mobilise people across the country.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299703\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_At-a-glance-1770627233.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_AT A GLANCE_Feb_9_2026_3\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>BNP leaders, however, reject the idea that being part of a dynasty undermines political legitimacy.</p><p>In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir argued that political inheritance is common across South Asia and should not disqualify a leader if he is “capable, accountable and subject to public scrutiny”.</p><p>Analysts take a more nuanced view, despite seeing Rahman as a leading contender for the premiership.</p><p>Sobayel bin Rafiq, the former military officer, distinguishes the individual and his organisation. “Tarique Rahman as a person and the BNP as a party are two different things,” he said. “I want to see him as the prime minister. But overall, the party’s performance as an organisation has not been strong.”</p><p>Analyst Chowdhury points to a different reality.</p><p>“It seems a segment of the civil and military bureaucracy may support a BNP victory because they see it as a return to a familiar status quo, where they can protect their vested interests,” she said.</p><p>For Rahman, however, the election is not just a contest for power, but a referendum on whether his return from exile marks a genuine break from the past or merely a familiar cycle under a new leadership.</p><p>“If any unintentional mistakes were made while governing the country in the past, I sincerely apologise to the people,” he said in his address to the nation on Monday. “Learning from those mistakes, and building on our achievements, we want to create a safe Bangladesh for the present and future generations.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He would not stay at a hotel or with friends. Instead, he would stay at what used to be his father’s office in Aleppo’s Old City.</p><p>There was only one problem.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Not a single room had a closable window or door,” Shaar, who had been away from the city for a decade, told Al Jazeera. Aleppo’s winters are brutally cold, with temperatures reaching well below zero degrees Celsius.</p><p>Still, he bought a sleeping bag that had been advertised as capable of withstanding extreme weather.</p><p>“That didn’t turn out to be true, and I still woke up with cold toes many nights,” he said. But despite the cold, he did not regret the decision.</p><p>Although his trip to Syria was short – about two weeks, in part due to flight cancellations after <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">armed clashes in Aleppo</a> – Shaar started renovating his old family home, also in the Old City, that had been looted and damaged during the war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The roof was collapsing, and the door to the street had been removed. Two weeks did not seem to be enough time to make a dent in the extensive renovation work required.</p><p>But he got the job done, and placed a metal door on the house to signal that it was no longer an abandoned property.</p><p>“I was happy. I was truly, truly happy to be in Aleppo, not as a guest or as a tourist, but as an Aleppan,” he said. “As someone who is home. And I felt at home.”</p><p>Thousands of Syrians are returning to Aleppo, a great city damaged by years of neglect and war. Much of it, however, is plagued by infrastructure damage, requiring significant reconstruction efforts.</p><p>The new Syrian government – in power since December 2024 – has already started some of the work to rebuild Aleppo. But residents wonder if this will be enough to bring the city back to its past glory.</p><h2 id=\"years-of-damage\">Years of damage</h2><p>Aleppo was Syria’s most populous city until the war heavily reduced its population.</p><p>Its geographical position made it an important stop on the Silk Road trade route, as well as for travellers who passed through Anatolia – a large peninsula in Turkiye – eastwards into Iraq or further south towards Damascus.</p><p>While the emergence of Egypt’s Suez Canal in international shipping diminished Aleppo’s regional role, it still maintained an importance in Syria for being the country’s capital of industry.</p><p>Its prominence lasted throughout the rule of President Hafez al-Assad, who took control of Syria in 1970. The Assad regime’s massacre in the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/hama-a-rebellious-syrian-town-that-can-finally-mourn-the-assad-massacre\">town of Hama</a> in the early 1980s also spread to Aleppo, where thousands of opponents were killed. Still, the city held on.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>However, by the time the 2011 Syrian uprising came around, Aleppo had already faced a lack of state investment and neglect.</p><p>The city deteriorated further as Bashar al-Assad, who took over the presidency when Hafez, his father, died in 2000, violently cracked down, and Syria deteriorated into war. Aleppo soon became divided, with regime forces controlling the west and the opposition controlling the east.</p><p>Then, in 2016, the Assad regime, with the help of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Iran and Russia, violently took the eastern part of the city, which had become the capital of the Syrian revolution. In the process, they <a href=\"/news/2017/11/17/totally-destroyed-east-aleppo-a-year-after-battle\">destroyed vast swaths</a> of east Aleppo, expelling thousands.</p><p>As the Assad regime fell a little more than eight years later, some of Aleppo’s <a href=\"/features/2024/12/22/displaced-youth-liberate-aleppo\">children returned as its liberators</a>. But they found that the regime had not rebuilt the city during their absence. Many of Aleppo’s suburbs, where Syrian production had flourished in the pre-war years, were now ghost towns, after the regime had cut off water and electricity services.</p><p>Aleppo is still struggling. Informal settlements and overcrowded schools are common in the city and the rest of northern Syria, where a European Union <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/funding/hip2026/echo_syr_bud_2026_91000_v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> in January said that “2.3 million people reside in camps and informal settlements, of which 80 [percent] are women and children”.</p><p>Locals say they fear Aleppo may never be the same again.</p><p>“There is nothing that will return to the same as it was,” Roger Asfar, an Aleppo-native and the Syrian country director for the Adyan Foundation, an independent organisation focused on citizenship, diversity management and community engagement, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Asfar said that Aleppo’s needs are the same as all parts of Syria devastated by more than a decade of war. Reconstruction is among the top priorities, but it will require heavy investment, particularly if the city’s historic character is to be protected.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reconstruction\">Reconstruction</h2><p>The Syrian government has worked with organisations like the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) to restore parts of Aleppo’s Old City, including its historic souk – a 13km-long (8 miles) covered marketplace.</p><p>The government also installed water pipes and new lighting around the city’s historic citadel, its crown jewel and a tourist attraction for both Syrians and foreigners. The municipality of Aleppo has also collaborated with the Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums to rehabilitate parts of the citadel, as well as the Old City’s Grand Umayyad Mosque.</p><p>Still, the effort to rebuild Aleppo is Herculean and will require more investment.</p><p>Asfar said the challenge starts with governance. This requires that Damascus, instead of merely imposing its decisions on the city, consults with locals. “Aleppo doesn’t need an authority that decides on its own and ignores all other voices,” he said.</p><p>The Aleppo governorate, which includes the city and eight districts in northern Syria, is Syria’s most densely populated region, according to UNICEF. Its 4.2 million population is forced to live with the problems facing much of Syria, including infrastructural issues and long power cuts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Shaar, the Aleppan native who recently visited his hometown, is also a founding scholar on the Aleppo Project, a Central European University project that aims to address the key issues facing the city’s eventual reconstruction.</p><p>He said he expects infrastructural issues to “improve in the coming years”, particularly as Syria’s oil and gas revenues increase. But he warns that expectations should be tempered.</p><p>Shaar is one Aleppan who holds out hope that the city may bounce back. He pointed out that a silver lining of Assad’s neglect is that the city had not become gentrified by the former government’s economic and political elites, unlike Homs or Damascus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"to-return-or-not-to-return\">To return or not to return?</h2><p>Aleppo has always been a city defined by its culture and diversity. Some Aleppans hope this of its character will return.</p><p>Musician Bassel Hariri is an Aleppo native, now based in London, who learned to play instruments from his father. He remembers the rich and diverse tradition of his native city, which has been passed on from one generation to the next.</p><p>“Music, art, cooking, whatever – everything is carried directly from the community,” Hariri said. “And this richness and this cultural access and the diversity of Aleppo makes it one of the most wonderful cities in Syria.”</p><p>While the city may not return to its past glory, thousands of Syrians are still coming back to their homes in Aleppo and its countryside. Others simply have nowhere else to go.</p><p>For Shaar, Aleppo is still calling. Two things are keeping him away: his wife’s full-time job as a lecturer in Germany, and the lack of a stable salary in Syria.</p><p>“Not much more than this,” he said. “It wouldn’t take much to bring me back to Aleppo, personally.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
