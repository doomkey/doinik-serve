December 30:</p><h2 id=\"alleged-attack-on-putin-s-residence\">Alleged attack on Putin’s residence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said that an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/kyiv-rejects-russias-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putins-residence\">attack took place</a> on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence in northwestern Russia’s Novgorod on Sunday, “practically immediately after” talks in Florida between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</li>\n<li>The strike “will not go unanswered”, Ushakov said in remarks reported by Russian media, following a call between Trump and Putin.</li>\n<li>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russian air defence systems shot down 91 long-range strike drones used in the attack and that no one was injured.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/29/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putin-residence\">denied the claim</a>, accusing Russia of trying to derail peace talks.</li>\n<li>However, Trump expressed anger over the alleged attack, telling reporters: “I was very angry about it.” When asked if the United States had evidence of the attack, Trump said, “We’ll find out.”</li>\n<li>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that “the response to Kyiv’s attacks will not be diplomatic” and that Russia would be revising its negotiating position in the attack’s wake.</li>\n<li>The United Arab Emirates’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “strongly condemned” the “deplorable attack” and “the threat it poses to security and stability”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy\">Diplomacy</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that a phone call between Putin and Trump on the issue of Ukraine on Monday was “positive”, without elaborating.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he spoke by phone with the leaders of Germany, Latvia and Finland to update them on the outcomes of his meeting with Trump and where peace negotiations stood.</li>\n<li>Lavrov said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA Novosti that “Kyiv and its Western backers must recognise the new territorial realities that have emerged following the incorporation of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the  Luhansk People’s Republic, and the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions into the Russian Federation.” He was referring to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions that Moscow claims to have annexed, which include Donetsk and Luhansk, renamed by Russian-backed separatists as the DPR and LPR.</li>\n<li>A survey published by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation (DIF), a Ukrainian think tank, on Monday showed that recognising occupied Ukrainian territories “as part of the Russian Federation” remained deeply unpopular in Ukraine, with 76 percent of Ukrainians saying they considered it “unacceptable”.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"fighting\">Fighting</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces attacked the front-line town of Orikhiv in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, killing a 46-year-old man and wounding a 49-year-old woman, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces killed one person and injured five in attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region on Sunday, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, said on Telegram that Russian forces killed seven civilians who had been hiding in a basement in the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said it had launched an investigation into reports that Russian soldiers shot dead two captured Ukrainian soldiers in the village of Shakhove, Pokrovsky, on Saturday.</li>\n<li>“The deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and qualifies as a grave international crime,” the prosecutor general’s office said.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks injured five civilians in Russia’s Belgorod region, according to Russia’s TASS state news agency, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks also injured four civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia, and three civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Donetsk, TASS reported, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>In a televised address from the Kremlin, Putin made a wide range of claims about Moscow’s ongoing war on Ukraine, including that Russian troops were advancing towards the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia.</li>\n<li>General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s army chief, said during the same address that Russian forces had captured 6,460 square kilometres (2,494sq miles) of territory in Ukraine in 2025, including 334 villages.</li>\n<li>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quoted its director general, Rafael Grossi, as saying that power line repairs near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had been successfully completed.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

It is an opportunity,” Miller claimed.</p><p>Many other countries expressed concerns about Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, including the implications for Palestinians, in statements presented to the UNSC.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the 22-member Arab League, its UN envoy, Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz, said the group rejected “any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people, or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases”.</p><p>Pakistan’s deputy UN ambassador, Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon, said at the meeting that Israel’s “unlawful recognition of [the] Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling”, considering it was made “against the backdrop of Israel’s previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza”.</p><p>China and the United Kingdom were among the permanent UNSC members to reject the move, with China’s UN envoy, Sun Lei, saying his country “opposes any act to split” Somalia’s territory.</p><p>“No country should aid and abet separatist forces in other countries to further their own geopolitical interests,” Sun Lei said.</p><p>Some non-members of the UNSC also requested to speak, including South Africa, whose UN envoy, Mathu Joyini, said that her country “reaffirmed” Somalia’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” in line with international law, the UN Charter and the constitutive act of the African Union.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"comparison-with-palestinian-recognition\">Comparison with Palestinian recognition</h2><p>In addition to defending Israel’s decision, US envoy Bruce compared the move to recognise Somaliland with Palestine, which has been recognised by more than <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/which-are-the-150-countries-that-have-recognised-palestine-as-of-2025\">150 of the UN’s member states</a>.</p><p>“Several countries, including members of this council, have unilaterally recognised a non-existent Palestinian state, yet no emergency meeting has been convened,” Bruce said, criticising what she described as the UNSC’s “double standards”.</p><p>However, Slovenia’s UN ambassador, Samuel Zbogar, rejected the comparison, saying, “Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory… Palestine is also an observer state in this organisation [the UN].”</p><p>“Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a UN member state, and recognising it goes against… the UN Charter,” Zbogar added.</p><p>The self-declared Republic of Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991, after a civil war under military leader Siad Barre.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Our homes, workplaces, sporting fields, and public spaces no longer feel secure.”</p><p>The response of Albanese’s Labor government to the attack, including proposals to tighten gun laws and introduce tougher legislation against hate speech, was “not nearly enough,” the families said.</p><p>“The dangerous rise of antisemitism and radicalism in Australia is not going away,” they said.</p><p>“We need strong action now. We need leadership now.”</p><p>The calls for an inquiry into anti-Semitism came as Albanese on Monday announced the terms of an independent review into whether law enforcement and intelligence agencies could have done more to prevent the attack.</p><p>Albanese and his government colleagues have resisted calls for a public inquiry into the attack, arguing that such a process would take years and could undermine social cohesion by platforming extremist voices.</p><p>Albanese told a news conference that the review, led by former intelligence chief Dennis Richardson, would examine what authorities knew about the suspected gunmen before the attack and information sharing between federal and state agencies, among other issues.</p><p>“Just over two weeks ago, anti-Semitic terrorists tried to tear our country apart, but our country is stronger than these cowards,” Albanese said.</p><p>“They went to Bondi Beach to unleash mass murder against our Jewish community. We need to respond with unity and urgency rather than division and delay.”</p><p>Anti-Jewish sentiment, as well as anti-Islam and anti-immigration sentiment, are rising in Australia. Many Australians have expressed their concerns over a rise in right-wing extremism in the country, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.</p><p>In September, thousands of people held rallies in cities, including Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, demanding an end to “mass migration”.</p><p>The Australian government has condemned the rallies, which took place under the banner of “March for Australia”, as racist, while Minister for Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly said the gatherings were “organised by Nazis”.</p><p>The group behind “March for Australia” said on its website and social media that “mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together” and that its rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration”.</p><p>But Australia also experienced a sharp rise in both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic incidents since October 7, 2023.</p><p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which supports the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, documented 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents nationwide between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025, after more than 2,060 incidents the previous year.</p><p>The Islamophobia Register Australia recorded 309 in-person incidents of Islamophobia and 366 online incidents between January 1, 2023 and November 31, 2024.</p><p>Numerous rights organisations, including some Jewish groups, have criticised the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, arguing that it has been used to conflate legitimate criticism of Israel – particularly of its genocidal war on Gaza – with anti-Jewish bigotry.</p><p>One of Albanese’s highest-profile critics in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – he blamed Albanese’s government for failing to protect Australia’s Jewish community and also linked the shooting to Australia’s recent decision to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/canada-australia-join-uk-in-recognising-palestinian-statehood\">recognise Palestinian statehood</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tipu has since spent his days on the pavement opposite the hospital gate, promising to stay put until he receives news of her recovery.</p><p>“She is like my mother. She sacrificed everything for democracy,” he told Al Jazeera. “My only prayer is that God allows her to see the upcoming election,” he added, referring to the national elections scheduled for February 12.</p><p>But it was not to be.

Rahman – who had stabilised the country after years of coups and counter-coups – left behind a fragile political order and a governing party, the BNP, that was suddenly without its founder.</p><p>Although Khaleda had not been politically active during her husband’s presidency, senior BNP leaders saw her as the only figure who could unify the party’s competing factions and preserve Rahman’s legacy.</p><p>After Rahman’s death, Vice President Abdus Sattar became acting president and later won an election. But within months, army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in March 1982, imposing martial law. It was in this volatile context – with the military back in control and political parties fighting for survival – that Khaleda began her ascent, eventually emerging as a central civilian figure challenging hardline rule.</p><p>Khaleda joined the BNP as a general member in January 1982, became its vice chair in 1983, and was elected party chairperson in August 1984. In the decades that followed, she would win three elections to become prime minister in a political landscape that she dominated alongside her longtime rival, Sheikh Hasina, and her Awami League party.</p><p>Her public life unfolded alongside personal struggles: her elder son, Tarique Rahman, went into exile in 2008 after being arrested during a military-backed caretaker government’s anticorruption drive; her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko, died of cardiac arrest in 2015 while living abroad. Khaleda herself later spent long periods in prison after her 2018 convictions in corruption cases brought under the Awami League government, followed by years of political isolation and deteriorating health.</p><p>Tarique eventually returned to Dhaka on December 25, after the cases against him were dropped by the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took office after Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] entire life was filled with hardship, yet she chose her country over personal comfort,” said Dilara Choudhury, a political scientist who observed both Khaleda and her husband closely. “That is why she is remembered across political lines as one of the most emblematic leaders of her time.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203068\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203068\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203068 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1996-02-13T120000Z_1761746045_PBEAHUMSTEL_RTRMADP_3_ZIA-1767066438.jpg?resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt='Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia speaks to reporters from below an Islamic inscription in Arabic reads \"God is one and Mohamad is his prophet\" February 13 in Dhaka.

Zia would later inherit her husband’s politics – centred on nationalism, multi-party democracy and a market-oriented economy.</p><p>From 1978 to 1981, she lived with her family in a modest military residence at 6 Moinul Road in Dhaka Cantonment, then designated as the residence of the deputy chief of the army, where then-Captain (later Colonel) Harunur Rashid Khan served as an aide-de-camp to her husband, President Rahman.</p><p>“She coordinated the house herself, welcomed guests and managed family matters,” Colonel Khan told Al Jazeera. “I never saw her raise her voice. She was humble, kind and thoughtful.”</p><p>He recalled her calm approach to parenting. When her younger son, Arafat, then aged 7, struggled to gain admission to a school, she asked only for other alternative school options. And when the boy later injured himself imitating a television stunt, she expressed no anger towards the staff who were supposed to be minding him.</p><p>“That was the kind of person she was,” Khan said. “Graceful, composed and considerate.”</p><p>But everything changed on May 30, 1981.</p><p>At dawn that day, Khan learned that Rahman had been assassinated in the port city of Chattogram, in an attempted coup by a group of army officers. The coup would eventually be crushed by Ershad, Rahman’s army chief, though Ershad would himself grab power months later.</p><p>“For a moment [after learning of the assassination], I felt the ground slip beneath my feet; but I did not share the information with Madam [Begum Zia] for moments,” Khan said.</p><p>Fearing that the family residence might be the next target, he immediately ordered an entire company of about 120 soldiers to be ready to defend the family.</p><p>In the early morning, the two boys came out of their bedrooms, preparing to leave for school, but Khan stopped them. Minutes later, Khaleda stepped out of her bedroom. “She asked me, ‘What has happened?’ I told her there was unrest outside,” he said.</p><p>Without asking anything else, she retreated to her bedroom as a member of the house staff switched on the radio, and the announcement of her husband’s death filled the room.</p><p>“She stepped back, looked at my eyes, and she understood,” the former aide-de-camp said. “She sank into the floor.”</p><p>Khan remained to support the family for two more months. “She was mentally shattered,” he said.</p><p>As Rahman had left no other personal residence for his family, the government later permanently allocated the house at 6 Moinul Road to Khaleda, and she lived there until she was evicted in 2010 by Hasina’s administration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203072\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203072 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1995-06-16T120000Z_700472488_PBEAHUNBVDF_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-1767066566.jpg?resize=770%2C563&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia (L) and Finance Minister Saifur Rahman discuss Bangladesh's 1995/96 budget placed in parliament June 15.

After taking over as president, the army chief suspended the constitution and imposed martial law.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s, the BNP and the Awami League – the two largest political parties – led parallel but often coordinated street movements calling for the restoration of parliamentary democracy.</p><p>According to Choudhury, the political scientist, a key turning point arrived in 1986, when Ershad announced a national election that the opposition denounced as unconstitutional, because martial law remained in force and political freedoms were restricted. While the Awami League eventually chose to contest the polls, the BNP, under Khaleda’s stewardship, boycotted the election.</p><p>“Her decision to boycott the 1986 election – which she denounced as illegal even as the Awami League participated – reinforced her public image as someone unwilling to trade principle for expediency,” Choudhury said.</p><p>Repeated house arrests under the Ershad regime cemented this perception. “Khaleda Zia was unwavering in her objective to remove Ershad and restore democracy,” Choudhury said. “Her readiness to endure arrest, even in ill health, earned her respect.”</p><p>The 1991 election – the first after the end of military government in December 1990 – produced a hung parliament. The BNP won 140 seats, short of the 151 needed to form a government. The Awami League won 88 seats, the Jatiya Party 35 and Jamaat-e-Islami 18.</p><p>Jamaat chief Ghulam Azam opened negotiations with Hasina. Meanwhile, Golam Wahed Choudhury, the husband of Dilara Choudhury and a former minister of communications of undivided Pakistan, arranged a discreet meeting at his Dhaka residence, bringing together Khaleda, Jamaat leaders Ghulam Azam and Motiur Rahman Nizami, and the army chief, Lieutenant General Nuruddin.</p><p>Khaleda arrived alone, without informing other BNP leaders. The negotiations ultimately paved the way to allow Bangladeshi citizenship for two very contrasting political figures.</p><p>Jamaat chief Azam, who had supported Pakistan during the war of independence, had previously been stripped of his citizenship as a result. Kader Siddique, a prominent 1971 war hero aligned with the Awami League’s political legacy, had been in exile in India after leading his private militia against the government and military following the 1975 assassination of Hasina’s husband, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – the leader of the country’s independence struggle and its first prime minister and president.</p><p>In return, Jamaat agreed to back the BNP in parliament, giving Khaleda the numbers needed to form a government.</p><p>“This negotiation showed her political prudence and firmness,” Choudhury said. “It could easily have failed.”</p><p>Khaleda was sworn in as Bangladesh’s first elected female prime minister, joining a line of South Asian women who had already held the region’s highest offices, including Indira Gandhi, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Benazir Bhutto.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203074 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1997-10-07T120000Z_1945019786_PBEAHUMPXBI_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-1767066707.jpg?resize=770%2C499&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Workers produce export quality garments at a Bangladesh factory in Dhaka October 6.

She succeeded in many areas.”</p><p>Supporters credit Khaleda’s government with policies aimed at stabilising a state emerging from years of hardline government. Her administration pursued economic liberalisation, export-led growth, revival of industry, expansion of the garment sector, and wider access to education – particularly for girls. Her tenure also coincided with the expansion of a relatively free press.</p><p>When her last elected term ended in 2006, Bangladesh’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate stood at about 7 percent – one of the highest in the country’s post-independence history and well above the average of roughly 4.8 percent in the 1990s, as well as about 3.8 percent in the 1980s. At that time, the World Bank described Bangladesh as “Asia’s next tiger economy”.</p><p>Her administrations, however, drew criticism, too.</p><p>In 1995, an acute fertiliser shortage and a resulting sharp increase in prices – driven by hoarding and distribution failures at a crucial time for the winter paddy crop – led to protests by thousands of farmers. Police opened fire in several districts: At least a dozen farmers and one officer died in clashes, an incident that damaged her government’s reputation amid widespread rural frustration.</p><p>During her 2001–2006 term, critics accused her elder son, Tarique, of building an alleged parallel centre of influence around his political office, widely known as Hawa Bhaban.</p><p>Allegations of corruption and claims that key decisions were being influenced through this parallel structure fuelled persistent questions about governance under her watch.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203078\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203078\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203078 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2006-10-28T000000Z_177212197_GM1DTUXWEYAA_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-1767066909.jpg?resize=770%2C532&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh's Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia addresses a Bangladesh Nationalist Party rally in Dhaka October 28, 2006.

A 1994 by-election in the Magura-2 parliamentary constituency was widely criticised as having been manipulated to benefit the BNP. Later, towards the end of her 2001–06 term, Zia was accused of trying to install a partisan caretaker government tasked with carrying out the next election.</p><p>Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed, the author of the book Khaleda – an independent historical account of the former prime minister’s legacy – pointed to other instances that he said hurt her credibility.</p><p>A grenade attack on a rally of Hasina’s then-opposition Awami League on August 21, 2004, in Dhaka, killed at least 24 people and injured hundreds. The investigation under the BNP-led government was widely criticised for failing to promptly pursue credible leads into the role of Islamist armed groups, including Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which investigators ultimately blamed for the attack.</p><p>A Dhaka court in 2018 convicted several individuals in connection with the attack. However, subsequent appeals and High Court rulings have overturned some convictions and acquitted others. Questions about accountability for the attack remain unresolved for many Bangladeshis.</p><p>In another incident, in April 2004, police and the coastguard intercepted a large consignment of illegal weapons believed to be destined for the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), an armed separatist group in India’s Assam region.</p><p>“These incidents deepened political hostility at home and created significant discomfort in Bangladesh’s relations with neighbouring India,” Ahmed told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Zia’s missteps during her 2001-06 government contributed to the political instability that culminated in a military-backed takeover of power on January 11, 2007.</p><p>The army’s senior leadership then pressed then-President Iajuddin Ahmed to declare a state of emergency, resign as chief adviser of the sitting caretaker government and cancel elections scheduled for later that month. With the army’s backing, former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed was appointed chief adviser of a new interim caretaker government tasked with stabilising the country and preparing for future elections.</p><p>The move effectively sidelined both Khaleda and Hasina from front-line politics for nearly two years.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] party created the circumstances [for the events of January 11, 2007], and the party – as well as her family – eventually became the victims of it,” Ahmed said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203083\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203083\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203083 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T124237Z_1166516131_RC2MNIAXK4XY_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-BNP-1767067222.jpg?resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman addresses his supporters after his return from London, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 25, 2025.

He was referring to the years of imprisonment, political persecution and sustained pressure endured by her and her family.</p><p>“Right or wrong, she rarely walked back from her stated positions, which we did not see among other contemporary politicians,” Ahmed said, citing her firmness during the anti-Ershad movement and her insistence on elections only under caretaker governments.</p><p>That she became the first woman to occupy the nation’s highest elected office in a socially conservative society traditionally sceptical of female leadership will always also remain a part of her legacy.</p><p>Her refusal to flee the country during crises – whether after January 2007, when her elder son was forced into exile as they faced numerous cases, or when she faced retribution under Hasina – also helped hold the BNP together, say analysts.</p><p>“She could have left, but she chose to stay and face the consequences. That determination set her apart,” Ahmed said.</p><p>The political historian also pointed to Khaleda’s restraint in political language. “Even when she was targeted with harsh propaganda and abusive remarks, she did not respond in that manner.”</p><p>Her message following the fall of Hasina in August 2024 was an example.</p><p>Freed from house arrest on August 6, after student-led protests forced Hasina to flee to India, Khaleda urged her supporters not to pursue retaliation.</p><p>“For many, it was an almost unimaginable moment,” Mohiuddin said. “She avoided inflammatory language even when the political tide turned in her favour.”</p><p>For many everyday Bangladeshis, this trait is central to how she will be remembered. “Both Hasina and Khaleda ruled the country well, but in my opinion, Khaleda did better,” said 77-year-old Nazim Uddin, speaking to Al Jazeera in early December while chatting with friends outside a commercial complex not far from Evercare Hospital.</p><p>But a key question now looms: What awaits the BNP in a post-Khaleda era?</p><p>At the centre of any answer to that question is Khaleda’s only surviving son, Tarique Rahman.</p><p>“Like the Awami League, the BNP has become a one-person-centric party,” political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed said. “With Tarique Rahman’s leadership still untested, the BNP is likely to face a serious leadership crisis.”</p><p>But others disagree.</p><p>Choudhury, the political scientist who knew Khaleda well, said that the BNP would now unite under Tarique. “There will be no division in the party,” she said.</p><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, the former minister under Khaleda, said that he believes Tarique, who has led the party as acting chair since 2018 from exile in the United Kingdom, has already “taken up the torch that his mother carried from his father, Ziaur Rahman”.</p><p>Tarique was greeted with a significant show of support by the party faithful when he returned to Dhaka from exile on Christmas Day, weeks ahead of the national election, in which the BNP is in a close race for poll position with its former ally, the Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>In his first comments since returning, Tarique spoke of wanting to build an inclusive Bangladesh. Some experts believe the 60-year-old might also be able to repair ties with India, which have suffered since Hasina’s removal and her decision to flee to New Delhi. Though India and the BNP have traditionally not enjoyed warm ties, with New Delhi preferring Hasina’s Awami League as its partner in Dhaka, both have sent overtures to each other in recent days.</p><p>Now the BNP’s, and Tarique’s, big test awaits: February’s elections will not just determine who leads Bangladesh, but could reveal whether the country trusts Khaleda’s heir to continue her legacy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She married army officer Ziaur Rahman in 1960 when she was about 15.

Both women were detained for more than a year.</p><p>Hasina later dominated, ruling from 2008 until her violent overthrow in 2024.</p><p>In 2018, Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister – charges she denounced as part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.</p><p>She ‍was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.

The letter, written on December 17, raised “grave concern” about the prisoners’ health, warning they were at high risk of organ failure, irreversible neurological damage, cardiac arrhythmias and death.</p><p>Lawyers for the hunger-striking detainees said last week that they had initiated legal proceedings against the government, alleging it had abandoned its own prison safety policy. The detainees said they have written repeatedly to Lammy and other justice officials without receiving a response.</p><p>James Timpson, the UK minister of state for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said the government would not engage directly with the hunger strikers or their representatives.</p><p>“We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes,” Timpson said. “Over the last five years, we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year. I do not treat any prisoners differently to others. We have a justice system based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And we don’t want that.”</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Hamas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The first phase of the ceasefire, which went into effect on October 10, calls for the exchange of Israeli captives held by Hamas for Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel, as well as an increase in aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal in Gaza.</p><p>Hamas is yet to return the body of one Israeli captive, while Israel, in addition to continued deadly attacks, has restricted the entry of aid and delayed the opening of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.</p><p>But Trump heaped the blame solely on Hamas for the delay in moving towards the second phase of the truce. The armed group has previously said it will not give up its weapons as long as Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory continues, but was willing to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/hamas-has-its-own-disarmament-vision-as-gaza-truce-enters-critical-phase\">set them aside</a> and offered a long truce of seven to 10 years.</p><h2 id=\"strikes-on-iran\">Strikes on Iran</h2><p>Trump went on to suggest that Iran may be working to restore its nuclear programme after the US <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">air strikes</a> in June damaged three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But, hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>If Iran was trying to build up its nuclear programme again, “we’re going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup”, he said. The consequences of such a move could be “more powerful than the last time”.</p><p>“We know exactly where they’re going, what they’re doing, and I hope they’re not doing it, because we don’t want to waste fuel on a B-2,” Trump added, referring to the bomber used in the earlier strike. “It’s a 37-hour trip both ​ways. I don’t want to waste a lot of fuel.”</p><p>The US president declined to offer evidence to support his allegations against Iran. But he added that the US and Israel have been “extremely victorious” against their enemies, and that if the US “didn’t beat Iran, you wouldn’t have had peace in the Middle East”.</p><p>When asked whether the US would back an Israeli attack on Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/netanyahu-pushes-for-iran-conflict-clashing-with-trumps-priorities\">missile programme</a>, Trump said, “If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear? Fast. OK? One will be: Yes, absolutely. The other is: We’ll do it immediately.”</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Iran.</p><p>Tehran has denied seeking to build a nuclear weapon and ruled out negotiating over its missile programme, which is at the core of its defence strategy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During the conflict in June, sometimes referred to as the 12-day war, Iran fired hundreds of missiles in response to Israeli attacks that killed the country’s top generals, several nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, an Iran hawk who is close to Trump, visited Israel this month and repeated the Netanyahu government’s talking points about the dangers of Iran’s long-range missiles. He warned that Iran is producing them “in very high numbers”.</p><p>“We cannot allow Iran to produce ballistic missiles because they could overwhelm the Iron Dome,” he told The Jerusalem Post, referring to Israel’s air defence system. “It’s a major threat.”</p><h2 id=\"much-harsher-response\">‘Much harsher’ response</h2><p>On Monday, Trump said Iran should “make a deal” with the US.</p><p>“If they want to make a deal, that’s much smarter,” Trump said. “You know, they could have made a deal the last time, before we went through a big attack on them, and they decided not to make the deal. They wish they made that deal.”</p><p>While the US has brokered three ceasefires involving its longtime ally – between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, and Israel and Lebanon – Netanyahu is wary of Israel’s ​foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in multiple wars.</p><p>Overall, Trump’s comments suggest he remains firmly in Netanyahu’s camp, even as some aides have privately questioned the Israeli leader’s commitment to ‌the Gaza ceasefire. Trump’s comments also suggest that he is willing to risk additional hostilities related to Gaza and Iran, even as the US president has taken credit for resolving Israel’s wars in both places.</p><p>The sabre-rattling on Monday also came weeks after the Trump administration released a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">National Security Strategy</a> that called for the US to shift its foreign policy resources away from the Middle East and instead focus on the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>But advocates of the strategy warn that another episode of attacking Iran may escalate into a longer, broader war.</p><p>In June, Iran responded to the US strikes with a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/hld-irans-attack-on-al-udeid-air-base-in-qatar-all-you-need-to-know\">missile attack</a> against a US airbase in Qatar, which did not result in any US casualties. Trump announced a ceasefire to end the war shortly after the Iranian response.</p><p>Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a US think tank that promotes diplomacy, told Al Jazeera last week that the Iranian response would be “much harsher” if the country is attacked again.</p><p>“The Iranians understand that, unless they strike back hard and dispel the view that Iran is a country that you can bomb every six months, unless they do that, Iran will become a country that Israel will bomb every six months,” Parsi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It can’t exert enough power to bring those minority groups into the fold,” he said, adding that it also doesn’t want to do so in an “oppressive or repressive way that would only alienate them further”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Over the next few days, Geist Pinfold said, there could be two potential outcomes.</p><p>“The positive outcome would be that the Syrian government reaches some kind of understanding or a tentative understanding with the SDF in eastern Syria that points towards a kind of roadmap for a future integration,” he noted, adding that such a step could ease tensions not only in eastern Syria but in other regions as well.</p><p>However, he warned that continued violence could spark deeper ethnic and sectarian divides.</p><p>“Syria stands on the edge of a very, very dangerous precipice,” he cautioned, comparing the risk to Iraq’s descent into mass sectarian violence after the 2003 United States-led invasion.</p></div></div></body></html>"
