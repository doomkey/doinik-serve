Taiwan</a>, one of Washington’s largest-ever weapons packages for the self-ruled island, which Beijing has promised to unify with mainland China.</p><p>The US State Department announced the deal late

HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS – worth more than $4bn – defence systems that are similar to what the US had been providing Ukraine to defend against Russian aerial attacks.</p><p>The deal also includes 60 self-propelled howitzer artillery systems and related equipment worth more than $4bn and drones valued at more than $1bn.</p><p>Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1bn, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700m, helicopter spare parts worth $96m and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91m.</p><p>In a series of separate statements announcing details of the weapons deal, the Pentagon said the sales served US national, economic and security interests by supporting Taiwan’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a “credible defensive capability”.</p><p>Taiwan’s defence ministry and presidential office <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/1768\">welcomed the news</a> while China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Washington’s huge sale of arms to Taiwan will likely infuriate China, which claims

would continue to reform its defence sector and “strengthen whole-of-society defence resilience” to “demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves, and safeguard peace through strength”.</p><p>China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday that it opposed efforts by the US Congress to pass bills “related to Taiwan and firmly opposes any form of military contact between the US and Taiwan”.</p><p>“We urge the US to abide by the one China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-US joint communiques : Stop ‘arming Taiwan’, stop reviewing relevant bills, and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs,” the office’s spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement.</p><p>Zhu said Taiwan’s political leaders were pursuing “independence”, and were “willing to let external forces turn the island into a ‘war porcupine’,” which could result in the population becoming “cannon fodder” and “slaughtered at will, which is despicable”.</p><p><a

Additionally, more than 25 dialects are spoken primarily across the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>Every year on December 18, the United Nations commemorates World Arabic Language Day, celebrating Arabic as “the pillar of the cultural diversity of humanity”. The date was chosen to mark the day in 1973 on which the UN General Assembly <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/191371?ln=en&amp;v=pdf\">adopted Arabic</a> as one of its six official languages.</p><p>In the following visual explainer, Al Jazeera lists some of the most common words in today’s English language that originated from Arabic or passed through Arabic before reaching English.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179364\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179364\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179364\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-World-Arabic-Language-Day-map-1765976626.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - World Arabic Language Day map-1765976626\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-arabic-words-entered-other-languages\">How Arabic words entered other languages</h2><p>As the most spoken of the Semitic languages, a group of languages that originated across Southwest Asia and Africa, Arabic has influenced societies and other languages for centuries.</p><p>Linguists say the presence of Arabic words in other languages reflects long histories of contact through trade, scholarship and cultural exchange.</p><p>English, Spanish, French, Turkish and many other languages across the globe have borrowed hundreds to thousands of words from Arabic that are used in everyday language.</p><p>Muntasir Al Hamad, a linguist and professor of Arabic at Qatar University, says this type of borrowing is a “natural phenomenon” and languages have borrowed from one another for centuries.</p><p>“Arabic is no different in that sense. This is reflected in vocabulary, science, technology and civilisation,” he tells Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"an-alphabet-with-many-forms\">An alphabet with many forms</h2><p>Arabic uses an alphabet of 28 letters and is written from right to left. The script is cursive, and its letters change shape depending on their position in a word. Short vowels are typically omitted in everyday writing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179362\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179362\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-The-Arabic-alphabet-Arabic-Language-day-1765976624.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - The Arabic alphabet - Arabic Language day-1765976624\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>These features, together with Arabic’s extensive vocabulary, have contributed to the perception that the language is difficult for non-native speakers to learn.</p><p>However, Al Hamad says this perception is far from accurate for many people.</p><p>“One of the biggest misconceptions about Arabic is that it is among the most difficult languages in the world,” he said. “In reality, it is simply a language with systems that differ from English or from many European languages.”</p><p>He added that while the Arabic script may appear unfamiliar to some learners, it is “quite familiar” to speakers of other languages, such as Urdu and Farsi. Speakers of those languages, Al Hamad says, often find Arabic easier to read while Turkish speakers may find its vocabulary easier to memorise due to the thousands of Arabic words Turkish has absorbed.</p><h2 id=\"from-a-for-algebra-to-t-for-tariffs\">From A for algebra to T for tariffs</h2><p>One of the biggest contributions the Arabic language has made to the world is in the fields of mathematics and science.</p><p>Over time, some of these words entered other languages in shortened or adapted forms, becoming so familiar that their origins are often forgotten.</p><p>One example is algebra, a cornerstone of mathematics. The term comes from the Arabic word al-jabr, meaning “restoration” or “reunion”. It originally appeared in the title of a ninth-century work on solving equations by the Baghdad-based Persian scholar Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, after whom the word “algorithm” is derived.</p><p>Other Arabic words underwent more dramatic transformations. Carat, the unit used to measure the weight of gemstones, traces its roots to the Arabic word qirat.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179838\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Common-English-words-with-Arabic-roots-1765989016.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Common English words with Arabic roots-1765989016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>According to Al Hamad, these changes reveal how English and other languages adapt unfamiliar sounds. “Because English has relatively few words beginning with Q,” he explains, “Arabic words such as qirat were reshaped using more familiar sounds like C, G or K, producing forms such as carat.”</p><p>The same process can be seen in everyday vocabulary beyond science and mathematics. The word giraffe, for instance, comes from the Arabic zarafa, and went through a similar transformation as English and other European languages reshaped the original sounds to fit their own phonetic patterns, much as they did with words beginning with the Arabic letter Q.</p><p>On the other hand, words such as tariff, which is derived from the Arabic word ta’rif, meaning “to notify” or “to announce”, entered English through contact with other languages involved in trade.</p><p>Al Hamad says these words “most likely entered the English language via Romance languages” although not necessarily in the forms we recognise today. He adds that they also passed through Turkish, which “borrowed heavily from Arabic” and influenced the medieval world through trade and warfare. Later, during the British colonial era, English both borrowed from and contributed words directly to Arabic.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But boy, are we making progress. Nobody can believe what’s going on,” Trump said.</p><p>Egg prices had seen a massive, temporary spike to record highs in February – early in Trump’s term – due to an outbreak of bird flu.</p><p>Trump said the <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/25/prices-increase-as-americans-prepare-for-thanksgiving\">price of turkey</a> plunged by 33 percent from last year, but the source of that number is not clear. He also said that the price of gasoline is now $2.50 per gallon in much of the country and even $1.99 in some states.</p><p>But the AAA National Average of gasoline on Wednesday was $2.90. And the monthly average for November was $3, similar to the price last year.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett noted that affordability remains a top economic concern for the US public.</p><p>“When it comes to the affordability of groceries and food items, going out to restaurants, these are still very high for most Americans, and that has a lot to do with the president’s tariffs, which he says are bringing an enormous amount of revenue into the country,” she said.</p><p>While painting a rosy picture of the economy, Trump suggested that if there were persisting issues, it is Biden’s fault, stressing that he “inherited a mess”.</p><p>Trump focused on domestic issues and only brushed over foreign policy, reiterating his unfounded claim that <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/17/satellite-images-reveal-israeli-demolitions-in-gaza-during-ceasefire\">the Gaza truce</a> he helped broker brought peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In reality, Israel was founded in 1948, and the Gaza truce has not stopped the daily Israeli attacks in Palestine and across the region.</p><p>“I’ve restored American strength, settled eight wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing peace for the first time in 3,000 years, and secured the release of the hostages, both living and dead, here at home,” Trump said.</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-absent\">Venezuela absent</h2><p>The announcement of the US president’s White House speech amid skyrocketing tensions <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">with Venezuela</a> had sparked speculations that he may announce military action against the country or at least make the case for a future war.</p><p>But Trump – who has imposed an oil blockade on Venezuela and amassed US military assets near the country – did not address the crisis with the Latin American nation.</p><p>Hours before the speech, Trump added fuel to the argument that he is escalating tensions with Venezuela to take the country’s oil.</p><p>“They took our oil rights.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In October, a small electronics manufacturer in the western Indian state of Gujarat shipped its first batch of chip modules to a client in California.</p><p>Kaynes Semicon, together with Japanese and Malaysian technology partners, assembled the chips in a new factory funded with incentives under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s $10bn semiconductor push announced in 2021.</p><p>Modi has been trying to position India as an additional manufacturing hub for global companies that may be looking to expand their production beyond China, with limited success.</p><p>One sign of that is India’s first commercial foundry for mature chips that is currently under construction, also in Gujarat. The $11bn project is supported by technology transfer from a Taiwanese chipmaker and has onboarded the United States chip giant Intel as a potential customer.</p><p>With companies the world over hungering for chips, India’s entry into that business could boost its role in global supply chains. But experts caution that India still has a long way to go in attracting more foreign investment and catching up in cutting-edge technology.</p><h2 id=\"unprecedented-momentum\">Unprecedented momentum</h2><p>Semiconductor chips are designed, fabricated in foundries, and then assembled and packaged for commercial use. The US leads in chip design, Taiwan in fabrication, and China, increasingly, in packaging.</p><p>The upcoming foundry in Gujarat is a collaboration between India’s Tata Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the country, and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC), which is assisting with the plant’s construction and technology transfer.</p><p>On December 8, Tata Electronics also signed an agreement with Intel to explore the manufacturing and packaging of its products in Tata’s upcoming facilities, including the foundry. The partnership will address the growing domestic demand.</p><p>Last year, Tata was approved for a 50 percent subsidy from the Modi government for the foundry, along with additional state-level incentives, and could come online as early as December 2026.</p><p>Even if delayed, the project marks a pivotal moment for India, which has seen multiple attempts to build a commercial fab stall in the past.</p><p>The foundry will focus on fabricating chips ranging from 28 nanometres (nm) to 110nm, typically referred to as mature chips because they are comparatively easier to produce than smaller 7nm or 3nm chips.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mature chips are used in most consumer and power electronics, while the smaller chips are in high demand for AI data centres and high-performance computing. Globally, the technology for mature chips is more widely available and distributed. Taiwan leads production of these chips, with China fast catching up, though Taiwan’s TSMC dominates production for cutting-edge nodes below 7nm.</p><p>“India has long been strong in chip design, but the challenge has been converting that strength into semiconductor manufacturing,” said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Washington, DC-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF).</p><p>“In the past two to three years, there’s been more progress on that front than in the previous decade – driven by stronger political will at both the central and state levels, and a more coordinated push from the private sector to commit to these investments,” Ezell told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"easy-entry-point\">Easy entry point</h2><p>More than half of the Modi government’s $10bn in semiconductor incentives is earmarked for the Tata-PSMC venture, with the remainder supporting nine other projects focused mainly on the assembly, testing and packaging (ATP) stage of the supply chain.</p><p>These are India’s first such projects – one by Idaho-based Micron Technology, also in Gujarat, and another by the Tata Group in the northeastern Assam state. Both will use in-house technologies and have drawn investments of $2.7bn and $3.3bn, respectively.</p><p>The remaining projects are smaller, with cumulative investments of about $2bn, and are backed by technology partners such as Taiwan’s Foxconn, Japan’s Renesas Electronics, and Thailand’s Stars Microelectronics.</p><p>“ATP units offer a lower path of resistance compared to a large foundry, requiring smaller investments – typically between $50m and $1bn. They also carry less risk, and the necessary technology know-how is widely available globally,” Ashok Chandak, president of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Still, most of the projects are behind schedule.</p><p>Micron’s facility, approved for incentives in June 2023, was initially expected to begin production by late 2024. However, the company noted in its fiscal 2025 report that the Gujarat facility will “address demand in the latter half of this decade”.</p><p>Approved in February 2024, the Tata facility was initially slated to be operational by mid-2025, but the timeline has now been pushed to April 2026.</p><p>When asked for reasons behind the delays, both Micron and Tata declined to comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>One exception is a smaller ATP unit by Kaynes Semicon, which in October exported a consignment of sample chip modules to an anchor client in California – a first for India.</p><p>Another project by CG Semi, part of India’s Murugappa Group, is in trial runs, with commercial production expected in the coming months.</p><p>The semiconductor projects under the Tata Group and the Murugappa Group have drawn public scrutiny after Indian online news outlet Scroll.in reported that both companies made massive political donations after they were picked for the projects.</p><p>As per Scroll.in, the Tata Group donated 7.5 billion rupees ($91m) and 1.25 billion rupees ($15m), respectively, to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just weeks after securing government subsidies in February 2024 and ahead of national elections. Neither group had made such large donations to the party before. Such donations are not prohibited by law. Both the Tata Group and the Murugappa Group declined to comment to Al Jazeera regarding the reports.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-domestic-demand-a-key-priority\">Meeting domestic demand a key priority</h2><p>The upcoming projects in India – both the foundry and the ATP units – will primarily focus on legacy, or mature, chips sized between 28nm and 110nm. While these chips are not at the cutting-edge of semiconductor technology, they account for the bulk of global demand, with applications across cars, industrial equipment and consumer electronics.</p><p>China dominates the ATP segment globally with a 30 percent share and accounted for 42 percent of semiconductor equipment spending in 2024, according to DBS Group Research.</p><p>India has long positioned itself as a “China Plus One” destination amid global supply chain diversification, with some progress evident in Apple’s expansion of its manufacturing base in the country. The company assembles all its latest iPhone models in India, in partnership with Foxconn and Tata Electronics, and has emerged as a key supplier to the US market this year following tariff-related uncertainties over Chinese shipments.</p><p>Its push in the ATP segment, however, is driven largely by the need to meet the growing domestic demand for chips, anticipated to surge from $50bn today to $100bn by 2030.</p><p>“Globally, too, the market will expand from around $650bn to $1 trillion. So, we’re not looking at shifting manufacturing from China to elsewhere. We’re looking at capturing the incremental demand emerging both in India and abroad,” Chandak said.</p><p>India’s import of chips – both integrated circuits and microassemblies – has jumped in recent years, rising 36 percent in 2024 to nearly $24bn from the previous year. An integrated circuit (IC) is a chip serving logic, memory or processing functions, whereas a microassembly is a broader package of multiple chips performing combined functions.</p><p>The momentum has continued this year, with imports up 20 percent year-on-year, accounting for about 3 percent of India’s total import bill, according to official trade data. China remains the leading supplier with a 30 percent share, followed by Hong Kong (19 percent), South Korea (11 percent), Taiwan (10 percent), and Singapore (10 percent).</p><p>“Even if it’s a 28 nm chip, from a trade balance perspective, India would rather produce and package it domestically than import it,” Ezell of ITIF said, adding that domestic capability would enhance the competitiveness of chip-dependent industries.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"better-incentives-needed\">Better incentives needed</h2><p>The Modi government’s support for the chip sector, while unprecedented for India, is still dwarfed by the $48bn committed by China and the $53bn provisioned under the <a href=\"/economy/2022/8/9/biden-signs-chips-act-to-boost-us-chipmakers-compete-with-china#:~:text=The%20law%2C%20providing%20$52bn,South%20Korea%20for%20critical%20technologies.&amp;text=US%20President%20Joe%20Biden%20on,generation%20investment%20in%20America%20itself%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US’s CHIPS Act</a>.</p><p>To achieve scale in the ATP segment for meaningful import substitution – and to advance towards producing chips smaller than 28nm – India will need continued government support, and there is a second round of incentives already in the works.</p><p>“The reality is, if India wants to compete at the leading edge of semiconductors, it will need to attract a foreign partner – American or Asian – since only a handful of companies globally operate at that level. It’s highly unlikely that a domestic firm will be competitive at 7nm or 3nm anytime soon,” Ezell said.</p><p>According to him, India needs to continue focusing on improving its overall business environment – from ensuring reliable power and infrastructure to streamlining regulations, customs and tariff policies.</p><p>India’s engineers make up about a fifth of the global chip design workforce, but rising competition from China and Malaysia to attract multinational design firms could erode that edge.</p><p>In its latest incentive round, the Indian government limited benefits to domestic firms to promote local intellectual property – a move that, according to Alpa Sood, legal director at the India operations of California-based Marvell Technology, risks driving multinational design work elsewhere.</p><p>“India already has a thriving chip design ecosystem strengthened by early-stage incentives from the government. What we need, to further accelerate and build stronger R&amp;D muscle – is incentives that mirror competing countries like China [220 percent tax incentives] and Malaysia [200 percent tax incentives]. This will ensure we don’t lose the advantage we’ve built over the years,” Sood told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Marvell’s India operations are its largest outside the US.</p><h2 id=\"the-trump-effect\">The Trump effect</h2><p>India’s upcoming chip facilities, while aimed at meeting domestic demand, will also export to clients in the US, Japan, and Taiwan. Though US President Donald Trump has threatened 100 percent tariffs on semiconductors made outside the US, none have yet been imposed.</p><p>A bigger concern for India-US engagement – so far limited to education and training – is Washington’s 50 percent tariff on India over its Russian crude imports. Semiconductors remain exempt, but the broader trade climate has turned uncertain.</p><p>“Over half the global semiconductor market is controlled by US-headquartered firms, making engagement with them crucial,” Chandak said. “Any alignment with these firms, either through joint ventures or technology partnerships – is a preferred option.”</p><p>The global chip race is accelerating, and India’s policies will need to keep pace to become a serious player amid growing geo-economic fragmentation.</p><p>“These new 1.7nm fabs are so advanced they even factor in the moon’s gravitational pull – it’s literally a moonshot,” Ezell said. “Semiconductor manufacturing is the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes – and the policymaking behind it must be just as precise.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is rare but not unprecedented for House leadership to cut a contested vote short.</p><p>Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said the decision prevented some Democrats from voting.</p><p>“Listen, it’s playing games when people’s lives are at stake,” DeLauro said. “They jettisoned it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It was the latest episode of congressional discord over the subsidies, which are slated to expire at the end of the year.</p><p>The vote also offered another key test to the Republican leadership of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Normally, Johnson determines which bills to bring to a House vote, but recently, his power has been circumvented by a series of “discharge petitions”, wherein a majority of representatives sign a petition to force a vote.</p><p>In a series of quickfire manoeuvres on Wednesday, Democrats resorted to one such discharge petition to force a vote on the healthcare subsidies in the new year.</p><p>They were joined by the four centrist Republicans: Mike Lawler of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan MacKenzie of Pennsylvania.</p><p>The Democratic proposal would see the subsidies extended for three years.</p><p>But Republicans have largely rallied around their own proposal, a bill called the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act. It would reduce some insurance premiums, though critics argue it would raise others, and it would also reduce healthcare subsidies overall.</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Tuesday said the legislation would decrease the number of people with health insurance by an average of 100,000 per year through 2035.</p><p>Its money-saving provisions would reduce federal deficits by $35.6bn, the CBO said.</p><p>Republicans have a narrow 220-seat majority in the 435-seat House of Representatives, and Democrats are hoping to flip the chamber to their control in the 2026 midterm elections.</p><p>Three of the four Republicans who sided with the Democrats over the discharge petition are from the swing state of Pennsylvania, where voters could lean right or left.</p><p>Affordability has emerged as a central question ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p><p>Even if the Republican-controlled House manages to pass a healthcare bill this week, it is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate before Congress begins a looming end-of-year recess that would stop legislative action until January 5.</p><p>By then, millions of Americans will be looking at significantly more expensive health insurance premiums that could prompt some to go without coverage.</p><p>Wednesday’s House floor battle could embolden Democrats and some Republicans to revisit the issue in January, even though higher premiums will already be in the pipeline.</p><p>Referring to the House debate, moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters: “I think that that will help prompt a response here in the Senate after the first of the new year, and I’m looking forward to that.”</p><p>The ACA subsidies were a major point of friction earlier this year as well, during the historic 43-day government shutdown.</p><p>Democrats had hoped to extend the subsidies during the debate over government spending, but Republican leaders refused to take up the issue until a continuing budget resolution was passed first.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But California regulators will not impose that part of the judge’s proposed penalty.</p><p>Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales licence suspended.</p><p>After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas-based company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it is deployed.</p><p>“Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue – steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,” said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.</p><p>In a post on Musk’s X service, Tesla brushed off the decision as regulatory overkill.</p><p>“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,” the company said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The car maker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began with a backlash to Musk’s high-profile role overseeing cuts in the US government budget via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that President Donald Trump created.</p><p>Politics apart, increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world’s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.</p><p>Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, Tesla’s sales have continued to slide and have decreased by 9 percent from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.</p><h2 id=\"bumper-stock\">Bumper stock</h2><p>Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla’s stock price touched an all-time high of $495.28 during Wednesday’s early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla’s shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk’s ill-fated stint in the Trump administration – a “somewhat successful” assignment he recently said he wouldn’t take on again.</p><p>The performance of Tesla’s stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk’s efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the US.</p><p>Musk has been promising Tesla’s self-driving technology would fulfil his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. In the past few days, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.</p><p>California regulators are far from the first critics to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner.</p><p>The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle’s owner’s manual on its website has made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own.</p><p>The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company’s California sales licence, remained on its website for nearly four years.</p><p>Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterisations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false sense of security that have resulted in lethal accidents.</p><p>The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year, a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/18/eyeing-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-musks-tesla-settles-accident-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lethal crash in Florida</a> that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240m in damages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.”</p><p>While US and British companies were involved in early oil exploration in Venezuela, the fuel belongs to the Latin American country under the international law principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in 1976 and brought it under the control of the state-owned PDVSA.</p><p>Later, in 2007, the late left-wing President Hugo Chavez nationalised the remaining foreign oil projects in Venezuela, effectively ousting US oil giants like ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.</p><p>The US companies filed legal challenges to fight the expropriation process, and in 2014, a <a href=\"/economy/2014/10/10/venezuela-ordered-to-pay-1-6bn-to-exxon\">World Bank arbitration tribunal</a> ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon Mobil $1.6bn. Legal proceedings remain ongoing.</p><p>The US imposed sanctions on PDVSA in 2019, under Trump’s first presidency.</p><p>But Trump has ramped up his “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela since returning to office for a second term in January.</p><p>Late on Tuesday, Trump announced a blockade on Venezuelan oil tankers, describing them as “sanctioned”. In a Truth Social <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on the subject, Trump echoed Miller’s assertions that Venezuelans had stolen oil from the US.</p><p>“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before – Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The blockade is part of the increasingly confrontational approach Trump has taken towards Venezuela and its left-wing President Nicolas Maduro, who served as vice president under the late Chavez.</p><p>Last week, the US military – which has been amassing military assets near Venezuela – seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a move that <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/venezuela-oil-exports-fall-steeply-after-us-forces-seize-tanker-off-coast\">Caracas denounced</a> as “international piracy”.</p><p>Since September, the US has also been bombing vessels near the South American country in the Caribbean Sea that it says are drug boats, in a deadly campaign many legal experts call a violation of domestic and international laws.</p><p>On Tuesday, the publication Vanity Fair quoted White House chief of staff Susie Wiles as saying that the US boat strikes <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/top-trump-aide-suggests-boat-strikes-aim-to-topple-venezuelas-maduro\">aim to topple</a> the Venezuelan president, who has faced accusations of human rights abuses.</p><p>Wiles reportedly told the magazine that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries ‘uncle'”.</p><p>The Trump administration has also taken several actions against the Maduro government itself. In November, the administration designated the “Cartel de los Soles” as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, even though the term does not refer to an organised group.</p><p>Rather, it is a reference to alleged corruption within the Venezuelan government and military.</p><p>There is no evidence, however, to back the claim that Maduro is the leader of a drug cartel, nor that Venezuela is a major source of US-bound narcotics.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump nevertheless said he would name “the Venezuelan regime” a “foreign terrorist organisation”, citing the “theft of our [US] assets”.</p><p>Another grievance that Trump and his aides have cited is the unfounded claim that Maduro intentionally sent criminals and gang members to the US over the past years.</p><p>But Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – believed to be the largest in the world – have been a particular point of contention.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925530\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925530\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Worldwide-proven-oil-reserves-1756989583.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Worldwide proven oil reserves-1756989583\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>On Wednesday, citing anonymous sources, the news publication Politico reported that the Trump administration had been approaching private oil companies to ask if they were interested in returning to Venezuela, should Maduro be removed from power.</p><p>“There has been the genesis of an outreach with the industry on the potential of reentering Venezuela,” one anonymous source told Politico.</p><p>“But frankly, there’s not a lot of interest from the industry, in light of lower oil prices and more attractive fields globally.”</p><p>However, prominent Venezuelan opposition figure <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/venezuelas-machado-taunts-maduro-government-after-dramatic-exit-to-oslo\">Maria Corina Machado</a> has promised to privatise the country’s oil sector and open it up to investment should Maduro lose power.

This was about going after the Republican Party, and most importantly, it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told the TV programme Fox and Friends on Wednesday.</p><p>Formerly a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Smith was appointed as a special counsel to the Justice Department in 2022, under former President Joe Biden.</p><p>Special counsels are selected from outside the Justice Department to prevent conflicts of interest in cases that are politically sensitive, and they operate without daily oversight from the department.</p><p>Smith ultimately dropped the two federal cases against Trump after the Republican leader’s successful re-election in 2024, as it is against Justice Department policy to prosecute a sitting president. He later resigned in January, shortly before Trump took office.</p><p>But Trump has repeatedly called for <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/us-authorities-investigating-ex-trump-prosecutor-jack-smith\">Smith</a> to be prosecuted for his role in the criminal cases against him.</p><p>In October, for instance, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115457600588415376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a link to an article about Smith on his Truth Social platform, accompanied by the message: “These thugs should all be investigated and put in prison.

Experts warn that, by threatening to sever Venezuela from its foreign oil markets, the US is attempting to destabilise the country’s economy and topple the leadership of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Already, tensions between the US and Venezuela are at a high, with the Trump administration surging military assets to the Caribbean and Maduro responding with his own troop movements.</p><p>That has led figures like United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press for calm in the region and a de-escalation.</p><p>Through UN spokesperson Farhan Haq, Guterres called on both countries to “honour their obligations under international law” and “safeguard peace in the region”.</p><p>Guterres also spoke with Maduro by telephone on Wednesday, repeating the need for both parties to respect international law.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, however, questioned whether the UN was taking enough precautions to prevent a full-scale conflict from erupting in the Americas.</p><p>“I call on the United Nations to fulfil its role. It has not been present. It must assume its role to prevent any bloodshed,” Sheinbaum said in her morning news conference on Wednesday.</p><p>She echoed Guterres’s appeal to find a “peaceful solution” to the tensions, adding: “We call for dialogue and peace, not intervention.”</p><p>The regional friction was also felt at a ministerial meeting in Brazil on Wednesday, where President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva spoke to the conflict.</p><p>“I am concerned about Latin America. I am concerned about President Trump’s attitudes toward Latin America, his threats. We are going to have to be very attentive to this issue,” Lula said.</p><p>The Brazilian leader shared that he had spoken to Trump about Venezuela and urged him to find a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“The power of words can be worth more than the power of weapons,” Lula said he told Trump. “It costs less and takes less time if you are willing to do it.”</p><p>He added that he had offered Brazil’s services as a mediator to facilitate communications with Venezuela. It shares a border with Venezuela to the north, and previously, in 2022, Lula <a href=\"/news/2022/12/14/brazil-to-resume-diplomatic-relations-with-venezuela-under-lula\">restored</a> Brazil’s relations with the Maduro government.</p><p>“I told Trump: ‘If you are interested in talking on good terms with Venezuela, we can contribute. Now, you have to be willing to talk. You have to have patience,'” Lula said.</p><p>The comments come on the heels of Trump’s latest threats on Tuesday.</p><p>On his online platform Truth Social, the US leader announced that he had designated Maduro’s government as a “foreign terrorist organisation” and would implement a “TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela”.</p><p>“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.”</p><p>Already, Trump has offered a $50m bounty for any information that leads to Maduro’s arrest, and his administration has deployed approximately 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, along with military jets and ships, among them the USS Gerald Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world.</p><p>Last week, the Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/trump-admin-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-reports\">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, claiming the vessel was sanctioned. The tanker’s oil, Trump said, would remain with the US.</p><p>Since his first term, Trump has led a “maximum pressure” campaign against the Maduro government, which has been accused of human rights abuses ranging from torture to the false imprisonment of political dissidents.</p><p>Last year, Maduro also claimed victory in a highly contested presidential election that critics called fraudulent — and that was followed by a deadly crackdown on protesters.</p><p>But critics have accused Trump of using his feud with Maduro as a pretext to expand his presidential powers and carry out controversial actions in the Caribbean region.</p><p>Since September 2, for instance, the Trump administration has bombed at least 25 boats and maritime vessels as part of an anti-drug campaign. An estimated 95 people have been killed in the attacks, which UN experts have likened to extrajudicial killings, in violation of international law.</p><p>Trump, however, has argued that the air strikes were necessary, blaming Maduro and other Latin American leaders for seeking to flood the US with drugs and criminals — allegations he has made with little to no proof.</p><p>The identities of those on board the bombed vessels remain largely unknown.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, an overlapping map of influence is evident on the ground with de facto authorities competing over security, resources and representation.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>At the heart of these changes is the STC, backed by a regional power, which now stands as the most powerful actor in Yemen’s south and parts of its east at a time when the government’s ability to impose unified administration over the whole country is distant and the economy is suffering.</p><p>In this context comes what the Yemeni government has said is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) decision to suspend activities in the country. While the IMF has not publicly commented on the topic, President Rashad al-Alimi, the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, warned on Sunday that the decision was a “wake-up call” and an early signal of the cost of the STC’s security and military escalation in Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>Al-Alimi stressed that Yemen’s economic circumstances – the country is the poorest in the region and has <a href=\"/news/2021/10/14/yemens-humanitarian-crisis-growing-as-economy-collapses-un\">suffered immensely during the war</a> – cannot withstand any new tensions. He added that the security instability in eastern Yemen would immediately affect the distribution of salaries, fuel and services and international donor confidence.</p><p>The solution, according to al-Alimi, is for the withdrawal of forces who have arrived in Hadramout and al-Mahra from outside the two governorates, calling it a necessary step to contain tensions and restore a path of trust with the international community.</p><p>But that economic warning cannot be understood in isolation from the shift in power in eastern Yemen, where competition for influence has become a direct factor in generating tension that leaves donors wary.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-new-balance-of-power\">A new balance of power</h2><p>The STC is clear that its goal is ultimately the secession of the territories in Yemen – its south and east – that formerly made up the country of South Yemen before unification in 1990.</p><p>It is opposed to the Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s populous northwest, and the STC’s leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has a seat on the government’s Presidential Leadership Council, officially as one of its vice chairmen.</p><p>The STC and government forces have previously fought, most notably in 2018 and 2019, in Aden and its surrounding governorates.</p><p>Its current expansion eastwards, focused on government forces and those affiliated with them, is part of that ongoing division in the anti-Houthi camp but one that redraws the balance of power within it, turning resource-rich Hadramout and al-Mahra into a multiparty arena of competition.</p><p>There are three concurrent trends that are emerging as a result: the expansion of STC forces with regional support, a desire by local and tribal forces – independent of the STC – to solidify their presence and the clearly limited tools the government has to confront its rivals.</p><p>The result is the further fragmentation of the state on three interconnected levels.</p><p>Politically, there is fragmentation within the same anti-Houthi camp with multiple decision-making centres. The government and regional actors are finding it more difficult to unify security and administrative policies, and the idea of a single “chain of command” controlling territory under anti-Houthi control has been eroded.</p><p>Geographically, new lines of contact have now been formed. Whereas lines of control were previously between the Houthis and government forces, they are now between Houthi and STC forces as well as grey areas contested by local and tribal forces and multiple military groups.</p><p>And then there is fragmentation on the representative level with mounting disputes over who actually speaks for the south and Hadramout and the practical decline of the concept of a single state as a sovereign framework for managing resources and institutions.</p><p>In Hadramout and al-Mahra, the fragmentation is particularly sensitive as both governorates include important border crossings with Saudi Arabia and Oman and also have a long coastline with routes tied to trade, smuggling and irregular migration.</p><p>Any imbalance here does not remain local; it quickly spills over into the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economy-hostage-to-security\">Economy hostage to security</h2><p>The IMF’s suspension of activities carries not only financial implications but also a political reading that the security and institutional environments no longer provide sufficient conditions for sustaining support programmes.</p><p>The Yemeni state relies heavily on its own limited resources and fragile external support, so any disruption in resource areas, ports or supply routes translates into immediate pressure on livelihoods.</p><p>The latest military developments increase pressure on the exchange rate and the government’s ability to meet its financial obligations and widen the trust gap between society and the state, prompting non-institutional alternatives based on levies and loyalties.</p><p>And it will shrink the room for the government to manoeuvre, meaning the government has to take into account the cost of any escalation because any military move increases an economic bill that it cannot pay and drains what remains of the government’s ability to manage services.</p><p>Now that the impression has taken root that Yemen has turned into “islands of influence”, some external actors may be inclined to deal directly with de facto local authorities at the expense of the government, weakening the political centre rather than helping it to strengthen.</p><p>That is why the latest developments are so important if not existential to the government and al-Alimi. His call for the withdrawal of outside forces from Hadramout and al-Mahra is part of an attempt to stop the deterioration of trust in Yemen and to present the government once again as capable of controlling the other parties in the anti-Houthi camp if reasonable political and economic conditions are provided.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"houthis-gain-while-rivals-stay-divided\">Houthis gain while rivals stay divided</h2><p>The Houthis, who overthrew the government in Sanaa in a coup in 2014, have benefitted from the developments in Hadramout and al-Mahra even without being directly involved.</p><p>Every struggle for influence in areas outside the group’s control gives it clear gains, including the disintegration of the front opposing it and its rivals being preoccupied by internal conflicts rather than by the Houthis themselves.</p><p>In the anti-Houthi camp, the notion of a united front recedes every time a military confrontation between its components takes place, and the discussion shifts from confronting the Houthis to disputes over power and resources within the same camp.</p><p>The divisions within the anti-Houthi camp and the regional dimension to them also allow the Houthis to reinforce their narrative that their rivals are working within competing foreign agendas, as opposed to the Houthis, who portray themselves as independent actors able to carry out their own decisions.</p><p>Moreover, the recent conflict and its consequences ultimately improve the Houthis’ negotiating position now that the other side is even more fragmented and weak. The Houthis will enter any upcoming settlement from a more cohesive organisational and administrative position, raising the ceiling of their conditions.</p><p>The Houthis may have their own economic and social tensions, but divisions among their enemies give them extra time to sustain the war economy and their instruments of control over it and over the people they rule.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rising-risks-domestic-and-regional\">Rising risks, domestic and regional</h2><p>The current course of events in Yemen elevates a number of overlapping risks.</p><p>Domestically, there is the possibility of front lines turning into actual borders between adjacent entities, the expansion of security vacuums and declining prospects for producing a unifying social contract.</p><p>Regionally, there could be an expansion of the areas considered lawless along the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman, increasing the risks of smuggling and leading to higher costs for managing border security.</p><p>Internationally, the growing need for global powers to communicate with multiple parties in Yemen prolongs the crisis and increases the chances that the conflict is internationalised through competition over ports, resources and shipping routes.</p><p>However, the picture painted does not mean there will be a decisive victory for any side and instead makes a mosaic of authorities, all needing external sponsorship, more likely. Inevitably, that will weaken the prospect of establishing a stable state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-way-out\">A way out?</h2><p>Lowering tensions by making partial deals on redeployments of forces is not enough. Instead, the path forward needs a broader approach based on three interlinked pillars.</p><p>First, the national project needs to be redefined by drafting a vision of the state that guarantees fair partnership for all the regions of Yemen within a viable federal framework and redefines the political centre as a guarantor of rights and services.</p><p>Second, security must be based on a model of local forces under a national umbrella. In Hadramout and al-Mahra, this should be done by building professional local forces within a clear national and legal framework with practical arrangements for withdrawing outside forces and ensuring that security decision-making in state institutions is uniform.</p><p>Third, an economic deal is necessary to restore trust by concluding a transparent agreement on managing resources in the governorates that produce them, the fair distribution of revenues and the linking of international support to an implementable reform plan with a clear commitment to protecting sovereign facilities under central management.</p><p>In the absence of these steps, Yemen will continue towards a gradual model of disintegration from the peripheries in which the most cohesive armed entities advance and contested margins expand.</p><p>If that continues, the economy will be the first victim of fragmentation, making conditions even more difficult for millions of Yemenis.</p><p>And the governance crisis will eventually turn into a prolonged stability crisis, the repercussions of which will be difficult to contain locally and perhaps even regionally.</p><p><em>Saeed Thabit is the Al Jazeera Media Network’s bureau chief for Yemen</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
