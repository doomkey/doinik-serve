The 17-year-old travelled on Monday with his mother, Randa, to southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, and then on to Rafah, which has been closed by Israel for two years as it waged its genocidal war on Gaza, killing more than 70,000 Palestinians.</p><p>Randa told Al Jazeera that she had received a phone call on Monday morning informing her that Mohammed had been included in the first list of wounded patients scheduled to travel, and that they were instructed to head immediately to the Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis.</p><p>The reopening of Rafah, Gaza’s only land crossing that does not go through Israel, has been much touted as evidence of the progress of the second phase of the United States-backed Gaza “ceasefire” deal.</p><p>But events on Monday revealed a different reality, marked by strict security restrictions, complex procedures, and limited numbers being allowed to cross, falling far short of expectations and the scale of Gaza’s accumulated humanitarian needs.</p><p>Each of the five patients being allowed to leave was accompanied by two people as per Israeli orders, bringing the total number of travellers to 15, according to information provided to Gaza’s health authorities.</p><p>Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Gaza’s al-Shifa Medical Complex, told Al Jazeera that this was the only group that departed, despite prior plans with the World Health Organization (WHO) – the body overseeing coordination between Egypt and Israel – for the departure of 50 patients daily.</p><p>Egyptian official sources have told Al Jazeera that 50 Palestinians were also permitted to return to Gaza via the Rafah crossing, though no information is yet available on whether they have actually reached the Palestinian side.</p><p>Ismail al-Thawabta, the director of Gaza’s Government Media Office, highlighted just how low these numbers are compared with the approximately 22,000 people needing to leave Gaza for treatment abroad. Meanwhile, about 80,000 Palestinians who left Gaza during the war want to return, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"eye-injury\">Eye injury</h2><p>Mohammed was injured in an Israeli air attack a year and a half ago, near where his family had been displaced in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, Randa said. He sustained a direct injury to his eye, severely affecting his optic nerve and ability to see.</p><p>“My son has been suffering immensely since his injury. Day after day, his condition kept worsening, and there is no treatment available for him in Gaza,” Randa said, while waiting in the hospital courtyard alongside other patients and their relatives.</p><p>Despite her joy at finally being able to accompany her son on his journey, Randa feels a sense of anguish at having to leave four of her six children behind, as she was only permitted to take one child as a second companion.</p><p>“What matters to me now is that my son regains his sight and can see again with his own eyes. That is my only concern at the moment,” Randa said.</p><p>“I also hope to return to Gaza soon after my son recovers, that the blockade will be lifted, and that all patients will be able to travel, just like my son.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-restrictions\">Israeli restrictions</h2><p>In the Red Crescent Hospital courtyard, dozens of patients on travel waiting lists expressed frustration over the first-day restrictions at Rafah.</p><p>Several patients, including those with amputations, gathered at the hospital, hoping to be permitted to travel to Egypt for treatment.</p><p>Despite patients and their families arriving early in the morning with high hopes, Israeli authorities refused to permit more than five patients to leave, leading to widespread dissatisfaction with the complex mechanisms accompanying the crossing’s partial reopening.</p><p>The multi-stage security procedure of Palestinians moving through the Rafah crossing begins with the preparation of daily lists of candidates for travel, which are then referred to the Israeli side for pre-travel security screening.</p><p>No one is allowed to pass through the crossing or enter it without explicit Israeli approval. The European Union Border Assistance Mission deployed to Rafah is limited to monitoring the process and verifying identities.</p><p>Arrivals in Gaza, after initial identity verification at the crossing under European supervision, are subject to additional inspection procedures at checkpoints located in areas under Israeli military control.</p><p>Raed al-Nims, the Gaza Red Crescent’s head of media, told Al Jazeera that the organisation was still waiting for updates regarding the transfer of more patients for treatment through the crossing.</p><p>He added that a group of patients was successfully transferred to Israel on Monday through the Kerem Abu Salem crossing, in coordination with the WHO.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperate-need\">Desperate need</h2><p>Ibrahim Abu Thuraya was also one of the five patients allowed to leave Gaza on Monday.</p><p>Ibrahim was injured in the early months of the war, sustaining wounds that led to the amputation of his left hand and an injury to his left eye, where shrapnel is still embedded.</p><p>“Day after day, my eye condition is deteriorating, and I feel severe pain, especially since the shrapnel is lodged behind it and there are no medical capabilities in Gaza to deal with it,” he said from Khan Younis, before he travelled to Rafah. “Doctors told me that I need to travel abroad.”</p><p>Ibrahim was informed on Monday morning by the WHO and Gaza’s Ministry of Health that he had been approved for travel. He will be accompanied by his wife, Samar, and their son.</p><p>“I have suffered greatly for two full years just to be able to leave for treatment, and there are thousands of wounded like me,” he said. “I hope the crossing will be opened permanently.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Other plaintiffs included foreign nationals approved for immigrant visas through their specialised employment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at The Legal Aid Society, called the State Department policy “arbitrary, unlawful, and deeply harmful to families who have followed the rules and are simply seeking to reunite with their loved ones”.</p><p>Other lawyers supporting the case underscored that the policy disproportionately affects people from Africa, the Middle East, South and Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p><p>Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, accused the administration of relying on “obviously pretextual tropes about nonwhite families undeservedly taking benefits”.</p><p>“Congress and the Constitution prohibit white supremacy as grounds for immigration policy.”</p><p>The lawsuit further points to “arbitrary and disparaging” statements made by Trump and administration officials about immigrants being likely to receive public benefits.</p><p>It notes that most immigrants are ineligible for most government assistance programmes, yet are required to pay local, state, and federal taxes.</p><p>The State Department did not reply to a request for comment on the new legislation from Al Jazeera. US agencies typically do not comment on pending litigation.</p><h2 id=\"chances-of-success\">Chances of success</h2><p>The odds of success for the new lawsuit, which comes amid a deluge of legal challenges, remained unclear.</p><p>Plaintiffs have won at least temporary pauses on several key immigration issues, particularly related to Trump’s use of the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/3/us-appeals-court-blocks-trump-use-of-alien-enemies-act-in-deportation-drive\">Alien Enemies Act</a> of 1798 to swiftly deport alleged gang members and his effort to end birthright citizenship, as lawsuits make their way through the legal system.</p><p>Many more long-term decisions remain elusive.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2018, a 5-4 ruling by the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court upheld Trump’s visa-processing ban on several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia.</p><p>In the 2018 ruling, most justices ruled that the president had broad discretion to limit the entry of individuals into the US.</p><p>At the time, the Trump administration cited “national security” concerns rather than the “public charge” argument it has used in the most recent suspension.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In January, they were around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and they are projected to decline to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, according to a Reuters report.</p><p>Indian markets have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington, making it the worst-performing market among emerging nations in 2025, with record outflows of foreign investors.</p><p>Despite the tariff relief, “India will continue to de-risk and diversify”, a process it had begun in the wake of punishing US tariffs and a deteriorating and unpredictable relationship with Washington, said Nadjibulla.</p><p>The announced tariff reduction comes days after <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/mother-of-all-deals-how-india-eu-trade-deal-creates-27-trillion-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">India and the European Union reached a free trade agreement</a> that could affect as many as two billion people after nearly two decades of negotiations.

Republicans – who have dominated Texas politics for years – still have a strong majority in the state’s senate.</p><p>Still, Saturday’s contest could be an indicator of a broader voting trend in Texas and beyond, signalling a significant shift.</p><p>“A huge political earthquake in Texas tonight as Democrats flipped a State Senate seat from red to blue in a district Trump won by 17 points,” Democratic strategist Matt McDermott wrote in a social media post.</p><p>“Trump personally waded in — endorsing the Republican and personally urging base turnout — and was dealt a massive loss.”</p><p>The election was held to fill the seat of a Republican state senator who had resigned to serve as Texas’s comptroller.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-endorsement\">Trump’s endorsement</h2><p>On the morning of the election, Trump reiterated his endorsement of Wambsganss.</p><p>“I am asking all America First Patriots in Texas’ 9th State Senate District to please make a plan to GET OUT AND VOTE on Election Day, Saturday, January 31st, for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283945\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283945\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283945\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-01T235744Z_806420888_RC2ADJAIXR0B_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1770052597.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he arrives on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 1, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump arrives on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington.

But when the results rolled in, the US president distanced himself from the vote.</p><p>“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race,” he told reporters on Sunday, stressing that he wasn’t on the ballot.</p><p>But the US president will not be on the ballot in the November midterm vote, either. And that will decide control of Congress.</p><p>If Democrats regain control of the US Senate and House of Representatives, they could impede Trump’s agenda and prevent him from passing any legislation.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-should-one-read-into-the-texas-result\">How much should one read into the Texas result?</h2><p>Opposition parties, seizing on their base’s anger, generally do well in special elections before the US midterms.</p><p>When Democratic Joe Biden was US president in 2021, voters in Virginia – which Democrats had won by 10 percentage points in 2020 – elected a <a href=\"/news/2021/11/3/republican-glenn-youngkin-wins-virginia-governors-race-us-media\">Republican governor</a>.</p><p>Similarly, the Democrats won a US Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama during Trump’s first year in office in 2017.</p><p>But the swing in the Texas State Senate race – more than 30 percentage points from the 2024 election – is noteworthy.</p><p>The district covers Fort Worth near Dallas and other areas of Tarrant County – a traditional Republican stronghold.</p><p>Republicans also poured nearly $2.5m into the race, according to local reports, significantly outspending Rehmet and his Democratic allies.</p><h2 id=\"wake-up-call\">‘Wake-up call’</h2><p>The election comes at a time when Trump’s popularity is dwindling. His approval rating has dropped to 37 percent, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, amid immigration enforcement chaos and an economy that is starting to show <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/16/us-unemployment-hits-highest-level-since-2021-as-labour-market-cools\">signs of stagnation</a>.</p><p>Rehmet dedicated his win to working people. “We have to continue to have our energy. We have a lot more work to do,” he said after the results came out.</p><p>Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, also invoked working people in a statement celebrating Rehmet’s victory.</p><p>“It’s clear as day that this disastrous Republican agenda is hurting working families in Texas and across the country, which is why voters in red, blue, and purple districts are putting their faith in candidates like Taylor Rehmet,” Martin said.</p><p>“This overperformance is a warning sign to Republicans across the country.”</p><p>Wambsganss, the losing Republican candidate, also described the result as a “wake-up call” for her party – but she was referring to mobilising voters, not changing policy.</p><p>Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, an ally of Wambsganss, echoed that assessment. “Our voters cannot take anything for granted,” he wrote on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Democrats have been trying for years to make inroads in Texas. The state is the second largest in the US by population. Without its 40 Electoral College votes, it would be difficult for any Republican to win a presidential race.</p><p>US Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, one of the Texas Democrats trying to unseat Republican Senator John Cornyn in November, seized on Rehmet’s win to talk up her own chances.</p><p>“Don’t tell us what can’t be done in Texas. When we show up #TexasTough, we change the game,” she wrote in a social media post featuring photos of her and Rehmet.</p><p>In essence, the Texas State Senate result represents a red flag for Trump and the Republican Party. At the same time, this result aligns with historical trends where American voters favoured <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/us-election-results-2025-key-takeaways-from-historic-night-across-the-us\">the opposition party</a> in special elections.</p><p>The November midterm elections will be the ultimate litmus test of the political climate in both Texas and the broader United States.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At this line, the audience applauded.</p><p>Pompeo went on to say that every war has civilian casualties, but the true victims in this case are the Israeli people. His concern is that October 7th and the war in Gaza would be remembered “incorrectly”.</p><p>It seems Pompeo wants to argue that the people of Gaza are just “collateral damage” in Israel’s war.  They are to remain nameless, faceless, forgotten. He wants their stories erased from the pages of human history.</p><p>His remarks reflect the next phase in Israel’s genocide. Dissatisfied with its progress in eliminating Gaza’s people, their mosques, their schools and universities, their cultural institutions, economy and land, Israel and its Christian-Zionist allies like Pompeo have now embarked on the erasure of memory and martyrdom.</p><p>The campaign is evident both inside and beyond Gaza. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) – an institution that has long preserved the status of the Palestinian refugee population and safeguarded their right of return under international law – is being systematically undermined and dismantled. TikTok – one of the few social media platforms where Palestinian voices have had a bit more freedom to speak – is now shadow banning and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/gaza-based-journalist-bisan-owda-regains-tiktok-account-after-outcry\">restricting pro-Palestinian accounts</a>, after being taken over by an Israel-friendly conglomerate.</p><p>In the US, United Kingdom, and elsewhere, local laws are weaponised to come after pro-Palestinian youth, with scores being detained for using what should be their protected right to free speech. Laws are even <a href=\"https://forward.com/news/775954/california-law-antisemitism-ethnic-studies-curriculum-gavin-newsom-israel/\">passed</a> at the state level in the US to shape what can be taught at schools about Israel and Palestine.</p><p>But what Pompeo – and those like him who misread biblical verses to justify their support for Israel and its genocide – do not understand is that Palestinians have faced erasure before and have overcome it. We will do so again.</p><p>In thinking about memory and bearing witness, the word “martyr” comes to mind. “Martyr” comes from the Greek word “martus”, meaning “witness”, and features prominently in the Bible. Similarly, the word “shaheed” in Arabic is derived from the root of the word for “witness” or “witnessing”. As the word evolved, it also took on connotations of violent suffering due to one’s beliefs, and even a sense of heroic steadfastness due to the scale of one’s sacrifice.</p><p>I can think of no better word than “shaheed” to describe Jamal and the people around him: they are living martyrs. Jamal’s little body has witnessed immense suffering; it has been pounded with the violence of the war, and he – like his mother – pushes on because of his overwhelming desire to live.</p><p>All around Jamal and Shaima’s tent are thousands of other tents. Day and night, each of them is pierced by the sound of Jamal’s screams. Inside the tents, cold and often wet from the recent floods, are thousands of other people who require urgent and important medical evacuation to hospitals.</p><p>The pain and suffering are immense, yet the likes of Pompeo continue to justify the ongoing and historically rooted process of the elimination of the Palestinian people.</p><p>The Palestinian people are also poets at heart. And what Pompeo – who devalues language, memory and history – will never understand is that the poet is a witness.</p><p>As Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote in one of his verses:</p><p><em>Those who pass between fleeting words</em></p><p><em>Take your names with you and go</em></p><p><em>Rid our time of your hours, and go</em></p><p><em>Steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sands of memory</em></p><p><em>Take what pictures you will so as to understand</em></p><p><em>That which you never will:</em></p><p><em>How a stone from our land becomes the ceiling of our sky.</em></p><p>The Palestinian people will keep memory alive, just as we have kept alive the pain of Beit Daras, Deir Yassin, Jenin, Muhammad al-Durrah, Anas al-Sharif and the roots of every olive tree ripped from its soil. The Palestinian people, and millions in solidarity around the world, witnessed Israel’s <a href=\"/opinions/2025/5/16/seventy-seven-years-after-the-nakba-we-are-naming-our-new-ruin\">destruction</a> of Gaza. In defiance of Pompeo and honouring the living martyr Jamal, each of us will take the stones of Gaza and build a new sky.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the largest release since US President Donald Trump’s administration passed a law last year to force the release of the documents.</p><p>Epstein was convicted in 2008 of sex offences but avoided federal charges – which could have seen him face life in prison – by doing a deal with prosecutors. Instead, he received an 18-month prison sentence, which allowed him to go on “work release” to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months.</p><p>In 2019, he was arrested again on charges including the sex trafficking of minors. But he died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 before his trial could commence.</p><p>With this latest disclosure of documents and emails linked to the cases against him, yet more has been revealed about the disgraced financier’s sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with wealthy and powerful figures from the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, Slovakia and India.</p><p>Simply being named in Epstein documents or emails does not mean a person is guilty of criminal wrongdoing, and, so far, no charges have been brought against individuals named in connection with the sex offender.</p><p>However, the new documents show communications between high-profile figures in the US, including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, and business tycoons such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk.</p><p>Here is what we know about some of the powerful men (and one woman) from other countries who have featured in these documents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4115743\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4115743\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4115743\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25322671830772-1763495454.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man holds a sign demanding release of the Epstein files\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4115743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrator Gary Rush holds a sign before a news conference on the Epstein files in front of the US Capitol, November 18, 2025, in Washington, DC, the United States [AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"narendra-modi-indian-prime-minister\">Narendra Modi, Indian prime minister</h2><p>Documents released on Friday reveal conversations between Anil Ambani, the billionaire chairman of Reliance Group who is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Epstein.

He snubbed the Palestinian Authority, prompting <a href=\"/news/2017/7/5/palestinians-unhappy-over-modi-snub-on-israel-trip\">condemnation</a> from Palestinian officials.</p><p>That year, New Delhi became the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, amounting to $715m worth of purchases. The defence partnership between the two countries has since continued despite Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza.</p><p>This marked a sharp change from India’s history of advocating for the Palestinian cause. It only opened up formal diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992. Before that, Indian citizens had been barred by India from travelling to Israel since the country’s creation in 1948.</p><p>After Modi’s visit on July 6, Epstein emailed an unidentified individual he referred to as “Jabor Y”, saying: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago..

Epstein responded affirmatively, stating, “yes, defintley India israel. for example great and all his doing (sic).”</p><p>In another conversation revealed in the latest document drop, Epstein offered to arrange a meeting between Modi and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon just hours after Modi had won a thumping majority in the Indian national election in 2019.</p><p>In an iMessage to Bannon on May 19, 2019, Epstein wrote, “modi sending someone to see me on thurs,” referring to Ambani.</p><p>That Thursday, May 23, Epstein met Ambani in New York and his calendar for that day shows no other meeting scheduled.</p><p>After the meeting with Ambani, Epstein wrote to Bannon: “really interesting modi meeting.

Their display was part of Pakistan’s latest offer to the Trump administration: The country was willing to open up its minerals to US investment.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Less than five months later, a cloud has moved over that promise. Most of Pakistan’s richest mineral deposits are in the province of Balochistan. The province – the country’s largest by area and its most impoverished – has long witnessed a separatist movement driven by anger over perceptions that the interests of the local population have been ignored by the federal government. On Saturday, coordinated attacks across Balochistan in which fighters killed 31 civilians and 17 security personnel while the military gunned down 145 fighters served up an urgent reminder of the challenges that Pakistan – and potential investors – face in the province.</p><p>Balochistan is also at the heart of China’s investments in Pakistan, making Saturday’s attacks particularly sensitive for Islamabad.</p><p>Within hours of the attacks across at least 12 locations, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi blamed neighbouring India. “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists,” Naqvi said without offering any evidence to back up his claims.</p><p>The attackers belonged to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">a separatist group</a> that has long sought independence for Balochistan and has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Pakistani state alongside several other armed groups.</p><p>In a video posted on social media, BLA leader Bashir Zeb said the attacks were part of the group’s “Herof 2.0” operation, a follow-up to a similar coordinated assault launched in <a href=\"/news/2024/8/26/whats-behind-pakistans-deadly-balochistan-attacks-which-left-43-dead\">August 2024.</a></p><p>India on Sunday rejected Pakistan’s allegations, calling them an attempt to divert attention from what it described as Pakistan’s “internal failings”.</p><p>“Instead of parroting frivolous claims each time there is a violent incident, it would do better to focus on addressing long-standing demands of its people in the region,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement.</p><p></p><p>Amid this blame game, analysts said the roots of Pakistan’s crisis in Balochistan run deeper than any one incident – and ignoring them won’t help Islamabad as it tries to woo both the US and China to invest in the province.</p><h2 id=\"roots-of-the-unrest\">Roots of the unrest</h2><p>Balochistan is home to about 15 million of Pakistan’s 240 million people, according to the 2023 census. It is the country’s poorest province despite its vast natural resources wealth.</p><p>It holds significant reserves of oil, coal, gold, copper and gas, resources that generate substantial revenue for the federal government.</p><p>With Pakistan having promised parts of this resource wealth to China, its closest ally, and to the US under a landmark agreement signed last year, concerns persist that escalating violence could not only jeopardise projects worth billions of dollars but also threaten the country’s fragile economic recovery.</p><p id=\"annexed-by-pakistan-in-1948-soon-after-partition-from-india-it-has-been-the-site-of-a-separatist-movement-almost-since-the-country-s-founding\">Annexed by Pakistan in 1948 soon after partition from India, Balochistan has been the site of a separatist movement almost since the country’s founding.</p><p>The province has witnessed at least five major rebellions since then. The latest phase began in the early 2000s when demands for greater control over local resources gradually escalated into calls for full independence.</p><p>The government’s response has been marked by heavy-handed security operations. Human rights groups accuse authorities of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of ethnic Balochs suspected of being involved in or having sympathy for separatist groups.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/deadly-pakistan-train-hijack-what-happened-and-whats-next\">March</a>, BLA fighters carried out one of their most audacious attacks, attempting to hijack a passenger train, the Jaffer Express, travelling from Quetta to the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. More than 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which at least 33 fighters were killed.</p><p>The incident was part of a broader uptick in violence across Balochistan along with the rest of the country. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025, a 26 percent increase from the previous year, resulting in more than 400 deaths.</p><p>The latest wave of violence came just days after Pakistan hosted a minerals summit aimed at attracting Chinese companies.</p><p>China has already invested heavily in the province, including in the development of Gwadar, Pakistan’s only deep-sea port. The port is a key node in the <a href=\"/news/2024/6/3/sharifs-beijing-trip-can-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-be-revived\">$60bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC), which aims to connect southwestern China to the Arabian Sea.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">September</a>, USSM, a US-based mining firm, also signed a $500m memorandum of understanding to invest in mineral excavation in Pakistan.</p><p>Saher Baloch, a Berlin-based researcher focusing on Balochistan, said there was a “core contradiction” in Pakistan’s efforts to court international partners by emphasising the province’s resources without addressing its political grievances.</p><p>“Balochistan’s instability isn’t episodic. It is structural and rooted in longstanding grievances over ownership, political exclusion and militarisation,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As long as violence persists, she said, large-scale extraction projects will remain high-risk and heavily securitised, making them viable primarily for “state-backed actors like China, not market-driven Western investors”.</p><p>And “even Chinese projects under CPEC have faced repeated attacks, forcing Pakistan to deploy thousands of troops just to secure limited infrastructure,” she added.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, offered a different perspective, arguing that the province’s main investors, China and potentially the US, are already fully aware of the risks.</p><p>“China has CPEC investments in the country, and the US signed a minerals deal in September last year, a whole year after Herof 1.0, so they both know the risk profiles and what they are getting into,” Basit told Al Jazeera, referring to another coordinated BLA attack across multiple locations in August 2024.</p><p>“Obviously, such attacks do shake investor confidence, but these are government-to-government deals. These are part of strategic investment calculus, and neither the US nor China will pull out their investment,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283684\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283684\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2025-01-1770042211.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"economic-stakes-rise\">Economic stakes rise</h2><p>Pakistan’s economy, which has long struggled, has faced sustained pressure in recent years. The country only narrowly avoided default in the summer of 2023, securing a last-minute bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Since then, Pakistan has regained some stability under its latest IMF programme, the 25th time it has turned to the lender, securing $7bn in funding.</p><p>Despite official efforts to market Pakistan as an attractive investment destination, foreign direct investment (FDI) has remained weak.</p><p>Central bank figures released last month showed a sharp decline from July to December. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, the country received just $808m in FDI during the first half of the fiscal year 2026, down from $1.425bn in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies, said the surge in violence in Balochistan and elsewhere was deterring investors.</p><p>“No sane national or international investor will risk their money in an extremely volatile situation,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the crisis was “rooted in problems centred in the province itself and linked to Islamabad’s approach”.</p><p>Balochistan also shares a long and porous border with Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. That adds to the region’s perception as a “high-risk zone” for investors.</p><p>“Persistent attacks suggest that even heavily guarded projects are vulnerable,” she said. “Absence of local consent increases the likelihood of a backlash.”</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"external-vs-internal-issue\">External vs internal issue</h2><p>The Jaffer Express train attack in March was followed a month later by an assault in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir, which killed at least 26 people.</p><p>Those incidents escalated into a four-day military confrontation between India and Pakistan in May, marked by missile strikes, drone attacks and cross-border shelling.</p><p>Pakistan has <a href=\"/news/2025/3/14/pakistan-links-train-hijacking-to-afghan-handlers-and-indian-mastermind\">repeatedly accused India</a> of training and facilitating Baloch rebels and, after the Jaffer Express attack, formally designated Baloch separatist groups as “Fitna al-Hindustan”, a term implying Indian involvement.</p><p>But Basit said such claims must be backed by credible evidence.</p><p>“This attack was carried out in broad daylight and done by locals. This is a straight-up failure of intelligence and local security apparatus. While the response time was quick and they were able to restore control, the question is why such an attack, in main cities, was able to take place at all,” he said.</p><p>Saher Baloch described Islamabad’s focus on India as a familiar tactic that may provide short-term diplomatic cover but does little to address deeper issues.</p><p>“Pakistan seeks to reframe Balochistan from a political conflict to a security problem in order to attract diplomatic sympathy and deflect scrutiny internally,” she said, adding that the approach has limits.</p><p>“There is a lot more awareness now that Balochistan’s unrest is driven primarily by domestic factors, such as enforced disappearances, lack of political autonomy and economic marginalisation,” she said.</p><p>Gul said that while local grievances are central, prolonged instability could still serve the interests of external actors.</p><p>India, he argued, could benefit by limiting China’s footprint in the region. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are external motives and that is why money is poured into violence and militancy to keep Balochistan on tenterhooks,” he said.</p><p>Basit said the involvement of both China and the US already gives the conflict an international dimension but stressed that the roots of the violence remain local.</p><p>“External elements are always secondary as internal fault lines are the primary reasons of why there is conflict and violence in the province. The government must bridge the gap to ensure that those external elements do not exploit those internal issues,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Last week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-t-do-anything-without-the-internet\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">‘Can’t do anything without the internet’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Pezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/protests-grow-as-irans-government-makes-meager-offer-amid-tanking-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic reforms and cash subsidies</a>.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Simin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Saeed Mirzaei, who works at an immigration agency in the capital, said 46 employees at his company had to go on mandatory leave for weeks amid the shutdown.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He told Al Jazeera that they suddenly lost all contact with foreign counterparts, were unable to get updated information from embassies, and missed deadlines to apply for universities on behalf of their customers wishing to leave a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heavily sanctioned Iran</a> for better opportunities.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“We can’t do anything without the internet because our work deals directly with it,” Mirzaei said.</p><h2 id=\"national-internet-a-bitter-joke\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">National internet a ‘bitter joke’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">During the blackout, Iran’s theocratic establishment even struggled to sustain basic services using the so-called National Information Network, a limited nationalised intranet.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The connection to the intranet was slow and patchy, many companies remained disconnected from it, and those that were allowed to connect retained only a fraction of their customer base amid <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/why-is-irans-economy-failing-prompting-deadly-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general economic stagnation</a> across the country.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Hashemi, the communications minister, said a demand by hardliners within the establishment to <a href=\"/news/2024/2/24/iran-unveils-plan-for-tighter-internet-rules-to-promote-local-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">move away from using the international web</a> in favour of a domestic connection was a “bitter joke” that is not feasible to enforce.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He said his ministry estimates that the country’s online businesses could survive under a blackout for roughly 20 days, signalling that the state had no choice this week but to gradually restore internet bandwidth.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Figures for economic damages incurred by the blackout published by officials reflect only the visible costs and do not account for hidden losses, according to Abazar Barari, a member of Iran’s Chamber of Commerce.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“In the import and export sector, processes are heavily dependent on the internet from the very initial stages – such as price negotiations, issuance of pro forma and other invoices – to coordination with transportation companies and the verification of documents. As a result, the internet shutdown effectively disrupted foreign trade,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“During this period, customer attrition also occurred, with the damage being particularly severe in certain food commodities, as many countries are unwilling to tie their food security to unstable supply conditions.”</p><h2 id=\"they-have-no-right-to-do-this\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">‘They have no right to do this’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">In a tumultuous country with one of the highest inflation rates in the world, numerous Iranians who tried to make money online to stay afloat are now deeply anxious as well.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">From owners of small online businesses to teachers, chefs, crypto traders, gamers and streamers, people are taking to social media to ask others for extra support after the gradual reconnect this week.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Mehrnaz, a young video editor in Tehran, said she only went back to work this week after her company put her on forced leave without pay from the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start of the protests in the city’s business district</a> in late December.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“I was on the verge of having to move back to my parents’ house in another city. I’m only 25, and I hit near-zero for the second time this year.

Pakistan has spent decades battling a separatist movement in Balochistan, where fighters have been targeting state forces, foreign nationals and people from other parts of Pakistan in the mineral-rich province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.</p><p>The outlawed <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">Balochistan Liberation Army</a> (BLA) claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, according to the AFP news agency.</p><p>The group said it targeted military installations and police and civil administration officials in gun attacks and suicide bombings in nine districts of Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest but least populated and most impoverished province</p><p>On the same day as the attack, Naqvi accused India of being behind the attacks in Balochistan as he spoke to local media with the province’s chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti.</p><p>“These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists,” Naqvi said without presenting any evidence.</p><h2 id=\"but-weren-t-tensions-already-building-up-over-the-world-cup\">But weren’t tensions already building up over the World Cup?</h2><p>Yes. On January 24, the International Cricket Council (ICC) kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament, replacing it with Scotland, after Dhaka refused to play its matches in India, which is cohosting the World Cup with Sri Lanka.</p><p>Amid rising tensions between India and Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Cricket Board asked that its games be shifted from India to Sri Lanka, but its request was rejected by the ICC.</p><p>Bangladesh cited security concerns, but the ICC said there was no “credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team in India”.</p><p>The monthlong tournament, which begins on Saturday, will be the first time Bangladesh will miss a men’s T20 World Cup.</p><p>When Bangladesh was not allowed to play in Sri Lanka, Naqvi criticised the ICC for “double standards”. The ICC in the past has allowed India to avoid playing in Pakistan when Pakistan has hosted tournaments and instead hold those games in third nations. And under a deal involving India and Pakistan, the ICC has now allowed Pakistan to do the same. When India hosts a series like the World Cup, Pakistan is allowed to play in third countries, like Sri Lanka in this case.</p><p>“You can’t have double standards. You can’t say for one country [India] they can do whatever they want and for the others to have to do the complete opposite,” Naqvi said. “That’s why we’ve taken this stand and made clear Bangladesh have had an injustice done to them. They should play in the World Cup. They are a major stakeholder in cricket.”</p><p>Pakistan will play all of its matches in Sri Lanka instead of India amid a flare-up in tensions between the South Asian neighbours.</p><p>After an attack on tourists in April in India-administered Kashmir that India blamed on Pakistan, India and Pakistan engaged in May in a heated aerial war. They used drones and missiles to target each other’s military bases. A ceasefire was eventually brokered on May 10.</p><p>Scepticism towards India has been on the rise in Bangladesh since the summer of 2024 when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in mass antigovernment protests and fled to India.</p><p>On January 3, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) removed fast bowler <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/india-bangladesh-tensions-rock-cricket-as-sport-turns-diplomatic-weapon\">Mustafizur Rahman</a> from the Indian Premier League, Bangladesh’s only cricketer in the tournament.</p><p>The BCCI did not state the reason behind this decision, citing only “developments all around”.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-impact-the-world-cup\">How will this impact the World Cup?</h2><p>The match between India and Pakistan was expected to have been the most watched match of the entire tournament. Losing it will likely slash viewership for that slot by tens of millions of people.</p><p>In 2021, the India-Pakistan match at the T20 World Cup registered a record 167 million viewers, making it the most watched T20 international in history, according to Star India, the tournament’s official broadcaster.</p><p>Due to its high viewership, the India-Pakistan match is the most valuable advertising window of the World Cup. If the match is cancelled, broadcasters lose out on revenue.</p><p>Similarly, Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium, which was due to host the game, loses a major match day revenue opportunity from ticket sales.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-pakistan-s-chances-at-the-world-cup\">What does it mean for Pakistan’s chances at the World Cup?</h2><p>The Pakistani team will forfeit two points in the group stage because of the boycott, which India will gain without playing the game.</p><p>With two points awarded for every win at this World Cup, Pakistan now have less room for error and must win more of their remaining games to ensure their chances of advancing.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Pakistan and India have not played any bilateral cricket since 2012 and face each other only in multination events.</p><p>Under a deal signed last year, India and Pakistan agreed not to travel to each other’s countries in cases in which either hosts an ICC event, instead playing at neutral venues.</p><p>Pakistan boycotting the match against India in the neutral venue possibly sets a new precedent for India to take similar action in future tournaments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
