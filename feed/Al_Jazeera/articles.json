Oil giant Chevron has managed to keep operating there.</p><p>With a capacity of more than 300 billion barrels, Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.</p><p>However, its reserves have dropped sharply over the past three decades, since former President Hugo Chavez and then the succeeding Maduro administration squeezed control of the state-run oil company, PDVSA.</p><p>Currently, Chevron is the only US oil producer still active in Venezuela. The company secured a licence from President Biden in 2022 to operate outside US sanctions. The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year.</p><p>Chevron, which partners with PDVSA, accounts for about one-fifth of Venezuela’s official oil production.</p><p>Chevron increased shipments from 128,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October this year to 150,000bpd last month. The US group says it needs to recover billions of dollars PDVSA owes in unpaid bills and property seizures.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-sanctions-does-the-us-already-have-in-place-on-venezuela\">What other sanctions does the US already have in place on Venezuela?</h2><p>At the core of the US sanctions programme are targeted financial and asset-blocking measures. US citizens and companies are banned from dealing with various designated Venezuelan officials, business leaders and entities whose property and interests in property are frozen in the US, unless authorised to do so by OFAC.</p><p>In addition to individual sanctions, the US has imposed broad sectoral restrictions on Venezuela’s economy, most notably on its state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and related oil exports. Since 2017, Washington has barred the Venezuelan government from US financial markets and prohibited the purchase of Venezuelan debt.</p><p>In 2019, sanctions were extended to freeze PDVSA assets in the US, restrict US firms – except Chevron – from doing business with PDVSA, and deter international partners from engaging with Venezuela’s oil sector.</p><p>US policy also includes visa restrictions and travel bans on Venezuelan officials and their associates, whom they accuse of undermining democracy or being responsible for human rights violations.</p><p>The US has also sanctioned maritime and shipping operations connected to Venezuela’s oil trade, including designating vessels and shipping companies which transport Venezuelan crude.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the US presidency earlier this year, the US has added terrorism-related designations to Venezuelan groups it alleges are involved in drug trafficking or broader criminal networks. These designations carry their own financial and legal restrictions, often intersecting with existing economic sanctions.</p><p>In November, the US government designated the Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/what-is-cartel-de-los-soles-the-latest-group-designated-terrorist-by-us\">Cartel de los Soles</a> as a terrorist organisation and alleged that the group, which is accused of drug trafficking operations, is overseen by Maduro himself.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-10T224806Z_2094381794_RC2WDIAZRGS9_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ANNIVERSARY-MARCH-1765538677.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro points towards supporters, during a march to commemorate the Battle of Santa Ines, on the same day Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, in Caracas, Venezuela, December 10, 2025 [Gaby Oraa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-affected-venezuela\">How have sanctions affected Venezuela?</h2><p>US sanctions against Venezuela have contributed to one of the most severe economic collapses in modern history outside of a war zone.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Caracas was producing 3.6 million barrels of oil per day, generating 95 percent of its export revenues. But US sanctions and years of mismanagement have brought production below 1 million bpd.</p><p>That severely reduced tax revenues from oil proceeds, a key source of government income. Eventually, after the central bank printed more money to cover budget shortfalls and imports became increasingly expensive, inflation exceeded 1 million percent in 2018.</p><p>Venezuela defaulted on its commercial debt in 2017. Together with bonds issued by PDVSA and the state-owned utility, Elecar, the government owes approximately $92bn. An additional $57bn is owed to China and in various arbitration awards.</p><p>In all, Venezuela’s debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated at 148 percent.</p><p>The US relieved some sanctions briefly during Biden’s presidency, under the 2023 Barbados Agreement, notably on oil and debt, in return for political guarantees such as holding free and fair elections and releasing detained US citizens.</p><p>The deal allowed Venezuela to earn an additional $740m in oil sales. But then Maduro blocked his main opponent, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/who-is-maria-corina-machado-2025-winner-of-the-nobel-peace-prize\">Maria Corina Machado</a>, who remains in hiding but was awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, from running for election, and Biden reimposed US sanctions in April 2024.</p><p>However, experts suggest, sanctions have actually helped Maduro stay in power to some extent. Venezuelan officials shifted to an illicit “black market” economy using shadow fleets to transport oil. That, in turn, strengthened a loyal circle of military and business elites who profit from evading sanctions, and circling back their support to Maduro.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169085\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169085\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-10T214724Z_415112225_RC2XDIAQZIJB_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ANNIVERSARY-MARCH-1765538660.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro dances, as he joins supporters during a march to commemorate the Battle of Santa Ines, on the same day Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, in Caracas, Venezuela, on December 10, 2025 [Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-ways-to-get-around-these-sanctions\">Are there ways to get around these sanctions?</h2><p>There are myriad methods Venezuela has adopted under Maduro to skirt US sanctions.</p><p>Caracas, in coordination with other sanctioned states such as Iran, has used a “shadow fleet” of older, lightly regulated oil tankers to transport crude to buyers such as Chinese refiners.</p><p>These vessels often turn off Automated Identification System (AIS) transponders, use falsified tracking data, change names or flags, or operate under opaque ownership structures in jurisdictions that do not enforce sanctions rigorously.</p><p>They aim to conceal the true origin and destination of the oil and frustrate enforcement of sanctions. The Skipper, which was seized off the coast of Venezuela by the US this week, is believed to be a part of this network of tankers which smuggle oil for countries facing stiff sanctions, including Venezuela, Russia and Iran.</p><p>Venezuelan oil shipped to China has, in some cases, been labelled as Brazilian crude or otherwise relabelled on certificates of origin, Reuters reported, allowing carriers and buyers to circumvent tagging that would flag cargo as subject to US sanctions.</p><p>Transshipment at sea or in intermediate ports, where sanctioned cargoes can be switched from one vessel to another which is not on a sanctions list, is another method of evading detection.</p><p>Some sanctioned entities have also been reported as using shell companies or intermediaries in tax havens to obscure beneficial ownership and make it harder for sanctions regulators to trace transactions.</p><p>In recent years, Venezuelan officials have also reportedly used cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions and access foreign currency. While this does not directly replace large oil export proceeds, it reflects broader methods for accessing value outside the formal financial architecture subject to US controls.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The crisis is aggravated by vehicular and industrial emissions, massive road dust, construction activities and coal and biomass-fired residential heating.</p><p>As dozens of Indian cities grapple with “poor” or “very poor” air quality, per India’s pollution watchdog, China serves as a model for its neighbouring nation. Beijing, through stringent measures and effective air pollution control policies, has made a considerable effort to improve its air quality while also achieving impressive economic growth.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Beijing was crowned as the world’s smog capital. China’s <a href=\"https://wmo.int/media/magazine-article/air-quality-management-and-weather-prediction-during-2008-beijing-olympics#:~:text=Temporary%20emission%20reduction%20regulations%20were,et%20al.%2C%202008).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">temporary</a> emission reduction regulations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics set the stage for its war on air pollution. With the <a href=\"https://english.mee.gov.cn/News_service/infocus/201309/t20130924_260707.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launch</a> of a five-year national action plan in 2013, the country introduced a raft of measures, including the closure of coal-fired boilers, promoting public transport and new energy vehicles, accelerating technological reform of enterprises and boosting innovation and green energy.</p><p>Special emphasis was given to slashing the “particulate matter (PM2.5)”. These inhalable particles, equal or less than <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/how-air-pollution-is-destroying-our-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.5 microns</a> in diameter, are a major source of air pollution and pose the greatest danger to human health over their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.</p><p>Beijing’s efforts, coupled with the establishment of an early warning and emergency response system, better <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/02/china-tackling-air-pollution-big-data/\">regulation</a> of pollution activities, relocation of factories from populated areas and incentives for farmers to discourage agricultural burning, made a lasting impact, showing a dramatic 35 percent improvement in highly polluted areas by 2017.</p><p>In the following years, Beijing continued its campaign against air pollution. <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-battle-against-air-pollution-update\">Average PM2.5 concentration</a> dropped by a half, from 72 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) in 2013 to 36μg/m³ in 2019, dropping further to <a href=\"https://www.mee.gov.cn/ywdt/xwfb/202502/t20250224_1102786.shtml\">29.3μg/m³</a> in 2024. Although substantially higher than the World Health Organization’s <a href=\"https://www.iqair.com/newsroom/2021-who-air-quality-guidelines\">guidelines</a> – 5μg/m³ – it still marked a major breakthrough in China’s push against air pollution.</p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, China sustained its <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2018-07/03/content_5303158.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">battle</a> for blue skies, rolling out targeted air pollution control policies such as limiting construction-related emissions, deploying clean industrial technologies, cutting steel production, retiring old cars and encouraging the adoption of electric energy vehicles. The measures paid dividends as China’s capital <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/23/china/china-air-pollution-mic-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transformed</a> from an environmental backwater into an emblematic case of urban air quality governance. Blue skies are indeed back in Beijing, given PM2.5 concentration <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20251016/44cf9562f5184a9fa1eb6b01bbef0708/c.html\">averaged</a> 24.9μg/m³ in the first three quarters of 2025, per the government.</p><p>The recent improvement builds on prior gains. In 2022, average annual PM2.5 concentration across China <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-01-29/339-Chinese-cities-enjoy-good-air-quality-on-86-5-of-days-in-2022-1gYTmxFHeI8/index.html\">fell</a> to 29μg/m³, according to Chinese media, and the number of days classified as having good air quality in 339 cities reached 316 – a progress not many regional countries could match. As many parts of the world <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/chinas-air-quality-policies-have-swifty-reduced-pollution-improved-life-expectancy/\">experienced</a> rising PM2.5 levels, China’s steep reductions were so substantial that they single-handedly drove a decline in global pollution, highlighting the country’s outsized contribution to improving air quality worldwide.</p><p>Independent research supports the data. Thanks to timely government <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/1063841/eawp-075-air-quality-peoples-republic-china.pdf\">intervention</a>, strong coordination between local and central administrations and international financial institutions, the Greater Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region notched a significant achievement. According to the Asian Development Bank, the region has made major gains in air quality: between 2015 and 2023, average annual PM2.5 levels fell by 44.2 percent, sulphur dioxide by 76.3 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 34.8 percent, while the share of days with good air quality rose by 10.3 points to 63.1 percent.</p><p>Experts <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-09-07/China-s-remarkable-global-achievement-in-air-pollution-control-1GtI6NZsWgE/p.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">underscore</a> that China’s environmental frameworks have boosted cross-sector cooperation and spurred active participation from industries that were once major polluters. Over the years, Beijing has developed the world’s largest and most comprehensive new energy industrial chain. Its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leadership</a> in producing renewable energy and manufacturing electric vehicles positions it at the centre of the global clean energy transition, making it an important actor to combat air pollution at home and abroad.</p><p>With Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) growing by more than 73 percent between 2013 and 2024 and PM2.5 concentrations plunging to 26μg/m³ in the January-September period, the country demonstrates how a consistent, policy-driven approach can maintain a high growth rate and still strive to deliver clean air to its people. This experience offers a precedent for India and other nations, pursuing to curb pollution without impeding their development goals.</p><p>Air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk. It knows no borders, exacerbates climate change, causes economic losses and reduces agricultural productivity. Even in China, where three-quarters of cities met their annual PM2.5 targets in 2024, the monster is resurging sharply across several regions, urging Beijing to intensify its own measures and ensure enforcement.</p><p>The scale of this challenge necessitates strengthening cooperation and sharing best practices, particularly among countries in South, Southeast and East Asia that are worst affected. Being at the forefront of the air pollution crisis – what China faced a decade earlier amid rapid development and urbanisation – India cannot afford to be complacent in drawing valuable lessons both from Chinese past successes and nascent challenges.</p><p>By adopting elements of China’s clean-air playbook – from shutting down highly polluting factories and expanding electric bus fleets to establishing real-time dust monitoring at construction sites and reinforcing interprovincial coordination – India could make meaningful progress in securing cleaner air and a sustainable future for its people, while advancing its own development and economic growth.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

barred women from most jobs and public services – and from playing sport.</p><p>Asghari, who in 2018 became Afghanistan’s first ever IOC member, accepts her “situation is quite challenging” and beating the drum for Afghan women’s sport “does require certain precautions”.</p><p>Nevertheless, the former international basketball player, like many top Afghan women athletes, is undeterred in speaking out about the treatment of women under the Taliban authorities.</p><p>“The reality is that when you take a public stand for women’s rights you do become a target, but I believe strongly in communication and engagement,” she said in an email interview with the AFP news agency.</p><p>“As long as the Taliban remain the reality on the ground in Afghanistan, we cannot afford to waste time doing nothing.</p><p>“In my role, I have tried to help smooth the discussions between the IOC and those currently in control, focusing on the sport rights of women and girls and particularly primary school girls who are still inside Afghanistan.”</p><p>Asghari, one of four children born to a retired professional makeup artist mother and a father who was a manager in the Afghan Olympic national committee, says the “conversations are not always easy”.</p><p>“They are not about legitimising any government,” she said.</p><p>“But they are very important for creating tangible opportunities for future generations of young boys and girls in Afghanistan.”</p><h2 id=\"i-hope-fifa-can-align-with-ioc-talks-with-the-taliban\">‘I hope FIFA can align with IOC talks with the Taliban’</h2><p>With

the Taliban,” she said.</p><p>Asghari, who had been involved in the “project” for more than a year, hopes the message gets through to Afghanistan’s rulers.</p><p>“The Taliban were given the country and now they’re trying to maintain power while ignoring fundamental human rights, particularly for women,” she said.</p><p>“It’s very difficult for them to continue ruling Afghanistan this way in the long term, and the Taliban need to understand that their international acceptance is directly linked to respecting human rights, including the rights of women to education and sport.”</p><p>Asghari, who attended the recent Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh, where Afghan women and men competed, said she hoped for “small openings” in the Taliban’s stance.</p><p>“I also believe that if we can find small openings — like developing sport in primary schools where girls are still allowed to attend up to sixth grade — we should take them,” she said.</p><p>“This isn’t about accepting the Taliban’s restrictions, it’s about not abandoning the girls and women of Afghanistan.</p><p>“We have to work with reality, while continuing to push for fundamental change.”</p><p>Asghari says even achieving small breakthroughs like that could prevent the long-term harm women suffered during the Taliban’s first spell in power, from 1996 to 2001.</p><p>She said she had seen the impact on her return from her first period of exile, in Iran.</p><p>“What concerns me deeply is that we’re creating another lost generation,” she said.</p><p>“I remember when I was in sixth grade aged 12, and there was a 20-year-old woman sitting next to me in the same class because she couldn’t go to school during the previous Taliban era.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to communicate with her and it was difficult for both of us, but especially for her because she had lost so many years.</p><p>“I cannot accept seeing this happen again. That’s why even small opportunities matter so much.”</p><p>Asghari retains hope despite the bleak outlook and believes in “continued engagement and dialogue” with the Taliban.</p><p>“The future of Afghanistan is this young generation. We need to give them every opportunity we can, no matter how small, and never, ever give up on them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

UN officials have warned the attacks amount to “war crimes”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Khodr explained that the attacks form part of a sustained military pressure campaign.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“This is all part of military pressure on Hezbollah to force it to disarm,” she said. Israel wants the group “to give up its strategic weapons, its long-range weapons, its precision-guided missiles, its drones” which the Israeli military believes are stored in the Bekaa Valley and further inland.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Hezbollah has sharply refused to relinquish its arsenal as long as Israel bombards and occupies parts of Lebanon. The group “doesn’t want to give up its weapons because it would view that as surrender”, Khodr added, noting that “Hezbollah and Lebanon do not have the upper hand. Israel enjoys air superiority.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Tensions escalated further two weeks ago when Israel bombed Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing Hezbollah’s top military commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Haytham Ali Tabatabai</a>.

It will enable officials to collect up to five years of social media history from travellers from certain visa-waiver countries before they can enter the country.</p><p>The proposal states that this mandatory social media history disclosure is in line with Executive Order 14161, signed by Trump in January 2025.</p><p>That order, titled “Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”, required US government agencies to increase their vetting of foreign nationals entering the country.</p><h2 id=\"who-would-this-affect\">Who would this affect?</h2><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The requirement will apply to travellers using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) under the US’s Visa Waiver Program.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The Visa Waiver Program permits citizens of <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">42 countries</a> – including the United Kingdom, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Malta, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea – to travel to the US for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">At present, the ESTA automatically screens applicants and grants travel approval without requiring an in-person interview at a US embassy or consulate, unlike standard visa applications. Applicants are required to provide a more limited set of information, such as their parents’ names, current email address and details of any past criminal record.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-this-work\" data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">How would this work?</h2><p>Once the proposal comes into effect, visitors will be required to provide CBP with a list of their social media handles or usernames used over the past five years.</p><p>The visitors would not have to give CBP their social media log‑in credentials or passwords. They will use this information to review the publicly accessible information on the social media profiles of these visitors.</p><p>The new notice also states that travellers will have to provide additional personal information, including all telephone numbers used over the past five years and email addresses used over the previous 10 years.</p><p data-start=\"1488\" data-end=\"1872\">Authorities also said they plan to add what are described as “high-value data fields” to the ESTA application “when feasible”. These will include metadata from electronically submitted photographs, extensive personal details about applicants’ family members, such as their places of birth and telephone numbers used over the past five years, as well as biometric information, including fingerprints, DNA and iris data.</p><p data-start=\"1488\" data-end=\"1872\">The announcement did not include information about what the administration will be looking for within social media accounts of visitors or why it is asking for that information.</p><p id=\"it-is-unclear-when-the-proposal-would-take-effect\">It is unclear when the proposal will take effect. However, the public now has 60 days to submit comments about the proposed changes before they are finalised, the notice in the Federal Register states.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-government-doing-this-now\">Why is the US government doing this now?</h2><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019. This is an extension of that.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">That measure was first introduced by the Trump administration during his first term as president, and was kept in place during President Joe Biden’s tenure.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The CBP and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have been seeking to significantly broaden the existing social media disclosure rules for some time.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">“USCIS has proposed to extend the social media disclosure requirement to applicants for other immigration benefits as well – up through naturalisation,” Caroline DeCell, a senior staff attorney and legislative adviser at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In June this year, the State Department also announced that it now requires all F, M and J visa applicants to make their social media profiles public as part of enhanced screening to identify national security threats.</p><p>Most social media platforms allow users to either keep their profiles private or make them public.</p><p>Private profiles can only be viewed by people actively added as friends – this includes all posts, photos, videos or other content posted by the profile user. Content posted on public profiles can be viewed by anyone.</p><p>This relates to student visas for those enrolled in accredited colleges, or in vocational or technical, non‑academic educational programmes. It also covers exchange visitors participating in approved exchange study programmes.</p><p>“A US visa is a privilege, not a right,” the State Department statement from June said.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-privacy-implications-of-this\">What are the privacy implications of this?</h2><p>DeCell said that if the CBP proposal is approved, the privacy implications would be “significant” as it will require disclosure not only of social media handles, but also of all phone numbers used in the past five years and email addresses used in the past 10 years, as well as biometric data.</p><p>“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online. And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.</p><p>DeCell added that if the USCIS proposal to seek this information for all immigration visa and citizenship applicants is also approved, besides the CBP proposal for travellers from visa waiver countries, “then nearly every non-US citizen who seeks to enter or remain in the United States would be subject to indefinite social media surveillance by the US government”.</p><p>Under the USCIS proposal, US citizens who petition in support of their relatives’ immigration applications would also be subjected to this “surveillance”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-implications-for-freedom-of-speech\">What are the implications for freedom of speech?</h2><p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, the press and peaceful assembly.</p><p>However, DeCell warned that this expanding system will deter free speech online and many foreigners will be put off from travelling to the US, whether for work or leisure.</p><p>“It’s a massive blow to First Amendment freedoms,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Keep fighting,” Abrego Garcia said.</p><p>In a ruling on Thursday, US District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/us-judge-orders-release-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-from-immigration-detention\">ordered</a> Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the US without any legal basis.</p><h2 id=\"the-face-of-trump-s-hardline-immigration-policies\">The face of Trump’s hardline immigration policies</h2><p>Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country by a gang that targeted his family. He originally moved to the US without documentation as a teenager.</p><p>He then became the highest-profile case among more than 200 people sent to the notorious <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/1/why-trump-and-bukele-are-destroying-kilmar-abrego-garcias-life\">El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison</a> as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in the US.</p><p>He was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March. A court later ordered his return to the US, where he was detained again, as immigration officials sought to deport him to a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/us-judge-asks-for-assurance-abrego-garcia-wont-be-deported-to-liberia\">series of African countries</a> instead of El Salvador.</p><p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have said in a previous filing that he endured maltreatment during his nearly three months in detention in El Salvador, including “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture”.</p><p>The US administration has said it was targeting violent gang members by sending them El Salvador, but many of the people swept up in the campaign – including Abrego Garcia – have protested their innocence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"judicial-activism\"></h2><p>The Department of Homeland Security slammed Thursday’s ruling and said it would appeal it, labelling the decision as “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during President Barack Obama’s administration.</p><p>“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.</p><p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said he expects his client’s ordeal was far from over, and he was preparing to defend him against further deportation efforts.</p><p>“I wish I could say that the government has decided that he’s suffered enough for his temerity to stand up for his constitutional right to not be deported to a country where he already had a judge order that he not be deported to,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.</p><p>“I wish I could say that this is the end of the story, but I think we’ve all been here long enough to know that unfortunately the government is not going to leave [Abrego Garcia] alone. They’re going to keep throwing the weight of the Department of Justice, the weight of the Department of Homeland Security, against this man and against his family.”</p><p>The lawyer earlier said the judge’s ruling had made it clear that the government could not detain a person indefinitely without legal authority, adding that Abrego Garcia had already “endured more than anyone should ever have to”.</p><h2 id=\"legal-battles-ongoing\">Legal battles ongoing</h2><p>Abrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him due to the attention his case received.</p><p>Since his return, federal authorities have also filed charges against Abrego Garcia for alleged human smuggling related to a 2022 traffic stop.</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.</p><p>In her ruling on Thursday, Judge Xinis said Trump lawyers “affirmatively misled” the court, including falsely claiming that Costa Rica had rescinded an offer to accept Abrego Garcia.</p><p>Abrego Garcia has said he was willing to resettle there in the event he was deported from the US.</p><p>In a separate proceeding, Abrego Garcia has also petitioned to reopen his immigration case to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/kilmar-abrego-garcia-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us-in-bid-to-avoid-deportation\">seek asylum</a> in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Initial home invasions and looting accompanied by rape, followed by attacks in public spaces as control solidifies, and finally the long-term detention of women subjected to torture, gang rape and forced marriage.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“Women and girls from non-Arab tribes in Darfur, including the Masalit, Berti, Fur and Zaghawa, were directly targeted,” the report said. In Al-Gezira state, witnesses described RSF forces singling out lighter-skinned girls and women aged 14 to 30 as “trophies”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Just last week, the Sudan Doctors Network, a medical monitoring organisation, documented 19 additional rape cases at al-Afad Camp in al-Dabba, where women fleeing the recently fallen city of el-Fasher were attacked by RSF forces.
