            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Venezuela and the United States teeter on the brink of war, China has been vocal in condemning US actions. In Beijing’s view, Washington’s escalation – which includes seizing Venezuelan oil tankers, striking alleged drug-smuggling boats and imposing a blockade off the Venezuelan coast – is a textbook example of American unilateralism, infringing on another country’s sovereignty and violating the United Nations Charter.</p><p>During a December 17 call with his Venezuelan counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced opposition to US “unilateral bullying” and expressed his support for Venezuela’s right to “defend its sovereignty and national dignity”.</p><p>Yet, Beijing has failed to offer Caracas anything beyond rhetoric. China is clearly wary of falling into a geopolitical trap and its inaction demonstrates the limits of its influence in Latin America.</p><h2 id=\"engagement-with-latin-america\">Engagement with Latin America</h2><p>For more than two decades, China has pursued an expansion of economic relations with Latin American countries. As a result, today it is South America’s top trading partner; it is also the second-largest trading partner of Mexico, one of the US’s closest allies in the region.</p><p>China’s engagement with Latin American countries is fuelled by the high degree of complementarity between their economies. Agricultural goods – notably soya beans from Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay – have improved China’s food security, especially during its trade war with the US. Meanwhile, minerals such as lithium carbonate from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have become indispensable to China’s rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) industry.</p><p>In recent years, Chinese EV exports to Latin America have surged, growing by 55 percent in 2023 alone. The region has not only alleviated China’s overcapacity problem, but has also offered Chinese telecommunication technology, such as Huawei’s 5G  – which has long been<a href=\"/economy/2018/12/7/why-are-countries-banning-huawei\"> spurned </a>by Western countries – a market. Currently, Huawei’s 5G equipment is present in most Latin American countries.</p><p>The US, traditionally viewing Latin America as its back yard, has been naturally suspicious and hostile towards China’s growing influence in the region. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – an outspoken China hawk who has previously labelled the Communist Party of China an “evil, genocidal regime” – embarked on a diplomatic blitz across the region. Declaring that he was on a mission to “counter the [CPC’s] influence in the Western Hemisphere”, he sought to persuade several Latin American countries to scale back ties with China.</p><p>Despite being unable to offer a compelling alternative model of economic cooperation and opting for extortion tactics through tariffs, Washington nonetheless holds the upper hand in this battle for influence. For example, although most countries in the region have been economically enticed to adhere to the one China policy, recognising that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, the region continues to be the last bastion of diplomatic support for Taiwan, with seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan over China.</p><p>This week, the US achieved a resounding victory when Trump-backed conservative <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-backed-conservative-nasry-asfura-wins-honduras-election-authorities\">Nasry Asfura</a> won the presidential elections in Honduras; during his campaign, he pledged to sever diplomatic ties with China and re-establish formal relations with Taiwan.</p><p>Over the past year, under the Trump administration, several Latin American countries have yielded to US pressure to limit economic ties with China.</p><p>In February, Panama formally <a href=\"/news/2025/2/7/china-blasts-us-as-panama-quits-belt-and-road-initiative\">withdrew</a> from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Then in March, the Panama Canal’s Hong Kong-based operator <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/china-scrutinising-hong-kong-firms-sale-of-panama-canal-ports\">announced</a> that it was selling most of its stake to a consortium of American companies – a move that followed Trump’s allegation that the vital waterway was controlled by China. In December, Mexico announced it would slap tariffs of up to 50 percent on Chinese goods, starting on January 1.</p><p>In Venezuela, US pressure is not related to its close ties to China, as it has more to do with US domestic politics: Rubio is seeking to fulfil a long-held political agenda to please opposition-minded Venezuelan and Cuban American constituencies.</p><p>Nevertheless, any regime change in Caracas would certainly hurt China’s interests. As the biggest customer of Venezuelan crude oil, China has a vested interest in maintaining Venezuela’s peace and stability. While China itself is not dependent on Venezuelan oil – with Venezuela not even ranking among its top 10 crude suppliers – the US’s interception of Venezuelan oil tankers nonetheless undermines China’s energy strategy, which aims to avoid becoming over-reliant on any single energy supplier.</p><h2 id=\"monroe-doctrine-2-0-or-a-trap\">Monroe Doctrine 2.0 or a trap?</h2><p>China views the escalation in Venezuela not only through the economic lens, but also through a geopolitical one. The larger context of US global power projection is important.</p><p>In the recently released National Security Strategy (NSS), the Trump administration declared that the days of the US acting as the world’s policeman are over, advocating instead for a return to the principles of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy strategy which sought to block any outside interference in the Americas that could infringe on US interests.</p><p>Although notably, the NSS does not designate China as the greatest threat to the US, it nonetheless states that the US government will maintain a military capable of deterring Chinese ambitions on Taiwan by military means.</p><p>This document, along with escalating US-Venezuela tensions, has sent mixed signals to China. On the one hand, the US appears to deprioritise competition with China and instead focus on reasserting its hegemony over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>On the other hand, it has not made any significant steps to indicate disengagement in Asia; for example, its military bases in South Korea and Japan remain fully operational.</p><p>Beijing fears that Washington might be trying to lure it into a false sense of security with its rhetoric and an ostensible geopolitical shift; thus, it remains cautious.</p><p>Following the NSS’s release, China put out a policy paper on Latin America and the Caribbean. Likely a response to recent events, the paper reflects Beijing’s attempt to bring the fight to the US’s doorstep.</p><p>However, the policies and strategies laid out in the document share the same shortcomings that Chinese foreign policy has always had: they offer support that is more symbolic than substantive. China’s attempt to rally the Global South under the banner of opposing US hegemony and to foster grievance-based unity, seriously falls short of its mark when confronted with American military might.</p><p>In this context and given Venezuela’s limited economic value to China and its geopolitical distance, the Chinese government would not commit any resources to defending the Latin American country.</p><p>In the event of a US invasion, China would likely leverage it to promote its vision of a multipolar world, and position itself as the champion of international law and the UN Charter. While it would consider the US being bogged down in a protracted war a positive development, China would almost certainly not come to Venezuela’s aid.</p><p>A US toppling of the Venezuelan government, however, would expose the limits of Chinese power in the region. Such a scenario would undoubtedly prompt many Latin American countries to reconsider whether aligning themselves with China is a good idea when an aggressive US is so close by.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A few months later, the Department of Homeland Security posted in favour of remigration online.</p><p>But it is not just American far-right figures evoking the idea of remigration; European far-right leaders are also joining in.</p><p>Here is a closer look at what remigration means and what its origins are.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-remigration\">What is remigration?</h2><p>Broadly, remigration refers to when an immigrant voluntarily returns to their country of origin.</p><p>However, in the context of far-right movements, remigration is a method of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>For white ethnonationalists, remigration is a process through which all non-white people are forcibly removed from traditionally white countries.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-origins-of-remigration\">W<strong>hat are the origins of remigration?</strong></h2><p>Ideas of remigration trace back to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. The Nazis attempted to “remigrate” the Jews in Germany to Madagascar.</p><p>But the concept got wind through the work of Renaud Camus, a French novelist who devised the Great Replacement conspiracy theory in his 2011 book, Le Grand Remplacement.</p><p>His widely debunked white nationalist theory suggests that elites are replacing white Christians in the West with non-white, primarily Muslim, people through mass migration and demographic changes. Camus calls this “genocide by substitution”.</p><p>Far-right nationalists in Europe and beyond have borrowed ideas from this theory.</p><p>Heidi Beirich, an expert on the American and European far-right movements, told Al Jazeera that the term remigration is “relatively new” in far-right circles.</p><p>Beirich said that the concept was popularised by <a href=\"/news/2024/3/19/far-right-austrian-figure-martin-sellner-banned-from-entering-germany\">Martin Sellner</a>.</p><p>Sellner, 36, is the leader of Austria’s ultranationalist <a href=\"/news/2018/5/22/austria-cracks-down-on-far-right-identitarian-movement\">Identitarian Movement</a>, a far‑right group known for anti-immigration activism and promoting ethnonationalist ideology. Ethnonationalists define the nation primarily by shared ethnicity, ancestry, culture and heritage.</p><p>“Remigration advocates the forced removal of non-white people from what Sellner and others with his beliefs view as historically white countries, basically Europe, Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand,” Beirich explained.</p><p>Beirich said remigration in essence, is a “policy solution to the white supremacist ‘Great Replacement’ conspiracy theory”.</p><h2 id=\"do-different-groups-have-different-ideas\">Do different groups have different ideas?</h2><p>There are strands of nationalists beyond ethnonationalism.</p><p>Civic nationalists, who also called liberal nationalists or constitutional nationalists, define the nation by shared political values, laws and institutions, regardless of ethnicity. They believe that a person belongs to a country if they hold legal citizenship and are committed to the state’s principles.</p><p>While civic nationalists are less enthusiastic about remigration than ethnonationalists, to them, remigration means voluntary return migration.

It was attended by far-right activists from across Europe. InfoMigrants, a website which covers migration issues in Europe, estimated that 400 right-wing activists attended the summit.</p><p>But Beirich said that remigration, if implemented as a policy, would in effect be an “attempt to create all-white countries through ethnic cleansing”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The onslaught turned my life upside down – it erased colours, shattered dreams, and broke my spirit. University education – the centre of my life and ambition – stopped. Gaza itself came to a standstill amid unprecedented destruction.</p><p>Like all families in Gaza, my family and I have suffered greatly during this war. Two years of genocide robbed us of our health and sense of stability. We were forced to flee 10 times, moving from northern Gaza to Khan Younis in the south, then to Rafah, then to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. After more than a year, we returned to Gaza City, only to be displaced again to Khan Younis eight months after our return. Our home was badly damaged; we are now forced to live in it, with tarpaulins instead of walls.</p><p>In the summer of 2024, universities reopened but only for online learning. I registered, not because I still believed I could achieve my dream of being a teaching assistant, but because I wanted to finish what I had started.</p><p>I completed my third year – the year that was supposed to shape me as a future lecturer – from inside a tent, using unstable internet.</p><p>In February, my final year began. A few months later, famine hit us. My health started to deteriorate due to the lack of food, the displacement, and the constant fear of bombing. I lost nearly 15kg in a sudden, unhealthy bout of weight loss. My body became frail, and I was constantly dizzy due to the lack of food. At some point, we had just one meal in the middle of the day, one that was hardly enough to feed a baby. I could see my collarbones becoming more prominent as the famine worsened.</p><p>I also began to notice the severe weight loss of my family members, especially my mother. There were moments when I felt that we were on the brink of losing her. I became afraid to stay awake past 8pm, fearing the hunger I constantly felt.</p><p>Despite all the hardship, I decided not to let the war break me. I kept reminding myself that Gaza is the land of everything, and that what matters is the “now”.</p><p>One night, I decided to start my own project – if I couldn’t light minds with knowledge, I could light phones – or charge them. I shared with my family the idea of starting a small phone-charging project using a small solar panel, and they fully supported me. The next morning, I wrote on a piece of paper: “Phone Charging Point” and hung it outside our tent, and my career as a phone-charging business owner began.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194319\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194319\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194319\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251107-WA00211-1766596977.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a photo of a dozen phones charging\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The charging station of the author [Courtesy of Shahed Abu AlShaikh]</figcaption></figure><p>I made numbered cards and attached them to each phone to ensure none got lost. My days became filled with voices calling out, “Shahed, how’s phone number 7?” I would smile outwardly, but inside, I would carry a deep ache – the ache of never imagining my final year of university would look like this.</p><p>I struggled with cloudy weather, too many phones, and final exams. Every passing cloud that blocked the sun would cut off the power supply since I didn’t have a large battery for storage. In those moments, I cried from exhaustion and helplessness.</p><p>Every day, I earned around $10, just enough to buy internet cards and simple things I once took for granted, like a packet of chips or a box of juice. I would sit there, watching the phones charge, thinking: That was supposed to be my time, my time as a teaching assistant at the university.</p><p>I took my final exams in October while surrounded by phones that were not charging because of cloudy skies, tears streaming down my face.</p><p>I am one of hundreds of thousands of young people in Gaza who refuse to let the war write the end of our stories.</p><p>Education is our form of resistance; that is why the occupation sought to obliterate it. It hoped to send us into the darkness of ignorance, dejection and resignation.</p><p>Yet, the youth of Gaza stand undefeated. We have continued to pursue our education online, battling constant internet blackouts. We continue to support ourselves and our families however we can – some selling food in small street stalls, others offering private tutoring, or starting small businesses.</p><p>Many are applying for scholarships so they can continue their education abroad.</p><p>All of this is proof that Gaza’s youth love life, love their homeland, and are determined to rebuild it, not as it once was, but even better.</p><p>I’m now applying for scholarships outside Gaza to pursue my master’s degree. I want to go abroad, study and then return one day not to charge phones, but to charge minds. If I get accepted, I will hand over my small phone-charging project to my younger brother Anas, whose dream is to become a journalist, to tell the truth about Gaza and its people.</p><p>He and I, and the rest of our peers in Gaza, refuse to give up.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

On Thursday, the son of the critically ill BNP chairperson and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia landed in Dhaka, returning from Britain, where he had lived in exile since 2008. Tens of thousands of supporters gathered at a rally to welcome him home.</p><p>“We want peace,” Rahman said. “We have people from the hills and the plains in this country – Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. We want to build a safe Bangladesh, where every woman, man and child can leave home safely and return safely.”</p><p>His return comes at a time of heightened political uncertainty and tension in Bangladesh, following the assassination of prominent youth leader Osman Hadi and with a national election scheduled for February 2026. The BNP has long been widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls, with Rahman viewed as a leading contender for the prime ministership.</p><p>But the escalating violence in the country following Hadi’s assassination — the offices of the country’s two leading newspapers were set on fire, and a Hindu man was lynched — and deepening political tensions had led to fears that the election might be derailed.</p><p>Analysts say that Tarique Rahman’s return and his speech are likely to help calm the country’s political waters and reinforce the momentum for Bangladesh to hold its election as planned.</p><p>“His arrival has opened a new window of opportunity. I think this will reduce the uncertainty about election and create a sense of stability that the country is looking for,” said Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at the University of Dhaka.</p><p>None of this was guaranteed even a few days ago.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196266\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196266\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196266\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359303711395-1766734458.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman shout slogans following his arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka after more than 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025.

Until recently, however, his return from exile had remained uncertain.</p><p>Rahman himself had demurred on committing to return. His arrival now clears that uncertainty but opens up a new question, said Shahan: Can Rahman truly lead?</p><p>“If he takes a firm stance against extremism, assures the people that he understands their concerns and will work for a stable political future, promises to bring about normalcy and shows that he is ready to govern while establishing a firm control over party apparatus, the political situation will improve significantly,” Shahan said.</p><p>But if Rahman fails to deliver a clear message, “things will deteriorate,” Shahan said.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct researcher at the Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative (HADRI) at Western Sydney University, said the public fervour visible on Thursday over Rahman’s return suggested that he might benefit from support beyond the traditional BNP voter base.</p><p>“People’s interest and reaction to his return is not limited to the BNP alone, but includes people from all walks of life,” Hasan said, adding that many in Bangladesh will likely see the party as a stabilising force amid the chaos of the past 16 months, since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina following massive student-led protests. The interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which assumed office after Hasina fled to India in August 2024, has faced increasing criticism over its failures to ensure law and order, and to deliver on broader promised reforms.</p><p>The enormous rally by supporters to greet Rahman also showed the BNP’s organisational and political strength, Hasan said.</p><p>But there’s another factor, too, that could work in Rahman’s favour, said Hasan: On the streets of Bangladesh, many believe that Khaleda Zia’s son was treated unjustly and forced to leave the country. Under a military-backed caretaker government that was in power between 2006 and 2009, Rahman faced a range of charges. He was subsequently convicted, in absentia, in some of those cases.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359270971109-1766734554.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, center, arrives at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025, after returning from London, ending more than 17 years of self-imposed exile.

The 2024 uprising gave him a second chance. All the cases against him were dropped over the last year and a half, and convictions were stayed, paving the way for his return.</p><p>“Tarique Rahman’s defining trait as a politician will be his focus on policy. He is known as a policy buff within his inner circle and in today’s speech in front of millions of supporters, he stated repeatedly that he has a plan,” said US-based Bangladeshi geopolitical columnist Shafquat Rabbee.</p><p>One key aspect of his plan that will be watched closely across South Asia is his approach to India.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196277\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196277\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196277\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359294746777-1766734733.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman waves to supporters from a bus in Dhaka after returning from London, ending more than 17 years of self-imposed exile, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025.(AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu)\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196277\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarique Rahman waves to supporters from a bus in Dhaka after returning from London on Thursday, December 25, 2025 [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"adult-in-the-room\">‘Adult in the room’</h2><p>Traditionally, India has had a mostly cold relationship with the BNP, maintaining functional ties whenever the Bangladeshi party was in power, but far too often making it clear that it preferred Hasina and her Awami League as its partner.</p><p>The BNP’s decades-old alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist group, didn’t help ties with India. The Jamaat had opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan and has historically favoured closer relations with Islamabad.</p><p>But in recent months, even as anti-Hasina sentiment in Bangladesh has led to intense anti-India rhetoric from several political groups in the country, the BNP has maintained a comparatively restrained posture.</p><p>It has also broken up with the Jamaat, and has tried to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/analysis-bangladeshs-bnp-seeks-hasinas-liberal-mantle-before-elections\">position itself as a centrist party,</a> seemingly eager to occupy the political space vacated by the Awami League, which has been banned from participating in the February election.</p><p>Although Tarique Rahman has adopted a “Bangladesh First” slogan, political observers believe he is unlikely to be a firebrand anti-Indian politician.</p><p>“The baseline assumption for India with Tarique back in Bangladesh will be that the Indians will finally have an adult in the room with serious political muscle to negotiate with,” Rabbee said.</p><p>Recent political surveys in Bangladesh show the BNP and the Jamaat are running close ahead of the election, with a significant number of voters still undecided.</p><p>There too, Rahman’s return should help the BNP, said analysts.</p><p>“His presence will definitely energise the party base and encourage undecided voters to break for the BNP,” Shahan of the University of Dhaka said. “<span>If he performs, we may very well see a ‘wave’ election where the BNP can win in a landslide.” </span></p><p>For that to happen, though, Rahman will need to show that “<span>he can connect with people, reassure them, and provide a clear pathway for reform and democratic transition,” Shahan said. </span></p></div></div></body></html>"

The increase marks the fourth year of Japan’s five-year effort to increase defence outlays to 2 percent of gross domestic product.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p data-start=\"900\" data-end=\"1153\">The spending increase comes as Tokyo voices growing concern over China. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that Japan’s military could become involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by Beijing – comments that caused outrage in Beijing, which hit back with diplomatic and economic measures against Japan.</p><p data-start=\"1155\" data-end=\"1450\">Under the five-year defence build-up plan, Japan is expected to become the world’s third-largest defence spender after the United States and China. The Finance Ministry said Japan is on track to meet the 2 percent target by March. Takaichi’s government has faced pressure from the US to hit that benchmark two years earlier than originally planned. Japan also intends to revise its existing security and defence policies by December 2026 to further enhance its military posture.</p><p data-start=\"1764\" data-end=\"1972\">In recent years, Japan has moved to strengthen its ability to strike targets at long range, a significant shift away from its post-World War II approach that limited the use of force strictly to self-defence.</p><p data-start=\"1974\" data-end=\"2226\">The current national security strategy, adopted in 2022, identifies China as Japan’s most serious strategic challenge and calls for a more assertive role for the military within the framework of the country’s alliance with the US.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4076542\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4076542\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4076542\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024-11-14T091244Z_1701283852_RC2T4BAGGS25_RTRMADP_3_SOUTHKOREA-USA-JAPAN-1762047931.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C556&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US Navy South China Sea\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4076542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The US Navy aircraft carrier USS George Washington is pictured during the Freedom Edge trilateral exercise among the US, Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea, south of the Korean Peninsula and west of Japan’s main islands [File: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"2228\" data-end=\"2535\">Under the new budget, more than 970 billion yen ($6.2bn) is earmarked to enhance Japan’s “standoff” missile capabilities. This includes 177 billion yen ($1.13bn) for the purchase of domestically produced and upgraded Type-12 surface-to-ship missiles, which have an estimated range of about 1,000km (620 miles).</p><p data-start=\"2537\" data-end=\"2974\">Citing an ageing and shrinking population and difficulties in maintaining troop numbers, the government has also placed emphasis on unmanned systems. To strengthen coastal defence, Japan plans to spend 100 billion yen ($640m) on deploying “massive” numbers of unmanned aerial, surface and underwater drones for surveillance and defence. The system, known as “SHIELD,” is scheduled to be operational by March 2028, defence officials said.</p><p data-start=\"2976\" data-end=\"3124\">To speed up deployment, Japan expects to rely initially on imported equipment, potentially sourcing systems from countries such as Turkiye or Israel.</p><h2 id=\"strains-with-china-intensify\">Strains with China intensify</h2><p data-start=\"3161\" data-end=\"3534\">The budget decision comes amid a deterioration in relations between Tokyo and Beijing following Takaichi’s comments on Taiwan. Friction intensified this month after Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan led Tokyo to lodge a protest, saying Chinese aircraft had locked their radar onto Japanese planes — an action seen as a possible prelude to missile targeting.</p><p data-start=\"3161\" data-end=\"3534\">Already concerned about China’s expanding military presence in the Pacific, Japan’s Defence Ministry plans to set up a new office to study Chinese operations, equipment and capabilities in the region.</p><p data-start=\"3738\" data-end=\"3995\">Concerns were further heightened in June when two Chinese aircraft carriers were observed operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima at the same time — a first — underscoring Beijing’s growing ability to project power beyond the East China Sea.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"japan-deepens-defence-industry-cooperation\">Japan deepens defence industry cooperation</h2><p data-start=\"4058\" data-end=\"4292\">Japan is also seeking to revitalise its largely domestic defence industry by expanding joint development projects with partner countries and promoting overseas arms sales, following a relaxation of export restrictions in recent years.</p><p data-start=\"4294\" data-end=\"4573\">For 2026, Tokyo plans to allocate more than 160 billion yen ($1bn) to jointly develop a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy, with deployment targeted for 2035. The project also includes research into AI-controlled drones designed to operate alongside the aircraft.</p><p data-start=\"4575\" data-end=\"4753\">In a boost to Japan’s defence sector, Australia selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August to upgrade the Mogami-class frigate, replacing its fleet of 11 ANZAC-class vessels.</p><p data-start=\"4755\" data-end=\"4871\">The new budget also sets aside nearly 10 billion yen ($64m) to support the defence industrial base and arms exports.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Overall GDP levels remain far below their pre-war baseline, underscoring the fragility of any potential recovery and the economy’s inability to regain productive capacity under current conditions.</p><p data-start=\"1879\" data-end=\"2218\">The report documented a near-total collapse of economic activity in Gaza, alongside sharp contractions across most sectors in the West Bank, despite a modest improvement compared with 2024. It also recorded a decline in trade volumes to and from Palestine compared with 2023, while unemployment in Gaza exceeded 77 percent during 2025.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195789\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195789\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195789\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-1-1766677566.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Palestinian Minister of National Economy visits the Bethlehem Industrial Zone to assess the state of Palestinian industries, 10 December 2025.

These figures align with a recent report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which concluded that the Palestinian economy has regressed to levels last seen 22 years ago.</p><p data-start=\"3946\" data-end=\"4105\">In response, al-Amour said the government was implementing an “urgent package of measures”.</p><p data-start=\"3946\" data-end=\"4105\">“The government is rolling out a series of actions that include strengthening the social protection system, supporting citizens’ resilience in Area C [of the West Bank], and backing small and medium-sized enterprises and productive sectors, particularly industry and agriculture,” al-Amour said.</p><p data-start=\"4509\" data-end=\"4757\">Official data show a sharp drop across nearly all economic activities. Construction contracted by 41 percent, while both industry and agriculture declined by 29 percent each. Wholesale and retail trade fell by 24 percent.</p><p data-start=\"4759\" data-end=\"5010\">The tourism sector has been among the hardest hit. Following the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, the Ministry of Tourism reported daily losses exceeding $2m, as inbound tourism nearly collapsed. By the end of 2024, cumulative losses were estimated at approximately $1bn.</p><p data-start=\"5012\" data-end=\"5312\">The Palestinian Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS), citing PCBS data, reported an 84.2 percent drop in hotel occupancy in the West Bank during the first half of 2024 compared with the same period a year earlier. Losses in accommodation and food services alone amounted to roughly $326m.</p><p data-start=\"5314\" data-end=\"5640\">Despite the downturn, al-Amour said the Ministry of Economy is focusing on sustaining the private sector, substituting Israeli imports across seven key sectors, developing the digital and green economies, and improving the business environment. He noted that about 2,500 new companies continue to be registered each year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tourism-collapsing\" data-start=\"5314\" data-end=\"5640\">Tourism collapsing</h2><p data-start=\"5314\" data-end=\"5640\">Samir Hazbun, a lecturer at al-Quds University and board member of the Palestinian Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said repeated crises have hollowed out the economy.</p><p data-start=\"5314\" data-end=\"5640\">“Over the past five years, all economic sectors have entered successive crises, starting with the COVID-19 pandemic and followed by the war on Gaza,” Hazbun said. “Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been especially affected, exhausting the local economy and weakening its ability to recover.”</p><p data-start=\"6173\" data-end=\"6407\">Hazbun said preliminary estimates indicate tourism has suffered direct losses exceeding $1bn, alongside extensive indirect losses resulting from the paralysis of hotels, souvenir shops, travel agencies, tour guides and street vendors.</p><p data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">He added that hotel investments alone are estimated at $550m, with no financial returns for owners, forcing many workers out of the sector due to the absence of job security and safety nets.</p><p data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">Economic expert Haitham Daraghmeh described Palestinian debt as “accumulated debt that increases monthly”, owed to banks, suppliers, contractors, and the telecommunications and health sectors.</p><p data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">“The withholding of clearance revenues is no longer a temporary financial crisis; it has become a factor of complete economic paralysis,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">With external aid frozen and domestic revenues at historic lows, Daraghmeh warned that the government was “no longer able to cover salaries or operational costs”.</p><p data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">“The government is operating like an ATM, with no real capacity for investment or economic stimulus,” Daraghmeh added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-warnings\" data-start=\"6409\" data-end=\"6607\">Economic warnings</h2><p data-start=\"7807\" data-end=\"8081\">Daraghmeh said World Bank reports warn that continued failure to pay salaries and meet obligations could trigger comprehensive economic collapse. While some countries, including France and Saudi Arabia, have pledged support, he said none of that assistance has materialised.</p><p data-start=\"8083\" data-end=\"8526\">He outlined three possible scenarios; the most likely is a continued gradual decline, driven by ongoing revenue withholding and shrinking resources. The second involves international intervention to prevent total collapse, particularly at a decisive political moment. The third scenario could see a conditional breakthrough, tied to European demands for financial reform, anticorruption measures, curriculum changes and elections.</p><p data-start=\"8765\" data-end=\"9095\">Taken together, the data and expert assessments suggest the Palestinian economy is approaching a dangerous tipping point. Analysts warn that without an end to revenue withholding, renewed international financial support, and a shift in the political context, the economy risks sliding from prolonged crisis into outright collapse.</p><p data-start=\"9097\" data-end=\"9362\">The question facing Palestinian officials and economists alike is how long the system can endure under siege-like conditions – and whether political and economic shifts will arrive in time to halt what many now describe as a slow and deliberate economic unravelling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
