But it is an acknowledgement they also admit has come quite late.</p><p>“The family is happy about it. And we’re excited that he’s finally being recognised,” Yeni Kuti, Fela’s daughter, told Al Jazeera before the ceremony. “But Fela was never nominated [for a Grammy] in his lifetime,” she lamented.</p><p>The recognition is “better late than never”, she said, but “we still have a way to go” in fairly recognising musicians and artists from across the African continent.</p><p>Lemi Ghariokwu, a renowned Nigerian artist and the designer behind 26 of Fela’s iconic album covers, says the fact that this is the first time an African musician gets this honour “just shows that whatever we as Africans need to do, we need to do it five times more.”</p><p>Ghariokwu said he feels “privileged” to witness this moment for Fela. “It’s good to have one of us represented in that category, at that level. So, I’m excited. I’m happy about it,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But he admits he was also “surprised” when he first heard the news.</p><p>“Fela was totally <a href=\"/opinions/2018/7/15/how-fela-kuti-came-to-be-celebrated-by-those-he-sang-against\">anti-establishment</a>. And now, the establishment is recognising him,” Ghariokwu said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4276616\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4276616\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4276616\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FELA-BEASTS-OF-NO-NATION-FRONT-COVER-1769797493.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela Kuti\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4276616\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The front cover of Fela Kuti’s Beasts of No Nation, designed by Lemi Ghariokwu [Courtesy of Lemi Ghariokwu]</figcaption></figure><p>On what Fela’s reaction to the award would have been if he were alive, Ghariokwu says he imagines he would be happy. “I can even picture him raising his fist and saying: ‘You see, I got them now, I got their attention!’”</p><p>But Yeni feels her father would have been largely unfazed.</p><p>“He didn’t at all [care about awards]. He didn’t even think about it,” she said. “He played music because he loved music. It was to be acknowledged by his people – by human beings, by fellow artists – that made him happy.”</p><p>Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela’s cousin and head of the Kuti family, agrees. “Knowing him, he might have said, you know, thanks but no thanks or something like that.” She laughs.</p><p>“He really wasn’t interested in the popular view. He wasn’t driven by what others thought of him or his music. He was more focused on his own understanding of how he should impact his profession, his community, his continent.”</p><p>Though she believes the award may not have meant much to him personally, she told Al Jazeera that he would have recognised its overall value.</p><p>“He would recognise the fact that it’s a good thing for such establishments to begin the process of giving honour where it’s due across the continent,” Ransome-Kuti said.</p><p>“There are many great philosophers, musicians, historians – African ones – that haven’t been brought into the forefront, into the limelight as they should be. So I think he would have said, ‘OK, good, but what happens next?’”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275569\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275569\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP8103161140-1769761121.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela Kuti\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fela Kuti performs on March 16, 1981, with his band “Africa 70” at the Hippodrome in Paris, France [File: Herve Merliac/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fela-s-influence-spans-generations\">‘Fela’s influence spans generations’</h2><p>Fela was born in Nigeria’s Ogun State in 1938 as Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti (later renaming himself to Fela Anikulapo Kuti), to an Anglican minister and school principal father and an <a href=\"/features/2020/10/1/the-lioness-of-lisabi-who-ended-unfair-taxes-for-nigerian-women\">activist mother</a>.</p><p>In 1958, he went to London to study medicine, but instead enrolled at Trinity College of Music, where he formed a band that played a blend of jazz and highlife.</p><p>After returning to Nigeria in the 1960s, he went on to create the Afrobeat genre that fused highlife and Yoruba music with American jazz, funk, and soul. That has laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop.</p><p>“Fela’s influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats,” reads the <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/news/special-merit-awards-2026-grammys-honorees-recording-academy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">citation</a> on the Grammys list of this year’s Special Merit Award Honorees.</p><p>But beyond music, he was also a “political radical [and] outlaw”, the citation adds.</p><p>By the 1970s, Fela’s music had become a vehicle for fierce criticism of military rule, corruption, and social injustice in Nigeria. He declared his Lagos commune, the Kalakuta Republic, independent from the state – symbolically rejecting Nigerian authority – and in 1977 released the scathing album, Zombie, with lyrics that painted soldiers as mindless zombies with no free will. In the aftermath, troops raided Kalakuta, brutally assaulting its residents and causing injuries that led to Fela’s mother’s death.</p><p>Frequently arrested and harassed during his life, Fela became an international symbol of artistic resistance, with Amnesty International later recognising him as a prisoner of conscience after a politically motivated imprisonment. When he died in 1997 at age 58 from an illness, an estimated one million people attended his funeral in Lagos.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275575\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275575\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP179924952246-1769761145.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portraits of Late Afrobeat Legend Fela Kuti, on display at Kalakuta Museum in Lagos, Nigeria [File: Sunday Alamba/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Yeni – together with her siblings – is now custodian of her father’s work and legacy. She runs Afrobeat hub,</p><p>the New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja, Lagos and hosts an annual celebration in Fela’s honour called “Felabration”.</p><p>She remembers growing up with her larger-than-life father as something that felt “normal”, as it was all she knew. But “I was in awe of him”, she also says – as an artist and a thinker.</p><p>“I really, really admired his ideologies. The most important one for me was African unity … He totally worshipped and admired [former Ghanaian President] Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who was fighting for African unity. And I always think to myself, can you imagine if Africa was united? How far we would be; how progressive we would be.”</p><p>Reflecting on Fela’s legacy, artist Ghariokwu says most big Afrobeats musicians today have been influenced and inspired by Fela’s music and fashion.</p><p>But he laments that most have “never really sat down with the ideological part of Fela – the pan-Africanism – they never really checked it out”.</p><p>For him, Fela’s Grammy recognition should say to young artists, “If someone [like Fela] who was totally anti-establishment can be recognised this way, maybe I can express myself too without too much fear.”</p><p>Yeni says that through Fela’s work and life philosophy, he wanted to pass a message of African unity and political consciousness on to young people.</p><p>“So maybe with this award, more young people will be drawn to talk more about that,” she said. “Hopefully, they will be more exposed to Fela and want to talk about the progress of Africa.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nicolas Maduro, from the presidential palace in Caracas, on the orders of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>Maduro was then taken to a prison in New York, and is facing drug trafficking and narcoterrorism conspiracy charges.</p><p>The move has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">widely criticised</a> as a violation of international law.</p><p>Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs Yvan Gil wrote on Telegram that he had received Dogu, and that talks would centre on creating a “roadmap on matters of bilateral interest” as well as “addressing and resolving existing differences through diplomatic dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect and international law”.</p><p>Dogu, who previously served as US ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, was appointed to the role of charge d’affaires to the Venezuela Affairs Unit, based out of the US Embassy in Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>Venezuela and the US broke off diplomatic relations in February 2019, in a decision by Maduro after Trump gave public support to Venezuelan lawmaker Juan Guaido, who claimed to be the nation’s interim president in January that year.</p><p>Minister of the Popular Power for Interior Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela’s most powerful politicians and a Maduro loyalist, said earlier in January that reopening the US embassy in Caracas would give the Venezuelan government a way to oversee the treatment of the deposed president.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/rubio-testifies-before-us-senate-on-abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro\">claimed</a> that Maduro’s abduction was necessary for security reasons, officials have also <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/8/us-says-it-wants-to-control-venezuelan-oil-indefinitely-can-it\">repeatedly framed</a> their interests in Venezuela around controlling its vast oil reserves, which are the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/what-resources-does-venezuela-have-apart-from-the-worlds-most\">largest</a> in the world.</p><p>Since the abduction, Trump has pressured Interim President Delcy Rodriguez to open the country’s nationalised oil sector to US firms.</p><p>The two countries have reached ‌a deal to export up ⁠to $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the US, and on Thursday, Rodriguez <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/venezuelas-rodriguez-signs-oil-reform-law-while-the-us-eases-sanctions\">signed into law</a> a reform bill that will pave the way for increased privatisation.</p><p>The legislation gives private firms control over the sale and production of Venezuelan oil, and requires legal disputes to be resolved outside of Venezuelan courts, a change long sought by foreign companies, which argue that the judicial system in the country is dominated by the governing socialist party.</p><p>The bill would also cap royalties collected by the government at 30 percent.</p><p>The Trump administration said on the same day that it would loosen some sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector, and allow limited transactions by the country’s government and the state oil company PDVSA that were necessary for a laundry list of export-related activities involving an “established US entity”.</p><p>Trump has announced that he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/trump-says-that-he-will-allow-reopening-of-venezuelan-airspace\">ordered the reopening</a> of Venezuela’s commercial airspace and “informed” Rodriguez that US oil companies would soon arrive to explore potential projects in the country.</p><p>On Friday, Rodriguez <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/venezuelas-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez-announces-prisoner-amnesty\">announced</a> an amnesty bill aimed at releasing hundreds of prisoners in the country, and said she would shut down El Helicoide, an infamous secret service prison in Caracas, to be replaced with a sports and cultural centre.</p><p>That move was one of the key demands of the Venezuelan opposition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But that result should occur through a more orderly ‌and humane policy than currently in place.”</p><p>The judge did not specify the deportation quota he was referring to, but Stephen Miller, the White House chief of staff for policy, has previously said there was a target of 3,000 immigration arrests a day.</p><p>The ongoing crackdown in the state of Minnesota is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to federal officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The surge has prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-governor\">led to the killings</a> of two American citizens by federal agents.</p><p>The deadly operation has sparked <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-protesters-begin-nationwide-strike-as-doj-launches-pretti-killing-probe\">nationwide protests</a> as well as mass <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/29/the-take-they-picked-the-wrong-state-how-minneapolis-is-fighting-back\">mobilisation efforts</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/thousands-in-minneapolis-brave-bitter-cold-to-protest-ice-crackdown\">demonstrations</a> in Minnesota.</p><p>According to the Columbia Heights Public School District in Minneapolis, Liam was one of at least four students detained by immigration officials in the suburb this month.</p><p>Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik said ICE agents took the child from a running car in the family’s driveway on January 20, and told him to knock on the door of his home, a tactic that she said amounted to using him as “bait” for other family members.</p><p>The government has denied that account, with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claiming that an ICE officer remained with Liam “for the child’s safety” while other officers apprehended his father.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance, who has vigorously defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, told a news conference that although such arrests were “traumatic” for children, “just because you’re a parent, doesn’t mean that you get complete immunity from law enforcement”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has said that Conejo Arias arrived in the US illegally in December 2024 from Ecuador, but the family’s lawyer says they have an active asylum claim that allows them to remain in the country legally.</p><p>Following their detention, the boy and his father were sent to a facility in Dilley in Texas, where advocacy groups and politicians have reported deplorable conditions, including illnesses, malnourishment and a fast-growing number of detained children.</p><p>Texas Representatives Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett visited the site earlier this week. Liam slept throughout the 30-minute visit, Castro said, and his father reported that he was “depressed and sad”.</p><p>Biery’s ruling on Saturday included a photo of the boy, as well as several Bible quotes: “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these’,” and “Jesus wept”.</p><p>The episode, Biery wrote, made apparent “the government’s ignorance of an American historical document called the Declaration of Independence”. Biery drew a comparison between Trump’s administration and the wrongdoings that then-author, future President Thomas Jefferson, mounted against England’s King George, including sending “Swarms of Officers to harass our People” and creating “domestic Insurrection”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Department of Justice and DHS.</p><p>The Law Firm of Jennifer Scarborough, which is representing Liam and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, said in a statement that the pair will soon be able to reunite with the rest of their family.</p><p>“We are pleased that the family will now be able to focus on being together and finding some peace after this traumatic ordeal,” the statement said.</p><p>Minnesota officials have been calling on the Trump administration to end its immigration ‍crackdown in the state. But a federal judge on Saturday <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">denied a request</a> from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and other officials to issue a preliminary injunction that would have halted the federal operation.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/trump-orders-federal-agents-to-stay-away-from-protests-in-democrat-cities\">ordered DHS</a> to, “under no circumstances”, get involved with protests in Democratic-led cities unless they ask for federal help, or federal property is threatened.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.</p><p>The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and led to the killings of Alex Pretti on January 14 and Renee Good on January 7 by federal agents, who said they were reacting to threats.</p><p>Bystander videos and witness accounts contradict those claims, however.</p><p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Minneapolis and other US cities on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota.</p><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and others also challenged the immigration enforcement surge in the state, arguing that DHS is violating constitutional protections.</p><p>But a federal judge has said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">she will not halt</a> enforcement operations as the lawsuit proceeds.

de-escalation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from the Iranian capital, Tehran,  said the situation remains “quite fragile and delicate”.</p><p>Still, he said

said, noting that senior Iranian officials have held talks with allies in recent days amid a push to prevent a confrontation between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs meanwhile said Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani met with Larajani in Tehran on Saturday to discuss “efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region”.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed reiterated Qatar’s “support for all efforts aimed at reducing tensions and achieving peaceful solutions that enhance security and stability in the region”, the ministry said of the talks in a <a href=\"https://x.com/MofaQatar_EN/status/2017701786694410746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“He also stressed the need for concerted efforts to spare the peoples of the

Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, have also been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Turkey, which is a member of NATO, shares a border with Iran and opposes any foreign intervention there. It has called for US-Iran dialogue to avoid further destabilisation and has been in touch with both sides to seek a solution.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, according to the SPA state news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Ever since the crackdown on protests in Iran between January 8 and 10, there has been contention on what the true death toll of those bloody events is. According to figures provided by the Iranian government, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">3,117 people were killed</a>, including civilians and security forces. Yet estimates from outside the country have put the number at anywhere between 5,000 and a staggering 36,500.</p><p>This wide range not only reflects the fact that it has been extremely difficult to verify these reports, but also that there has been a concerted effort to use the death count to manufacture global consent for an attack on Iran and, in a deceitful rhetoric, downplay the official death toll of the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>Since the outbreak of the protests, there has been a race to estimate and report on the casualties – something I call a “Death Toll Olympics”.</p><p>Iran-focused human rights organisations led by dissident activists have been going through all sorts of evidence and testimonies to verify the number of the dead. As of writing this piece, the US-based organisation HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) has cited more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">6,000 deaths</a> and a further 17,000-plus cases under examination.</p><p>However, there are valid doubts about the speed of the activist-led verification process.</p><p>For every reported death, multiple accounts have to be examined, possible duplications must be identified and eliminated; and dates, locations and specific circumstances must be cross-checked against the timeline of events.</p><p>Furthermore, any visual evidence has to be localised and authenticated based on open-source data or corroborated by the accounts of multiple witnesses. From an investigative standpoint, the reliability and quality of activist-led counts that increase rapidly on a daily basis, therefore warrants caution.</p><p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, has cited a conservative estimate of <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">around 5,000 deaths</a>. At the same time, she has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">mentioned</a> that unverified numbers of up to 20,000 have been reported to her by medical sources.</p><p>The described obstacles, and difficulties of verification over the past weeks, have been further exacerbated by Iran’s severely restricted internet access. Despite this, major media outlets have begun distributing much higher figures, solely based on vague anonymous sources who claim privileged access within Iran’s government or health sector.</p><p>On January 25, for example, UK-based TV network Iran International <a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198\">published</a> a report claiming 36,500 were killed, citing “extensive reports” allegedly obtained from the Iranian security apparatus – reports it has neither published nor otherwise made transparent.</p><p>The same day, United States news magazine Time <a href=\"https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/\">published</a> an article titled “Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30,000, According to Local Health Officials”. It claimed that “as many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone” based on the accounts of two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health, whose identities were not revealed for security reasons. Notably, the magazine admitted in the text that it did not possess any means to independently confirm that number.</p><p>Two days later, British newspaper The Guardian followed the same trend with an article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">titled</a> “Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?” The piece introduced the figure of 30,000 based on estimates of an anonymous doctor, who spoke to the newspaper. He and his colleagues in Iran, the outlet admitted, were actually hesitant to provide a concrete figure.</p><p>Other media – from the Sunday Times to the Pierce Morgan Uncensored show – have cited papers circulated by Germany-based ophthalmologist Amir Parasta claiming death toll numbers between <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/iran-young-protesters-news-nsdztp5t2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16,500</a> and 33,000. However, the latest available version of the paper, dating back to January 23 uses disputable extrapolation methods to reach its figures. Strikingly, Parasta does not make any secret of his affiliation with Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s ousted Shah</p><p>The exiled crown prince and his team, whose extensive social media manipulation and disinformation efforts have been exposed by <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-10-03/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-israeli-influence-operation-in-iran-pushing-to-reinstate-the-shah-monarchy/00000199-9f12-df33-a5dd-9f770d7a0000\">recent investigations</a> by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab, have been key actors in inciting and escalating the recent protests towards confrontation. Accordingly, the fatality numbers disseminated by Mr Parasta cannot be perceived as neutral and constitute partisan estimates at best.</p><p>Despite acknowledging their own inability to verify these estimates, the media in question nevertheless put these extreme figures in titles and subheadings. It didn’t take long for other outlets to report on these inflated numbers, referring to these major publications as primary sources. Activists and Western politicians have also used them to push their respective agendas, thereby further fuelling a spiral of disinformation campaigns on social media. – In other words, a “death toll olympics” was born.</p><p>All of this has served two ends.</p><p>First, it has supported efforts to manufacture consent for foreign military intervention and malicious political action. While the protests were still ongoing, US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran in the event of a deadly crackdown. As of writing these lines, there has been a significant US military build-up around Iran, effectively thickening the war cloud.</p><p>Second, the speculation about the Iranian death toll has helped pro-Israel politicians and commentators in the West to downplay the casualties of the Israeli war on Gaza. In this way, it has become a utilitarian tool for relativising the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p><p>Confronted with mounting pressure regarding the death toll, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the authorities to “publicly publish the names and personal data of those deceased during the recent bitter incidents”. His director of communication has even promised that a procedure has been set up to examine and verify any conflicting claims.</p><p>It remains to be seen how effective and transparent the promised procedure will turn out. It is undeniable that thousands have been killed in Iran, mostly by Iranian security forces, amid a multi-day brutal crowd and riot control effort.</p><p>Structural obscurity and the restricted access to Iran for independent experts will likely mean that the exact death toll will never be determined. However, the more transparency can be established regarding the scale of the killings, the more likely it is that the perpetrators can be held accountable.</p><p>An arduous verification process of the recent deaths is crucial not only for the sake of accountability, but also to expose the media manipulation that is once again preparing the ground for a unilateral US-led act of aggression in the Middle East. In light of this, the “Death Toll Olympics” remains an ignominious disservice to the wretched of the Earth from Palestine to Iran.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In one exchange in 2012, Musk writes: “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”</p><p>One planned meeting with Musk in 2013 appears to have been cancelled by Epstein due to scheduling. The emails do not indicate that Musk ultimately visited Epstein’s island, but challenge previous Musk claims that he is the one to have rebuffed Epstein’s invitations.</p><p>Musk responded on Saturday on his X social media platform that he had been “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name.”</p><p>“No one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened,” Musk wrote. “I had very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to ‌go to his island or fly on his ‘Lolita Express.’”</p><p>The files also include email correspondence showing Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick arranging to visit Epstein’s island in December 2012. One email, forwarded from Epstein’s assistant to Lutnick, appears to confirm the two men met during that period.</p><p>In October 2025, Lutnick called Epstein “gross” and “the greatest blackmailer ever,” claiming he had severed ties with the man years earlier.</p><p>A ‌Department of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement that Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”</p><h2 id=\"abusers-still-hidden-and-protected\">Abusers still ‘hidden and protected’</h2><p>Despite the new disclosures, a group of survivors of Epstein’s alleged abuses said some of their alleged abusers “remain hidden and protected”.</p><p>A statement from 19 of the survivors, some using aliases or initials, said information about them still remained in the files, “while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected.” The letter demanded “the full release of the Epstein files” and that Attorney General Pam Bondi directly address the matter when she testifies before Congress next month.</p><p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/trump-says-he-signed-bill-to-release-epstein-files\">signed into law by Trump on November 19</a>, called for all the Epstein-related documents held by the Justice Department to be published by December 19.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday’s release “marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process”.
