reportedly studying the Quran at the Sheikh Ahmed al-Badawi Mosque in North Kordofan State when the building was hit by a drone in a “blatant violation of international humanitarian law and a grave assault on places of worship”, the doctors’ group said in a Facebook post.</p><p>“Targeting children inside mosques is a fully constituted crime that cannot be justified under any pretext and represents a dangerous escalation in the pattern of repeated violations against civilians,” the doctors said.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said the RSF has previously targeted other religious buildings for attack, including a church in Khartoum and another mosque in el-Fasher, reflecting a “systematic pattern that shows clear disregard for the sanctity of life and religious sites”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>“The network calls on the international community, the United Nations, and human rights and humanitarian organizations to take urgent action to pressure for the end to the targeting of civilians, ensure their protection, open safe corridors for the delivery of medical and humanitarian aid, and work to document these violations and hold those responsible accountable,” it said.</p><p>The UN separately said on Wednesday that a recent series of drone attacks have been reported on civilian infrastructure in Sudan’s South Kordofan, North Kordofan and West Kordofan states.</p><p>A World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in Kadugli was also hit by a suspected rocket attack on Tuesday night, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. He did not say which group was responsible for the attack.</p><p>“The fact that we have to reiterate almost every day that civilians and civilian infrastructure, places of worship, schools and hospitals cannot and should not be targeted is a tragedy in itself,” Dujarric told reporters.</p><p>The UN has warned that Sudan’s civil war is expanding from western Darfur into the Kordofan region.</p><p>It has documented more than 90 civilian deaths and 142 injuries caused by drone strikes between the end of January and February 6, which were carried out by the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces.</p><p>Targets included a WFP convoy, markets, health facilities and residential neighbourhoods in southern and northern Kordofan, the UN said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

for the fossil fuel</a> amid its declining cost competitiveness and climate change concerns.</p><p>In an executive order signed on Wednesday, Trump directed the US Department of Defence to enter into long-term purchase agreements with coal-fired plants and prioritise the “preservation and strategic utilisation” of “coal-based energy assets”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump’s order did not specify how much energy the Pentagon would purchase or under what financial terms.</p><p>“You do so much,” Trump said at a White House event attended by coal industry executives and miners.</p><p>“You heat our homes, fuel our factories, and turn natural resources into American riches and dreams,” he said.</p><p>Trump also announced that the US Department of Energy would invest $175m to upgrade six coal plants in North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia.</p><p>“The most important people here today are those who get their hands a little bit dirty to keep America running at full speed – our front line coal workers,” Trump said.</p><p>Coal production in the US has been in decline for decades amid growing competition from natural gas and renewables, including wind, hydropower and solar.</p><p>Production fell by more than half between 2008 and 2023, when output hit 578 million tonnes, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p>The fossil fuel accounted for about 16 percent of US energy production in 2023, behind natural gas and renewables at 43 percent and 21 percent, respectively.</p><h3>Trump: ‘Beautiful, clean coal’</h3><p>A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a California-based nonprofit, found that 99 percent of coal-powered facilities in the US were more expensive to run than the cost of their replacement with renewable alternatives.</p><p>Trump has championed the revival of “beautiful, clean coal” as crucial to boosting domestic manufacturing and achieving US dominance in artificial intelligence, despite the fossil fuel’s flagging competitiveness and contribution to greenhouse gases that drive climate change.</p><p>Trump, who initiated Washington’s exit from the Paris climate accord and has described the scientific consensus on warming temperatures as a “con job”, declared an “energy emergency” on his first day in office to prevent the closure of ageing coal plants.</p><p>The US Energy Department has forced at least five plants to extend their operations beyond their scheduled retirement date since Trump’s order.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest public utility provider in the US, voted to extend the lifespan of two coal plants that had been scheduled for closure by 2035.</p><p>The TVA vote came after the utility added four Trump appointees to its board of directors last month, after the US president had earlier fired three board members chosen by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A minority, comprised of 211 representatives, voted against the bill.</p><p>It was a rare rebuke from Congress’s lower chamber, where the Republican Party holds a 218-seat majority.</p><p>Before the vote, Democrats challenged their Republican colleagues to defy Trump, who has come to dominate the party.</p><p>“Today’s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J Trump?” said Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, who authored the resolution.</p><p>The vote comes as the US enters its pivotal midterm election season. Primaries begin in March, and the general election unfolds in November.</p><p>All members of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in their respective districts.</p><p>Faced with Trump’s drooping approval rating, Republican representatives have faced the uncomfortable choice of either bucking his less-popular policies or remaining steadfast, despite possible blowback at the ballot box.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, threatened to derail the election prospects of any Republican who voted in favour of Wednesday’s bill.</p><p>“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054542648712986\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media in the lead-up to the vote.</p><p>He also accused Canada – one of the US’s biggest trading partners and closest allies – of mistreating its southern neighbour.</p><p>“Canada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,” Trump said in a second <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054544240272433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“They are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wednesday’s bill now heads to the US Senate, where it is likely to pass.</p><p>That chamber had already passed similar legislation designed to curtail Trump’s Canada tariff, first in April and later in October of last year.</p><p>But the legislation is unlikely to become law. Even if it passes the Senate, Trump is poised to veto the bill.</p><p>Congress needs a two-thirds majority in each chamber to overcome a presidential veto. That would require substantial Republican defections, more than what happened during Wednesday’s vote.</p><p>Still, polls have shown that Trump’s tariffs are largely unpopular with voters, who blame them in part for rising prices on a bevy of goods.</p><p>On February 4, for instance, the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of respondents disapprove of Trump increasing tariffs. Only 37 percent said they approved.</p><p>Democrats hope that the growing dissatisfaction, along with anger over Trump’s aggressive mass deportation raids, will help them end Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.</p><p>Currently, the Supreme Court is also weighing the legality of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, after the president faced defeat in lower-court rulings.</p><p>Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson had urged the Republican caucus to abstain from voting until the high court rendered its decision.</p><p>But six Republican representatives, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, defied him to help bring the measure to the floor for a vote.</p><p>“Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” said Representative Bacon. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also indicated the US president would take a hemisphere-wide approach to his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.</p><p>“Our countries share a long history. It has gone through different chapters, as all relationships do,” Wright said.</p><p>“But I bring today a message from President Trump. He is passionately committed to absolutely transforming the relationship between the United States and Venezuela, part of a broader agenda to make the Americas great again.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-era-of-expansion\">A new era of expansion</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly outlined his vision for a new era of “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manifest destiny</a>“, a 19th-century doctrine that champions US expansionism.</p><p>Already, he has quipped about implementing the “Donroe Doctrine”, his version of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy platform that designates the entire Western Hemisphere as the US’s sphere of influence.</p><p>Part of that push has been to bring countries throughout the Americas in line with US policy, whether through economic pressure, diplomatic efforts or military action.</p><p>An example of the latter came on January 3, when Trump authorised an early-morning military operation to attack Venezuela and abduct its then-leader, President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>The Venezuelan leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were then transported by military aircraft to New York. They are expected to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges in March.</p><p>In his first remarks after the military operation, Trump asserted that the US would “run” Venezuela.</p><p>He has since recognised the interim leadership of Maduro’s former vice president, Rodriguez, though he has threatened a “second wave” of military action if she fails to comply with his demands.</p><h2 id=\"claiming-venezuela-s-oil\">Claiming Venezuela’s oil</h2><p>Trump has also made sweeping claims to Venezuela’s oil industry.</p><p>In his initial speech following the military operation, Trump reiterated claims that the country’s petroleum resources belonged to the US, as a result of early oil exploration from companies like Exxon Mobil.</p><p>Trump argued that Venezuela’s efforts to nationalise its oil industry amounted to the “largest theft of property in the history” of the US.</p><p>“Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,” Trump said. “They took all of our property. It was our property. We built it.”</p><p>He emphasised that his country, not Venezuela, should control the local oil reserves, though international law states otherwise.</p><p>Multiple international resolutions and covenants outline that nations have permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources.</p><p>“We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive and skill. And the socialist regime stole it from us during those previous administrations,” Trump said on January 3.</p><p>Since then, Trump has announced that Venezuela has turned over nearly 50 million barrels of oil to the US. That oil, Trump explained, is slated to be sold at market price for the benefit of both the US and Venezuela.</p><p>“That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America,” Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2008691566131769746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> online.</p><p>He also indicated he had tasked Wright to carry out the planned sale.</p><h2 id=\"a-presidential-overstep\">A presidential overstep?</h2><p>But Trump has faced backlash for his aggressive approach to Venezuelan oil. Critics have pointed out that the US Constitution puts the power to manage money with Congress, not the president.</p><p>Then there is the question of whether this oil was legally acquired from Venezuela in the first place, as Republican Congress member Thomas Massie pointed out last month.</p><p>“Selling stolen oil and putting billions of dollars in a bank in Qatar to be spent without Congressional approval is not Constitutional,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2013661360752640469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“Only Congress can appropriate money. The President can’t legally create a second Treasury overseas for his own piggy bank.”</p><p>The criticism continued on Wednesday. While Wright visited the Rodriguez administration, Democrats in the Senate introduced the Venezuela Oil Proceeds Transparency Act, designed to force a nonpartisan audit of the recent oil proceeds.</p><p>One of the bill’s sponsors, Adam Schiff of California, criticised Trump’s preoccupation with Venezuelan oil and questioned his motives for attacking Venezuela and its surrounding waters.</p><p>“For months, the Trump administration claimed that its military operations in the Caribbean were about stopping drugs, but the objective is now abundantly clear: this was about seizing Venezuela’s oil and lining the pockets of the oil industry,” Schiff said in a <a href=\"http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-americans-face-higher-energy-prices-leader-schumer-and-senator-schiff-demand-independent-audit-of-trump-admins-secretive-plan-for-handling-venezuela-oil-money-that-is-ripe-for-corruption-and-exploitation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber and the bill’s co-sponsor, echoed Schiff’s call for greater transparency.</p><p>“The American people deserve to know what’s happening with the money received from these Venezuelan oil payments and where – and to whom – they are going,” Schumer said.</p><h2 id=\"an-upbeat-meeting\">An upbeat meeting</h2><p>But the controversy in the US did not dampen the upbeat meeting Wright had with Rodriguez.</p><p>Wright’s visit was the first of its kind for Venezuela. Under Maduro, Trump did send a special envoy, Richard Grenell, to the country in January 2025 to negotiate for the release of US prisoners.</p><p>Grenell’s negotiations with Maduro, however, ended in October, as the Trump administration ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government.</p><p>Since Maduro’s removal, the US Department of State <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/venezuela-starts-exploratory-process-to-re-establish-formal-ties-with-us\">has deployed</a> a mission to Caracas, as the two countries work to reestablish diplomatic ties. The US has signalled it will soon reopen its embassy in Venezuela, which has been closed since 2019.</p><p>But no US official as senior as Wright has visited the country in years.</p><p>Rodriguez, meanwhile, has led an effort to comply with Trump’s demands. On January 29, she <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/venezuelas-rodriguez-signs-oil-reform-law-while-the-us-eases-sanctions\">signed into law</a> a reform bill that would allow for increased privatisation in Venezuela’s nationalised oil industry.</p><p>On Wednesday, she and Wright appeared together on the steps of the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas to present a summary of their meeting.</p><p>Wright pledged that Venezuela would see a “dramatic increase in Venezuelan oil production”, as well as a boost in the use of its other energy resources. He also promised “to bring commerce, peace, prosperity, jobs, opportunity to the people of Venezuela and in partnership with the United States”.</p><p>“These are not just words or ambitions,” he added. “We have very specific plans and very specific actions already.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have met a total of seven times — including once in Israel — since January 2025.</p><p>The latest visit came just days after US and Iranian officials held indirect talks in Oman aimed at diverting a military confrontation that could spill into the wider Middle East region.</p><p>While Arab leaders have largely advocated for deescalation, Netanyahu has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/netanyahu-says-hell-present-principles-for-iran-talks-to-trump\">repeatedly called</a> for further military action against Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-private-meeting\">A private meeting</h2><p>Netanyahu’s latest visit took place behind closed doors. After their visit was over, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116053512461029874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on his Truth Social account that it had been a “tremendous meeting”. He also wrote that he had hope a deal could be struck with Iran.</p><p>“If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump said. “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”</p><p>Trump previously sided with Israel in a 12-day war against Iran last June. The conflict culminated with US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, in a military operation dubbed “Midnight Hammer”.</p><p>In Wednesday’s post, the US president appeared to threaten further military action against Iran, pointing out that June’s attack came after talks on Iran’s nuclear programme failed to make progress.</p><p>“Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit with Midnight Hammer,” Trump wrote. “That did not work well for them. Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.”</p><p>Netanyahu’s office, meanwhile, offered few details, saying only that the pair discussed Israel’s “security needs” and agreed to “continued coordination and close ties”.</p><p>Among the topics discussed were “negotiations with Iran, Gaza and regional developments”, the statement said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-says-ballistic-missile-non-negotiable\">Iran says ballistic missile ‘non-negotiable’</h2><p>Trump has signalled optimism in the wake of Friday’s talks in Oman, which included US envoy Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.</p><p>The gathering came after the US surged military assets to the region, raising the prospect of a military entanglement.</p><p>Since January, Trump has pledged to strike Iran if the country’s security agents kill protesters involved in recent antigovernment demonstrations.</p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in turn, warned of a “regional war” in the event of a US attack.</p><p>Regional powers across the Middle East have pushed for a diplomatic solution to avoid a military clash.</p><p>The Trump administration, meanwhile, has not been clear on the scope of its talks with Iran.</p><p>However, officials have told US media outlets that the recent negotiations hinge on three main demands: ending Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme, curtailing its ballistic programme and cutting its support for regional proxies, a goal long held by Netanyahu as well.</p><p>The US had previously entered into an agreement to scale back Iran’s nuclear programme in 2015.</p><p>That multilateral deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), offered Iran sanctions relief. The United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, Germany and the European Union were all participants.</p><p>But in 2018, during his first term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA. Ever since, he has unsuccessfully pursued a new agreement while re-imposing “maximum pressure” sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Iranian officials have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/iran-says-missile-programme-non-negotiable-as-tehran-washington-eye-talks\">signalled</a> they are open to reaching a new deal on their nuclear programme, which they have maintained is only for civilian purposes. But they maintain their ballistic missile capabilities should remain off limits.</p><p>“The ‌Islamic Republic’s missile capabilities are non-negotiable,” Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei, was quoted by state media as saying on Wednesday.</p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, meanwhile, said that his country was ready to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme but would “not yield to excessive demands”.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-brings-maximalist-demands\">Netanyahu brings ‘maximalist demands’</h2><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the US-based Stimson Center think tank, said Netanyahu brought “maximalist demands” to his White House meeting.</p><p>“He considers Iran to be a mortal threat to Israel. He wants it weakened in any possible way. He would love to see regime change,” Slavin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But if he can’t have that, he would like to make sure that Iran has no nuclear programme whatsoever and that it has no missiles that could strike Israel.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She added that the Israeli prime minister “clearly was worried, especially because Donald Trump said some rather optimistic things after the talks in Oman”.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Nour Odeh also pointed to the prospect of early elections in Israel, which might further incentivise Netanyahu to push Trump to take a hard line.</p><p>“Toppling the government in Iran would make him the king of all kings, as far as Israeli policy is concerned, and that’s something he can take to the ballot and win with,” Odeh said.</p><p>“Netanyahu now needs to convince Trump that a deal is not something that will yield results and that Iran cannot be trusted.”</p><p>Still, Odeh explained that Netanyahu must also be prepared for the possibility that the US-Iran negotiations will succeed.</p><p>“If a deal is reached, he needs to make sure that this is up to par with what Israel can live with,” Odeh explained. “He wants Iran to be permanently disabled, and that, in effect, is a formula to ensure that Israel continues to be the hegemon in the region.”</p><h2 id=\"highlighting-gaza\">Highlighting Gaza</h2><p>In his post on Truth Social, Trump said he and Netanyahu also discussed the “tremendous progress being made in Gaza, and the Region in general”.</p><p>Since October 2023, Israel has led a genocidal war in Gaza that has killed an estimated 72,045 Palestinians and wounded 171,686.</p><p>But last year, the Trump administration advocated for a 20-point Gaza “ceasefire” plan that was adopted in October.</p><p>It has since announced in January that the plan was entering “phase two”, although major questions persist, including over the disarmament of Hamas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have continued. On Wednesday, a Palestinian child was wounded by Israeli gunfire in the Batn as-Sameen area, south of Khan Younis, according to the Wafa news agency.</p><p>Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling also targeted areas under Israeli military control east of the city, Al Jazeera’s team in Gaza reported.</p><p>Since the first phase of the ceasefire agreement came into effect in October, 591 Palestinians have been killed and 1,578 injured, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Also on Wednesday, Netanyahu signed a document establishing Israel’s membership in Trump’s controversial <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/trumps-board-of-peace-to-convene-in-washington-discuss-gaza-report\">Board of Peace</a> during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>The board was initially designed to supervise Gaza’s ceasefire, but Trump has since pushed it to take on a wider role in resolving global conflicts. Some critics have accused the US president of seeking to create an alternative to the United Nations.</p><p>Netanyahu, who will hold a seat on the multinational board, currently faces an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) over alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Moderna said the letter claimed that the FDA thought the biotech giant’s flu vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care”.</p><p>The company has pushed back on the allegation, and CEO Stephane Bancel said the letter “did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product”.</p><p>Experts say the lack of guidance isn’t helpful.</p><p>“If there are things that need scrutiny, a review process can address them. At the end of the review, they can identify the issues that need to be corrected. That gives the company an opportunity to make changes and adapt. When that guidance isn’t provided, it makes it very difficult for someone submitting materials to know how to proceed,” Bruce Y Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Last year, Moderna said that its mRNA-1010 vaccine is 26.6 percent more effective than an approved annual flu vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>“It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER [Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research] prior to starting,” Bancel said.</p><p>In terms of the next steps for Moderna, William Soliman, CEO of the Accreditation Council for Medical Affairs, a healthcare trade group, said typically a company would need to go back and continue study in a case like the one facing Moderna.</p><p>“They [Moderna] would have to provide additional analysis or alter the study design and resubmit it for review. That’s typically how it works: they go back, address whatever the FDA is requesting, and then resubmit,” Soliman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In 2025, Moderna withdrew its application seeking approval for its flu and COVID combination vaccine to wait for efficacy data from a late-stage trial of its influenza vaccine.</p><p>The vaccine is currently under review in the European Union, Canada and Australia, with the company expecting potential approvals to come in late 2026 or early 2027.</p><h2 id=\"political-undertones\">Political undertones</h2><p>The FDA action comes amid concerns over transparency within the organisation, raising questions among experts if the decision-making process to reject the application was merit-based or politically motivated.</p><p>“A big question is whether this is part of some type of political agenda. Many of the policies and decisions we’ve seen have been rolling back vaccine policies long supported by the science, again without clear explanation why, so the concern is that this is part of a larger trend,” Lee said.</p><p>According to the healthcare trade publication Stat News, career scientists were ready to review the application, including the head of the US agency’s vaccine office, David Kaslow, but were overridden by FDA commissioner Vinay Prasad, which the agency has disputed.</p><p>Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the claims. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>In August, HHS, the federal agency that the FDA operates under, announced it would scale down mRNA vaccine development.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, who leads HHS, is a known vaccine sceptic. Since he was appointed health secretary, there has been a rollback in vaccine guidance, which included recommendations for routine vaccines on six infectious diseases, including influenza, and new guidance on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/alarms-raised-as-trumps-cdc-cuts-number-of-suggested-vaccines-for-children\">childhood immunisation.</a></p><p>The rates of diseases otherwise preventable by vaccines have skyrocketed. In the US, there were more than 2,200 <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/un-agency-warns-of-sharp-increase-in-measles-cases-in-the-americas\">measles cases in 2025,</a> the highest in nearly three decades, and so far this year, there have been more than 730 reported cases.</p><h2 id=\"wall-street-strain\">Wall Street strain</h2><p>Moderna, which rose to prominence with its COVID-19 vaccine, has seen a sharp decline on Wall Street over the past year as vaccine sales dropped alongside falling case numbers. In its most recent earnings report, released in November, the company posted a $200m quarterly loss, with profits down $13m from a year earlier.</p><p>The company has struggled to regain its footing amid the slump in sales.</p><p>The FDA’s decision “throws a wrench into the company’s reliance on seasonal vaccines to reach its 2028 cash break-even goal,” Citi Research analyst Geoff Meacham told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Moderna’s stock has fallen 29 percent in 2025 alone and is down more than 90 percent from its 2021 peak.</p><p>Moderna’s stock tumbled in early trading but has begun to rebound. It is still far below the market open and was down 4.7 percent in midday trading on Wednesday, following news that the FDA refused to review its application.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in late 2024, that stable career hit a speed bump.</p><p>He was laid off from his job amid a round of restructuring. The news landed without warning. One day he had a job, and the next he was sitting at home, staring at the numbers, trying to figure out how to keep paying the mortgage and putting food on the table.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>He is married, and his partner is a teacher, but the math did not work. One salary might cover things for a little while, but not long enough to maintain long-term stability.</p><p>So he started applying for new work immediately. Over three months, he submitted 350 job applications. He got six interviews.</p><p>After months of searching, something moved.</p><p>He advanced in the hiring process for a Washington, DC–based nonprofit, making it far enough to sit across from senior leadership. It felt like he finally caught a break.</p><p>Then the ground shifted again. As Dodge was interviewing for a new job, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, was advising the administration of US President Donald Trump on how to shrink the federal government, and that meant cutting funding to agencies that provide contracts and funds to swaths of nonprofit organisations around the country. The effects rippled outward, and Dodge was caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>Contracts were cancelled and funding streams dried up. Nonprofits that depend on government support had to pull back and scale down ambitions — those very same nonprofits from whom Dodge sought employment.</p><p>“I got a call from HR saying they weren’t going to hire for the position, and that all hiring was on hold. I couldn’t argue with them, because I’d been hearing the same thing from organisations I’d spoken to since I started applying. ‘We were relying on federal funds, and now they’re gone,’” Dodge said.</p><p>Then it was back to the drawing board. He began searching yet again, but this time with a cloud of uncertainty looming over the entire industry he works in. Dodge finally took what he could get — part-time work in his field. The pay was well below what he had been earning before, but he accepted it anyway. Some income, he reasoned, was better than none.</p><p>The result is underemployment. Underemployment can manifest in several ways, often when workers are seeking full-time work but can only find part-time positions, or when the jobs they work do not fully utilise their skills and training. It is generally associated with industries like restaurants or retail, but it also reaches into fields with fewer resources and shrinking opportunities, including the nonprofit sector, where jobs are increasingly precarious and full-time stability is harder to find because of the wave of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/obama-bush-decry-travesty-of-trumps-gutting-of-usaid-on-its-last-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government funding cuts in 2025</a>.</p><p>The upshot is lower incomes for underemployed workers, sometimes below the cost of living or even pushing them into the ranks of the working poor.</p><p>Underemployment has been on the rise, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which has tracked the rate of underemployment since 1978. Today, 8 percent of the US population is underemployed, up 0.5 percent from 2024 and it is up 1.1 percent from 2023.</p><p>At the same time, many in the US are seeing their expenses increase.</p><p>The impact of tariffs has hit low-to-middle-income earners harder than others. Analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found that lower-income households are paying a higher percentage of their post-tax income on goods subject to tariffs as opposed to higher-income households, all while costs for necessities like healthcare are increasing.</p><p>Earlier this year, Congressional leaders failed to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies. Premiums increased by an average of 144 percent, according to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>“Some people have lost their jobs and found new ones that pay less, but others have kept their jobs, but their healthcare premiums have increased. Their electric bills have also gone up. Their salaries no longer cover basic living costs,” Jillian Hishaw, a personal bankruptcy lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina, said.</p><p>She said that because of increased costs like these and a stalling job market, she is seeing an increase in inquiries about personal bankruptcy filings in efforts by potential clients not to lose their homes to foreclosure.</p><p>“In one day last week, 85 foreclosures were filed in Mecklenburg County [where Charlotte is located]. Foreclosures happen daily, but 85 in a single day is unusually high. Two years ago, the daily average was 10 to 20, but now filings are approaching triple digits each day,” Hishaw said.</p><h2 id=\"shrinking-options\">Shrinking options</h2><p>The surging economic pressures hit workers across various sectors, including financial and administrative services. An Ohio-based accountant who did not want his name to be published, has worked a patchwork of accounting and administrative jobs over the past few years. In March, he was laid off from a research organisation in central Ohio.</p><p>After months of searching, he found new work, but not as an accountant, and the pay falls far short of covering his cost of living.</p><p>“I’m working as a sales coordinator, which I really don’t want to be doing, but it was the only thing I could land with how bad things are. It’s not enough to live on,” he said.</p><p>The labour market is under strain. Layoffs reached more than 1.1 million in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, while job creation failed to keep pace, with just 584,000 jobs added. As a result, more workers are settling for underpaid or part-time work that does not meet basic living expenses, including Dodge and the accountant.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, says that economic uncertainty driven by tariffs and developments in <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/28/amazon-cuts-thousands-of-jobs-amid-ai-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">artificial intelligence</a> has put businesses across a wide set of sectors essentially on pause — maintaining the status quo or scaling back.</p><p>“People who are already at the margins are getting kicked out entirely, and that’s placing pressure on everyone who is clinging to a job,” Evermore told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In January, one of the key measures of underemployment, the number of people who work part-time for economic reasons, such as an inability to find full-time work or had their hours reduced, hit 4.9 million. It was a 453,000 decline from the month before, but is up 410,000 from this time last year, according to the January jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday.</p><p>Long-term unemployment jumped 386,000 from this time a year ago to 1.8 million, although it remains unchanged compared with the previous month.</p><p>The nonprofit sector has been hit particularly hard in the last year, losing 28,729 jobs in 2025, up sharply from 5,640 losses the year before, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p><p>Like the Ohio accountant, Dodge has been searching for new opportunities since he lost his full-time role a year and a half ago. He has applied for 460 jobs and only landed a handful of interviews.</p><h2 id=\"working-weekends-washing-dishes\">Working weekends, washing dishes</h2><p>The market is only getting tighter. US employers cut more than 108,000 jobs in January, while employers only announced intentions to hire 5,300 new roles for the month, the lowest on record since Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas started tracking that in 2009.</p><p>“Employers aren’t wanting to make any big investments right now, including increasing salaries to their workforce,” Evermore, who served as a policy adviser in the US Labor Department during the administration of former US President Joe Biden, added.</p><p>In December, labour market turnover remained stagnant. Amid economic uncertainty and a slowdown in new job growth, many Americans are hanging on to the jobs they already have. Job openings fell to 6.5 million, down 386,000 from the previous month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS).</p><p>Hiring and separations, which include layoffs and firings, were unchanged. That followed November’s report, which similarly showed little movement in both new hiring and the number of workers leaving their jobs.</p><p>Combined, that means that for the underemployed, finding a new role, either part-time to augment their existing income, or to replace it altogether, is increasingly difficult for people like the accountant.</p><p>“I’m also working weekends at a friend’s cafe, washing dishes, and I’m still applying and interviewing for other opportunities. But it’s the same story, no offers. At the same time, I’m debating whether to switch professions or even go back to school, even though I already have a master’s degree,” he said.</p><p>That shared distress has also created an unlikely sense of camaraderie among those struggling to get by, even as the outlook remains bleak.</p><p>Dodge finds it in late-night scrolls through Reddit, watching strangers narrate versions of the same stalled search.</p><p>“I doomscroll a lot,” he said, “getting depressed about the state of politics and the global economy, and taking some solace in knowing I’m not the only one struggling to find viable employment after 12, 13, 14, even 15 months.”</p><p>For now, that recognition of others stuck in the same place, hitting the same walls, is enough to keep him moving forward, submitting applications and waiting for a response that might not even come.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has gone far beyond Washington’s decades-long embargo on the island, threatening crippling tariffs on any country that provides fuel shipments, and, in turn, stifling lifeline supplies from Venezuela and Mexico.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But as the impact of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-countries-supplying-cuba-with-much-needed-oil\">US policy</a> on the lives of Cubans just 90 miles (145 km) away from the US state of Florida comes into increasing focus, the same clarity has not emerged on what the Trump administration actually hopes to achieve in its strategy, analysts have told Al Jazeera.</p><p>That comes as Trump has sent a contradicting message: He has both told reporters he seeks to “work a deal” with the communist government led by Miguel Diaz-Canel and, alternately, plans to make Cuba “free again”, hinting at the regime change long sought by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>“One possibility is that they actually do come to some kind of a deal,” William LeoGrande, a professor focusing on US foreign policy in Latin America at American University, told Al Jazeera. “But the $64,000 question is, what would be the terms of such a deal be?”</p><p>“The second possibility, of course, is that this oil embargo causes social collapse on the island, no electricity, no gasoline, no fuel for anything, and the society literally begins to crumble,” he said.</p><p>A third possibility, LeoGrande explained, is that the US could adopt a Venezuelan-style approach, keeping the government in place while installing a more pliable leader.</p><p>“But I think even if there were such a person high enough up in the Cuban government that they could actually win the loyalty of the armed forces and the government and party bureaucracies, which I doubt, I don’t think the Trump administration has any way to identify them or to communicate with them,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"try-and-bend-the-cuban-government\">‘Try and bend the Cuban government’</h2><p>In the short term, Trump, who has long portrayed himself as the dealmaker-in-chief, appears to be leaning into messaging that calls for an agreement with Diaz-Canel’s strained government, according to Tiziano Breda, a Latin America and the Caribbean senior analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).</p><p>Trump has said both sides are in discussions, although the nature of any contacts and the terms of any proposal have not yet emerged.</p><p>“Trump has shown less interest and eagerness to engage with these left-wing governments on ideological battles,” Breda told Al Jazeera.”The circumstances give me the impression that Trump’s goal would be rather to try and bend the Cuban government, rather than prompting its collapse.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Diaz-Canal, meanwhile, has said he was open to talking to the US, but would only enter dialogue “without pressure or precondition” and with respect to sovereignty.</p><p>In the same breath, he decried Washington’s “criminal policy against a country, as it affects food, transportation, hospitals, schools, economic production and the functioning of our vital systems”.</p><p>Cuba, Diaz-Canel added in statements last week, sought peace, but was developing a defence plan “in case we have to move to a state of war”.</p><h2 id=\"unclear-terms\">Unclear terms</h2><p>Several analysts assessed that some type of new agreement between the US and Cuba remained on the table, but any terms seen as an existential threat to the government in Havana would be non-starters.</p><p>It remained unclear what extractions Trump would consider satisfactory.</p><p>Cuba has far less to offer economically than Venezuela, a South American country with the world’s largest proven oil reserves. However, it contains significant deposits of rare and critical earth minerals, including the world’s third-largest reserve of cobalt, a key mineral used in lithium-ion batteries and other advanced technologies.</p><p>“Economically, Cuba has little to offer beyond agreements on the tourism industry or some trade deals,” according to Breda, although he added that Trump may try to pressure Havana to “give in on certain conditions, such as migration, the presence of US competitors in the country, and security cooperation between Russia and China”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In an executive order declaring Cuba an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US last month, Trump focused heavily on relations between Russia and China, which both cooperate with Cuba on defence, but do not have known military bases on the island.</p><p>The order, which also highlighted crackdowns on dissent by Cuba’s government, further accused Havana of hosting what Washington considers “transnational terrorist groups”, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p>Cuba experts have regularly dismissed the threat posed by Cuba as overblown, while noting there is scant evidence to support the “terrorist group” claims.</p><p>That has raised further questions over what tangible concessions the government could offer Trump, if his order is seen as a prelude to negotiations.</p><h2 id=\"regime-change\">Regime change?</h2><p>To be sure, Trump’s stated desire to pursue talks with Cuba’s current government puts him at odds with the decades-old ideology of the US Republican Party writ large, which has long eschewed any form of engagement with the communist government founded by Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1959.</p><p>That approach has been particularly championed by Trump’s top diplomat, Rubio, who is himself the son of Cuban immigrants with a political career <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio\">predicated</a> on a hawkish approach to the island.</p><p>Rubio has for months pushed the notion that the government in Havana is on the verge of collapse, laying the groundwork for Trump’s current pressure campaign. His stance dovetails with an influential Cuban-American voting bloc, which has been a key part of the Republicans’ electoral coalition.</p><p>“Rubio’s goal is to get rid of this regime in Cuba,” LeoGrande said, “so he would not be happy with any kind of deal like that Trump has cut in Venezuela, particularly if it were more or less a permanent deal.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>LeoGrande, meanwhile, downplayed the likelihood of Trump deploying boots on the ground in Cuba, noting the president has so far avoided prolonged military engagement.</p><p>A more surgical operation like the one targeting Maduro also remains unlikely, he assessed, with top roles in the armed forces still dominated by direct appointees of former President Raul Castro, who served as the Communist Party’s top official until his retirement in 2021.</p><p>Instead, according to ACLED’s Breda, any approach to topple the government would likely result in a continuation of the current pressure campaign to fuel dissent among a population beleaguered by shortages.</p><p>“But it remains to be seen whether Rubio will be able to convince Trump that there would not be great consequences in terms of migration, instability and violence in the island, and that this cannot have a spillover effect,” Breda said.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Discerning Trump’s motives may be akin to reading tea leaves, according to Louis Perez, a professor who has long focused on Cuban history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who notes that “deep historical antecedents” to his current actions may help illuminate what comes next.</p><p>Perez pointed to US policy that preceded the Cuban Revolution in 1959, reaching back to the US-established military government in Cuba in the early 20th century, and the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which first sought to assert US influence across Latin America.</p><p>“So widening the screen and pulling back, one sees the long view of a remarkable continuity of policy that reveals itself in many iterations,” he told Al Jazeera. “But the thread that links all of these iterations together in one package is the determination to deny Cuba sovereignty and self-determination.”</p><p>The Trump administration has recently elucidated its own goal of restoring US “pre-eminence” in the Western Hemisphere, what Trump and his allies have dubbed the “Donroe doctrine”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The American political leadership want the Cubans to say ‘uncle’, to surrender, to acquiesce,” Perez said. “This sounds simplified, but somewhere deep inside the US national psyche, this is driving policy, especially in an administration that is now presuming to redefine the ‘Donroe doctrine’.”</p><p>A prolonged impasse, meanwhile, could have unintended consequences for Washington, including driving Cuba closer to Russia and China.</p><p>Russia, already under heavy US sanctions, has not increased oil deliveries to Cuba in recent weeks, but could choose to do so as the US pressure campaign continues, American University’s LeoGrande explained. China and other regional allies could provide alternative forms of aid, freeing funds for energy purchases.</p><p>“The more pressure the United States puts on Cuba, the more threatening the United States is towards Cuba, the more incentive Cuba has to look for patrons among US adversaries,” he said.</p><p>ACLED’s Breda, in turn, pointed to the toll of a prolonged diplomatic stalemate, which could lead to further hardship under a government long accused of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/07/11/cuba-crackdown-protests-creates-rights-crisis\">cracking down</a> on internal dissent.</p><p>“The main risk is to trigger a humanitarian crisis within the island, which could have repercussions for outbound migration and also trigger a wave of unrest,” he said.</p><p>“Of course, this will test the government’s ability to remain in power, but it would also increase the likelihood that we would witness renewed rounds of repression and mass arrests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The government’s fiscal year starts on October 1.</p><p>While revived investment tax incentives and bigger individual tax refunds provide a boost in 2026, the CBO said that this is attenuated by the drag from larger fiscal deficits and reduced immigration that slows the growth of the labour force.</p><p>Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of economic and health policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center said “large deficits are unprecedented for a growing, peacetime economy”, though “the good news is there is still time for policymakers to correct course.”</p><h2 id=\"urgent-warning\">‘Urgent warning’</h2><p>Lawmakers have recently addressed rising federal debt and deficits primarily through targeted spending caps and debt limit suspensions, as well as deploying “extraordinary measures” when the US is close to hitting its statutory spending limit, though these measures have often been accompanied by new, large-scale spending or tax policies that maintain high deficit levels.</p><p>And Trump, at the start of his second term, deployed a new “Department of Government Efficiency”, which set a goal to balance the budget by cutting $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse; however, budget analysts estimate that DOGE cut anywhere between $1.4bn to $7bn, largely through workforce firings.</p><p>Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation, said the CBO’s latest budget projection “is an urgent warning to our leaders about America’s costly fiscal path.”</p><p>“This election year, voters understand the connection between rising debt and their personal economic condition. And the financial markets are watching. Stabilising our debt is an essential part of improving affordability, and must be a core component of the 2026 campaign conversation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

You’re running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.”</p><p>Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump and his administration have consistently faced questions about the decision to withhold or redact documents related to Epstein.</p><p>Trump himself has come under the microscope for his personal relationship to the late financier, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting federal charges.</p><p>At Wednesday’s hearing, women who had come forward as survivors of Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking ring and their families sat in the audience behind Bondi. They included Teresa Helm, Jess Michaels and Lara Blume McGee, as well as the family of the late Virginia Giuffre.</p><p>Representative Pramila Jayapal asked Bondi to apologise to Epstein’s victims. She and other Democrats criticised the Trump administration for not meeting with the survivors — and for the heavy redaction of the released Epstein files.</p><p>“Your department has shown a pattern of redacting the names of powerful predators,” Jayapal said.</p><p>She then asked the survivors to raise their hands if they had been unable to meet with the Department of Justice.</p><p>“For the record,” Jayapal added, “every single survivor has raised their hand.”</p><h2 id=\"bondi-rejects-criticism\">Bondi rejects criticism</h2><p>Bondi responded harshly to the criticism she faced, saying that she would not “get in the gutter” with Jayapal and her fellow Democrats.</p><p>She also accused Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who helped spearhead a law forcing the release of the Epstein files, of having “Trump derangement syndrome”.</p><p>When asked whether she would investigate Trump’s links to Epstein, Bondi said that Democrats were using the Epstein affair to “deflect from all the great things Donald Trump has done”.</p><p>Trump himself has faced criticism for calling the Epstein scandal a Democratic “hoax”.</p><p>But Al Jazeera correspondent Rosiland Jordan explained that Democrats were trying to leverage outrage over an issue that has transcended political parties.</p><p>After all, members of Trump’s own “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) base were among those publicly clamouring for the release of the government’s Epstein files.</p><p>“Congressional Democrats believe that they are tapping into the broadening public disgust with the way that the Trump administration has handled the release of the Epstein files,” Jordan reported from the US Capitol.</p><p>“This is a situation where the officials on the Democratic side try to get Pam Bondi to apologise for not doing enough, including not complying fully with a new law that compels the Justice Department to release all six million pages of evidence in the Epstein case.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"compliance-with-the-law\">Compliance with the law?</h2><p>That new law, called the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed into law in November with bipartisan support.</p><p>It requires the Justice Department to publish all of its documents related to Epstein in an easily searchable format.</p><p>Though the law does allow for some limited redaction to protect the identities of victims, critics argue that scores of documents have been published with heavy redactions.</p><p>Some of those blacked-out sections appear to shield the identity of powerful figures involved with Epstein.</p><p>During her opening statement on Wednesday, Bondi, a prosecutor from Florida, defended her record of addressing sexual abuse.</p><p>“ I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,” she said.</p><p>She added a message directed at the Epstein survivors: “I am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.”</p><p>But Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, accused Bondi of using the redactions to “spare” abusers and accomplices from “embarrassment and disgrace”.</p><p>He also questioned the volume of records that have been released, arguing that they fell short of the full disclosure required by November’s law.</p><p>“ You’ve been ordered by subpoena and by Congress to turn over six million documents, photographs, and videos in the Epstein files,” Raskin said.</p><p>“But you’ve turned over only three million. You say you’re not turning over the other three million because they’re somehow duplicative. But we know that there are actual memos of victim statements in there.”</p><h2 id=\"questions-about-prosecutions\">Questions about prosecutions</h2><p>Bondi also faced questions about the numerous investigations and lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Trump’s political rivals.</p><p>In September, for instance, the Justice Department announced charges against Trump critic James Comey, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>The following month, it also unveiled charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a politician who had brought a successful civil case against Trump.</p><p>Both charges were dropped, amid questions about the legality of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan’s appointment. But those charges and other investigations have fuelled criticism that Trump is using the Justice Department to settle political scores.</p><p>On Wednesday, Democratic Representative Mary Gay Scanlon asked Bondi if the administration was curating an “enemies list” based on an October order to crack down on alleged “left-wing terrorism”.</p><p>Bondi responded that she was “not going to commit to anything to you because you won’t let me answer questions”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

By late morning, though, the FAA announced that flights would resume in and out of the area as normal, prompting questions about the legitimacy of the drone claims.</p><p>“The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted. There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal,” the agency said in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/FAANews/status/2021583720465969421\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>El Paso is one of the largest cities in Texas, and it is located on the banks of the Rio Grande River, directly across from Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.</p><p>Securing border areas, however, has been a focus of President Donald Trump’s second term in office.</p><p>The Trump administration has asserted that Wednesday’s brief airspace closure was a result of a drone operated by a Mexican drug cartel infiltrating US airspace. It has since suggested the drone was destroyed.</p><p>“The FAA and [the Department of Defense] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on <a href=\"https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/2021594420806639787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media</a> at 9:37 US Eastern time (14:37 GMT).</p><p>“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”</p><p>But the Mexican government has not confirmed the drone incursion.</p><p>At her morning news conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters, “There is no information about drone use on the border,” but she added that the security cabinet would investigate the incident.</p><p>Anonymous US officials have told media outlets like CNN and CBS News that the sudden airspace closure may have been a false alarm, caused by the US military’s tests of its laser-based counter-drone system near El Paso.</p><p>CBS and Fox News also reported that, earlier this week, a party balloon was misidentified as a drone, prompting it to be shot down, according to official sources.</p><p>The El Paso airspace closure began abruptly late on Tuesday night and lasted until early Wednesday morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, the Trump administration framed the airspace closure as evidence of the threat from Mexican cartels.</p><p>Speaking to lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the alleged drone incident as she spoke of “striking crucial blows against terrorist organisations”.</p><p>“I think you’ve seen the news this morning,” Bondi told Congress members. “The news is reporting that cartel drones are being shot down by our military. That’s what we all should care about right now: protecting America.”</p><p>The Trump administration has frequently referred to criminal groups operating in Mexico as a threat to US national security.</p><p>Since taking office on January 20, 2025, Trump has started designating cartels across Latin America as “foreign terrorist organisations”, spurring fears that the US could launch aggressive, cross-border military actions.</p><p>Trump himself has threatened to strike drug trafficking groups in Mexican territory, despite criticism that such an attack would constitute a violation of Mexican sovereignty.</p><p>Already, Trump has authorised military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, on the pretext of disrupting international drug trafficking. He has alluded to land-based targets as an extension of that military campaign.</p><p>“We are going to start now hitting land. With regard to the cartels, the cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview published on January 9.</p><p>“You see what’s happened to that country. But the cartels are running it.”</p><p>Some elected officials, however, have expressed scepticism about the Trump administration’s claims about a drone incursion on Wednesday. Democratic Congress member Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, was among those asking for more information.</p><p>“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a news conference.</p><p>“The information coming from the federal government does not add up.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Washington continues to do the same.</p><p>The New START agreement <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/russia-criticises-us-as-final-nuclear-warhead-treaty-set-to-expire\">expired earlier this month</a>, leaving the world’s two biggest nuclear-armed powers with no binding constraints on their strategic arsenals for the first time in more than half a century and sparking fears of a new global arms race.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In an address to parliament on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow was in no rush to start developing and deploying more weapons – backtracking on comments made by his ministry last week that said Russia considered itself no longer bound by the treaty’s terms.</p><p>“We proceed from the fact that this moratorium, which was announced by our president, remains in effect, but only while the United States does not exceed the outlined limits,” said Lavrov.</p><p>“We have reason to believe that the United States is in no hurry to abandon these limits and that they will be observed for the foreseeable future,” he said, without explaining the basis for that assumption.</p><p>US President Donald Trump rejected an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin to voluntarily abide by the limits set out in New START for another year, saying he wanted a “new, improved and modernised” treaty rather than an extension of the old one.</p><p>Russia has also indicated it wants to strike a new arms control agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Washington is pushing for China to be included in the talks, pointing to its growing nuclear arsenal.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than that of any other country by about 100 new warheads a year since 2023.</p><p>However, Beijing refuses to negotiate with the US and Russia because it says it has only a fraction of their warhead numbers – an estimated 600, compared with about 4,000 each for Russia and the US.</p><p>As the treaty expired, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China would not be joining the bilateral arms-reduction talks.</p><p>Moscow says if China is brought into a new deal, then so too should the US’s nuclear allies, the United Kingdom and France, which have 290 and 225 warheads, respectively.</p><p>New START, first signed in Prague in 2010 by the then-presidents of the US and Russia, Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limited each side’s nuclear arsenal to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads – a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002.</p><p>Deployed weapons or warheads are those in active service and available for rapid use as opposed to those in storage or awaiting dismantlement.</p><p>It also allowed each side to conduct on-site inspections of the other’s nuclear arsenal, although these were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and have not resumed since.</p><p>Russia in 2023 rejected inspections of its nuclear sites under the treaty, as tensions rose with the US over its nearly four-year war in Ukraine.</p><p>But it said it had remained committed to the quantitative limits set down.</p></div></div></body></html>"
