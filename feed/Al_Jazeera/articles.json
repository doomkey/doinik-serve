He is one of tens of thousands who are still displaced from their homes around Lebanon and who say that what little they have received in support from the Lebanese state or Hezbollah is not enough to rebuild their lives or homes destroyed during the war.</p><h2 id=\"south-not-safe\">South ‘not safe’</h2><p>On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire came into effect between Hezbollah and Israel. The agreement brought to an end more than a year of cross-border attacks and a two-month-long Israeli intensification that killed thousands in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and devastated civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Under the ceasefire, cross-border attacks were supposed to stop, Hezbollah was to withdraw north of the Litani River, which runs across south Lebanon, and Israel was to withdraw troops that had invaded south Lebanon in October.</p><p>Israel, however, never stopped attacking. Its army still occupies five points in southern Lebanon, and during the ceasefire, it <a href=\"/features/2025/2/18/israeli-just-wanted-to-destroy-in-southern-lebanon-despite-the-ceasefire\">razed several villages</a> to the ground.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3518594\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/INTERACTIVE-Israel-Hezbollah-Lebanon-remain-in-5-locations-1739885189.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel-Hezbollah Lebanon remain in 5 locations-1739885189\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>An estimated <a href=\"/podcasts/2024/10/2/the-take-one-million-in-lebanon-are-now-displaced-where-can-they-go\">1.2 million people</a>, more than a quarter of the Lebanese population, had been displaced during the war. On the morning of November 27, hundreds of thousands of people streamed south to their villages to <a href=\"/gallery/2024/11/27/thousands-returning-home-to-south-lebanon-after-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire\">return home</a>. But tens of thousands more have been left behind and are still unable to go home.</p><p>“The south is not safe,” Ali said. “I am afraid that I might be walking somewhere and a raid will attack a car next to me.”</p><p><a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">Israeli attacks</a> continue across the south and the Bekaa Valley in the east on a near-daily basis, with the Lebanese government counting more than <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/lebanon-files-un-complaint-against-israels-daily-ceasefire-violations\">2,000 Israeli violations</a> of the 2024 ceasefire deal in the last three months of 2025.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ali is not alone. The International Organization for Migration estimates that more than 64,000 people are still internally displaced in Lebanon, according to figures compiled in October 2025.</p><h2 id=\"entire-villages-razed\">Entire villages ‘razed’</h2><p>Some of the 64,000 cannot return to their homes along the border region with Israel. Israeli soldiers still hold five points on Lebanese territory, managing large swaths of south Lebanon through violence and technology: using drones, air raids, shelling or gunfire. Since the ceasefire, Israel has killed more than 330 people in Lebanon, including at least 127 civilians.</p><p>Melina*, from Odaisseh, a village on the southern border, lived most of her life in Nabatieh. During the war, she was displaced to Sidon, a southern city about 44km (27 miles) south of Beirut.</p><p>“I haven’t been able to visit my village,” she told Al Jazeera. “Psychologically, I can’t bear to see our house, which was completely destroyed, and the entire village was razed to the ground.”</p><p>“The security situation remains extremely dangerous,” she said. “You could be shot at by the Israeli side at any moment, and it’s unsafe to travel without a Lebanese army escort.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ali runs a market in Burj Qalaway, but he says the income is not enough to rebuild his home. There are also other concerns. Israel has attacked reconstruction equipment in southern Lebanon, drawing criticism from human rights groups.</p><p>“Amid the ceasefire, Israeli forces have carried out attacks that unlawfully target reconstruction-related equipment and facilities,” Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a December 2025 report. “After reducing many of Lebanon’s southern border towns to rubble, the Israeli military is now making it much more difficult for tens of thousands of residents to rebuild their destroyed homes and return to their towns.”</p><p>Some Lebanese also <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/lebanese-fear-us-has-given-green-light-for-israeli-escalation\">fear</a> a renewed Israeli offensive similar to the one in 2024.</p><h2 id=\"couldn-t-see-2cm-in-front-of-me\">‘Couldn’t see 2cm in front of me’</h2><p>On July 30, 2024, at about 7:40pm, Ramez* was sitting in his bedroom at home in Haret Hreik, a neighbourhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs referred to locally as <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/10/26/once-upon-a-time-in-dahiyeh-israels-destruction-of-lebanons-communities\">Dahiyeh</a>, an area often targeted in the past by Israel for the Hezbollah presence there.</p><p>His cats were roaming around the room, and he was busy on his phone when he heard loud explosions.</p><p>The war had been raging in the south, but attacks on Beirut and its suburbs were not yet as common. “I heard more than nine bangs,” Ramez said. He ran out of his bedroom to help his family evacuate. He left his door open, he said, so his cats could escape. While telling his mother to grab her things, he heard the loudest bang.</p><p>“The whole neighbouring building just collapsed and fell on us,” he said. Israel had just levelled the building next to his, killing <a href=\"/news/2024/7/31/hezbollahsays-top-commander-fuad-shukr-killed-in-israel-strike-on-beirut\">Fuad Shukr</a>, a top Hezbollah commander.</p><p>“I couldn’t see 2cm in front of me because of the fog and the dust.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4282885\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4282885\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4282885\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/building-1769954614-copy-1770019225.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Left: The building next to RK’s home was destroyed, causing it to fall onto his building, damaging the apartment.

His cats also survived. He found them the next day.</p><p>“I always wondered how people just go through something like this and just move on, saying, OK, Alhamdulillah, everyone is alive,” he says, though, “at that point I kind of understood it”.</p><p>Since the end of the war, he has been able to return to his family home in Haret Hreik. But his family had to pay for most of the reconstruction themselves, with little help from the government or any group.</p><p>They registered with the government for assistance but said they received only a one-time payment of 30 million Lebanese pounds (a little more than $330).</p><p>Hezbollah also sent engineers to assess the damage. In December 2024, the Reuters news agency reported that Hezbollah would pay about $77m and rent to families affected by war. Some locals said payments from the group helped a bit, but others said it had stopped paying nonmembers or tried to undervalue their losses.</p><p>“They were very stingy with payments,” Ramez said. “They tried to make us accept low payments, but my mom stood her ground and said it is enough.”</p><p>Other people who were displaced by the war told Al Jazeera that the aid provided by the state and Hezbollah was very limited.</p><h2 id=\"war-is-most-terrible\">War is ‘most terrible’</h2><p>Reports are mixed over Hezbollah’s financial capability, and it is difficult to determine how badly they have been hit financially after the group’s political and military leadership was devastated by 2024’s war and suffered several Israeli assassinations, including their longtime charismatic leader, <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"/features/2024/12/11/damascus-celebrates-assads-fall-joy-concern\">fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime</a> in Syria also dealt Hezbollah a serious blow, disrupting the land route to its main benefactor, Iran – itself now reeling <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">from deadly protests</a> and bracing for a possible <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-prepares-for-war-as-us-military-armada-approaches\">US attack</a>. The group is under immense pressure from the Lebanese government to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/7/israels-continued-attacks-on-lebanon-could-derail-hezbollah-disarmament\">disarm</a>, with the United States and Israel applying pressure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Further compounding the crisis is the fact that Lebanon is now almost seven years into one of the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/whats-happening-with-lebanons-economy-and-will-it-recover\">worst economic crises</a> in more than 150 years, according to the World Bank. This has hit locals hard, with many having their bank accounts frozen and the currency devaluing by more than 90 percent.</p><p>This has left many of the displaced feeling abandoned and unsure of how to continue.</p><p>There were violent <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/31/wave-of-israeli-air-strikes-hit-southern-lebanon-despite-ceasefire\">Israeli air raids</a> in the south on Saturday, which continued on Sunday. In the meantime, people like Ali have to continue figuring out ways to survive as their displacement carries on well past the one-year mark.</p><p>“We love life, but the situation is not good. Wars break your back,” Ali said. “War is the most terrible thing in the world.”</p><p><em>*Real names withheld for safety reasons. </em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong><em>Joao Sousa contributed to this report.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Then there was dust; I don’t remember anything else,” Nebal says.</p><p>“It was the shell fragments that amputated my hands,” she recounts.</p><h2 id=\"life-is-completely-paralysed\">‘Life is completely paralysed’</h2><p>Nebal was taken to the hospital with severe injuries, including complete amputation of both upper limbs up to the elbows, internal bleeding, and a leg injury. She underwent two abdominal surgeries.</p><p>She spent about 40 days in the hospital before beginning a new stage of suffering in displacement tents, without the most basic long-term care.</p><p>Today, Nebal, an English translation graduate and mother to two-year-old Rita, relies almost entirely on her family for the simplest daily tasks.</p><p>“I can’t eat or drink on my own … even getting dressed, my mother, sister, and sister-in-law mainly help me,” she says sorrowfully.</p><p>“Even going to the bathroom requires help. I need things in front of me because I cannot bring them myself.”</p><p>Nebal talks about the pain of motherhood left suspended, as her daughter grows up before her eyes without her being able to hold her or care for her.</p><p>“My little daughter wants me to change her, feed her, give her milk, hold her in my arms like other mothers… she asks me, and I can’t,” Nebal says with sorrow.</p><p>“My life is completely paralysed.”</p><p>Doctors tell Nebal that she urgently needs to travel to continue treatment and have prosthetic limbs fitted, emphasising that she needs advanced prosthetics to regain a degree of independence, not just cosmetic appearance.</p><p>“Doctors tell me that I need a state or an institution to adopt my case so I can gradually return to living my normal life,” she adds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4281844\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4281844\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4281844\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A5938-1769968070.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nebal with her two-year-old daughter, Rita [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera] \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4281844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nebal with her two-year-old daughter, Rita [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>With Palestinian authorities announcing arrangements to open the Rafah crossing today for batches of wounded people and medical patients, Nebal, like many others, lives in a state of anticipation mixed with fear.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, thousands of wounded still require specialised treatment unavailable inside the Strip, while the scheduling of names depends on medical lists and complex approvals, amid the absence of a clear timetable or publicly announced priority criteria.</p><p>Nebal says she received repeated calls over the past months from medical organisations informing her that she would be among the first on the travel lists.</p><p>“They contacted me more than once, told me to prepare… they gave me hope,” she adds. “But this time, no one has contacted me yet.”</p><p>Today, Nebal fears her case might be overlooked again, or that the crossing’s opening could be merely a formality, disregarding the urgent needs of patients like her.</p><p>“I die a little every day because of my current situation … not figuratively.

She stayed there for about two and a half months. They tried multiple times to graft her eye, but each operation failed, and the disfigurement worsened,” he says.</p><p>According to her father, Nada underwent three surgical attempts using tissue from her hand and other facial areas, but all failed, further complicating her medical and psychological condition.</p><p>“My daughter bleeds from her eye every day, and she has pus and discharge,” he says. “I am standing helpless, unable to do anything.”</p><p>Today, Nada needs constant assistance to walk and suffers from persistent dizziness and balance weakness. Her vision in the healthy eye is also affected.</p><p>“Even going to the bathroom, my sisters help me. I can’t walk alone,” Nada tells Al Jazeera in a soft voice.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4281910\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4281910\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4281910\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/unnamed121-1769970172.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C554&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Image showing Nada’s condition before and after the injur\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4281910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A photo showing Nada’s condition before and after the injury [Courtesy of Abdul Rahman Arhouma]</figcaption></figure><p>Nada has an official medical referral and urgently needs to travel for reconstructive surgery and the implantation of a prosthetic eye. But her ability to get the treatments remains uncertain pending the reopening of Rafah – as is the case for other patients and wounded individuals.</p><p>“Since I’ve been in the hospital, I hear every week: next week the crossing will open. Honestly, I feel they are lying. I’m not optimistic,” Nada says.</p><p>Her father told Al Jazeera that the continuing wait for the Rafah crossing to reopen was “disappointing”.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we didn’t understand anything. All the reports came from Israeli sources, and it seemed Rafah looked like a gate for prisoners, not for travel,” he says.</p><p>“Our situation is difficult, and it’s clear we face a long wait to secure my daughter’s right to treatment.”</p><h2 id=\"pilot-reopening\">Pilot reopening</h2><p>Sunday was the first pilot reopening day at Rafah, amid ambiguity and a lack of clarity about the mechanism, particularly regarding the number of patients and wounded who would be allowed to travel.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, thousands of patients and wounded people require urgent medical transfers outside the Strip, amid the collapse of the healthcare system and lack of resources.</p><p>The World Health Organization has repeatedly confirmed that Gaza’s health system is “on the brink of collapse”, and that delays in travelling for critical cases threaten their lives.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel has said it will only allow those whose names it has approved in advance to cross, without any clear announcement on daily numbers or approved criteria, leaving families of patients in constant anticipation and frustration.</p><p>For Nada’s family, this “experimental opening” means little so far.</p><p>“We can’t plan, neither to stay nor to leave,” her father says. “The decision is not in our hands. One lives in a whirlpool, unable to decide what happens. Even the Ministry of Health has not disclosed anything.”</p><h2 id=\"devastating-struggle-to-access-treatment\">‘Devastating’ struggle to access treatment</h2><p>Raed Hamad, 52 and a father of four, is also desperate to leave Gaza in order to seek treatments and medication that are not available in the war-ravaged territory.</p><p>Hamad was undergoing kidney cancer treatment a year before the war started. He underwent kidney removal after tumour detection to prevent its spread. But the outbreak of the war in October 2023 halted his treatment protocol, significantly affecting his health.</p><p>Hamad lives in the remains of his destroyed home in Khan Younis, amid the devastation left by the war, under deteriorating humanitarian conditions.</p><p>He describes his current struggle to access treatment during the war, alongside other cancer patients he meets in the hospital’s oncology department, as “devastating.”</p><p>“The war has made it almost impossible to obtain medicines and medical supplies. Cancer treatments and known treatment protocols are unavailable,” he says.</p><p>“Food, its nature, and the harsh crises we’ve endured during the war—all of this has greatly affected my health.”</p><p>Raed’s weight dropped from 92kg (203lb) to 65kg (143lb) due to complications from the disease, lack of treatment, and malnutrition.</p><p>“I continue my treatment whenever I can at my own expense,” he says. “Every time I go to the hospital, I cannot find my treatment and see that capabilities in Gaza are extremely limited. My immunity is low, and every day I face new hardships.</p><p>“I need to complete my protocol, undergo nuclear scans, and obtain some essential medications to continue my treatment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The army declared the site a “closed military zone”, a tactic frequently used to clear Palestinian land for settlement expansion.</p><p>During the raid, Israeli troops arrested three foreign solidarity activists attempting to document the eviction order.</p><p>The expulsion order is part of a widening campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region. It follows the complete displacement of the Shallal al-Auja community north of Jericho, which concluded on Saturday. After years of systematic harassment, the last three families of the community were forced to leave, marking the erasure of a presence that once included 120 families.</p><h2 id=\"al-aqsa-provocations\">Al-Aqsa provocations</h2><p>In occupied East Jerusalem, Israel’s municipal policies of urban restriction continued to displace Palestinians.</p><p>On Sunday, Yasser Maher Dana, a Palestinian resident of the Jabal Mukaber neighbourhood, was coerced into demolishing his 100-square-metre (1,076-square-foot) home. The structure, located in the al-Salaa district, housed four family members.</p><p>Israeli authorities routinely force Palestinians in East Jerusalem to execute their own demolition orders to avoid paying exorbitant fees charged by municipal crews and forces if they carry out the destruction themselves. These demolitions are justified by a lack of building permits, which rights groups say are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain in the city.</p><p>Simultaneously, in Silwan, south of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the municipality issued a demolition order for a residential room belonging to the al-Taweel family, granting them a 10-day deadline. This follows notices issued three days before demolishing two homes belonging to brothers in the Wadi Qaddum neighbourhood.</p><p>Tensions also rose at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, stormed by dozens of Israeli settlers under heavy police protection. According to the Jerusalem governorate, the incursion included a provocative “wedding blessing” ritual performed by settlers for a bride in the courtyards, a violation of the site’s status quo.</p><h2 id=\"settlers-attack-schools-and-homes\">Settlers attack schools and homes</h2><p>In the northern Jordan Valley, Israeli settlers, backed by the military, disrupted the school day at the al-Maleh School.</p><p>Azmi Balawneh, the director of education in Tubas, reported that settlers blocked teachers from reaching the school, which serves children from the vulnerable Bedouin communities of al-Hadidiya, Makhoul, and Samra.</p><p>This harassment coincides with the establishment of a new illegal settlement outpost in the al-Maleh area just a week ago. In the nearby Khirbet Samra, settlers erected a new tent on Sunday morning to seize more pastoral land.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the village of Faraata, east of Qalqilya, settlers from the illegal “Havat Gilad” outpost attacked the home of Hijazi Yamin.</p><p>Yamin told Wafa that settlers pelted his house and unleashed an attack dog on his family, trapping his wife and seven children inside.</p><p>“We live in a constant state of insecurity,” Yamin said, noting this was the second attack in a week. “I am afraid to leave my wife and children alone or let them go to school.”</p><h2 id=\"military-raids-and-closures\">Military raids and closures</h2><p>Israeli forces conducted multiple raids across the West Bank on Sunday, arresting at least four Palestinians. In Hebron, two brothers were arrested following a raid on their family home. More arrests were reported in the village of Duma, south of Nablus, and in the town of al-Ubeidiya, east of Bethlehem.</p><p>In the northern city of Jenin, military vehicles stormed the city centre and the Jabel Abu Dhuhair neighbourhood. During the incursion, troops deliberately destroyed street vendors’ carts at the Cinema Roundabout, targeting the local economy.</p><p>Movement restrictions also tightened significantly. For the second consecutive day, the Israeli army closed the main entrance to Turmus Aya, north of Ramallah, and blocked the Atara military checkpoint since the early morning hours, severing connections between northern and central West Bank cities. According to the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, Israel now operates 916 military checkpoints and gates throughout the West Bank.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
