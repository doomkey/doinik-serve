Real Madrid, founded in 1902, has only ever had this ownership model.</p><p>This ownership structure prevents large private investors from forging a majority controlling stake in the clubs; it also means they can claim tax concessions.</p><p>This is despite the fact that Real Madrid was named the world’s wealthiest football club for the fourth straight year in 2025, with an estimated market valuation of $6.75bn, according to the Forbes List. It was also the first club to earn $1bn in revenue.</p><p>The nonprofit status allows Spanish clubs to preserve some traditions of their clubs and for members to take an active role in the organisations.</p><p>Graham Hunter, a British football journalist who specialises in Spanish football, pointed to the example of Joan Laporta, the current president of the other Spanish mega club, Barcelona.</p><p>“Laporta went from being a member and a lawyer to being [club] president in seven years,” he said.</p><p>In stark contrast, football clubs in England or the United States – Manchester United or Inter Miami being just two examples – can be owned by individuals, corporations and in some instances, acquired on public stock exchanges, resulting in more commercialised ownership structures.</p><p>It means their club’s performances are often centred on more short-run processes like profit maximisation, whereas in Spain, the club is in the hands of fans – not large private investors – allowing scope for longer-term business strategies to be enacted.</p><p>If Perez’s plan goes ahead, this could open the door for this famous Spanish club to become more like its foreign rivals.</p><p>The high-profile, multi-billionaire boss of Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault, was named in Spanish media on Monday as a potential investor in the club, should the new minority ownership rules be adopted.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3394168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3394168\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3394168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241218__36QM4W6__v2__HighRes__FblFifaQatRealMadridPachuca-1734543018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid's French forward #9 Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid's Brazilian forward #7 Vinicius Junior look on ahead of the 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup final football match between Spain's Real Madrid and Mexico's Pachuca at the Lusail Stadium in Doha on December 18, 2024.

He had told us that access to the club was restricted to the children or grandchildren of members to prevent a Russian or Chinese person from joining,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Garcia added that in recent years, the rules of admission to membership had been changed several times, and Chinese and other foreigners had appeared on membership lists.</p><p>Alejandro Dominguez, a former vice president of the Real Madrid Veterans Pena, questioned why outside investors were needed to boost the coffers of such a profitable club.</p><p>“I don’t understand why we need more money when we are already the richest club in the world?” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, Fernando Valdez, a lifelong Real Madrid fan who is part of La Gran Familia supporters club, said he believed the reform would not harm the character of the club.</p><p>“If we were selling off huge chunks of the club to raise money to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, then that would be worrying, as it would change the club forever. But it is not like that,” he said.</p><p>“We need to know more details about this, but on the face of it, it does not seem like anything to worry about. Five percent or 10% is nothing.”</p><p>David Alvarez, who writes about Real Madrid for El Pais newspaper, said Perez’s ownership plan was not designed to compete with other high-spending clubs like Manchester City.</p><p>“This will allow the club to pay dividends to socios (club members). At present, the law stops them from doing that. They would have to sell a much bigger stake to be able to compete with the other big clubs in Europe, so they are not trying to do that.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4129841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4129841\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129841\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-01T213015Z_347588341_UP1ELB11NQC36_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-RMA-VAL-1764068303.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid fans react.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4129841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unlike football fans in other countries, Real Madrid spectators often own a small part of their club under the ‘socios’ model, which has existed since 1902 [File: Juan Barbosa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Again,” said Yevheniya Demyanenko, 42, who sells seeds, pots and fertiliser in southeastern Kyiv.</p><p>Huddled in a warm overcoat, as a gasoline-fuelled power generator rattled outside her shop feeding a pallid lamp, a small heater and electronic devices, she speculated that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have “something so disgustingly compromising on [Trump] that he betrays everything America is built on”.</p><p>Washington said later that the deadline is “fluid”.</p><p>Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">plan</a> resembles the Kremlin’s wish list, with short and vague clauses that provide few security guarantees to Ukraine, a Kyiv-based analyst said.</p><p>One clause stipulates that Kyiv loses Washington’s undefined security guarantees in case Ukraine “attacks” Russia. Another demands that Ukraine enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO.</p><p>A former Russian diplomat sees the plan as a triple triumph over Ukraine, Washington’s diplomacy and Europe’s entire security architecture.</p><p>The plan “restricts Ukraine’s sovereignty, offers no credible security guarantees, and signals Washington’s willingness to yield ground to the Kremlin”, Boris Bondarev, who quit his Ministry of Foreign Affairs job to protest against Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Putin sees it as proof of US weakness – and as an opening to pressure NATO into revising Europe’s entire security architecture,” he said.</p><p>According to Mariia Kucherenko, an expert with the Come Back Alive think tank, “the victim and the aggressor were equalled” in the proposal.</p><p>“Has Ukraine ever attacked Russia? Or do they mean attempts to reclaim occupied Ukrainian territories?”</p><p>She also lashed out at a clause that Washington would recognise Crimea and the southeastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – “as de facto Russian”.</p><p>Russia has occupied most of Luhansk and about three-quarters of Donetsk, and wants Kyiv to cede the rest – including fortified strongholds and commanding heights that could ease Moscow’s ability to invade deeper into Ukraine.</p><p>In return, Moscow pledges to freeze the southern front-line and withdraw from toeholds in the north.</p><p>Kucherenko said the plan does not detail the guarantees behind the “de facto” recognition that is virtually equalled to Russia’s “de jure” control.</p><p>She also lambasted a laconic clause about Ukraine “holding elections in 100 days” that does not specify “after what?”</p><p>If a vote is held after a ceasefire, would there be sanctions for violating it – and who would monitor and enforce them? she wondered.</p><p>“Until there are … answers to these questions, there won’t be any ceasefire,” Kucherenko said.</p><p>Meanwhile, any elections held after a ceasefire instead of after a full peace settlement carry enormous security risks for voters, she said.</p><p>Another question looms. Who is going to secure the vote of Ukrainians in occupied regions or Ukrainian refugees abroad?</p><p>Moscow-appointed “authorities” forced most residents in occupied regions to get Russian passports, otherwise barring them from medical and legal services and forcing them to quit their jobs.</p><p>“There are many questions, and there isn’t a single answer,” Kucherenko said.</p><p>To her, the plan resembles a “classic” intelligence operation, when Moscow’s wish list is published without considering Kyiv’s or the European Union’s positions, she added.</p><p>The publication was timed to Ukraine’s political and energy crises – and the anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity: Huge, months-long protests that began on November 21, 2013 and installed a pro-Western government.</p><p>With all that in mind, Ukrainian diplomats “need to keep our head cool, communicate with European partners and define – firmly, calmly and consequentially – the Ukrainian position,” said Kucherenko.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ukrainian parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said on Monday that Kyiv would not agree to recognising Russia’s occupation, limiting the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 and vetoes on Kyiv’s membership in NATO.</p><p>Kyiv said any peace should be “dignified” and “lasting”, and that the plan needs to be <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/24/us-and-ukraine-announce-revised-peace-plan-this-is-what-we-know#flips-6385520440112:0\">updated and refined</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, European leaders said the plan should include an immediate ceasefire, allow Kyiv to eventually join NATO, and use frozen Russian funds to restore Ukraine.</p><p>“This is a pure ‘leave-us-alone’ declaration,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera, describing the Ukrainian and European reaction to the US’s proposal.</p><p>“Russia won’t capitulate now, but has decent chances to reach the outskirts of the [southeastern city of] Zaporizhzhia and [the eastern city of] Dnipro by spring, and the EU has chances to accept five to seven million Ukrainian refugees from frozen cities,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Washington has not provided any proof for its claims. Cartel de los Soles is actually a term Venezuelans use to refer to officials engaged in corruption, and is not an organised cartel.</p><p>Several airlines have cancelled flights to Venezuela following a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace.</p><p>The advisory came after months of military build-up in the Caribbean Sea as part of what the US said were efforts to counter narcotics. Meanwhile, the top US military officer, Dan Caine, has been visiting the Caribbean region.</p><p>Last month, US President Donald Trump said he had authorised the CIA spy agency to carry out secret operations in Venezuela, bringing into the spotlight the history of US intervention in Latin America.</p><p>A strike on Venezuelan territory would constitute a serious escalation of the months-long US operation in the region, which has seen more than 80 people killed in a series of strikes on boats for allegedly trafficking drugs.</p><p>Maduro has denounced the US actions. On Monday, the Venezuelan government dubbed the “terrorist” designation of the alleged drug cartel as a “ridiculous lie” aimed at justifying “an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>Since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he has escalated attacks on Venezuela, reversing his predecessor Joe Biden’s policy of engaging with Maduro.</p><p>But the roots of distrust and tension between Washington and Caracas go back a quarter of a century, following left-wing former President Hugo Chavez’s ascension to power in 1999. Maduro took over as president following Chavez’s death in 2013.</p><p>Here is a timeline of the deteriorating relations between Venezuela and the US since Trump started his second term, and how Washington’s approach towards the South American nation has led to this moment.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>January 10, 2025</strong> – Maduro is <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-sworn-in-for-third-term-after-disputed-election\">sworn</a> in for a third term after disputed elections. The US rejects the outcome, reiterating allegations of election fraud.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2025</strong> – Trump returns to power in the US and revokes the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/21/us-supreme-court-clears-way-to-end-tps-for-venezuelans-what-it-means\">temporary protected status (TPS)</a> that had shielded about 600,000 Venezuelans living in the US from deportation.</li>\n<li><strong>February 20, 2025: </strong>The Trump administration designates Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as a “foreign terrorist organisation”. Trump would go on to claim that Tren de Aragua is a front for Maduro, even though US intelligence agencies have themselves said they have no evidence of any link between the group and the Venezuelan leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>February 21, 2025</strong> – Caracas agrees on coordinating with Washington over Trump’s mass deportation push; <a href=\"/news/2025/2/21/us-deports-dozens-of-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-bay\">the first batch of migrants reaches Venezuela</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>February 26, 2025</strong> – Trump nixes Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/2/26/trump-nixes-venezuelan-oil-concessions-granted-by-predecessor-joe-biden\">oil concessions</a> granted by Biden.</li>\n<li><strong>March 24, 2025</strong> – Trump imposes <a href=\"/news/2025/3/24/trump-to-impose-25-percent-tariffs-on-countries-that-buy-oil-from-venezuela\">25 percent tariffs</a> on countries buying oil from Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>August 8, 2025</strong> – <a href=\"/news/2025/8/8/us-doubles-reward-for-arrest-of-venezuelas-president-maduro-to-50m\">US doubles reward for arrest</a> of Maduro to $50m, designating him the “global terrorist leader” of the Cartel de los Soles.</li>\n<li><strong>September-November 2025</strong> – Washington launches a maritime “anti-narcotics” campaign in the Caribbean and Pacific on September 2. At least 21 attacks on alleged “drug boats” have since killed more than 83 people.</li>\n<li><strong>October 15, 2025</strong> – Trump confirmed that he has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela\">authorised</a> the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>October 28, 2025</strong> – Venezuela suspends a gas accord with <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/venezuela-suspends-trinidad-and-tobago-gas-accord-over-us-warship-visit\">Trinidad and Tobago</a> over a visit by a US warship.</li>\n<li><strong>November 12, 2025</strong> – Venezuela launches <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/12/venezuela-launches-nationwide-military-drills-amid-us-troop-build-up\">nationwide military drills</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14, 2025</strong> – The US announces <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america\">“Southern Spear” mission</a> as forces deploy near South America.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14-16, 2025</strong> – The US deploys the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, other warships, thousands of troops, and F-35 stealth jets to the Caribbean.</li>\n<li><strong>November 22, 2025</strong> – The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/airlines-cancel-flights-to-venezuela-amid-us-military-buildup\">FAA issues</a> a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), warning airlines of hazards in Venezuelan airspace due to “heightened military activity”, including GPS interference.

US companies invested in the oil sector in the early 20th century, and, by the 1920s, the US became the biggest market for Venezuela’s oil exports.</p><p>But Chavez’s nationalisation of the oil industry and vocal stance against US imperial interests in Latin America soured the ties. In 2007, Chavez pushed out US oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as part of his efforts to make the state oil company gain a majority stake in all new oil projects. Chevron, another US oil major, however, continues to operate.</p><h2 id=\"here-s-a-snapshot-of-venezuela-us-ties-over-the-past-25-years\">Here’s a snapshot of Venezuela-US ties over the past 25 years:</h2><h3 id=\"1999-chavez-takes-office\">1999 – Chavez takes office</h3><p>Campaigning on an anti-establishment, anti-US platform, <a href=\"/features/2013/3/6/timeline-venezuela-during-the-chavez-era\">Hugo Chavez</a> is elected president and launches the so-called Bolivarian Revolution.

The US criticises Venezuela over “authoritarianism” and restrictions on the media.</p><p>Domestically, Chavez’s government expands social programmes, funded by high oil prices, but economic mismanagement and corruption begin to undermine growth.</p><h3 id=\"2002-the-coup-attempt\">2002 – The coup attempt</h3><p>A <a href=\"/video/the-big-picture/2018/2/8/hugo-chavez-and-the-coup-that-never-happened\">short-lived coup</a> removes Chavez for 48 hours.

This event lays the foundation for two decades of distrust.</p><h3 id=\"2013-maduro-s-rise\">2013 – Maduro’s rise</h3><p>Following the death of Chavez, Maduro — his longtime deputy — narrowly wins the presidency in elections. His tenure is immediately marked by economic decline, corruption scandals and worsening relations with the US.</p><h3 id=\"2014-15-first-major-us-sanctions\">2014-15 – First major US sanctions</h3><p>Amid growing protests and allegations of human rights abuses, the US imposes visa restrictions and sanctions on Venezuelan officials.</p><p>This is a turning point: Sanctions exacerbate the economic crisis, and Venezuela begins to experience severe shortages of food and medicine. Inflation skyrockets, and migration out of the country surges.</p><h3 id=\"2017-19-economic-crisis\">2017-19 – Economic crisis</h3><p>​​The US blocks Venezuela’s access to its financial markets and bans the purchase of Venezuelan debt. Sanctions on oil imports intensify as Venezuela’s economy collapses under hyperinflation and years of mismanagement. In 2019, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi\">inflation</a> peaks at 345 percent.

The opposition showed vote tallies from several booths that appeared to suggest a comfortable win for Gonzales, disputing the result announced by election authorities in Maduro’s favour. The United Nations criticised the conduct of the election.</p><p>The then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was “overwhelming evidence” that Gonzalez had won. Several left-wing Latin American governments, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, also questioned the official results and called for a recount.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The next hearings are scheduled for Thursday and December 2.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Ammori succeeds, the ban could potentially be lifted, bringing an end to a months-long campaign of civil disobedience that has resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for showing support for the organisation since it was outlawed in July, mostly for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>Being a member of or showing support for the direct action group is currently a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned the group after two of its members broke into the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">RAF Brize Norton military base</a> in Oxfordshire in June and sprayed red paint on Voyager planes that activists said were used in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In a separate incident in August 2024, members of the group broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm <a href=\"/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab\">Elbit Systems</a> in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians. A total of 24 activists linked to the group remain under arrest.</p><p>Ammori told Al Jazeera that the ban against Palestine Action is “absurd and authoritarian”.</p><p>“Proscribing Palestine Action wasn’t done to protect the public, it was done to crush dissent and defend the Israeli weapons industry,” she said.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for the courts to right the wrongs that the government has done, and reinstate a bit of sanity. If we are not successful, we will continue to fight the ban, and I am sure that ultimately, we will win.”</p><h2 id=\"political-battle\">Political battle</h2><p>Defend Our Juries, a campaign group coordinating protests across the United Kingdom during which sign-wielding demonstrators are routinely arrested, argued the ban is “political”.</p><p>“The reason there are protest groups is because our government isn’t listening to what the continuous protests are about,” Lex Korte, the group’s legal coordinator and cofounder, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent months, thousands of protesters at mass rallies, experts of international law and human rights groups have called on the UK to end its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/corbyn-led-tribunal-accuses-uk-of-complicity-in-gaza-genocide\">alleged complicity</a> in Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. The UK provides vital components of F-35 jets and operates Shadow R1 surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The ban on Palestine Action marked the first time in British history that a direct action group has been branded as a terrorist organisation. It is also the first time that a proscribed group has been granted a judicial review.</p><p>Korte said the term “terrorism” has always had a strong political connotation.</p><p>“The UK definition of terrorism, particularly in the Terrorism Act 2000, has been criticised as being way too vague and [of including] acts that aren’t acts of terrorism, namely the inclusion of criminal damage that doesn’t require any acts of violence towards humans,” he said.</p><p>“Inviting arrest with your behaviour and with that kind of method, we’re highlighting the unjust nature of the proscription of Palestine Action,” Korte said.</p><h2 id=\"direct-action-challenges-uk-complicity-in-gaza\">Direct action challenges UK complicity in Gaza</h2><p>London-based human rights advocacy organisation Cage International highlighted the “draconian use of terrorism legislation to shut down direct action” in a report issued on Tuesday.</p><p>“Direct action has been neither random nor gratuitous. It has been focused on the specific nodes that make war possible: manufacturers, insurers, logistics providers, financiers, universities, lobbyists, and government infrastructure,” it said.</p><p>“When ordinary channels fail to restrain state-sanctioned harm, principled disruption becomes not only legitimate but necessary.”</p><p>The report argues that the UK continues to support the war in Gaza with military, trade and diplomatic ties, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) having concluded in July 2024 that Israel’s prolonged presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, constitutes a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">breach of international law</a>.</p><p>The ICJ also found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/what-has-the-icj-ordered-israel-to-do-on-gaza-war-and-whats-next\">provisional measures</a> to mitigate the risk of such acts.</p><p>Cage found Palestine Action has spurred a wave of civil disobedience between 2020 and 2025, leading to a “significant shift in the landscape of activism in the UK”. This resulted in the shutdown of operations at sites connected to the production or facilitation of weapons used by Israeli forces, such as  Elbit’s site in Bristol that was the subject of dozens of protests by Palestine Action, including days before the group was proscribed.</p><p>“Over the last two years of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the UK has steadily expanded its authoritarian counter-terrorism powers to suppress dissent and insulate itself from public accountability,”  Anas Mustapha, Cage’s Head of Public Advocacy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the proscription of Palestine Action went beyond the bounds of what the public would tolerate. It backfired precisely because the greater community consciousness has shifted. People could see with their own eyes what is happening in Gaza, and they recognise those acting to stop British participation in such acts.”</p><p>Korte, of Defend Our Juries, said judges at London’s High Court would have to understand “the gravitas that [their] decision has, both to everyday people and their lives and to the international community and the people of Palestine”.</p><p>Israel has pummelled Gaza since October 2023, killing at least 69,733 Palestinians and wounding 170,863. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel and about 200 were taken captive.</p><p>Since a ceasefire came into effect last month, two years after the war began, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">has killed</a> more than 300 people in Gaza and violated the terms of the truce hundreds of times.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly six million people lack basic minimum food supplies in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, which are mainly comprised of rural farming communities.</p><p class=\"s3\">“The advance of insurgency presents a serious threat to stability in the north, with consequences reaching beyond Nigeria,” said David Stevenson, WFP’s Nigeria country director. “Communities are under severe pressure from repeated attacks and economic stress.”</p><p class=\"s3\">Besides Boko Haram in the northeast, Nigeria also suffers violence led by armed gangs in the centre and northwest of the country, where they raid villages, kill people and kidnap for ransom.</p><p class=\"s3\">Over the past week, the country has experienced three mass kidnappings.</p><p class=\"s3\">At least 303 children and 12 teachers were abducted by gunmen from the Saint Mary’s Catholic School in north-central Nigeria’s Niger State on Friday.</p><p class=\"s3\">In neighbouring Kebbi State, 25 Muslim high school girls were taken, while 38 worshippers were snatched from a church during a livestreamed service in Kwara State.</p><p class=\"s3\">The hunger crisis in Nigeria and the region is expected to get worse as international bodies trying to assist suffering populations face increasing funding challenges.</p><p class=\"s3\">The WFP was forced to scale down its nutrition programme in Nigeria in July, affecting more than 300,000 children and exacerbating malnutrition levels from “serious” to “critical” in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"s3\">Under President Donald Trump, the United States – the NGO’s largest donor – has slashed aid, leaving the agency at risk of running out of funds for emergency food and nutrition by December.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Until this year, the FTO label was largely limited to groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) with political motives.</p><p>On Monday, Washington formally designated the Cartel de los Soles for allegedly shipping narcotics into the US. The administration says the network includes Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials, though it has provided no evidence. Venezuela denounced the move, calling it a “ridiculous” effort to sanction a “non-existent” group.</p><p>The designation follows earlier measures against eight Latin American criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. US officials claim the Cartel de los Soles has collaborated with Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang – itself designated an FTO – to move drugs northward.</p><p>Officials have rarely identified which groups they believe are behind the boats targeted by US strikes. Hegseth said last week the new designation would provide a “whole bunch of new options to the United States” in dealing with Maduro. Asked whether such options might include land strikes inside Venezuela, he said “nothing is off the table, but nothing’s automatically on the table.” Sanctions experts have noted that the FTO statute does not authorise military action.</p><h2 id=\"caracas-pushes-back\">Caracas pushes back</h2><p>Maduro’s government denies involvement in criminal operations and accuses Washington of seeking regime change to control Venezuela’s resources.</p><p>“They want Venezuela’s oil and gas reserves. For nothing, without paying. They want Venezuela’s gold. They want Venezuela’s diamonds, iron, bauxite. They want Venezuela’s natural resources,” said Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez on state television.</p><p>Foreign Minister Yvan Gil echoed that view, saying the US designation revives “an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organised crime, has described the cartel narrative as an “oversimplification”, saying it “is more accurately described as a system of corruption wherein military and political officials profit by working with drug traffickers”.</p><p>The US campaign has also drawn sharp domestic debate within the country. A Reuters poll suggested that only 29 percent of Americans support killing suspected traffickers without judicial oversight. A former senior Treasury official said FTO designations were never intended to justify military operations. “Never had it been suggested that by designating an entity as an FTO it would … meet the standard for military action,” the official said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.</p><p>At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.</p><p>The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.</p><p>These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.</p><p>Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.</p><p>He pointed to the <a href=\"/news/2021/4/13/elite-privilege-consumes-17-4bn-of-pakistans-economy-undp\">2021 UNDP report</a> and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”</p><p>“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p><p>It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).</p><p>The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.</p><p>The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.</p><p>Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.</p><p>“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"judiciary-and-rule-of-law\">Judiciary and rule of law</h2><p>The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.</p><p>The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.</p><p>Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.</p><p>The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.</p><p>While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.</p><p>The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.</p><h2 id=\"was-the-report-necessary\">Was the report necessary?</h2><p>The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.</p><p>Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.</p><p>Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.</p><p>He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.</p><p>“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.</p><p>Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.</p><p>“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120683\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120683\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP22154336836269-1763683560.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani rickshaw drivers chant slogans during a protest against the recent increasing in petrol prices, Friday, June 3, 2022.

The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.</p><p>Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.</p><p>“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.</p><p>Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.</p><p>“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.</p><p>For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.</p><p>He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.</p><p>“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.</p><p>For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.</p><p>“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”</p><p>“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was a massacre. None of the people killed that I have seen were armed soldiers.”</p><p>Mediation has so far failed to end the fighting as both sides try to secure military gains before talks are held.</p><p>On Sunday, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/sudan-army-chief-rejects-truce-proposal-citing-uae-role\">Burhan rejected</a> a US truce proposal from the Quad group of mediators as the “worst yet” and unacceptable. The Quad group comprises the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Burhan claimed that the presence of the UAE – which he accused of supporting the RSF – in the Quad meant that the proposals could not be seen as unbiased.</p><p>The UAE has consistently denied any role in the war in Sudan, and on Monday, it accused Burhan of “consistently obstructive behaviour”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
