In a statement, she praised Zelenskyy’s “consistently constructive approach” and said she hoped Russia would “offer its own concrete contribution” to future talks.</p><h2 id=\"territorial-question-deepens-diplomatic-tensions\">Territorial question deepens diplomatic tensions</h2><p>The territorial issue is shaping up to be the most sensitive point in negotiations, as Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, prepare to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.</p><p>Zelenskyy has said he hopes to speak with Trump after those talks. But Ukrainian officials have already told the US that Kyiv will not accept any settlement requiring it to cede territory.</p><p>“We told the American side that it is unacceptable for Russia to continue its occupation of our territory and then demand that we grant it legitimacy,” Zelenskyy’s adviser, Rustem Umerov, told Al Jazeera Arabic. “Giving up our territory means that international law no longer exists and that any party can use force to abolish the sovereignty of another party.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Umerov said security guarantees remain a delicate part of discussions, because “we are seeking security for both Europe and Ukraine”. He added that negotiations will be “extremely difficult” if Russia genuinely engages, arguing that Moscow still believes “continuing the war is less costly than ending it”.</p><p>Reporting from Brussels, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said that European Union leaders are insisting that no major concessions be made to Russia, and that “instead of handing over territory, there need to be land swaps that can only be decided by the Ukrainian people”.</p><p>It comes after a draft US plan was leaked to the press in mid-November, prompting criticism in Ukraine and among its European allies, who said the document heavily favoured Moscow.</p><p>The plan had proposed to limit Ukraine’s army strength to 600,000 men, with no mention of any cap on Russia. It also barred Kyiv from ever joining NATO, and included plans for Moscow to keep captured Ukrainian territories.</p><h2 id=\"russian-strikes-hit-dnipro\">Russian strikes hit Dnipro</h2><p>As diplomatic efforts accelerate, Ukraine suffered another deadly attack earlier on Monday. Local officials said at least four people were killed in a Russian missile strike on the central city of Dnipro.</p><p>Interfax reported that injuries have risen to 43, citing Vladyslav Haivanenko, the acting head of the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Military Administration. He said 10 people were in serious condition. The strike damaged an administrative building, several businesses, four educational institutions, multiple high-rise buildings, two service stations and more than 50 vehicles.</p><p>Dnipro, located about 100km (62 miles) from the front line and home to nearly one million people before the war, is frequently targeted by Russian bombardments.</p><p>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its forces had “liberated” the settlement of Klynove in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, claiming it had advanced deep into Ukrainian positions. However, the Ukrainian army has refuted these claims.</p><p>Moscow said Ukraine lost about 1,415 troops across the front over the past 24 hours. Kyiv, meanwhile, reported eliminating 1,060 Russian troops, one tank, six armoured vehicles, 14 artillery systems, 239 drones and 71 vehicles in the same period.</p><p>Al Jazeera could not independently verify either side’s battlefield claims.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Driven by hunger and fear that he might die, the wolf ate the grandmother and the girl.</p><p>The story puzzled Musliu and her peers, who struggled at first to understand how hunger could possibly justify the wolf killing the little girl and her grandmother, and second, to see the purpose of this story in a reconciliation workshop. The facilitators explained that the exercise was meant to show that there are many perspectives to every story, the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and there could always be different truths.</p><p>Absurd as it is, more than 20 years later, I found myself in a very similar situation. In October, I attended a workshop organised by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to bring together young women from Kosovo and Serbia and teach them dialogue and peacemaking.</p><p>Just like Musliu, we too had a foreign facilitator and several international speakers. This time, they had also added two assistant facilitators, one from Kosovo and one from Serbia; it was clear that both had been given a detailed script to follow, which they could not deviate from.</p><p>The first day of the training, we were asked to explain how we understood peace. So we did so by sharing different stories, many of which were traumatic. Some I still cannot stop thinking about. The facilitator seemed less concerned about what we were saying and more preoccupied with us running 15 minutes late. There seemed to be little understanding of the depth of emotions, courage, and vulnerability that those stories carried.</p><p>On the second day, we learned about integrative negotiations. One bullet point in the presentation said that negotiation requires “separating the people from the problem”. I read it, and I felt something in my chest; I couldn’t continue reading further.</p><p>How do I separate the people from the problem, when I know what happened to my family and my community during the war? My parents were forced to flee to Albania before Serb forces entered their neighbourhood; when they came back, their home had been broken into, damaged and some items missing – including my mother’s wedding dress. Neighbours told her that Serb soldiers made it a point to burn women’s wedding dresses they found.</p><p>In other communities, the crimes went well beyond broken homes. More than <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2014/12/10/kosovo-war-victims-list-published/\">8,000 ethnic Albanian civilians</a> were killed or forcibly disappeared; more than 20,000 girls, boys, women and men <a href=\"https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/en/cp_article/war-in-kosovo-and-sexual-violence-a-painful-legacy/\">were raped</a>.</p><p>“During the rape, I was trying to protect myself—I was just a child, only 11 years old. But they marked me. They carved a cross into me and said, ‘This is the memory you’ll keep of us.’ It destroyed me as a child, from the inside. They made those marks on me with a knife,” one survivor recounted.</p><p>Knowing this story and so many others, I found it hard to understand how one can tell a group of young women whose family members were displaced, raped, tortured, or killed during the war that the problem has to be separated from the people.</p><p>I guess it is easy for foreign facilitators to do so because at the end of a peacemaking workshop, they would take a cab to the airport, fly home and leave behind the survivors still struggling with a transition from war to peace and all the pain in between. I recalled Musliu’s words at the end of her story about peacemaking between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood: “We should ask them how they would reconcile their differences if the wolf had eaten their grandmothers?”</p><p>Throughout the workshop, we were assigned seats in the conference room, where we were mixed, the girls from Kosovo and the girls from Serbia sitting next to each other. However, as soon as the lunch break time came, the attempt to make us sit together and befriend failed, as we sat at different tables.</p><p>When asked by the organisers about this division, I responded that the workshop was yet to address the elephant in the room – the war itself. How could we feel there could be resolution and closure without discussing what triggered the war, what happened during it, and how it ended? How could we reconcile if we could not talk about justice?</p><p>Every time I wanted to emphasise the complexity of the post-war situation – for example, by bringing up the topic of survivors of sexual violence – there was an intervention from the facilitators who told me “you are not ready yet” to talk about this.</p><p>I was furious to hear someone else evaluate my ability to handle a conversation. It is a tone the West often uses when speaking to the rest of the world. We are told we are “not ready” for democracy, “not prepared” for self-governance, “not objective enough” to confront our own past.</p><p>Readiness becomes a way to measure civilisation, to decide who can speak and who must listen. In these spaces, “not being ready” is never about emotional strength; it is about power. It is a polite way of saying that our truth is inconvenient, that our pain must wait for translation, moderation, and approval.</p><p>It speaks volumes that the workshop organisers claimed to have a focus on gender, but at the same time avoided the topic of rape as a war crime because it surpassed the level of depth – or rather level of superficiality – they had planned in their agenda.</p><p>On the fifth day of the training, the facilitator announced that we would talk about historical narratives to understand “different perspectives and different truths, even if we don’t agree with all of them”.</p><p>For the organisers, clearly, such an exercise was useful. For me, using perspectives and truths interchangeably was dangerous. It could blur the lines between facts and narratives.</p><p>Yes, wars may hold many perspectives and experiences, but truth is not among the things that can be multiplied. Truth, out of all the things, is not a matter of balance or compromise; it rests on evidence, and it is rooted in facts. When we challenge or debate facts, we risk distorting truth; we risk allowing falsehoods to look like reasonable interpretations of history.</p><p>And so, I sat on that day, 26 years after the end of the war, listening to a painful, outrageous, and dangerous message: There are many truths to a story. I was told that now we have to move on from the past and look towards the future, reconcile and find a way to live with each other.</p><p>I cannot help but think, how in a few years’ time, someone will go and train the Palestinians who experienced genocidal horrors as children on Western-style peacebuilding.</p><p>How would they look a Palestinian in the eye and tell them there are many truths to the Gaza genocide story? How on earth would this be promoting peace?</p><p>If this is what the West today calls building peace, I do not want to be a part of it.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Experts have <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/what-is-cartel-de-los-soles-the-latest-group-designated-terrorist-by-us\">pushed back</a> on the characterisation, saying the “Cartel de los Soles” has traditionally referred to a loose network of corruption within the Venezuelan government.</p><p>In a Saturday post on his Truth Social account, Trump said airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed “in its entirety”, in what some observers saw as the final preparations for military action.</p><p>But on Sunday, Trump told reporters not to “read anything into” the move.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC on Monday, Al Jazeera’s chief US correspondent Alan Fischer said “no one quite knows” why Trump announced the airspace closure. He added that reports in US media indicate the announcement happened without Pentagon notification.</p><p>“When asked about it … on Air Force One, [Trump] said that you shouldn’t read too much into it. But of course, that didn’t stop the speculation, because normally no-fly zones are imposed before there’s some sort of military operation,” Fisher said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He added that many observers in Washington have read the threats and asset build-up as an effort to force Maduro to flee the country before any military action is taken. Others have pointed to Trump’s past statements on Venezuela’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/venezuela-calls-on-opec-to-counter-us-threats\">vast oil reserves</a>, sparking concerns he could pursue a “war for oil”.</p><p>“Of course, in all of this, Donald Trump has to balance his MAGA [Make America Great Again] supporters because he campaigned on the fact that he wouldn’t get involved in what he described as stupid foreign wars,” Fisher said.</p><p>Reporting from the US territory of Puerto Rico, the staging ground of the military’s Caribbean build-up, Al Jazeera’s Phil Lavelle said there has been a flurry of activity, but it remained difficult to discern if any operations were imminent.</p><p>“We’ve got about 15,000 or so military personnel in this part of the world as this readiness is under way,” Lavelle said.</p><p>“We’ve also obviously got the sea systems: We’ve got the USS Gerald F Ford, the largest aircraft carrier strike group in the world, currently off the coast … Also, the USS Winston S Churchill and the USS Bainbridge,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-scrutiny-over-boat-strikes\">Renewed scrutiny over boat strikes</h2><p>The build-up has persisted as the Trump administration has faced renewed pressure over its <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">lethal strikes</a> on alleged Venezuelan drug smugglers in international waters in the Caribbean.</p><p>Over the weekend, Republican and Democratic leaders on the US House and Senate armed services committees announced they were upping oversight of the strikes.</p><p>That came after the Washington Post and CNN reported last week that US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill all people aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs from Venezuela.</p><p>Subsequently, military officials reportedly ordered a so-called “follow-on” strike on the vessel after two individuals appeared to survive the first strike.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While legal scholars have long said US strikes on vessels carrying alleged “narco-terrorists” in international waters <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/in-boat-strike-trump-repurposes-war-on-terror-for-latin-american-crime\">may be illegal</a> under both international and domestic law, the defence secretary explicitly ordering forces to kill all people on board the vessels ventures into even more precarious legal grounds.</p><p>In a letter, a group of former US military lawyers said the orders “if true” would “constitute war crimes, murder, or both”.</p><p>Responding to the report, Hegseth said all military actions in the Caribbean were “in compliance with the law of armed conflict”.</p><p>He has since doubled down in defiance, posting on social media on Sunday a mock image of children’s character Franklin targeting boats with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said that Hegseth had denied giving the kill order.</p><p>“He did not say that, and I believe him 100 percent,” he said.</p><p>On Monday, the White House confirmed that a second strike did occur, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt saying Admiral Frank Bradley gave the order for the follow-on attack.</p><p>Bradley “worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,” Leavitt told reporters. She characterised the attack as in the “self-defence” of the US.</p><p>Also on Monday, Venezuela’s National Assembly was set to meet for an extraordinary session to debate forming a commission on the strikes.</p><p>However, the meeting was postponed until Tuesday, with no reason given.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are all displaced from their home in Tal al-Hawa in southwest Gaza City, as a result of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/israeli-attack-kills-two-children-in-southern-gaza-despite-ceasefire\">Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza</a>.</p><p>“There are no words to describe how I feel right now,” Samar says, her voice almost breaking. “I feel like my mind is going to freeze. How am I supposed to welcome my baby girl like this?”</p><p>While Samar tries to salvage clothes and blankets, her husband and brothers shovel sand into the pools of water that have swallowed their living space. Mattresses, clothing, and basic belongings lie scattered around them, soaked and unusable.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143567\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143567\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143567\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9270-1764603663.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Close up of a woman holding nappies damaged by water\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143567\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samar al-Salmi had prepared nappies and other items for her new baby, but they were ruined by the floodwater [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“I put the baby’s hospital bag in my mother’s tent, thinking it would be safe,” she says. “But the rain rushed in there first and flooded everything, including the bag.”</p><p>“I don’t know where to start,” she adds. “Should I care for my children, whose clothes are full of mud and sand so I need to heat water and bathe them?</p><p>“Or do I try to dry the mattresses that will be so difficult in this cold? Or should I prepare myself so I’m ready to give birth at any moment?” she asks.</p><p>Since the war began two years ago, aid organisations have warned that Gaza’s displaced families would face catastrophe each time winter arrived, as they live in thin, tattered tents as a result of a strict Israeli ban on construction materials and caravans entering the Gaza Strip.</p><p>“A tent is not a solution,” Samar says. “In the summer, it’s unbearably hot, and in the winter, we flood. This is not a life. And winter hasn’t even started yet. What will we do when the real cold arrives?”</p><p>“At the very least, why weren’t caravans allowed in? Any roof to shelter us until this ends.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143572\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143572\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143572\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9224-1764603779.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman cleaning in a tent, reflected through a mirror\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samar is now trying to dry out all her family’s belongings, to make the Gaza tent they live in partially habitable [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-father-overwhelmed\">A father overwhelmed</h2><p>Samar’s husband, Abdulrahman al-Salmi, sits quietly, busy repairing the tents with her brothers. At first, he is so discouraged that he says he doesn’t even feel like talking to Al Jazeera. But gradually, he begins to open up.</p><p>“As a father, I’m helpless,” the 39-year-old says. “I try to hold our life together from one side, and it collapses on the other. That’s our life during and after the war. We’ve been unable to find any solution.”</p><p>He recounts the moment Samar called him earlier that morning while he was on his way to his first day of work at a small barbershop.</p><p>“She was crying and screaming, and everyone around her was screaming,” he recalls. “She told me, ‘Come quickly, the rain has invaded our tent from every direction.’”</p><p>He dropped everything and ran back under the rain.</p><p>“The place was completely flooded, like a swimming pool,” he says, tears filling his eyes. “My wife and mother-in-law were screaming, my children were outside shivering from the cold, the tents were flooded, the street was flooded… people were scooping water out of their tents with buckets. Everything was extremely difficult.”</p><p>For Abdulrahman, the rain feels like the final blow.</p><p>“We’ve been struggling in everything since the war began, and now the rain has come to finish us off completely.”</p><p>The father spoke of his immense difficulty in providing essentials for the newborn amid severe shortages and skyrocketing prices.</p><p>“I bought the diapers for 85 shekels ($26), the same type we used to get for 13 ($4),” he says. “The milk formula is 70 ($21). Even the pacifier is expensive. And now everything we prepared for tomorrow’s delivery is ruined. I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>The couple cannot help but remember the life they once had; their warm, clean second-floor apartment in Tal al-Hawa, where they once lived a dignified and peaceful life, as they put it.</p><p>“Now the apartment, the building, and the entire neighbourhood are destroyed,” Samar says. “All our family homes are gone. We have no option but to live in tents.”</p><p>What terrifies the couple most is welcoming their baby girl into these conditions. Samar is scheduled for a C-section and will return afterwards to the tent.</p><p>“I never imagined this,” she says softly. “I never imagined I would welcome the daughter we dreamed of under these conditions.”</p><p>She admits, through guilt, that she sometimes regrets getting pregnant during the war.</p><p>“In my previous deliveries, I returned from the hospital to my apartment, to my comfortable bed, and I took care of myself and my baby peacefully,” she adds with grief.</p><p>“Any mother in the world would understand my feelings now, the sensitivity of the last days of pregnancy, the delivery itself, and the early days afterward.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143577\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9405-1764604018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man holds an empty bucket\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abdulrahman al-Salmi says he feels frustrated and helpless as life ‘collapses’ [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"endless-displacement\">Endless displacement</h2><p>Like most families in Gaza, Samar’s has been displaced repeatedly, moving between Khan Younis, Rafah, Nuseirat, and Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“I fled to my family’s home, then my uncle’s home, then my husband’s family. Every house we fled to is now destroyed, and everyone is homeless,” Samar says.</p><p>Their children, Mohammad, seven, Kinan, five, and Yaman, three, have suffered the most.</p><p>“Look at them,” she says. “They’re shivering from the cold. They don’t have enough clothes. And the laundry I just washed is covered in mud again.”</p><p>A few days ago, the children needed to be taken to the hospital after being bitten by insects inside the camp. Cold and illness stalk them every night.</p><p>“The older boy couldn’t sleep from stomach pain,” Abdulrahman says. “I covered him and covered him, but it didn’t help. There are no blankets … nothing.”</p><p>For Samar, even the ceasefire has brought no comfort. She rejects the narrative that the <a href=\"/features/2025/11/26/stuck-in-gazas-limbo-palestinians-struggle-to-live-amid-israels-attacks\">war has calmed down</a>. To her, the war never stopped.</p><p>“They say the war is over. Where is it over?” Samar asks. “Every day there is bombing, every day there are martyrs, and every day we drown and suffer. This is the beginning of a new war, not the end.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143593\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143593\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9256-1764604216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman holds her belongings\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salma al-Salmi cleans up her family’s rain-soaked tent [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-plea-for-shelter\">A plea for shelter</h2><p>Above all, the couple wants only one thing: dignity.</p><p>“Even caravans are not a real solution; they’re temporary,” Samar says. “We are human beings. We had homes. Our demand is to rebuild our homes.”</p><p>Her final plea is directed at humanitarian organisations.</p><p>“We need clothes, mattresses, blankets. Everything is ruined. We need someone to stand with us. We need a place to shelter us. It’s impossible to keep living on a sheet of plastic.”</p><p>As for Abdulrahman, he sums up their reality with a single sentence as he spreads another layer of sand:</p><p>“Honestly… we’ve become bodies without souls.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9146-1764604413.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A waterlogged area between tents\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winter rains have flooded tents in Gaza, with more rain expected over the next few months [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
