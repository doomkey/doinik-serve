Yet even at this pivotal moment, one major highway is still missing from that roadmap that could undermine the progress made in Brazil: the carbon emissions of the military.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, governments are not required to report their militaries’ emissions, and most simply don’t. Recent analysis by the<a href=\"https://militaryemissions.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Military Emissions Gap</a> project shows that what little data exists is patchy, inconsistent or missing entirely. This “military emissions gap” is the gulf between what governments disclose and the true scale of military pollution. The result is stark: militaries remain largely invisible in the Belem negotiations, creating a dangerous blind spot in global climate action.</p><p>The size of that blind spot is staggering. Militaries account for an estimated 5.5 percent of global emissions. This share is set to rise further as defence spending surges while the rest of society decarbonises. If militaries were a country, they would be the fifth-largest emitter on Earth, ahead of Russia with 5 percent. Yet only five countries follow the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) voluntary reporting guidelines for military emissions, and those cover fuel use alone. The reality is far broader: munitions production and disposal, waste management and fugitive emissions from refrigeration, air-conditioning, radar and electrical equipment are left out. And operations in international waters and airspace are not reported at all, leaving massive gaps in both climate accountability and action.</p><p>The military emissions gap widens further still when we consider the climate impact of armed conflicts. As if the horror and human suffering from fighting wars were not enough, wars also destroy ecosystems, leave a toxic legacy on lands for decades to follow, and result in significant CO2 emissions, including from the rebuilding following the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. But without any internationally agreed framework to measure conflict emissions, these additional emissions risk going unreported, meaning that we don’t know how much wars are setting back climate action.</p><p>But despite this, momentum for accountability is finally building. Nearly 100 organisations have signed the<a href=\"https://www.thewaronclimate.org/cop\"> War on Climate initiative’s pledges</a> ahead of COP30, and protesters and civil society groups in Belem are demanding the UNFCCC confront this long-ignored source of pollution. Policymakers are starting to shift, too. The European Union has taken steps towards more transparent reporting and decarbonisation in the defence sector, though this progress is now threatened by rapid rearmament. Combined with NATO’s new target for members to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product on militaries, these pledges could produce up to 200 million tonnes of CO2 and trigger as much as $298bn in climate damages annually, putting Europe’s own climate goals at risk.</p><p>International law reinforces the urgency and demand for accountability. <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">The International Court of Justice’s </a>recent landmark advisory opinion reminded states that they are obliged under climate treaties to assess, report and mitigate harms, including those caused by armed conflict and military activity. Ignoring these emissions doesn’t just undercount global warming; it masks the scale of the crisis and weakens the world’s ability to tackle its root causes.</p><p>The gap between current emission-reduction plans and what is needed to stay below the 1.5C limit remains catastrophic. If COP30 negotiators agree on a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels, what happens next will determine whether it delivers real progress or remains symbolic. No sector can be exempt from climate action, and military emissions cannot continue to remain hidden.</p><p>Mandatory reporting of all military emissions to the UNFCCC – from combat and training activities to the long-lasting climate damage inflicted on communities – is essential.  That data must form the baseline for urgent, science-aligned reductions, embedded in national climate plans, and consistent with the 1.5C limit.</p><p>Security cannot come at the cost of the climate. Tackling climate change is now essential to our collective safety and the survival of our planet.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The proposal would also demand cuts to Ukraine’s military, several outlets reported.</p><p>Ukraine’s Zelenskyy – who <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy\">sparred with</a> US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a dramatic meeting in February – has been clear since Russia’s 2022 invasion that potential peace talks ought not sideline Ukraine, a viewpoint shared by much of the EU’s leadership.</p><p>“We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelenskyy <a href=\"/news/2025/2/13/zelenskyy-wants-plan-to-stop-russia-before-us-peace-talks\">said ahead of that contentious meeting.</a></p><p>He has since repeatedly made clear several red lines that neither the Ukrainian government nor its constitution would permit, including ceding its territory.</p><p>Still, some European leaders have offered less enthusiasm. Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU should stop sending money to Ukraine in seeming reference to an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/ukraine-suspends-justice-minister-for-alleged-link-to-100m-corruption-case\">ongoing corruption probe</a> involving an alleged $100m energy kickback scheme.</p><p>Last week, Ukraine’s Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignations as anticorruption authorities said they had detained five people suspected of an alleged plot to control procurement at nuclear agency Energoatom.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There’s a war mafia, a corrupt system working in Ukraine, and then the European Commission president … instead of stopping the payments and demanding for immediate financial clearance, she wants to send another 100 billion to Ukraine. That is insane,” Szijjarto said.</p><p>Hungary’s right-wing populist leader Victor Orban, who counts Russian Putin as an ally, has been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-on-hungarys-orban-to-stop-blocking-eu-bid\">blocking Ukraine’s EU bid,</a> received an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/hungarian-leader-viktor-orban-to-meet-us-president-donald-trump\">exemption</a> on Russian energy sanctions from Trump and a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">financial shield</a>” to safeguard its economy in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The time is not on the side of Ukraine. It is an illusion to say that the time is on the side of Ukraine,” Szijjarto said, adding that he would support Trump’s peace initiatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was designed to silence and intimidate any possible opposition.</p><p>The number of victims who were summarily executed is estimated at 130,000 to 200,000.</p><p>In the half-century since Franco's demise, exhumations have been slow and beset by logistical, financial and legal challenges. There are an estimated 6,000 unmarked mass graves dotted around the country, including everywhere from wells and woodlands to gardens, cemeteries and remote hillsides.</p><p>But as Spain remembers the era's victims and analyses exhumation efforts, it is grappling with the steady recent rise of a far-right party, Vox, and nostalgia for the ideals of the dictatorship among young people who did not endure it.</p><p>A recent CIS poll suggested that 20 percent of those aged 18 to 24 believed the dictatorship was \"good\" or \"very good\".</p><p>According to secondary schoolteachers, social media is driving pro-Franco support among teenagers.</p><p>“They talk like they are really in favour of the dictatorship and of obligatory military service as well,” Jose Garcia Vico, a secondary school economics teacher in Andalusia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The majority of the teachers I know are very worried because even if we’ve explained the difference between dictatorship and democracy, the students are so overrun with content from TikTok and they’re so p***** off with the world in general, they don’t know what they want.”</p><p>“The content they get from the hard-right parties on social media aimed at adolescents is considerable, and it has a lot of effect on how they relate to each other.”</p><p>While emphasising “not everybody in the class” is attracted to the far right, Garcia Vico points to a parallel sharp rise in Islamophobic and anti-transgender comments.</p><p>“Above all, it’s the boys who feel superior to the rest. But it’s a problem which involves some of the parents as well. A couple of years ago, some parents told me that it was OK that their child had interrupted me by shouting, 'Viva Franco!’ ['Long Live Franco!'] because that was freedom of expression.”</p><p>Hundreds of kilometres north in the capital, Madrid, Sebastian Reyes Turner, a 27-year-old teacher, said he has also noticed the impact of hard-right social media influencers.</p><p>“In schools, people only see Franco’s dictatorship as one of several topics to mindlessly memorise to pass a history exam they don’t really care about to begin with.</p><p>“On the other hand, details are cherry-picked by the far right to make them think it was a better time in which they didn’t face problems like they do today - like how hard it is to find jobs even if they’ve been studying well into their 20s or the housing crisis.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

California’s Governor <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference\">Gavin Newsom</a> has accused US President Donald Trump of “handing the future to China” and leaving states like California to pick up the slack, in a speech at the summit.</p><p>“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said. Trump has called concerns over climate change a “hoax” and a “con job”.</p><p>But the UN Climate Change Conference COP30 is not the only event where the diverging paths that China and the US are taking on addressing the climate crisis are being felt.</p><p>Back in the US, and in neighbouring Canada, trade barriers aimed at punishing Chinese electric vehicles have made them far costlier than what the manufacturers want to sell them for.</p><p>These tariffs are a legacy of former US President Joe Biden’s administration, and place North America as an outlier at a time when Chinese EVs otherwise dominate the global market.</p><h2 id=\"how-dominant-is-china-in-evs\">How dominant is China in EVs?</h2><p>Joel Jaeger, a senior research associate with the World Resources Institute, told Al Jazeera that Chinese EVs have “really upended the car market” in recent years.</p><p>China has gone “from basically not a major player five years ago” to becoming “the number one exporter of cars globally in terms of the units”, says Jaeger.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China manufactured 12.4 million electric cars in 2024, more than 70 percent of the 17.3 million electric cars manufactured globally last year.</p><p>Of these, China exported about 1.25 million cars, representing 40 percent of global exports, while the remaining Chinese-made cars — the vast majority — were sold domestically.</p><p>This dominance has been built on the back of “subsidies that China’s put in place to develop its industry, which I think is a very strategic thing that China has done, both for its own economic growth as well as decarbonisation”, Jaeger said.</p><p>But on the streets of the US or Canada, Chinese EVs are still relatively rare.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-chinese-evs-less-affordable-in-the-us-and-canada\">Why are Chinese EVs less affordable in the US and Canada?</h2><p>According to Jaeger, “prohibitive” tariffs mean that Chinese EVs are almost impossible to buy in the US and Canada.</p><p>“In the last year, the US and <a href=\"/economy/2024/8/26/canada-follows-us-imposes-100-tariff-on-evs-imported-from-china\">Canada</a> both put on basically completely prohibitive tariffs on EVs [of] over 100 percent in both places,” he added.</p><p>Notably, the steep import taxes on Chinese EVs in the US were introduced under Biden, a Democrat, who <a href=\"/news/2024/5/8/clean-energy-on-the-cusp-of-rolling-back-fossil-fuels-report\">championed renewable energy</a>, in contrast to Trump, who has pledged to fight it and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out\">“drill, baby, drill”</a> for oil.</p><p>A month after the US introduced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in September 2024, Canada brought in identical tariffs of its own.</p><p>It means that a car that a Chinese EV manufacturer might be selling at $30,000 actually costs at least $60,000 in the US or Canada. This makes it hard for even cheaper Chinese models to compete with the higher-end US electric models, which on average retail for approximately $55,000.</p><p>These tariffs, along with other US policies, have meant that Chinese manufacturers have yet to set up shop in the US.</p><p>In Canada, Addisu Lashitew, an associate professor of business at McMaster University, told Al Jazeera that the steep tariffs conflict with targets set to transition fully to electric cars by 2035, but are also complicated due to Canada’s close trading ties with the US.</p><p>“The problem is that one, we are going through a very complex trade talk with the US now,” said Lashitew. “And two, our supply chain has also [been] very much integrated. Many of the American manufacturers are here, and Canadian firms are mainly suppliers.”</p><p>But while it is almost impossible to buy a cheap Chinese electric car in the US, Jaeger says this does not mean that North America is completely missing out on importing new Chinese technology.</p><p>“The US, for example, imports a lot of batteries from China. It’s actually the second-biggest importer of lithium-ion batteries behind Germany in the world, from China. So, they’re using them in US-made EVs,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117290\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117290\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117290\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691da524082d9-1763550500.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A selection of 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali pick-up trucks, which are fully electric vehicles, are displayed at a GMC/Hummer truck dealership, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Manchester, N.H.

A majority of the 4.27 million electric cars that BYD sold in 2024 were bought by Chinese consumers. BYD also has a manufacturing presence in Lancaster, California, where it builds electric buses and batteries, but not cars.</p><p>In China, the local market has grown in part due to incentives from the government, which also saw electric cars as part of its strategy to <a href=\"/news/2022/1/4/beijing-meets-national-air-quality-standards-for-first-time\">bring down air pollution</a> in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>Customers in China have benefitted from the government’s approach, including through access to new technology. For example, a new battery, which BYD announced in March with the promise of charging for 400km (about 250 miles) of travel in just five minutes, is first being made available for preorder to customers in China only.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-expensive-are-evs\">How expensive are EVs?</h2><p>They used to be costlier than cars that run on petrol or diesel. But according to the IEA, the cost of owning an electric car over the vehicle’s entire lifetime is now less than fossil fuel-powered cars, due to the reduced costs of fuel and maintenance.</p><p>Buying an electric car is still often more expensive, though.</p><p>That is where China’s subsidies to manufacturers help. The IEA has found that prices for electric cars in China are similar to petrol and diesel cars, with half of all electric cars being sold for less than $30,000 and a wide range of lower-priced models available.</p><p>By contrast, in the US and Europe, “the range [of available EVs] was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices”, according to the IEA.</p><p>Under Biden, the US tried to boost its domestic electric vehicle industry, while also trying to get the sector to reduce dependence on China.</p><p>Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced incentives for US manufacturers that did not use any Chinese parts. The IRA also introduced subsidies for consumers who bought EVs, though these have largely been overturned by Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which became law in July.</p><p>Nevertheless, even with the Biden-era incentives, only one in 10 cars sold in the US in 2024 was electric, while more than half of all new cars sold last year in China were electric.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117288\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117288\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117288\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691da50293471-1763550466.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cape Town’s Arrowgate Depot, equipped with Autel Energy’s MaxiCharger DC Fast units, powering the city’s growing fleet of electric buses — the largest public EV bus charging hub in South Africa.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electric buses charge in Cape Town, South Africa [File: AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"not-just-cars\">Not just cars</h2><p>While electric cars grab most headlines on sustainable transport, people are also increasingly turning to electric bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, buses and even trains in many parts of the world.</p><p>Even in the US, says Jaeger, there has been a significant growth in the number of electric scooters and two-wheelers imported from China.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), the US imported $1.5bn worth of electric two-wheelers from China in the 12 months up to September 2025, an increase of $275m — or more than 20 percent — from the previous year. Experts say that is because scooters are cheaper than cars, and because US tariffs on Chinese electric scooters are also lower than on electric cars.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the government has said it will <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/vietnams-petrol-scooter-ban-for-hanoi-raises-fears-for-livelihoods\">ban petrol-powered motorbikes</a> in the centre of its capital, Hanoi, from July next year, as part of a plan to tackle local air pollution.</p><p>According to the IEA, some 40 percent of bus sales are now electric in European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway.</p><p>There have also been increases in electric bus sales in Central and South America. In Mexico, for example, “close to 18 percent of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1 percent in 2023”, according to the IEA.</p><p>Still, the US continues to struggle here, too. Electric bus sales declined in 2024, according to the IEA, after the leading electric bus manufacturer went bankrupt and a second company stopped manufacturing in the US market after suffering sustained financial losses.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117294\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117294\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117294\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/getty_691da60e4e-1763550734.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM - NOVEMBER 6: People ride motorbikes on a street as water levels reach the annual peak on November 6, 2025 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Speaking outside a mosque in the Bronx, Mamdani criticised opponents for bringing “hatred to the forefront”, noting that their Islamophobia not only affected him as the Democratic nominee for mayor but also <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/22/nyc-working-class-muslims-see-progress-in-mamdani-but-policies-win-votes\">close to one million Muslims</a> living in New York.</p><p>Earlier this week, Mamdani told reporters his team contacted the White House because he had made a “commitment that showed a willingness to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it is for the benefit” of New Yorkers.</p><p>“The president ran a campaign where he spoke about a promise to deliver cheaper groceries, a promise to reduce the cost of living,” Mamdani said. “We are seeing his actions … leading to the exact opposite effect for New Yorkers. I will go to make the case, to the president, and to anyone, frankly, that these are the kinds of things we need to change.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
