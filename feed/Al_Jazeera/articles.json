            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”.</p><p>The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”.</p><p>Although there are reports last week that these plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/14/us-military-plan-divided-gaza-green-zone\">were dropped</a>, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north.</p><p>If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza.  The purpose of creating these camps is not to provide humanitarian relief but to create zones of managed dispossession where Palestinians would be screened and vetted to enter in order to receive basic services, but would be explicitly barred from returning to the off-limits and blockaded “red zone”.</p><p>These plans represent a recycled version of what Israel has long wanted to do in Gaza. The creation of “bubbles” – an initial, telling euphemism that I first heard proposed by the Israeli authorities when I was part of coordinating humanitarian operations in Palestine as a United Nations official – was the first iteration of areas where Palestinians would be screened and would be conditioned to receive controlled assistance.</p><p>This is the grim reality of the so-called ceasefire deal in Gaza. It will not deliver peace; it will further shatter Gaza and the prospect for Palestinian sovereignty into pieces. If anything, it is a Gaza piece plan.</p><p>On Monday this week, the United Nations Security Council voted to legitimise the plan by endorsing a board of peace to manage Gaza and an international stabilisation force (ISF) to provide security. But what areas will these forces secure? There is no agreed-upon peace for these forces to keep. According to maps I have seen of the “alternative safe communities”, the ISF would be positioned along the yellow line and would secure these newly established camps.</p><p>Hamas has unsurprisingly rejected the UNSC resolution. It was obvious that its provisions were not the outcome of a negotiated agreement. In the 20-point Trump plan, which was attached as an annex to the <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2803(2025)\">resolution</a>, point 17 may now be invoked: “in the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operations, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF [Israeli army] to the ISF”. In this way, the “alternative safe communities” may become the only enabled aid delivery centres, thereby prolonging the total blockade on Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The deadly logic of evacuation orders that marked the past two years and which drove Palestinians out of their homes, is now being extended into the UNSC-endorsed plan. Those who remain outside of the alternative communities, in the “red zone”, risk being labelled “Hamas supporters” and therefore ineligible for protection under Israel’s warped interpretation of international law and subject to ongoing military operations, as already seen <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">in past days</a>.</p><p>The fate of Palestinians in the “red zone” remains conspicuously absent from official planning. In fact, humanitarian organisations capable of saving lives are <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/mounting-alarm-israeli-authorities-reject-ngo-applications-transport-life-saving-aid\">being squeezed out</a> by an Israeli registration process designed to stifle criticism and vet staff for compliance.</p><p>The model of contained communities is not entirely new. The British created “new villages” in Malaya in the 1950s, the Americans created “strategic hamlets” in Vietnam in the 1960s, and the colonial authorities in Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe) created “protected villages” in the 1970s during so-called “counter-insurgency”.</p><p>Civilian populations were coerced and forced into camps where they were screened in return for aid. The plan was to diminish popular support for resistance groups who were fighting colonial rule. It failed.</p><p>In South Africa, the apartheid government created bantustans, pseudo-independent homelands designed to concentrate and control the Black population. They also failed to prevent the collapse of a settler-colonial apartheid regime.</p><p>In Gaza, the peace plan that has been imposed rather than negotiated will leave Israel’s occupation not only intact but emboldened. The UNSC has endorsed something that goes against the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">rulings</a> of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs\">occupied Palestinian territory</a>, essentially whitewashing a genocidal crime scene and creating a monument to impunity.</p><p>All of this unfolds during a so-called ceasefire, in which Palestinians continue to be killed for crossing invisible lines drawn by an illegal occupation.</p><p>The world might hail this phase as an end to the war, and states reluctant to sanction Israel are undoubtedly relieved to revive trade and reduce public scrutiny.</p><p>Moving beyond this dangerous status quo will require the very accountability the US and Israel have worked hard to avoid: implementing the rulings of the ICJ. While Western powers hollow out these institutions, new political coalitions are needed to demand the equal application of international law. At its most basic level, this requires the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians wherever they are in the strip and Palestinian-led reconstruction that ensures Palestinians are not perpetually condemned to bare survival.</p><p>The precedent set in Gaza would not be contained within the fences of Gaza’s gated communities sealed by international forces: it would further erode the foundations of a so-called rules-based order.

Those remarks angered Beijing, which has demanded retractions, although the Japanese PM has not made one.</p><p>However, the spat has now rapidly escalated into a trade war involving businesses on both sides, and has deepened security tensions over a contested territory that has long been a flashpoint for the two countries.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the dispute:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4090755\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4090755\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4090755\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2022-04-15T080326Z_1647075303_RC2FLT91ABIR_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-JAPAN-RUSSIA-1762494738.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Scallops in yellow baskets next to a fishing boat at a port.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4090755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Japan has resumed seafood exports to China with a shipment of scallops from Hokkaido [File: Daniel Leussink/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-did-japan-s-pm-say-about-taiwan\">What did Japan’s PM say about Taiwan?</h2><p>While speaking to parliament on November 7, Taikachi, a longtime Taiwan supporter, said a Chinese naval blockade or other action against Taiwan could prompt a Japanese military response. The response was not typical, and Taikachi appeared to go several steps further than her predecessors, who had only in the past expressed concern about the Chinese threat to Taiwan, but had never mentioned a response.</p><p>“If it involves the use of warships and military actions, it could by all means become a survival-threatening situation,” Taikachi told parliament, responding to an opposition politician’s queries in her first parliamentary grilling.</p><p>That statement immediately raised protests from China’s foreign and defence ministries, which demanded retractions. China’s consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, a day after, criticised the comments and appeared to make threats in a now deleted post on X, saying: “We have no choice but to cut off that dirty neck that has been lunged at us without hesitation. Are you ready?”</p><p>That post by Xue also raised anger in Japan, and some officials began calling for the diplomat’s expulsion. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara protested to Beijing over Xue’s X message, saying it was “extremely inappropriate,” while urging China to explain. Japan’s Foreign Ministry also demanded the post be deleted. Chinese officials, meanwhile, defended the comments as coming from a personal standpoint.</p><p>On November 14, China’s Foreign Ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador and warned of a “crushing defeat” if Japan interfered with Taiwan. The following day, Japan’s Foreign Ministry also summoned the Chinese ambassador to complain about the consul’s post.</p><p>Although Taikachi told parliament three days after her controversial statement that she would avoid talking about specific scenarios going forward, she has refused to retract her comments.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-tensions-increased-since\">How have tensions increased since?</h2><p>The matter has deteriorated into a trade war of sorts. On November 14, China issued a no-travel advisory for Japan, an apparent attempt to target the country’s tourism sector, which welcomed some 7.5 million Chinese tourists between January and September this year. On November 15, three Chinese airlines offered refunds or free changes for flights planned on Japan-bound routes.</p><p>The Chinese Education Ministry also took aim at Japan’s education sector, warning Chinese students there or those planning to study in Japan about recent crimes against Chinese. Both China and Japan have recorded attacks against each other’s nationals in recent months that have prompted fears of xenophobia, but it is unclear if the attacks are linked.</p><p>Tensions are also rising around territorial disputes. Last Sunday, the Chinese coastguard announced it was patrolling areas in the East China Sea, in the waters around a group of uninhabited islands that both countries claim. Japan calls the islands the Senkaku Islands, while Beijing calls them the Diaoyu Islands. Japan, in response, condemned the brief “violation” of Japanese territorial waters by a fleet of four Chinese coastguard ships.</p><p>Over the last week, Chinese authorities have suspended the screening of at least two Japanese films and banned Japanese seafood.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, China postponed a three-way meeting with culture ministers from Japan and South Korea that was scheduled to be held in late November.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4064718\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4064718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4064718\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-21T141729Z_935378202_RC2C7GAVIAXC_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-POLITICS-1761604178.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"japan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4064718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks during a news conference at the prime minister’s office in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday, October 21, 2025 [Eugene Hoshiko/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"symbol-of-defiance\">‘Symbol of defiance’</h2><p>On November 18, diplomats from both sides met in Beijing for talks where the grievances were aired.</p><p>Senior Chinese official Liu Jinsong chose to wear a five-buttoned collarless suit associated with the rebellion of Chinese students against Japanese imperialism in 1919.</p><p>Japanese media have called the choice of the suit a “symbol of defiance.” They also point to videos and images from the meeting showing Liu with his hands in his pockets after the talks, saying the gesture is typically viewed as disrespectful in formal settings.</p><p>The Beijing meeting did not appear to ease the tensions, and there seems to be no sign of the impasse breaking: Chinese representatives asked for a retraction, but Japanese diplomats said Taikachi’s remarks were in line with Japan’s stance.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-history-of-sino-japanese-tensions\">What is the history of Sino-Japanese tensions?</h2><p>It’s a long and – especially for China – painful story. Imperial Japan occupied significant portions of China after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), when it gained control of Taiwan and forcefully annexed Korea. In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Amid strong Chinese resistance, Japan occupied parts of eastern and southern China, where it created and controlled puppet governments. The Japanese Empire’s defeat in World War II in 1945 ended its expansion bid.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party emerged victorious in 1949 in the civil war that followed with the Kuomintang, which, along with the leader Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan to set up a parallel government. But until 1972, Japan formally recognised Taiwan as “China”.</p><p>In 1972, it finally recognised the People’s Republic of China and agreed to the “one China principle”, in effect severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. However, Japan has maintained firm unofficial ties with Taiwan, including through trade.</p><p>Japan has also maintained a policy of so-called “strategic ambiguity” over how Tokyo would respond if China were to attack Taiwan — a policy of deliberate ambivalence, aimed at leaving Beijing and the rest of the world guessing over whether it would intervene militarily. The stance is similar to that of the United States, Taiwan’s most powerful ally.</p><h2 id=\"how-important-is-trade-between-china-and-japan\">How important is trade between China and Japan?</h2><p>He Yongqian, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry, said at a regular news conference this week that trade relations between the two countries had been “severely damaged” by PM Takaichi’s comments.</p><p>China is Japan’s second-largest export market after the US, with Tokyo selling mainly industrial equipment, semiconductors and automobiles to Beijing. In 2024, China bought about $125bn worth of Japanese goods, according to the United Nations’ Comtrade database. South Korea, Japan’s third-largest export market, bought goods worth $46bn in 2024.</p><p>China is also a major buyer of Japan’s sea cucumbers and its top scallop buyer. Japanese firms, particularly seafood exporters, are worried about the effects of the spat on their businesses, according to reporting by Reuters.</p><p>Beijing is not as reliant on Japan’s economy, but Tokyo is China’s third-largest trading partner. China mainly exports electrical equipment, machinery, apparel and vehicles to Japan. Tokyo bought $152bn worth of goods from China in 2024, according to financial data website Trading Economics.</p><p>It’s not the first time Beijing has retaliated with trade. In 2023, China imposed a ban on all Japanese food imports after Tokyo released radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific. Beijing was against the move, although the UN atomic energy agency had deemed the discharge safe. That ban was lifted just on November 7, the same day Taikachi made the controversial comments.</p><p>In 2010, China also halted the exports of rare earth minerals to Japan for seven weeks after a Chinese fishing captain was detained near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Bosnia’s top court upheld that ruling in early November.</p><p>In October, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska appointed Ana Trisic-Babic as an interim president until the Sunday election.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the vote, and why it matters.</p><h2 id=\"when-are-the-snap-republika-srpska-elections-taking-place\">When are the snap Republika Srpska elections taking place?</h2><p>According to Bosnia’s Central Election Commission (CIK), voting will be open on Sunday, November 23, between 7am (06:00 GMT) and 7pm (18:00 GMT). More than 1.2 million people, spanning the three main ethnic groups – Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats – are eligible to vote. Turnout in previous presidential elections has typically ranged between 50 percent and 55 percent.</p><p>Although Trisic-Babic was appointed as an interim president, the law still requires new elections within 90 days of a president’s removal.</p><p>The winner of Sunday’s election will serve only the remainder of Dodik’s term, less than a year, until next October’s general elections.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-the-results-be-announced\">When will the results be announced?</h2><p>Preliminary results are expected on election night, but the final official vote count by the Central Election Commission will be announced only after the body also validates all outcomes.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-INFO-CARD-1763656911.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-INFO-CARD-1763656911\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-republika-srpska\">What is Republika Srpska?</h2><p>Republika Srpska is one of two main political entities within Bosnia, along with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – each of which enjoys significant autonomy. The two share equal rights over a small, third self-governing administrative unit within the country, known as the Brcko District.</p><p>Republika Srpska was proclaimed by Bosnian Serb leaders in 1992 at the start of the 1992–95 war and was formally established as part of Bosnia’s post-war constitutional structure in 1995 under the Dayton peace agreement.</p><p>Republika Srpska covers about 49 percent of Bosnia’s territory, while the remaining 51 percent forms the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>Republika Srpska has its own government, parliament, judiciary and police, but not its own army.</p><p>Today, it is overwhelmingly Serb-populated, with Serbs making up approximately <a href=\"http://www.statistika.ba/?show=12&amp;id=29800\">82 percent of its residents</a>, alongside smaller Bosniak and Croat minorities, according to the latest census, which was held more than a decade ago in 2013.</p><p>Its demographics changed drastically during and after the war, and because of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMuk3t3NoTU\">the ethnic cleansing of non-Serb communities.</a> Before the conflict, Bosniaks and Croats made up about half of the population in the area that is now Republika Srpska; today, they account for less than 17 percent.</p><p>Its first president, Radovan Karadzic, has been sentenced to life in The Hague for the 1995 <a href=\"/the-srebrenica-genocide-as-it-happened-30-years-ago/\">genocide against Bosniaks</a> in Srebrenica, now a town inside Republika Srpska.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-are-the-elections-important\">Why are the elections important?</h2><p>The elections come at a highly sensitive time for Bosnia. Since Russia’s 2022 <a href=\"/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets\">invasion of Ukraine</a>, Republika Srpska has intensified its rhetoric to secede from Bosnia, with Dodik – a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin – increasingly calling for the entity to break away, potentially to join Serbia.</p><p>These elections will determine who replaces Dodik after his removal from office and his long dominance over Republika Srpska’s politics. The vote is also a test of how much influence he can still exert, despite being banned from political activity.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-candidates\">Who are the candidates?</h2><p>There are six candidates on the ballot, four nominated by Republika Srpska’s political parties, and two running as independents.</p><p>The main contenders are Sinisa Karan of Dodik’s ruling Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), who is directly backed by Dodik, and Branko Blanusa of the opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS).</p><p>Karan is a longtime member of Dodik’s inner circle and a former Republika Srpska interior minister. He serves as minister for scientific and technological development and higher education in the current Republika Srpska government.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/radna-grupa-secesija-republika-srpska/33282397.html\">Radio Free Europe</a>, he was part of a group ‘tasked’ to draft an SNSD plan for Republika Srpska to break away from Bosnia.</p><p>Analysts say Dodik sees Karan as an extension of his own power. Dodik has appeared prominently at Karan’s rallies.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120152\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-ELECTION-CANDIDATES-1763656914.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-ELECTION-CANDIDATES-1763656914\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Blanusa, the SDS candidate, is a member of the party’s Banja Luka City Committee and a professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Banja Luka.</p><p>The SDS, now the main opposition party in Republika Srpska, was originally led by Karadzic. It is also a Serb nationalist party and has long competed with Dodik’s SNSD for the same electorate.</p><p>While it is critical of Dodik’s style of governance and allegations of corruption, it broadly shares similar positions on key political issues, including relations with the capital Sarajevo and scepticism towards the international overseer of the peace agreement.</p><p>The other party-backed candidates are Nikola Lazarevic of the Ecological Party of Republika Srpska and Dragan Dokanovic of the Alliance for New Politics (SNP).</p><p>Two independents, Igor Gasevic and Slavko Dragicevic, are also on the ballot but have remained almost entirely outside the public eye.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-milorad-dodik\">Who is Milorad Dodik?</h2><p>Milorad Dodik, 66, is the former president of Republika Srpska.</p><p>Backed by Western governments in the late 1990s, he became the entity’s prime minister in 1998 and was seen as a promising alternative to the hardline nationalist leadership of genocide convict Karadzic and the then-ruling SDS, which dominated the post-war period. Then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described Dodik as “a breath of fresh air”, and both the United States and the United Kingdom placed their hopes in him as a more moderate future option.</p><p>He was among the first leaders in Republika Srpska to acknowledge the Srebrenica genocide. In a 2007 interview with a Bosnian television outlet, Dodik, the president of SNSD since its formation, said he knew “perfectly well what took place” and that “there was a genocide in Srebrenica”.</p><p>“That judgement was made by the court in The Hague, and that is an undeniable legal fact,” he said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120154\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-DODIC-1763656918.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-DODIC-1763656918\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>He has served three terms as president of Republika Srpska, holding two consecutive mandates from 2010 to 2018 and winning again in 2022. In 2018, he was elected as the Serb member of Bosnia’s three-member presidency.</p><p>During this period, however, Dodik adopted a far more nationalist stance, <a href=\"/news/2020/2/18/dodiks-repeated-calls-for-republika-srpska-secession-raise-alarm\">repeatedly calling</a> for the entity’s secession, and denying the Srebrenica genocide – going back on his own earlier admissions.</p><p>In 2023, Dodik signed two controversial bills that, in essence, said that decisions of the Dayton Agreement peace envoy and rulings of Bosnia’s constitutional court would not apply to Republika Srpska. The peace envoy and the constitutional court blocked those bills.</p><p>In March 2025, the constitutional court issued arrest warrants for Milorad Dodik and several of his allies on charges of undermining the constitutional order. But a month later, members of the Republika Srpska police blocked officers from the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) from entering the administrative centre of the Republika Srpska government to arrest Dodik, further intensifying tensions with Sarajevo.</p><p>In August, Bosnia’s electoral authorities stripped Dodik of the presidency and banned him from participating in politics. He, however, remains the president of the SNSD party and continues to be its most powerful figure.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122438\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122438\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25114435871080-1763779612.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A member of the Special Anti-terrorist unit of police of Republika Srpska stands guard during the opening ceremony of the rectory building in Istocno Sarajevo, Bosnia, Thursday, April 24, 2025.

Bosnia as a country relies on a power-sharing system in which the two entities are closely linked. Republika Srpska’s challenge against state institutions and the rise of secessionist threats can affect the stability of the country on the national level.</p><p>The early election also strains Bosnia’s economy. The vote is funded from the state budget, rather than the entity’s own institutions, in a country with <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp?continent=europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the smallest economies</a> in Europe. Bosnia’s Central Election Commission has allocated more than six million Bosnian marks (close to $4m) for the elections.</p><p>The UK government, one of the guarantors of  the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, said at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Bosnia in October that holding presidential elections in the Republika Srpska would give “an opportunity for formation of their new government,” insisting that “the constitutional order and rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be upheld”.</p><p>“We encourage a focus on constructive and cooperative politics, including between Bosnia and Herzegovina’s two entities,” Jennifer MacNaughtan, the UK representative, said at the meeting.</p><p>In October, Russia, a strong ally of Republika Srpska, praised the transfer of power from Dodik to interim president Babic, but had also said that the Office of the High Representative peace envoy (OHR) should be “permanently closed”, echoing Dodik’s stance.</p><p>In conversation with the media, the spokesperson of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, said the Russian Federation “wholeheartedly supports” the struggle of the leadership of Republika Srpska against “eroding fundamental principles” of the Dayton peace treaty.</p><p>The US has not officially commented on the elections, but the Department of the Treasury has recently <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/14/why-did-us-let-dodik-off-the-hook-and-hand-europes-ailing-heart-to-russia\">lifted sanctions</a> against Dodik, his family members and his allies, including the SNDS candidate Karan, for undermining the Dayton peace agreement. Bosnia’s Serb officials have suggested they were quietly seeking a more cooperative relationship with the US, while still preserving their friendly ties with Russia.</p><p>Republika Srpska’s strongest ally, Serbia, has taken a more cautious stance than usual. In an interview with the state-owned Radio Television of Serbia, Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic – who has faced <a href=\"/news/2025/9/14/political-crisis-rumbles-in-serbia-as-duelling-camps-hold-parallel-rallies\">antigovernment protests</a> that have shaken the country for almost a year now – avoided commenting on the elections directly. He said he wished “all the best” to Republika Srpska and hoped everything would “pass peacefully”. He added that Serbia would always be there to help with “infrastructure”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-possible-scenarios-after-the-election\">What are the possible scenarios after the election?</h2><p>If SNSD’s Karan wins, the entity would likely remain under Dodik’s influence. Speaking to Euronews Serbia, Karan said the vote had been “forced” onto Republika Srpska by the peace envoy Schmidt and that a vote for him is “a vote for President Dodik”.</p><p>The ruling SNSD also holds a strong majority in the National Assembly of Republika Srpska.</p><p>Blanusa, from the opposition SDS party, told local BN television that Republika Srpska, under the current leadership, has become “impoverished, displaced and isolated”, and has pledged to make tackling corruption in the entity his main goal.</p><p>Indeed, the entity faces deep economic challenges. According to the <a href=\"https://www.irbrs.net/statistika/UporedniPrikaz.aspx?tab=3&amp;lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Database of Economic Indicators of Republika Srpska</a>, total gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023 was about 16 billion Bosnian marks (about $9bn), half of the GDP of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – and so, a third of the national economy.</p><p>The election verdict could also offer clues to political trends ahead of next year’s October elections, which could determine who rules the entity for another four years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has caricatured Mamdani as an anti-Semitic communist, even threatening to strip him of his US citizenship, while Mamdani called Trump a “despot” in his election victory speech just weeks ago.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But the pair appeared to put these seemingly irrevocable differences aside – for one day at least – with Trump describing the “great meeting” as “really productive” when talking to reporters in the Oval Office with Mamdani standing by his side.</p><p>With many left unsure of what to make of the bizarrely chummy meeting between the political polar opposites, here are a few key takeaways:</p><h2 id=\"finding-common-ground\">Finding common ground</h2><p>Trump and Mamdani exuded friendliness in their first get-together since the 34-year-old beat Democratic establishment party figures earlier this month, notably former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, to become New York City’s mayor-elect.</p><p>Mamdani said ahead of his meeting with Trump that he was willing to “meet with anyone” to push forward his affordability agenda for the US’s largest city, saying that he and Trump shared some common ground in that they ran campaigns focused on the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>“I will speak to everyone so long as it could stand to benefit an economic agenda for New Yorkers. And that’s where I will always make the case,” he said.</p><p>The approach appears to have paid off, with Trump saying he and Mamdani “agree on a lot more than I would have thought”, as he predicted success for his tenure leading New York.</p><p>“Some of his ideas are the same ideas I have,” said Trump, adding that some of his supporters also voted for Mamdani, who pitched in, saying “one in 10”.</p><p>Trump said of Mamdani: “He wants to have a safe New York, and ultimately, a safe New York in a great New York.” Later in the media conference, Trump doubled down on how Mamdani was keen to fight crime — echoing the emphasis on strong law enforcement that is a traditional Republican focus.</p><p>The US president also suggested that he agreed with Mamdani on housing.</p><p>“He said some very interesting things. He wants to see houses go up, a lot of apartments built,” Trump said. “People would be shocked, but I want to see the same thing.”</p><p>“I want to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump said. “A big help”.</p><h2 id=\"praise-and-banter\">Praise and banter</h2><p>But the apparent camaraderie extended beyond policy issues, with Trump also repeatedly praising Mamdani.</p><p>“I think this mayor can do some things that are going to be really great,” he said at one point.</p><p>At another point, Trump said: “The better he does, the happier I am. I feel very confident that he can do a very good job.”</p><p>Trump spoke of Mamdani’s election campaign and how he went from just 1 percent in the polls to upsetting Cuomo, first in the Democratic Party’s primary and then in the actual election. “It’s an amazing thing that he did,” the president said.</p><p>A reporter asked Trump if he would be comfortable living in New York City under Mamdani’s mayorship.</p><p>“Yeah, I would, I really would,” Trump responded instantly. “Especially after the meeting. Absolutely.”</p><p>Towards the end of the media conference, Trump described his impression of Mamdani after their meeting.</p><p>“I met with a man who is a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before.”</p><p>In one striking moment, Trump even gave Mamdani an easy out when the mayor-elect was asked by a reporter if he stood by his previous comments describing the president as a “despot” and “fascist”.</p><p>“That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’,” Trump interjected. “It’s easier than explaining it.”</p><p>While striking a respectful tone when talking about Trump, Mamdani appeared to draw the line at actively praising him, with the compliments largely flowing one way.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"breaking-from-white-house-and-gop-messaging\">Breaking from White House and GOP messaging</h2><p>If the plan was to pivot away from boogeyman characterisations of Mamdani, key members of Trump’s administration and the Republican party weren’t given the message.</p><p>A day before the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that it “speaks volumes” that a “communist” was visiting the White House.</p><p>“That’s who the Democratic Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” she said.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance also joked on Thursday that he might “have a stomach bug” to avoid meeting Mamdani, who is set to take office on the first day of 2026.</p><p>Republican Senator Rick Scott also derided Mamdani as a “literal communist” on Friday morning, as he predicted Trump would “school” him at the White House later that day.</p><p>Trump, however, stayed away from any aggressive talk towards Mamdani, even going as far as to contradict members of his own party when he told reporters that he did not agree with Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik’s characterisation of Mamdani as a “jihadist”.</p><p>Following Trump’s comments, Stefanik, a New York Republican gubernatorial candidate, said, “We’ll have to agree to disagree on this one.”</p><p>“If he walks like a jihadist, If he talks like a jihadist, If he campaigns like a jihadist, If he supports jihadists, He’s a jihadist,” she wrote on X.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Why Trump took a more conciliatory approach in this meeting, starkly breaking from previous Republican messaging on Mamdani, is impossible to tell.</p><p>But the meeting and the talk of affordability as a shared concern occurred at a time when Trump faces growing scrutiny over rising prices following months of tariffs.</p><p>Major schisms have appeared in the Republican party and the Trump MAGA movement in recent days and weeks – notably <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">over the Epstein files scandal</a> and over US support for Israel. On Friday, Republican Congresswoman <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, for long one of Trump’s staunchest supporters, and a champion of the MAGA movement, said she would resign from the House of Representatives in January, after a public clash with the US president.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sidestepping-israel\">Sidestepping Israel</h2><p>One topic which which raised the spectre of creating a more awkward, confrontational atmosphere between Trump and Mamdani was <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza</a>.</p><p>Asked by a reporter about previous comments he had made about the US government’s complicity in Israel’s assault, including the current administration, Mamdani didn’t shy away from reiterating this criticism – despite an awkward-looking Trump sitting silently next to him.</p><p>“I have spoken about the Israeli government committing genocide [in Gaza] and I’ve spoken about our government funding it,” he said. It is the first known occasion that Israel has been accused of genocide in Gaza within the walls of the White House, even if from an opponent of the current administration.</p><p>Mamdani, however, quickly pivoted back to his core message of the cost-of-living crisis in New York.</p><p>“I shared with the president in our meeting about the concerns that many New Yorkers have of wanting their tax dollars to go towards the benefit of New Yorkers and their ability to afford basic dignity,” he said.</p><p>“I also believe that we have to follow through on international human rights, and I know that still today those are being violated,” Mamdani added, without mentioning Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
