            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-06-25T155230Z_484322823_RC2L9FAY1EHX_RTRMADP_3_KENYA-SECURITY-PROTESTS-ANNIVERSARY-1753711764.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In Kenya, as in many countries across the world, street protests are often framed as the unfortunate result of political failure. As the logic goes, the inability of state institutions to translate popular sentiment into political, legislative and regulatory action to address grievances undermines trust and leaves the streets vulnerable to eruptions of popular discontent.</p><p>In this telling, protests are viewed as a political problem with grievances expected to be legitimately addressed using the mechanisms – coercive or consensual – of the formal political system.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the increasingly paranoid regime of Kenyan President William Ruto has also adopted this view. While generally acknowledging the constitutional right of protest, it has sought to paint the largely peaceful and sustained Generation Z demonstrations and agitation of the past 16 months, which have questioned its rule and policies, as a threat to public order and safety and to delegitimise the street as an avenue for addressing public issues.</p><p>“What is going on in these streets, people think is fashionable,” <a href=\"https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-responds-to-ruto-must-go-calls-urges-critics-to-offer-solutions-instead/\">Ruto declared a month ago</a>. “They take selfies and post on social media. But I want to tell you, if we continue this way, … we will not have a country.”</p><p>The killing and abductions of protesters as well as the move to charge them with “terrorism” offences, borrowing a leaf from Western governments that have similarly criminalised pro-Palestinian and antigenocide sentiments, are clear examples of the state’s preferred response. At the same time, there have been repeated calls for the protesters to enter into talks with the regime and, more recently, for an “<a href=\"https://www.citizen.digital/news/saba-saba-raila-wants-national-conclave-formed-to-address-grievances-n365889\">intergenerational national conclave</a>” to address their concerns.</p><p>But framing protests as a dangerous response to political dissatisfaction is flawed. Demonstrations are an expression of democracy, not the result of its failures. The Generation Z movement has shown that transparency, mutual aid and political consciousness can thrive outside formal institutions. Activists have made the streets and online forums sites of grievance, rigorous debate, civic education, and policy engagement.</p><p>They have raised funds, provided medical and legal aid, and supported bereaved families, all without help from the state or international donors. In doing so, they have reminded the country that citizenship is not just about casting ballots every five years. It is about showing up – together, creatively and courageously – to shape the future.</p><p>The Generation Z movement is in many respects a reincarnation of the reform movement of the 1990s when Kenyans waged a decadelong street-based struggle against the brutal dictatorship of President Daniel arap Moi. Today’s defiant chants of “Ruto must go” and “Wantam” – the demand that Ruto be denied a second term in the 2027 election – echo the rallying cries from 30 years ago: “Moi must go” and “Yote yawezekana bila Moi (All is possible without Moi).”</p><p>Centring the struggle on Moi was a potent political strategy. It united a broad coalition, drew international attention and forced critical concessions – from the reintroduction of multiparty politics and term limits to the expansion of civil liberties and, crucially, the rights of assembly and expression.</p><p>By the time Moi left office at the end of 2002, Kenya was arguably at its freest, its spirit immortalised in the Gidi Gidi Maji Maji hit I Am Unbwogable! (I Am Unshakable and Indomitable!)” But that moment of triumph also masked a deeper danger: the illusion that removing a leader was the same as transforming the system.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Moi’s successor, Mwai Kibaki, hailed then as a reformist and gentleman of Kenyan politics, quickly set about reversing hard-won gains. His government blocked (then tried to subvert) constitutional reform, raided newsrooms and eventually presided over a stolen election that brought Kenya to the brink of civil war.</p><p>One of his closest ministers, the late John Michuki, had in 2003 revealed the true mindset of the political class: Constitutional change to devolve the power of the presidency, <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/the-standard/article/2001457975/intrigues-that-shattered-the-kibaki-raila-dream?started=true\">he claimed</a>, was necessary only so “one of our own could share power with Moi”. Once Moi was gone, he averred, there was no longer need for it.</p><p>Due to the obstruction from the political class, it took Kenyans close to a decade after Moi’s departure to finally promulgate a new constitution.</p><p>Generation Z must avoid the trap of the transition of the 2000s. Power, in the Kenyan political imagination, has often been the prize, not the problem. But real change requires more than a reshuffling of names atop the state. It demands a refusal to treat state power as the destination and a commitment to reshaping the terrain on which that power operates. And this is where the youth should beware the machinations of a political class that is more interested in power than in change.</p><p>Today’s calls for national talks and intergenerational conclaves emanating from this class should be treated with suspicion. Kenyans have seen this play out before. From the 1997 Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group talks and the negotiations brokered by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan after the 2007-2008 postelection violence to the infamous “handshake” between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival Raila Odinga and the failed Building Bridges Initiative, each of these elite pacts was presented as a way to translate popular anger into meaningful reform. Yet time and again, they only served to defuse movements, sideline dissenters and protect entrenched power.</p><p>Worse still, Kenya has a long history of elevating reformers – from opposition leaders and journalists to civil society activists – into positions of state power, only for them to abandon their principles once at the top. Radical rhetoric gives way to political compromise. The goal becomes to rule and extract, not transform. Many end up defending the very systems they once opposed.</p><p>“Ruto must go” is a powerful tactic for mobilisation and pressure. But it should not be seen as the end goal. That was my generation’s mistake. We forgot that we did not achieve the freedoms we enjoy – and that Ruto seeks to roll back – through engaging in the formal system’s rituals of elections and elite agreements but by imposing change on it from the outside. We allowed the politicians to hijack the street movements and reframe power and elite consensus as the solution, not the problem.</p><p>Generation Z must learn from that failure. Its focus must relentlessly be on undoing the system that enables and sustains oppression, not feeding reformers into it. And the streets must remain a legitimate space of powerful political participation, not one to be pacified or criminalised. For its challenge to formal state power is not a threat to democracy. It is democracy.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They said their children have been starving for days, and they do not have any other option than jumping on these trucks,” Khoudary said.</p><p>“This shows how desperate Palestinians are and how they were deprived of their basic necessities. Now we are expecting more trucks to enter today.”</p><p>Israel’s decision to allow more aid into Gaza has been welcomed by the UN, but officials warned that severe restrictions continued to block lifesaving deliveries.</p><p>“This is a welcome step in the right direction,” Tom Fletcher, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But clearly, we need to get in vast amounts of aid at a much, much greater scale than we’ve been able to do so far.”</p><p>Fletcher said deliveries overall have been just “a drop in the ocean” of what is needed.</p><p>“We can’t just simply turn up and drive through. That’s what we should be allowed to do, that’s what international law demands, but we’re not yet at that point,” he said, citing ongoing security risks, closed crossings, visa rejections and customs delays.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As the hunger crisis deepens, Israeli forces have continued to launch attacks across Gaza, killing at least 65 people on Monday, including 23 who were seeking aid, medical sources told Al Jazeera.</p><p>More than 1,000 Palestinians seeking aid have been killed by Israeli forces near distribution sites run by the US- and Israeli-backed GHF, which launched operations in late May.</p><p>The GHF has been heavily criticised by the UN and other humanitarian organisations for failing to provide enough aid and for the dire security situation at and around its aid distribution sites.</p><p>Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said: “What Israel describes as ‘humanitarian pauses’ are, in fact, limited and seen as unilateral suspensions of military activities that usually last for a few hours and are confined to select areas,” Abu Azzoum said.</p><p>“These pauses, as we have seen, lack international oversight or any sort of coordination with humanitarian agencies,” he said.</p><p>Rejecting international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli army has conducted its offensive on Gaza since October 7, 2023, the day Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel killed 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people being taken captive.</p><p>The war has since killed nearly 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.</p><p>Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for its war on the enclave.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In a couple of weeks, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the biggest hydroelectric dam on the African continent, will be inaugurated. The construction of this dam has taken more than a decade and has cost nearly $5bn. The government and people of Ethiopia mobilised the funds for this national project from their meagre internal resources. No international financing was made available for this project.</p><p>While the construction of the dam has received some international media attention, the media coverage has not made clear the Ethiopian perspective. This is a modest attempt to rectify that problem.</p><p>The GERD is constructed on the Blue Nile, which Ethiopians call Abay. Abay means “big” or “major” in several Ethiopian languages. Abay is one of the main tributaries of the Nile River. Although many associate the Nile almost exclusively with Egypt, the river traverses 10 other African countries. Among these countries, Ethiopia holds a unique position because 86 percent of the Nile water that reaches Egypt originates from the Ethiopian highlands.</p><p>Abay is the biggest river in Ethiopia with a huge potential to boost overall socioeconomic transformation and development. It has been a long-held aspiration of Ethiopians to utilise this resource. The GERD is a national development project that fulfils this dream.</p><p>Despite its huge labour force and economic potential, Ethiopia has yet to make headway in its endeavour to industrialise. One critical factor that has held back this effort has been Ethiopia’s lack of energy. According to the latest figures, barely 55 percent of Ethiopians have access to electricity.</p><p>There is a huge demand and need for electricity in Ethiopia. Hence, the GERD is seen as our national ticket out of darkness and poverty. Necessity dictates that Ethiopia use this major resource as an instrument to spur growth and prosperity for the benefit of its 130-million-strong population, which is expected to reach 200 million by 2050.</p><p>The GERD is expected to generate about 5,150 megawatts of electricity and produce an annual energy output of 15,760 gigawatt hours. This will double Ethiopia’s energy output, which will not only light our homes but also power industries and cities and transform our economy. The GERD would also make it possible to increase our energy exports to neighbouring countries, thereby strengthening regional integration and interconnectedness.</p><p>The lower riparian states of the Nile would also derive immense benefit from the GERD because it would prevent flooding, sedimentation and water loss through evaporation. The very purpose of the GERD, which is generating electricity, requires that the water flows to lower riparian countries after hitting the enormous turbines that generate the electricity. The dam does not block or stop the river from flowing. Doing so would make electricity generation impossible and defeat the very purpose for which the dam was built.</p><p>So, you might ask, why are some lower riparian countries complaining about the construction of the dam? The reason for their objections emanates not from rational fear or legitimate concern. The objections are the result of an attitude shaped by a colonial-era water-sharing agreement concluded between Britain and Egypt in 1929 and its derivative agreement sealed in 1959 between Egypt and Sudan.</p><p>Ethiopia was not a party to any of these treaties. However, some Egyptians contend that the water-sharing formula enshrined in the colonial-era agreement, which excludes the remaining nine African nations from having any share of the Nile, is still valid and should be adhered to by all Nile riparian countries.</p><p>From an Ethiopian point of view, this anachronistic argument, often presented as “historic rights over the Nile” is unacceptable. While Britain is entitled to enter into any agreements regarding the River Thames, it does not have the right to dispose of the waters of the Nile or the Abay River. As we all recall, the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser rejected Britain’s claims over the Suez Canal. For much stronger reasons, Ethiopian leaders have consistently rejected arguments based on colonial arrangements in which Ethiopia did not have a say.</p><p>The Ethiopian view is that the Nile is a shared natural resource. It should be used in a cooperative framework that would be beneficial for all riparian countries. The developmental aspirations and dreams of all nations are equally legitimate. The needs of some should not be prioritised over the needs of others.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A fair, just and inclusive arrangement that takes into account the realities of the 21st century is needed. Such an arrangement is already in place in the form of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement, which is a contemporary, African-initiated treaty designed to promote sustainable management and equitable use of the Nile. This treaty has already been signed and ratified by Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.</p><p>Egypt should stop yearning for a bygone colonial era and join these Nile riparian countries in their joint effort to promote fair and equitable use of the Nile in a sustainable manner.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that details of the deal remained to be worked out, and that “the EU Commission and the German government are now fully committed to this.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h3 id=\"hungary\">Hungary</h3><p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban slammed the deal. “This is not an agreement … Donald Trump ate von der Leyen for breakfast, this is what happened, and we suspected this would happen as the US president is a heavyweight when it comes to negotiations, while Madame President is featherweight,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"ireland\">Ireland</h3><p>Irish Trade Minister Simon Harris said the deal provides a “measure of much-needed certainty for Irish, European and American businesses who together represent the most integrated trading relationship in the world”.</p><p>“While Ireland regrets that the baseline tariff of 15 percent is included in the agreement, it is important that we now have more certainty on the foundations for the EU-US trade relationship, which is essential for jobs, growth and investment,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"italy\">Italy</h3><p>“I consider it positive that there is an agreement, but if I don’t see the details, I am not able to judge it in the best way,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Speaking at a summit in Ethiopia, she said a “trade escalation between Europe and the United States would have had unpredictable and potentially devastating consequences”.</p><p>Meloni – a Trump ally on many issues – had warned earlier this month against a “trade war within the West”.</p><h3 id=\"romania\">Romania</h3><p>In a statement, the Romanian government’s press office said Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan “salutes that a trade agreement was reached and … feels it is a good omen”. “It eliminates present unclearness which caused disruptions and uncertainties in transatlantic trade relations,” it said.</p><h3 id=\"spain\">Spain</h3><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he backed the deal but “without any enthusiasm”.</p><p>“I value the constructive and negotiating attitude of the president of the European Commission. In any case, I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any enthusiasm,” he told a news conference.</p><h3 id=\"sweden\">Sweden</h3><p>“This agreement does not make anyone richer, but it may be the least bad alternative. What appears to be positive for Sweden, based on an initial assessment, is that the agreement creates some predictability,” said Swedish Trade Minister Benjamin Dousa.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It also pledged to open designated aid corridors for food and medical convoys between 6am and 11pm.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p data-start=\"1618\" data-end=\"1792\">But hours into the first day of the “humanitarian pauses”, Israeli air raids resumed.</p><p data-start=\"1794\" data-end=\"2101\">“There was an air strike on Gaza City, and this is one of the areas that was designated as a safe area, and where the Israeli forces are going to halt their military operations,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary reported from Deir el-Balah.</p><p data-start=\"1794\" data-end=\"2101\">“According to Palestinians in that area, a bakery was targeted.”</p><p data-start=\"2103\" data-end=\"2281\">The bombardment comes as global outcry grows over the worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza inflicted by Israel.</p><h2 id=\"famine-deaths-rise\" data-start=\"2283\" data-end=\"2305\">Famine deaths rise</h2><p data-start=\"2307\" data-end=\"2605\">Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported that six more Palestinians, including two children, died from hunger-related causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the number of starvation deaths to 133 since October 2023.</p><p data-start=\"2307\" data-end=\"2605\">Among the dead was five-month-old Zainab Abu Haleeb, who succumbed to malnutrition at Nasser Hospital.</p><p data-start=\"2607\" data-end=\"2800\">“Three months inside the hospital, and this is what I get in return, that she is dead,” said her mother, Israa Abu Haleeb, as the child’s father cradled her small body wrapped in a white shroud.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2802\" data-end=\"3100\">The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Sunday that one in three Gaza residents has gone days without eating, and nearly 500,000 people are suffering from “famine-like conditions”. The World Health Organization also warned last week that more than 20 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women are malnourished.</p><p data-start=\"3102\" data-end=\"3443\">Falestine Ahmed, a mother in Gaza, told Al Jazeera she lost one-third of her body weight.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"3102\" data-end=\"3443\">“I used to weigh 57kg [126 pounds], now I weigh 42kg [93 pounds], and both my son and I have been diagnosed with severe malnutrition,” she said. “We barely have any food at home, and even when it’s available, it’s far too expensive for us to afford.”</p><p data-start=\"3445\" data-end=\"3625\">Israel has authorised new corridors for aid, while the United Arab Emirates and Jordan have airdropped supplies into the territory. However, deliveries have been fraught with danger and are far too few.</p><p data-start=\"3445\" data-end=\"3625\">Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported that one aid drop injured nearly a dozen people. “Eleven people were reported with injuries as one of these pallets fell directly on tents in that displacement site near al-Rasheed Road.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3860017\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3860017\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3860017\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25207438726734-1753623386.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen, in Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Saturday, July 26, 2025 [Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Photo]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3860017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Gaza City [Abdel Kareem Hana/AP]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"3836\" data-end=\"4007\">Despite the mounting evidence of extreme hunger, Israel continues to deny that famine exists in Gaza.

They haven’t eaten for a week,” said Smoud Wahdan, a mother searching for flour, speaking to Al Jazeera. “At the very least, I’ve been looking for a piece of bread for my children.”</p><p data-start=\"4280\" data-end=\"4511\">Another displaced mother, Tahani, said that her cancer-stricken child was among those suffering. “I came to get flour, to look for food to feed my children.

However, he added that Australia was not ready to recognise Palestinian statehood “imminently”.</p><p data-start=\"6767\" data-end=\"6904\">In the United States, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that ceasefire talks led by President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, are making “a lot of progress”.</p><p data-start=\"6906\" data-end=\"7085\">“We’re optimistic and hopeful that any day now, we will have a ceasefire agreement,” Rubio told Fox News, suggesting that half of the remaining Israeli captives may be released soon.</p><p data-start=\"7110\" data-end=\"7232\">Gaza’s Health Ministry said that 88 Palestinians were killed and 374 wounded in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours alone.</p><p data-start=\"7234\" data-end=\"7429\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October, at least 59,821 Palestinians have been killed and more than 144,000 injured.</p><p data-start=\"7234\" data-end=\"7429\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Despite talk of pauses and diplomacy, the violence continues to escalate.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
