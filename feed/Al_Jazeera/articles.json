on developed nations to “at least triple” the money given to developing countries to help them withstand extreme weather events.</p><p>It also urges “all actors to work together to significantly accelerate and scale up climate action worldwide” with the aim of keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) mark for global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “within reach”.</p><p>Wopke Hoekstra, the European Union’s climate commissioner, said the outcome was a step in the right direction, but the bloc would have liked more.</p><p>“We’re

largest drivers of the climate crisis – that drew opposition from oil-producing countries and nations that depend on oil, gas and coal.</p><p>Questions of <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/20/to-close-the-climate-finance-gap-let-vulnerable-nations-use-carbon-markets\">climate finance</a> also sparked heated debates, with developing nations demanding that richer countries bear a greater share of the financial burden.</p><p>But COP30 host Brazil had pushed for a show of unity, as the annual conference is largely viewed as a test of the world’s resolve to address a deepening crisis.</p><p>“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/brazils-lula-faces-obstacles-in-push-for-agreement-at-climate-summit\">said earlier this week</a>.</p><p>Speaking during Saturday afternoon’s closing session in Belem, COP30 President Andre Aranha Correa do Lago acknowledged that several countries as well as civil society groups “had greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand”.</p><p>“As President Lula said at the opening of this COP, we need roadmaps so that humanity – in a just and planned manner – can overcome its dependence on fossil fuels, halt and <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/8/25/the-take-how-did-lula-da-silva-cut-amazon-deforestation-in-half\">reverse deforestation</a> and mobilise resources for these purposes,” Correa do Lago said.</p><p>“I, as president of COP30, will therefore create two roadmaps: One on halting and reverting [reversing] deforestation and another to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner,” he said, spurring a round of applause from delegates.</p><p>Correa do Lago also added that the first international conference on the phase-out of fossil fuels is scheduled to take place in Colombia in April.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera before the draft text was released, Asad Rehman, chief executive director of Friends of the Earth, said <a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/two-thirds-of-global-warming-caused-by-worlds-richest-10-study-finds\">richer countries</a> “had to be dragged – really kicking and screaming – to the table” at COP30.</p><p>“They have tried to bully developing countries and have weakened the text … But I would say that, overall, from what we’re hearing, we will have taken a step forward,” Rehman said in an interview from Belem.</p><p>“This will be welcomed by the millions of people for whom these talks are a matter of life and death. However, in the scale of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un\">the crisis that we face</a>, we of course needed a giant leap forward.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”.</p><p>The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”.</p><p>Although there are reports last week that these plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/14/us-military-plan-divided-gaza-green-zone\">were dropped</a>, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north.</p><p>If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza.  The purpose of creating these camps is not to provide humanitarian relief but to create zones of managed dispossession where Palestinians would be screened and vetted to enter in order to receive basic services, but would be explicitly barred from returning to the off-limits and blockaded “red zone”.</p><p>These plans represent a recycled version of what Israel has long wanted to do in Gaza. The creation of “bubbles” – an initial, telling euphemism that I first heard proposed by the Israeli authorities when I was part of coordinating humanitarian operations in Palestine as a United Nations official – was the first iteration of areas where Palestinians would be screened and would be conditioned to receive controlled assistance.</p><p>This is the grim reality of the so-called ceasefire deal in Gaza. It will not deliver peace; it will further shatter Gaza and the prospect for Palestinian sovereignty into pieces. If anything, it is a Gaza piece plan.</p><p>On Monday this week, the United Nations Security Council voted to legitimise the plan by endorsing a board of peace to manage Gaza and an international stabilisation force (ISF) to provide security. But what areas will these forces secure? There is no agreed-upon peace for these forces to keep. According to maps I have seen of the “alternative safe communities”, the ISF would be positioned along the yellow line and would secure these newly established camps.</p><p>Hamas has unsurprisingly rejected the UNSC resolution. It was obvious that its provisions were not the outcome of a negotiated agreement. In the 20-point Trump plan, which was attached as an annex to the <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2803(2025)\">resolution</a>, point 17 may now be invoked: “in the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operations, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF [Israeli army] to the ISF”. In this way, the “alternative safe communities” may become the only enabled aid delivery centres, thereby prolonging the total blockade on Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The deadly logic of evacuation orders that marked the past two years and which drove Palestinians out of their homes, is now being extended into the UNSC-endorsed plan. Those who remain outside of the alternative communities, in the “red zone”, risk being labelled “Hamas supporters” and therefore ineligible for protection under Israel’s warped interpretation of international law and subject to ongoing military operations, as already seen <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">in past days</a>.</p><p>The fate of Palestinians in the “red zone” remains conspicuously absent from official planning. In fact, humanitarian organisations capable of saving lives are <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/mounting-alarm-israeli-authorities-reject-ngo-applications-transport-life-saving-aid\">being squeezed out</a> by an Israeli registration process designed to stifle criticism and vet staff for compliance.</p><p>The model of contained communities is not entirely new. The British created “new villages” in Malaya in the 1950s, the Americans created “strategic hamlets” in Vietnam in the 1960s, and the colonial authorities in Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe) created “protected villages” in the 1970s during so-called “counter-insurgency”.</p><p>Civilian populations were coerced and forced into camps where they were screened in return for aid. The plan was to diminish popular support for resistance groups who were fighting colonial rule. It failed.</p><p>In South Africa, the apartheid government created bantustans, pseudo-independent homelands designed to concentrate and control the Black population. They also failed to prevent the collapse of a settler-colonial apartheid regime.</p><p>In Gaza, the peace plan that has been imposed rather than negotiated will leave Israel’s occupation not only intact but emboldened. The UNSC has endorsed something that goes against the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">rulings</a> of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs\">occupied Palestinian territory</a>, essentially whitewashing a genocidal crime scene and creating a monument to impunity.</p><p>All of this unfolds during a so-called ceasefire, in which Palestinians continue to be killed for crossing invisible lines drawn by an illegal occupation.</p><p>The world might hail this phase as an end to the war, and states reluctant to sanction Israel are undoubtedly relieved to revive trade and reduce public scrutiny.</p><p>Moving beyond this dangerous status quo will require the very accountability the US and Israel have worked hard to avoid: implementing the rulings of the ICJ. While Western powers hollow out these institutions, new political coalitions are needed to demand the equal application of international law. At its most basic level, this requires the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians wherever they are in the strip and Palestinian-led reconstruction that ensures Palestinians are not perpetually condemned to bare survival.</p><p>The precedent set in Gaza would not be contained within the fences of Gaza’s gated communities sealed by international forces: it would further erode the foundations of a so-called rules-based order. The only way forward is a return to the principle this entire process has so far ignored: the inalienable right of a people to determine their own future.</p><p><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Those remarks angered Beijing, which has demanded retractions, although the Japanese PM has not made one.</p><p>However, the spat has now rapidly escalated into a trade war involving businesses on both sides, and has deepened security tensions over a contested territory that has long been a flashpoint for the two countries.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the dispute:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4090755\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4090755\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4090755\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2022-04-15T080326Z_1647075303_RC2FLT91ABIR_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-JAPAN-RUSSIA-1762494738.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Scallops in yellow baskets next to a fishing boat at a port.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4090755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Japan has resumed seafood exports to China with a shipment of scallops from Hokkaido [File: Daniel Leussink/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-did-japan-s-pm-say-about-taiwan\">What did Japan’s PM say about Taiwan?</h2><p>While speaking to parliament on November 7, Taikachi, a longtime Taiwan supporter, said a Chinese naval blockade or other action against Taiwan could prompt a Japanese military response. The response was not typical, and Taikachi appeared to go several steps further than her predecessors, who had only in the past expressed concern about the Chinese threat to Taiwan, but had never mentioned a response.</p><p>“If it involves the use of warships and military actions, it could by all means become a survival-threatening situation,” Taikachi told parliament, responding to an opposition politician’s queries in her first parliamentary grilling.</p><p>That statement immediately raised protests from China’s foreign and defence ministries, which demanded retractions. China’s consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian, a day after, criticised the comments and appeared to make threats in a now deleted post on X, saying: “We have no choice but to cut off that dirty neck that has been lunged at us without hesitation. Are you ready?”</p><p>That post by Xue also raised anger in Japan, and some officials began calling for the diplomat’s expulsion. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara protested to Beijing over Xue’s X message, saying it was “extremely inappropriate,” while urging China to explain. Japan’s Foreign Ministry also demanded the post be deleted. Chinese officials, meanwhile, defended the comments as coming from a personal standpoint.</p><p>On November 14, China’s Foreign Ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador and warned of a “crushing defeat” if Japan interfered with Taiwan. The following day, Japan’s Foreign Ministry also summoned the Chinese ambassador to complain about the consul’s post.</p><p>Although Taikachi told parliament three days after her controversial statement that she would avoid talking about specific scenarios going forward, she has refused to retract her comments.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-tensions-increased-since\">How have tensions increased since?</h2><p>The matter has deteriorated into a trade war of sorts. On November 14, China issued a no-travel advisory for Japan, an apparent attempt to target the country’s tourism sector, which welcomed some 7.5 million Chinese tourists between January and September this year. On November 15, three Chinese airlines offered refunds or free changes for flights planned on Japan-bound routes.</p><p>The Chinese Education Ministry also took aim at Japan’s education sector, warning Chinese students there or those planning to study in Japan about recent crimes against Chinese. Both China and Japan have recorded attacks against each other’s nationals in recent months that have prompted fears of xenophobia, but it is unclear if the attacks are linked.</p><p>Tensions are also rising around territorial disputes. Last Sunday, the Chinese coastguard announced it was patrolling areas in the East China Sea, in the waters around a group of uninhabited islands that both countries claim. Japan calls the islands the Senkaku Islands, while Beijing calls them the Diaoyu Islands. Japan, in response, condemned the brief “violation” of Japanese territorial waters by a fleet of four Chinese coastguard ships.</p><p>Over the last week, Chinese authorities have suspended the screening of at least two Japanese films and banned Japanese seafood.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, China postponed a three-way meeting with culture ministers from Japan and South Korea that was scheduled to be held in late November.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4064718\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4064718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4064718\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-21T141729Z_935378202_RC2C7GAVIAXC_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-POLITICS-1761604178.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"japan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4064718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks during a news conference at the prime minister’s office in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday, October 21, 2025 [Eugene Hoshiko/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"symbol-of-defiance\">‘Symbol of defiance’</h2><p>On November 18, diplomats from both sides met in Beijing for talks where the grievances were aired.</p><p>Senior Chinese official Liu Jinsong chose to wear a five-buttoned collarless suit associated with the rebellion of Chinese students against Japanese imperialism in 1919.</p><p>Japanese media have called the choice of the suit a “symbol of defiance.” They also point to videos and images from the meeting showing Liu with his hands in his pockets after the talks, saying the gesture is typically viewed as disrespectful in formal settings.</p><p>The Beijing meeting did not appear to ease the tensions, and there seems to be no sign of the impasse breaking: Chinese representatives asked for a retraction, but Japanese diplomats said Taikachi’s remarks were in line with Japan’s stance.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-history-of-sino-japanese-tensions\">What is the history of Sino-Japanese tensions?</h2><p>It’s a long and – especially for China – painful story. Imperial Japan occupied significant portions of China after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), when it gained control of Taiwan and forcefully annexed Korea. In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Amid strong Chinese resistance, Japan occupied parts of eastern and southern China, where it created and controlled puppet governments. The Japanese Empire’s defeat in World War II in 1945 ended its expansion bid.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party emerged victorious in 1949 in the civil war that followed with the Kuomintang, which, along with the leader Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan to set up a parallel government. But until 1972, Japan formally recognised Taiwan as “China”.</p><p>In 1972, it finally recognised the People’s Republic of China and agreed to the “one China principle”, in effect severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. However, Japan has maintained firm unofficial ties with Taiwan, including through trade.</p><p>Japan has also maintained a policy of so-called “strategic ambiguity” over how Tokyo would respond if China were to attack Taiwan — a policy of deliberate ambivalence, aimed at leaving Beijing and the rest of the world guessing over whether it would intervene militarily. The stance is similar to that of the United States, Taiwan’s most powerful ally.</p><h2 id=\"how-important-is-trade-between-china-and-japan\">How important is trade between China and Japan?</h2><p>He Yongqian, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry, said at a regular news conference this week that trade relations between the two countries had been “severely damaged” by PM Takaichi’s comments.</p><p>China is Japan’s second-largest export market after the US, with Tokyo selling mainly industrial equipment, semiconductors and automobiles to Beijing. In 2024, China bought about $125bn worth of Japanese goods, according to the United Nations’ Comtrade database. South Korea, Japan’s third-largest export market, bought goods worth $46bn in 2024.</p><p>China is also a major buyer of Japan’s sea cucumbers and its top scallop buyer. Japanese firms, particularly seafood exporters, are worried about the effects of the spat on their businesses, according to reporting by Reuters.</p><p>Beijing is not as reliant on Japan’s economy, but Tokyo is China’s third-largest trading partner. China mainly exports electrical equipment, machinery, apparel and vehicles to Japan. Tokyo bought $152bn worth of goods from China in 2024, according to financial data website Trading Economics.</p><p>It’s not the first time Beijing has retaliated with trade. In 2023, China imposed a ban on all Japanese food imports after Tokyo released radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific. Beijing was against the move, although the UN atomic energy agency had deemed the discharge safe. That ban was lifted just on November 7, the same day Taikachi made the controversial comments.</p><p>In 2010, China also halted the exports of rare earth minerals to Japan for seven weeks after a Chinese fishing captain was detained near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The peace envoy and the constitutional court blocked those bills.</p><p>In March 2025, the constitutional court issued arrest warrants for Milorad Dodik and several of his allies on charges of undermining the constitutional order. But a month later, members of the Republika Srpska police blocked officers from the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) from entering the administrative centre of the Republika Srpska government to arrest Dodik, further intensifying tensions with Sarajevo.</p><p>In August, Bosnia’s electoral authorities stripped Dodik of the presidency and banned him from participating in politics. He, however, remains the president of the SNSD party and continues to be its most powerful figure.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122438\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122438\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25114435871080-1763779612.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A member of the Special Anti-terrorist unit of police of Republika Srpska stands guard during the opening ceremony of the rectory building in Istocno Sarajevo, Bosnia, Thursday, April 24, 2025.

Bosnia as a country relies on a power-sharing system in which the two entities are closely linked. Republika Srpska’s challenge against state institutions and the rise of secessionist threats can affect the stability of the country on the national level.</p><p>The early election also strains Bosnia’s economy. The vote is funded from the state budget, rather than the entity’s own institutions, in a country with <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp?continent=europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the smallest economies</a> in Europe. Bosnia’s Central Election Commission has allocated more than six million Bosnian marks (close to $4m) for the elections.</p><p>The UK government, one of the guarantors of  the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, said at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Bosnia in October that holding presidential elections in the Republika Srpska would give “an opportunity for formation of their new government,” insisting that “the constitutional order and rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be upheld”.</p><p>“We encourage a focus on constructive and cooperative politics, including between Bosnia and Herzegovina’s two entities,” Jennifer MacNaughtan, the UK representative, said at the meeting.</p><p>In October, Russia, a strong ally of Republika Srpska, praised the transfer of power from Dodik to interim president Babic, but had also said that the Office of the High Representative peace envoy (OHR) should be “permanently closed”, echoing Dodik’s stance.</p><p>In conversation with the media, the spokesperson of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, said the Russian Federation “wholeheartedly supports” the struggle of the leadership of Republika Srpska against “eroding fundamental principles” of the Dayton peace treaty.</p><p>The US has not officially commented on the elections, but the Department of the Treasury has recently <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/14/why-did-us-let-dodik-off-the-hook-and-hand-europes-ailing-heart-to-russia\">lifted sanctions</a> against Dodik, his family members and his allies, including the SNDS candidate Karan, for undermining the Dayton peace agreement. Bosnia’s Serb officials have suggested they were quietly seeking a more cooperative relationship with the US, while still preserving their friendly ties with Russia.</p><p>Republika Srpska’s strongest ally, Serbia, has taken a more cautious stance than usual. In an interview with the state-owned Radio Television of Serbia, Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic – who has faced <a href=\"/news/2025/9/14/political-crisis-rumbles-in-serbia-as-duelling-camps-hold-parallel-rallies\">antigovernment protests</a> that have shaken the country for almost a year now – avoided commenting on the elections directly. He said he wished “all the best” to Republika Srpska and hoped everything would “pass peacefully”. He added that Serbia would always be there to help with “infrastructure”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-possible-scenarios-after-the-election\">What are the possible scenarios after the election?</h2><p>If SNSD’s Karan wins, the entity would likely remain under Dodik’s influence. Speaking to Euronews Serbia, Karan said the vote had been “forced” onto Republika Srpska by the peace envoy Schmidt and that a vote for him is “a vote for President Dodik”.</p><p>The ruling SNSD also holds a strong majority in the National Assembly of Republika Srpska.</p><p>Blanusa, from the opposition SDS party, told local BN television that Republika Srpska, under the current leadership, has become “impoverished, displaced and isolated”, and has pledged to make tackling corruption in the entity his main goal.</p><p>Indeed, the entity faces deep economic challenges. According to the <a href=\"https://www.irbrs.net/statistika/UporedniPrikaz.aspx?tab=3&amp;lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Database of Economic Indicators of Republika Srpska</a>, total gross domestic product (GDP) for 2023 was about 16 billion Bosnian marks (about $9bn), half of the GDP of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – and so, a third of the national economy.</p><p>The election verdict could also offer clues to political trends ahead of next year’s October elections, which could determine who rules the entity for another four years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
