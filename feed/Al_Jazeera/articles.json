Brys had the backing of the government, which pays the team’s costs, leaving a frustrated Eto’o undermining his coach whenever he could but being unable to get rid of him.</p><p data-start=\"717\" data-end=\"909\">Ultimately, Cameroon, who have been to more FIFA World Cups than any other African nation, had a dismal qualifying campaign and failed to make the cut for the 2026 edition.</p><p data-start=\"717\" data-end=\"909\">World Cup qualification failure, combined with a landslide re-election win for Eto’o at about the same time, saw support for Brys suddenly fade, and he was fired three weeks before the AFCON. In his place, the unheralded David Pagou was appointed new coach, and a squad for AFCON was selected without captain Vincent Aboubakar or goalkeeper Andre Onana, who had previously expressed support for the sports minister.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-cameroon-reach-the-afcon-quarterfinals\">How did Cameroon reach the AFCON quarterfinals?</h2><p>Cameroon finished runners-up in Group F with two wins and a draw. They were tied on seven points with the Ivory Coast, but settled for the second spot on account of fewer goals scored than the table toppers.</p><p>In the round of 16, Cameroon <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/4/cameroon-edge-south-africa-2-1-to-book-afcon-quarterfinal-with-morocco\">beat</a> South Africa 2-1, thanks to goals from Junior Tchamadeu and Christian Kofane.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4215256\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4215256\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4215256\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695ad55857c4-1767560536.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - Cameroon's forward #26 Christian Kofane celebrates scoring his team's second goal during the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) round of 16 football match between South Africa and Cameroon at Al Medina Stadium in Rabat on January 4, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4215256\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">For Cameroon, reaching the last eight means their AFCON is already a success after a chaotic build-up [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-morocco-s-camp\">What happened in Morocco’s camp?</h2><p data-start=\"468\" data-end=\"804\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Despite being tipped as overwhelming favourites, the World Cup 2022 semifinalists faced early criticism after a nervy opening-day win over minnows Comoros and a draw with Mali, before restoring confidence with a convincing 3-0 victory over Zambia in their final group match.</p><p data-start=\"686\" data-end=\"888\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Coach Walid Regragui had apologised to frustrated fans for the team’s underwhelming performance, saying, “Moroccans are naturally emotional, they need confidence.”</p><p data-start=\"686\" data-end=\"888\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Captain Hakimi urged fans to back them all the way through.</p><p data-start=\"686\" data-end=\"888\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">“If the fans are behind us we can be champions of Africa together,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-morocco-reach-the-quarterfinals\">How did Morocco reach the quarterfinals?</h2><p>Morocco topped Group A with a similar record, bagging two wins and a draw for seven points.</p><p>They started their knockout campaign with a 1-0 win over Tanzania in the round of 16.</p><h2 id=\"who-will-the-winner-face-in-the-next-round\">Who will the winner face in the next round?</h2><p>The winner of the Cameroon vs Morocco match will face the winner of the Algeria vs Nigeria match in the semifinals.

He made his first <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/venezuelas-abducted-leader-maduro-wife-to-appear-in-nyc-court\">court appearance</a> in New York on Monday after his <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduction</a> and professed his innocence, saying that he was “kidnapped”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Another international law issue that arises with Maduro’s abduction is the immunity of heads of state and other high-ranking officials from prosecution and civil penalties abroad – a principle that has been affirmed by the International Court of Justice and <a href=\"/news/2022/12/7/immunity-cited-as-khashoggi-lawsuit-against-prince-dropped-in-us\">previously acknowledged</a> by Washington.</p><p>“So not only is the US extending enforcement jurisdiction without the consent of Venezuela, but the US is also grabbing up a high state official and saying we have the right to simply take this person out of their position and put them on trial in the US,” Satterthwaite told Al Jazeera.</p><p>International courts are an exception to head-of-state immunity. In 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over war crime charges in Gaza.</p><p>The US has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">imposed sanctions</a> on ICC officials for investigating Israel.</p><h2 id=\"the-us-position\">The US position</h2><p>That legal consensus, however, has not stopped US President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/trumps-attacks-on-venezuela-put-the-us-neighbour-mexico-on-edge\">Donald Trump’s</a> aides and allies from arguing that the abduction of Maduro was a mere law enforcement operation, not an act of aggression against another country.</p><p>Republican Senator Tom Cotton likened US special forces <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/price-hikes-queues-and-tension-venezuela-shoppers-uneasy-after-us-bombing\">abduction in Caracas</a> to law enforcement officers arresting a suspected drug trafficker in the US, as he argued that the White House did not have to inform the US Congress of the attack.</p><p>“That’s not the kind of thing that you expect advance notice to Congress for,” Cotton told the Hugh Hewitt Show on Monday.</p><p>“Nor, for that matter, do I expect advance notice every time the executive carries out an arrest of a drug trafficker, whether it’s in Venezuela or in Arkansas.”</p><p>Hours after the operation on Saturday, US Vice President JD Vance also invoked Maduro’s indictment as the legal basis for the US attack.</p><p>“And PSA [public service announcement] for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance wrote on X.</p><p>“You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Republican Senator Mike Lee initially questioned the domestic legality of the military action without congressional authorisation on Saturday.</p><p>But he later said that US Secretary of State <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio\">Marco Rubio</a> told him that the violence was “deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” – an explanation that appeared to satisfy the senator’s concern.</p><p>But Yusra Suedi, assistant professor in International law at the University of Manchester, stressed that the attack on Venezuela violates <a href=\"/features/2026/1/5/what-the-us-did-in-venezuela-normalises-power-grabs-expert\">the UN Charter</a>, which prohibits “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.</p><p>“A state cannot lawfully justify violating international law by citing its own domestic law. And this is a cardinal principle of international law,” said Suedi.</p><p>For his part, Ian Hurd, a professor of political science at Northwestern University, dismissed the notion that US forces were conducting a law-enforcement operation.</p><p>“It’s silly for the American government to purport that this is simply the execution of an arrest warrant,” Hurd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It would require, then, that you imagine that the Canadian government might issue an arrest warrant for Trump for fraud or <a href=\"/news/2024/12/30/appeals-court-upholds-trump-sexual-abuse-defamation-liability-verdict\">sexual harassment</a> and send the forces to bomb the White House to extract him to take him back to Canada for trial.”</p><p>He added that international law is unambiguous in saying that governments cannot use force against other countries to advance their goals.</p><p>“So it’s very clearly illegal under international law. It’s simply an overthrow of a government by a neighbour using military force,” Hurd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"question-of-legitimacy\">Question of legitimacy</h2><p>In the wake of the abduction of Maduro, some supporters of the move have argued that Maduro <a href=\"/news/2024/9/12/us-imposes-sanctions-on-maduro-allies-over-illegitimate-election-results\">lacks legitimacy</a> due to the alleged voter fraud that took place in the last election, which the opposition claims to have documented.</p><p>Even before the US raid, opposition figure <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/venezuelas-machado-says-she-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-since-october\">Maria Corina Machado</a> said removing Maduro would not amount to regime change because Venezuelans had already voted against the president.</p><p>But experts say Washington’s assessment of Maduro’s legitimacy is irrelevant to the illegality of the strike.</p><p>He was Venezuela’s head of state at the time of his abduction, a fact recognised by the US Justice Department in its 2026 indictment, which calls Maduro “Venezuela’s president and now de facto ruler”.</p><p>Satterthwaite, the UN rapporteur, said that while there are “serious concerns” with the 2024 elections, the US itself has treated Maduro as Venezuela’s leader.</p><p>In January, Trump sent his envoy <a href=\"/news/2025/1/31/trump-envoy-arrives-in-venezuela-to-meet-maduro-about-deportation-flights\">Richard Grenell</a> to meet Maduro for talks on accepting deportation flights of undocumented Venezuelans in the US.</p><p>“If we allowed one government to go around the world saying, ‘Well, this person is legitimate, this is not. And since he’s not, I’m going to go grab him,’ you can see what kind of chaos would ensue,” Satterthwaite said.</p><p>She added that the legitimacy of many governments across the world can be questioned over fraudulent elections, lack of elections or ascension to power via a coup. “That does not allow another individual government unilaterally to decide that it can go and grab up the head of that government,” she said.</p><p>Maduro’s government has been accused of major human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests of dissidents and torture.</p><p>“I, of course, would be in favour of measures of accountability for the [Venezuelan] government, but not in this reckless kind of Wild West manner that we’ve seen play out here,” Satterthwaite told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-noriega-case\">The Noriega case</h2><p>Some defenders of the abduction of Maduro over US charges have claimed that the move has a legal precedent.</p><p>“Critics calling President Trump’s capture of Nicolas Maduro unprecedented and illegal have short memories. We’ve done this before, and the courts blessed it,” an associate professor of business law at Georgia College and State University wrote in a Wall Street Journal column.</p><p>He was referring to the US invasion of Panama and the seizure of its President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/maduro-joins-iraqs-saddam-panamas-noriega-as-latest-leader-taken-by-us\">Manuel Noriega</a> in 1989-1990. Noriega stood trial and was convicted of drug charges in the US.</p><p>Satterthwaite said the capture of Noriega had its own legal issues under international law, and it is not entirely analogous to the abduction of Maduro.</p><p>“That also was illegal, and therefore doesn’t help us at all to make the comparison,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The UN General Assembly had condemned the US invasion of Panama.</p><p>Satterthwaite said in the case of Panama, Washington attempted to make a jurisdictional argument by saying that Noriega was not the country’s leader, and that the US was acting with the consent of the proper head of state at that time, President-elect Guillermo Endara.</p><p>“It’s important to note that at that moment in Panama, the National Assembly there had actually declared a state of war against the US, so there was already an engagement between the two states,” Satterthwaite said.</p><p>“All of those things make this different, but I don’t think they make that first operation legal.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The car is then seen hurtling out of control and crashing into other parked cars.</p><p>Multiple angles of the videos filmed by various onlookers went viral on the internet. The onlookers sound terrified, shouting, “Shame!” at the agent and asking him to stop.</p><p>In some images and videos, the woman’s bloodied body is seen slumped in the SUV in the aftermath.</p><p>According to Frey, the victim was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died of her injuries.</p><p>The incident took place during protests against the ICE immigration crackdown in south Minneapolis.</p><h2 id=\"who-was-renee-nicole-good-the-woman-named-as-the-victim\">Who was Renee Nicole Good, the woman named as the victim?</h2><p>The Minneapolis City Council, the city’s primary legislative body, identified the victim as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.</p><p>In a joint statement, Council President Elliot Payne and council members wrote: “Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>The statement demanded that ICE leave Minneapolis.</p><p>Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that Good died a few blocks away from her home. “She was probably terrified,” Ganger said.</p><p>Ganger denied that her daughter was part of the protests against ICE.</p><p>“She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”</p><p>The Star Tribune also quoted Good’s father-in-law, who said she had a six-year-old child with his son, Timmy Ray Macklin Jr. Macklin died in 2023 at the age of 36.</p><p>The newspaper reported that Good also had two other children.</p><p>She studied creative writing at Old Dominion University, a public university in Norfolk, Virginia. A brief English Department bio, which referred to her as Renee Macklin, described her as a Colorado Springs, Colorado, native who hosted a podcast with her husband, Tim Macklin, and said that when she wasn’t focused on writing, she enjoyed movie marathons and making “messy art”.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-the-shooting\">What has Trump said about the shooting?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump said: “The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”</p><p>He added that the reason “these incidents” are happening is because “the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”</p><p>It is unclear from the footage whether Good tried to run over the agent. The footage shows her car reverse and then move forward. When the car moves forward, an agent is seen jumping ahead. However, it is not clear whether this was because of her car or what he was trying to do.</p><h2 id=\"what-have-other-trump-administration-officials-said\">What have other Trump administration officials said?</h2><p>Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said during a news conference that “any loss of life is a tragedy” but Good “had been stalking and impeding [ICE’s] work all throughout the day”.</p><p>“She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” Noem said.</p><p>The DHS runs ICE, and last summer, it launched a major recruitment drive to hire 10,000 more ICE agents on top of the existing force of about 6,000.</p><p>On X, the DHS wrote that the ICE agent fired “defensive shots” at Good after she had tried to run over the agent.</p><p>“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” it posted, calling the incident “an act of domestic terrorism”.</p><p></p><p>“I want every ICE officer to know that their president, vice president, and the entire administration stands behind them,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.</p><p>“To the radicals assaulting them, doxxing them, and threatening them: congratulations, we’re going to work even harder to enforce the law.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-local-authorities-responded\">How have local authorities responded?</h2><p>Authorities in Minnesota have disputed the Republican Trump administration’s accounts of the shooting.</p><p>Democratic Governor Tim Walz reposted the DHS X post on Wednesday, saying: “I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”</p><p></p><p>Frey released a statement rebuking the actions of ICE.</p><p>“ICE – Get the f*** out of Minneapolis,” Frey said during a news conference on Wednesday. “We do not want you here. Your stated purpose for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, but you are doing exactly the opposite.”</p><p>“People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart, long-term Minneapolis residents who have contributed greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, someone is dead. That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury is not done.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-trump-administration-s-justification-for-ice-raids-in-minneapolis\">What’s the Trump administration’s justification for ICE raids in Minneapolis?</h2><p>On Tuesday, the Trump administration escalated its immigration operation in Minneapolis. In an X post, ICE announced it planned to deploy 2,000 additional agents to the northern Midwestern city.</p><p>“A 100% chance of ICE in the Twin Cities – our largest operation to date,” the post said.</p><p></p><p>The DHS launched Operation Metro Surge, which includes Minneapolis, in December. The Trump administration said the operation aims to root out criminals and undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told local news media that ICE is “surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens”.</p><p>The population of Minnesota is more than 5 million, and according to numbers from the Migration Policy Institute from 2023, the number of undocumented immigrants in the state is 100,000.</p><p>Republicans have made disparaging remarks particularly targeting the state’s Somali population.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/trump-administration-freezes-minnesota-childcare-funds-over-fraud-claims\">froze</a> childcare payments to the state in response to allegations by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley, who claimed daycare centres operated by Somali Americans in the city of Minneapolis had committed up to $100m in fraud.</p><h2 id=\"where-else-has-ice-led-anti-immigration-raids-under-trump\">Where else has ICE led anti-immigration raids under Trump?</h2><p>In September, ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, Illinois, to arrest undocumented immigrants in the city. It is ongoing.</p><p>Last month, ICE launched a raid in Columbus, Ohio, which also has a large Somali population. In late November, ICE agents were deployed in New Orleans, Louisiana. Similar raids were launched in Charlotte, North Carolina that same month.</p><p>Since Trump came to office in January 2025, ICE raids have taken place in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Miami, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, DC, among other cities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And by 2030, they aim to reach almost 210,000.”</p><p>Russia also shifted tactics a few months ago, from large mechanised assaults that had resulted in huge losses of personnel and equipment, to infiltration tactics using several teams of two soldiers to establish bridgeheads and supply drops before reinforcements arrive.</p><p>These tactics enabled it to capture two-thirds of the hotly contested eastern town of Pokrovsk, in Donetsk, by the end of last year, and roughly half of neighbouring Myrnohrad.</p><p>Anticipating the further honing of these tactics, Ukraine has said it is improving the training of new troops.</p><p>“We clearly understand what we will have to face in the near future,” wrote Syrskii. “We have set the task of forming special units designed to effectively detect and destroy enemy high-tech drone units, control points, and the crews of the occupiers’ unmanned aerial systems.”</p><h2 id=\"the-long-range-war\">The long-range war</h2><p>On Monday, the war claimed the first two civilian deaths of the year in Ukraine.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In recent days, leaked recordings and documents have provided the rough outline of a conspiracy to launch an insurgency in the Alawite-dominated coastal region of Syria. Behind the plan are a number of high-level officials of the former regime of Bashar al-Assad living in exile. The leaks reveal the recruitment of fighters within the Alawite community, the movement and storage of weapons, and the transfer of payments to their families.</p><p>The revelations come months after an insurrection staged in the coastal region in March led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people, including civilians, government troops and Alawite fighters.</p><p>Similar violence erupted again in July in Suwayda, the Druze stronghold in southern Syria where several hundred Druze civilians were killed as government forces tried – unsuccessfully – to restore order after clashes between Sunni tribes and Druze militias.</p><p>There have also been sporadic clashes between the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and government forces despite a March 10 agreement to integrate the former into the national army.</p><p>Concerns are now growing that minority-dominated regions may be carved out, undermining the establishment of a strong Syrian state or even violating the territorial integrity of the country. Such a development, however, is not inevitable.</p><h2 id=\"the-alawite-challenge\">The Alawite challenge</h2><p>While the leaked recordings and documents show that al-Assad regime remnants have not accepted their fate and are planning a comeback in some form, they are far from being successful. Most Alawites, deeply shaken by what they view as abandonment and betrayal by the al-Assad family, seem to have resigned themselves to living under a new authority and are trying to adapt to this reality.</p><p>While a small number of die-hard figures may still harbour fantasies of a return to power, possibly through the creation of a coastal enclave, such ambitions remain politically detached from the broader Alawite community.</p><p>What shapes Alawite attitudes today are economic deprivation and physical insecurity, not aspirations for secession or restoration of the former regime.</p><p>Last month, the response to calls for protests by Ghazal Ghazal, head of the so-called Islamic Alawite Council in Syria and the Diaspora, reflected accumulated grievances rather than realistic political projects.</p><p>The dissolution of state institutions, particularly the army and security services, has plunged hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. Even pensioners have gone unpaid for more than a year.</p><p>Should violence re-emerge among Alawites, it would be driven by poverty and desperation rather than ideological or political ambition. This situation must be addressed before it erupts into a full hunger mutiny.</p><p>The absence of transitional justice further aggravates tensions. It encourages victims of the former regime to seek revenge outside legal frameworks while collective blame directed at Alawites has led to frequent revenge killings in Alawite-dominated areas.  Many Alawites now urge the government to publish a clear list of former regime officials responsible for major crimes, both to individualise accountability and to lift the burden of collective guilt imposed on their community.</p><h2 id=\"druze-and-kurdish-resistance\">Druze and Kurdish resistance</h2><p>The situation is more complicated in the southwest region of Suwayda, where the local Druze community has categorically refused to allow government forces to enter their territory. Hikmat al-Hijri, a prominent Druze spiritual leader with known ties to Israel, has been suspicious of the new government, and his position hardened after the March massacres in the coastal region of Syria. Over the summer, he was elevated to the position of the sole political authority of the Druze community.</p><p>Suwayda has become a de facto autonomous zone after the failure of government forces backed by Sunni tribal fighters to impose control in July. Al-Hijri openly appealed to Israel, whose intervention forced Damascus to retreat.</p><p>Since then, he has overseen the creation of a so-called National Guard, led by former regime officers and financed and armed by Israel, while openly advocating for independence.</p><p>In the northeast, Damascus also faces a formidable challenge. The SDF has refused to fully implement the March 10 agreement and relinquish the political and military gains it has consolidated over the past decade.</p><p>The collapse of the latest round of talks to implement the agreement, held in Damascus on Sunday, sparked tense fighting in and around Kurdish-dominated neighbourhoods of Aleppo, threatening to plunge the country into yet another civil war – this time along ethnic faultlines.</p><p>Backed by the United States and enjoying good relations with Israel, the SDF commands a force of roughly 60,000 fighters and runs an autonomous civil administration that governs roughly one-third of the country, including a significant amount of Syria’s natural resources. In effect, the SDF aspires to a status resembling that of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq.</p><h2 id=\"maintaining-unity\">Maintaining unity</h2><p>Dark predictions that Syria would slip back into a civil war have failed to materialise. However, the current situation still poses immense challenges.</p><p>Lacking decisive US backing while simultaneously fearing Israeli intervention and coordinated unrest both along the coast and in Suwayda, Damascus possesses little credible leverage to fully unify the country in the near term.</p><p>As minorities lack the capacity to challenge the new government and Damascus lacks the power to subjugate them, Syria risks sliding into a prolonged deadlock – one that may ultimately solidify into de facto partition.</p><p>Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland as a breakaway entity has reinforced fears that it may employ similar tactics in Syria, aiming to weaken the state by promoting fragmentation along sectarian lines.</p><p>However, there are also other external powers that have vested interests in a stable and united Syria. Fearing a revival of ISIL (ISIS) and the return of Iranian influence, the US is pressuring both the SDF and the government in Damascus to implement the March 10 agreement. Turkiye is also applying pressure on the SDF to soften its position and agree to the terms of integration.

Initiating an inclusive political process, forming a unity government and convening a national dialogue conference to draft a new constitution with broad participation from Syria’s political, ethnic and sectarian components can help win more support in Syria’s troubled regions.</p><p>The initiation of a transnational justice track along with national reconciliation would also help heal the wounds of the past 14 years. Some <a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/facing-alawite-backlash-syrias-new-leaders-take-controversial-steps-win-loyalty-2025-12-30/&amp;data=05%257C02%257Cmarwan.kabalan@dohainstitute.edu.qa%257Ca36d8273fad5489cbc0c08de4c6ca073%257Cdd2a2bdcb2b94005bbb65a5b635ada77%257C0%257C0%257C639032226649337014%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ==%257C0%257C%257C%257C&amp;sdata=vUlZcs2XwhfhMxwdGCaUIMKU0wlmJziZSxQ3DPmWOdE=&amp;reserved=0\">conciliatory gestures</a> towards minorities on the coast and in Suwayda and the northeast would also help. Yet all these measures will have little impact if they are not accompanied by the right economic policies especially designed to address dire poverty and staggering unemployment.</p><p>Taken together, these policies would certainly help Damascus abort Israel’s wicked plans for Syria and maintain unity.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It grossly violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, infringed on China’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and undermined peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this, and has taken a series of necessary measures to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"965\">The Taiwan question is entirely China’s internal affair. There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This has been clearly recognised by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 1971.</p><p data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"1271\">Taiwan’s restoration to China is a victorious outcome of World War II and an integral part of the post-war international order. A series of instruments with legal effect under international law, including the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, have all affirmed China’s sovereignty over Taiwan.</p><p data-start=\"1273\" data-end=\"1563\">Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, 183 countries have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. The one-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community and a basic norm in international relations.</p><p data-start=\"1565\" data-end=\"2190\">The US’s massive arms sales to China’s Taiwan region grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs. The US side pledged in the August 17 communique, which China and the US jointly issued in 1982, that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution.</p><p data-start=\"2192\" data-end=\"2682\">However, the US has not been faithfully implementing the one-China principle and stipulations in the three China-US joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, over the past 40 years. There have been more frequent open military interactions between the US and Taiwan, and the size and performance of arms sold by the US to Taiwan have kept increasing. It gravely undermines China’s sovereignty and security, while emboldening the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.</p><p data-start=\"2684\" data-end=\"3212\">Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and must be decided by the Chinese ourselves. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. When the one-China principle is fully recognised and earnestly followed, the Taiwan Strait would remain calm and tranquil. However, when the one-China principle is wilfully challenged or even sabotaged, there would be dark clouds or even violent storms across the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"3214\" data-end=\"3797\">The root cause of the tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the Taiwan authorities have kept soliciting US support for “Taiwan independence”, and some people in the US intend to use Taiwan to contain China. It is the US and Taiwan separatist forces, not China, that seek to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The US arms sales to Taiwan made provocations first. China’s response is legitimate, lawful and justified. It is a severe punishment against the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and a stern warning to external interference forces.</p><p data-start=\"3799\" data-end=\"4084\">Although the two sides across the Taiwan Strait have yet to be reunified, the fact that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China has never and will not be changed. This is the true status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"4086\" data-end=\"4525\">To solicit US support to advance their separatist agenda, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) authorities are turning Taiwan into a powder keg. Their massive and desperate arms purchase further reveals their true nature as provocateurs, saboteurs of peace and warmongers. External forces who try to arm Taiwan to contain China will only embolden the separatists and push the Taiwan Strait closer to the peril of armed conflict.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The Taiwan question is at the core of China’s core interests, and is a red line that must not be crossed. China will take all measures necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. No matter how many advanced weapons are sold to Taiwan, this will not reverse the inevitability of China’s reunification. Anyone who crosses the line or makes provocations on the question will be met with China’s firm response. All attempts to hold back China’s reunification will invariably fail.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This will take effect on January 27, 2026. From this point forward, the US will no longer be legally bound by the agreement’s carbon-cutting pledges.</p><p>In the new memorandum, the administration moved beyond the Paris Agreement to target the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) itself, which is the foundational 1992 treaty that the Paris Agreement is built upon. By withdrawing from the UNFCCC, the administration aims to exit the entire international framework for climate negotiations.</p><p>The withdrawal from the UNFCCC is particularly significant as it is a Senate-ratified treaty. The administration’s authority to unilaterally withdraw from such treaties is expected to face legal challenges.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3309441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3309441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3309441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-07T200357Z_395462279_RC2J0BAZMR5I_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-COP29-ACTIVISM-1731025780.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Climate activists project warning against Trump on London bridge\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3309441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Climate activists project a message onto Tower Bridge with a silhouette of US President-elect Donald Trump, before COP29 climate talks, in London, UK, November 7, 2024 [Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the US remains a member of the UN Security Council, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which the administration identified as serving essential security or humanitarian functions.</p><h2 id=\"35-non-un-organisations\">35 non-UN organisations</h2><ol>\n<li>24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact</li>\n<li>Colombo Plan Council</li>\n<li>Commission for Environmental Cooperation</li>\n<li>Education Cannot Wait</li>\n<li>European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats</li>\n<li>Forum of European National Highway Research Laboratories</li>\n<li>Freedom Online Coalition</li>\n<li>Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund</li>\n<li>Global Counterterrorism Forum</li>\n<li>Global Forum on Cyber Expertise</li>\n<li>Global Forum on Migration and Development</li>\n<li>Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research</li>\n<li>Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals, and Sustainable Development</li>\n<li>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</li>\n<li>Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services</li>\n<li>International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property</li>\n<li>International Cotton Advisory Committee</li>\n<li>International Development Law Organization</li>\n<li>International Energy Forum</li>\n<li>International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies</li>\n<li>International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance</li>\n<li>International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law</li>\n<li>International Lead and Zinc Study Group</li>\n<li>International Renewable Energy Agency</li>\n<li>International Solar Alliance</li>\n<li>International Tropical Timber Organization</li>\n<li>International Union for Conservation of Nature</li>\n<li>Pan American Institute of Geography and History</li>\n<li>Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation</li>\n<li>Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia</li>\n<li>Regional Cooperation Council</li>\n<li>Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century</li>\n<li>Science and Technology Center in Ukraine</li>\n<li>Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme</li>\n<li>Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.</li>\n</ol></div></div></body></html>"
