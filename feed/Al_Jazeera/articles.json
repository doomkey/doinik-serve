China, in a similar statement, said it would also extend its tariff suspension for 90 days.</p><p>On May 11, the two sides agreed to a 90-day tariff pause. From early April until then, US import levies on Chinese goods stood at 145 percent, while Chinese tariffs on US exports were 125 percent – rates that resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries.</p><p>But the tariff truce agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland, lowered the temperature by temporarily slashing US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent, while Chinese levies on US exports fell to 10 percent.</p><p>Beijing also agreed to resume some rare earth exports critical for the US manufacturing sector, including electronics, aerospace and cars.</p><p>Following talks in Geneva, US and Chinese representatives met in London in June and then again in Stockholm, Sweden, last month. After the Stockholm meetings, US negotiators returned to Washington with a proposal that Trump extend the Geneva deadline past August 12.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In the run-up to this latest pause, it’s understood that Trump pushed for additional concessions on Sunday, urging China to quadruple its US soya bean purchases. But analysts questioned the feasibility of his deal, and Trump did not repeat his demand on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-stock-markets-responded\">How have stock markets responded?</h2><p>Financial markets rallied on Tuesday, with Japanese and Australian equities hitting record highs following the trade truce announcement. Japan’s Topix benchmark rose 1.6 percent, as Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.2 percent.</p><p>In the US, futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes edged up 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, oil prices increased. Brent crude futures jumped 0.4 percent to $66.9 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.4 percent to $64.2.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-been-flexible-with-china-on-trade\">Why has Trump been flexible with China on trade?</h2><p>In recent weeks, US-China negotiations have been on a parallel track to other talks Washington has held with trade partners, as it moved to implement sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs – as well as industry-specific levies – on <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trumps-higher-tariffs-take-effect-on-imports-from-dozens-of-countries\">August 7</a>.</p><p>Trump struck agreements to lower tariffs with some trading partners, including the EU and Japan, but hit others like Brazil and Switzerland with swingeing levies. In the case of India, Trump doubled tariffs to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-india-relations-at-their-worst-as-trump-slaps-50-percent-tariff\">50 percent</a> after New Delhi refused to curb purchases of Russian oil and lower tariffs on US goods.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, trade negotiations between the US and China have “been running on their own track … because the US sees China as a long-term economic rival.”</p><p>Sampson told Al Jazeera that “I don’t think it [Washington] sees the EU or other countries in the same way.” He also noted that the “incipient military rivalry between the US and China” means that bilateral negotiations are sensitive.</p><h2 id=\"what-makes-the-trade-relationship-special\">What makes the trade relationship special?</h2><p>Trump has consistently criticised Beijing for what he deems to be unfair trade practices – namely import quotas, tax breaks and subsidies. He has even argued that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/tariff-wars-has-donald-trump-killed-the-wto\">the US’s trade deficit with China</a>, which reached $295.4bn last year, amounts to a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/what-legal-tests-are-donald-trumps-tariffs-facing\">national emergency</a>.</p><p>China is the US’s third-largest trade partner, after Mexico and Canada. It is heavily reliant on China for manufactured goods – from washing machines and TV sets to clothing.</p><p>The US Department of Commerce calculated that mechanical appliances (mainly low to mid-range technology products) made up 46.4 percent of all US imports from China in 2022.</p><p>And while US imports from China surged to beat Trump’s tariff bite following his “liberation day” announcement in April, they then dropped in June.</p><p>Indeed, the US trade deficit with China fell by roughly a third to $9.5 billion in June – its narrowest level since 2004, according to US Census Bureau data.</p><p>The US trade gap with China fell by $22.2bn from March to August. That amounts to a 70 percent drop from one year earlier.</p><p>More generally, US Treasury Department data shows that the US generated $124bn from January to July this year from tariffs. This is 131 percent more than the same time last year.</p><p>At the same time, the two countries trade goods of vital strategic interest whose importance trumps crude deficit figures. And both sides have been taking steps to reduce flashpoints recently.</p><p>For its part, the US has eased some export restrictions on advanced semiconductors – a key demand from China.</p><p>On Monday, the Financial Times newspaper revealed that Trump had permitted Nvidia and AMD to export advanced US chips to China. But the tech giants would pay 15 percent of their China sales to the federal government.</p><p>Trump had previously barred those deals. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, had also imposed restrictions on US chip exports, as well as banned a range of US high-tech investments in China.</p><p>On the flipside, Chinese exports of rare earth magnets have started to recover in recent weeks after it blocked sales to the US in April.</p><p>Flows of rare earth magnets – used in everything from clean energy technology to military hardware – from China to the US <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-21/global-magnet-crisis-subsides-as-china-eases-up-on-supply-curbs\">rose</a> to 353 tonnes in June, up from just 46 tonnes in May.</p><p>Still, total shipments were still substantially lower than before Beijing launched its export controls in early April.</p><p>Washington has also been pressing Beijing to stop buying Russian oil to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump even threatening to impose secondary tariffs on China.</p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday that President Trump has been thinking of imposing tariffs on Beijing.</p><p>“Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance told Fox News in an interview.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>This week’s tariff pause may clear the path for Trump to meet President Xi Jinping in late October, when the president is expected to travel to South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p><p>Until then, the partial tariff moratorium will give both sides time to work through longstanding trade concerns in advance of the potential meeting.</p><p>In the US, economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods has not been fully felt, as many firms have built up their stockpiles of inventories to mitigate the higher duties.</p><p>Looking ahead, however, BBVA Research published an analysis last month estimating that US tariffs on China would raise US inflation and slow economic growth later this year.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, “the tariff pause allows them [the US and China] to maintain the status quo, and it wouldn’t be surprising if, after 90 days, they extend it further.”</p><p>More broadly, however, he believes that “there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington to push for a de-linking with trade from China.”</p><p>“Big picture,” he said, “even under a different president, I think you’d still see tensions in the US-China relationship.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On June 6, I decided for the first time to head to one of the distribution sites run by what is known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). On the long 12km walk on foot, I was accompanied by a few friends.</p><p>I went with a faint hope of getting some food for my family. What we encountered bore no trace of humanity. The scene we saw play out at the distribution centre resembled a battlefield.</p><p>Israeli military vehicles stood alongside GHF trucks, with a massive barrier in front of them. Occupation soldiers were stationed on elevated positions, their weapons pointed directly at the Palestinian civilians gathering.</p><p>At one point, two trucks arrived and dumped the aid on the ground in a degrading manner. Anyone who tried to approach was met with gunfire from the Israeli soldiers. Eventually, an Israeli soldier announced over a loudspeaker, “Now you can get the aid,” and the crowd rushed towards the boxes.</p><p>Men shoved and pushed, children cried, and women trembled from fear and exhaustion. Just a small minority managed to lay their hands on some aid. Some tried to steal from those who had made it. The vast majority – myself included – went back home empty-handed.</p><p>It felt as if we were selling our dignity for scraps. I saw it as a deliberate humiliation, a reshaping of the consciousness of our educated society, and its transformation into a broken community.</p><p>I went two more times to the GHF site.</p><p>On the third trip, I was accompanied by Nader, a 23-year-old youth whom I had met during displacement. Nader lived near me and regularly went to the GHF site.</p><p>Before the genocide, he worked as a guard at an orphanage in the east of Khan Younis. He did more than guard the shelter; he cared for the children, helped them in their daily lives, and gave them a sense of safety. After his life was destroyed, he took on the responsibility of supporting his family and his relatives’ children.</p><p>I would see him returning from aid sites covered in dust from head to toe, utterly exhausted, yet greeting me with a faint smile even when he did not manage to get anything.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On July 19, Nader and my 16-year-old cousin Khaled prepared to go to the GHF site. I decided not to go, having lost all hope in that place, fully convinced it was a trap where Gazans were killed daily under the banner of “humanitarian work”.</p><p>They said they would try to get there early to secure food. Nader never returned. Khaled came back wounded with shrapnel in his leg.</p><p>Israeli forces had opened fire and launched several shells at the starving civilians. Most of the martyrs had been at the front of the line. Nader was hit by three bullets – in the chest, abdomen, and leg – along with shrapnel from a shell that landed near him.</p><p>Nader’s murder was devastating for his family; he was their sole provider. They could find no words to express their grief, only tears that fell on his lifeless body, as they mourned him.</p><p>Nader’s death was registered in the grim statistic of Palestinians killed at aid distribution sites, which today stands at 1,500. To the world, he was just a number; to me, he was a good man who had harmed no one but always helped others; he was robbed of everything by the occupation, his home, his job, his dreams of travelling and working in design and video editing. His family is now doomed to starve.</p><p>Since GHF began operating in Gaza over two months ago, nearly every major humanitarian organisation has condemned it and its method of aid distribution.</p><p>On August 7, Doctors Without Borders published a report titled: This is Not Aid. This is Organized Killing. It provided medical evidence that civilians were being deliberately targeted and described GHF sites as “death traps”.</p><p>A week before that, Human Rights Watch issued a report stating that what is happening constitutes a war crime, noting that the systematic shooting of Palestinian civilians without justification is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. It confirmed that the distribution of aid has turned into “regular bloodbaths”.</p><p>What makes GHF’s crimes even more horrific is that its leadership deny what is happening and embrace the occupation’s narrative. Its president, Johnny Moore, declared that there is no famine in Gaza, ignoring medical reports documenting the deaths of children from hunger. He accused Hamas of stealing aid and dismissed reports on the humanitarian situation as “Hamas disinformation”.</p><p>He even claimed that Hamas deliberately harmed Palestinian civilians to blame the Israeli army or GHF. Yet the reality on the ground, witnessed by me firsthand, is that the only people with guns present at GHF sites are their mercenary guards and occupation soldiers. The Palestinians coming there are starving civilians, their bones protruding from extreme hunger.</p><p>The continuing operations of GHF have implications beyond the Gaza Strip. Granting legitimacy to this organisation instead of condemning and dismantling it risks turning humanitarian aid centres into killing fields everywhere.</p><p>I do not want my friend Nader’s death to be in vain. Everyone responsible for his killing, and everyone who allowed aid to be distributed through GHF, or funded it, or gave it a false humanitarian cover, must be held accountable. What we need is not only to stop these practices, but to prosecute everyone who turned aid into a trap, used hunger as a weapon, and contributed to the killing of innocents.</p><p>Silence over these crimes is complicity, and silence today means they will happen again tomorrow.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of the schools' curriculums emphasise social justice, and students are encouraged to take jobs in underserved communities.</p>\n<p>But that revolutionary spirit has also made the normal schools hotbeds for activism. \"Normalistas\", as the students are called, have a long tradition of protest.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they block highways. Other times, they occupy toll booths. One of their most famous activities is the nonviolent commandeering of local buses: The practice is so common that many bus drivers know to simply step aside when their vehicle is boarded.</p>\n<p>Professor Tanalis Padilla, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the public reaction to such protests has been mixed. Some people support the students wholeheartedly. Others, she said, express annoyance at \"the radical kids out there again on the streets\".</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, negative news coverage has contributed to that scepticism. \"It’s safe to say the media has always been against them, calling them vandals and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>Padilla explained that this perception stems from the educational programme at the normal schools, which is rooted in socialist and collectivist politics.</p>\n<p>\"With the Cold War in the '70s and '80s, the media would portray the schools as hotbeds of radicalism and social disturbance,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Over the years, numerous normalista protests have culminated in violent clashes with police — and even death.</p>\n<p>The most infamous incident took place in September 2014, when 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College, another normal school, took over a bus in the state of Guerrero. They planned to use it to join a protest in Mexico City.</p>\n<p>What happened next remains unclear. But it is believed that the students were kidnapped and killed with the knowledge of local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Not a single one of the students was ever seen alive again. Charred remains belonging to three of the Ayotzinapa students were later identified using DNA testing.</p>\n<p>The Ayotzinapa case garnered widespread outrage and support for normalistas in Mexico and abroad.</p>\n<p>“What happened was so shocking and so vicious that there was a general reaction of sympathy” towards normalistas, Padilla explained.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It is clear this meeting is a symbolic victory for Russia by the very fact it is being held, regardless that no one expects any results from it,” Budraitskis told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It is a proof of the effectiveness of [Putin’s] strategy, which is that there is no need to make any compromises – you need to stubbornly repeat your maximalist positions, and at some point, everyone will be so tired of this that they will be forced to accept them, and the international isolation of Russia will gradually disappear.”</p><p>Budraitskis believes the meeting holds a similar value for Trump.</p><p>“The fact he is confused about whether Russia should give up its territory shows he doesn’t take any meaningful agenda of this meeting very seriously,” he continued.</p><p>“What the symbolic meaning of this meeting is for Trump is in showing he continues to play a key role in the situation in Ukraine, that he is the only person who is capable of talking to Putin, whom Putin listens to and respects.”</p><p>While Russia currently occupies vast chunks of eastern Ukraine, Ukraine no longer occupies any Russian territory after being ousted from the Kursk region of western Russia earlier this year.</p><p>Bloomberg reported on Friday that Russian and US diplomats were hammering out a deal that would allow Russia to keep the territory it has conquered so far, halting its invasion along the existing battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of southern Ukraine.</p><p>The Polish online newspaper Onet said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff proposed to Putin a de facto recognition of what the Kremlin considers its “new territories” and the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>Officially, the Kremlin lays claim to the entire Donbas area of eastern Ukraine. If Ukraine were to abide by those terms, its forces would have to retreat from those parts of its Luhansk and Donetsk regions still under its control.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/zelenskyy-rejects-trumps-proposal-ukraine-swap-territories-russia-rcna224022\">fired back</a> in a Telegram post on Saturday, reiterating: “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.”</p><p>But Zelenskyy will not be present at Friday’s meeting.</p><p>“The summit will be held without the participation of the EU countries and Ukraine,” stated Zaurbek Khugaev, director of the Digoria Platform think tank.</p><p>“This is an eloquent signal that both Trump and Putin understand the destructive position of Zelenskyy and European officials for the development of mutually acceptable agreements, who, by the way, are persistently trying to include the Ukrainian leader in the agenda of the event.”</p><p>Budraitskis said certain token measures may be granted without seriously hindering the war effort.</p><p>“It’s possible that Putin will take some symbolic steps, for example limiting or temporarily refraining from bombing Ukraine, because, in general, this aerial warfare does little to help advance Russian troops.”</p><p>Although Putin and Trump have spoken several times by phone this year, Friday’s talks will mark the first face-to-face meeting between the two statesmen since they met in Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, but because the United States is not a member of the ICC, it is under no obligation to arrest him.</p><p>Alexey Nechayev, a political scientist and member of the Digoria Expert Club, said Ukraine is unlikely to be the only item on Friday’s agenda. Also of interest are arms control treaties, the situation in the Middle East and of course, given how the meeting is taking place in Alaska, the Arctic Circle.</p><p>“Finally, the key issue for Russia is the new security framework in Europe,” Nechayev said.</p><p>“Moscow views the Ukrainian conflict as part of a broader crisis in relations with NATO. This means that the solution requires eliminating the root causes, including legally enshrined nonexpansion of the alliance to the east.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Reports of unusual jet activity over Srinagar triggered widespread panic among residents.</p><p data-start=\"95\" data-end=\"840\">This evoked harrowing memories of similar aerial activity coupled with a similarly bizarre set of rumours in the tense days leading up to August 5, 2019. People waited anxiously.</p><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"1636\">The bombshell that came on the sixth anniversary was an official order <a href=\"/features/2025/8/9/attack-on-peoples-memory-kashmirs-book-ban-sparks-new-censorship-fears\">banning 25 books</a> that focus on Jammu and Kashmir’s history and politics – all accused of promoting “false narratives” and “secessionism” – a sweeping judgement that does not stand the test of scrutiny and is not based on any evidence.</p><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"1636\">My book A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370, published in December 2022 by HarperCollins, is one of them. The book is a rare chronicle of the day-to-day reality in Jammu and Kashmir after 2019. Based on ground research, extensive interviews and the collation of data from other primary and secondary sources, it punctured the Indian government’s claims of “normalcy” in Jammu and Kashmir.</p><p data-start=\"1638\" data-end=\"2208\">The government justified the actions of August 5, 2019 on the grounds that they would usher in peace and development in the region, while glossing over the unprecedented physical and cyber-restrictions imposed across the erstwhile state, during which thousands of people, including pro-India politicians (three former chief ministers included), were arrested. Barbed wire and military barricades turned the region, particularly the Kashmir Valley, into a curfewed zone, and communication channels – from internet to telephone lines – were pushed into some black hole.</p><p data-start=\"2210\" data-end=\"2698\">Six months later, when some of these restrictions were slightly eased and the internet was partially restored, the stranglehold of the Indian state became even more oppressive, with an exacerbation of raids and crackdowns against journalists, political and social activists, and civil rights defenders. The policy of widespread detentions under laws like the Public Safety Act, which allows the government to detain anyone without charge for up to two years, was ramped up significantly.</p><p data-start=\"2700\" data-end=\"3072\">These realities were hardly ever reported. Journalism was severely curtailed under the state’s clampdown, particularly affecting local publications. Newspapers that refused to fall in line were choked financially until they were out of print. Those that did comply were rewarded with lavish government advertisements that kept the businesses going, minus the journalism.</p><p data-start=\"3074\" data-end=\"3425\">Either co-opted or terrorised, the newspapers were no longer daily chroniclers of the events, developments and incidents in the region. Community voices were silenced while journalists no longer asked questions. The rich archives of some newspapers, showcasing the complex day-to-day history of the region, became inaccessible or were removed.</p><p data-start=\"3427\" data-end=\"3982\">In the last six years, the government has been extremely intolerant of any criticism. Any word of dissent invites punitive measures ranging from mere intimidation and interrogation to confiscation of devices, and from the slapping of income tax and money laundering cases to terrorism accusations, sometimes accompanied by short detentions or prolonged arrests. While local journalism was reduced to an extension of the government’s public relations department, all civil society voices were throttled by intimidation, leaving major gaps in information.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"3984\" data-end=\"4584\">It was this vacuum that my book aimed to fill. Focused on the first two years of the revocation of Article 370, and in 12 chapters, I documented what was happening on the ground – the increased suppression of the masses, the lack of space for freedom of expression, the shrinking space for civil society and political activism, the criminalisation of dissent, the continuation of terrorism as opposed to the claims of peace and normalcy, and the hollowness of the development claims by the government even as the new policies and actions robbed the people of their homes and agricultural lands.</p><p data-start=\"4586\" data-end=\"5124\">The book is a pursuit of truth – the naked truth, which challenged everything the Indian state was saying. A paranoid state whose only method of engagement in Jammu and Kashmir is through increasing its military footprint, merciless subjugation of the residents and silencing of all voices of dissent was obviously uncomfortable with what I documented. The book was a warning to the government that its methods of control, creation of a police and surveillance state, and misplaced development models were unsustainable and would fail.</p><p data-start=\"5126\" data-end=\"5972\">In the last six years, the government has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the world by trumpeting its achievements of bringing peace, normalcy, tourism and development. The April 22 killings this year of 26 innocent civilians punctured this bubble. It was a wake-up call for the government to sit back and review its policies in Kashmir and begin course correction.</p><p data-start=\"5126\" data-end=\"5972\">Instead, it clamped down even further with a horrific scale of demonisation of Kashmiris, ruthless detentions and even more brutal demolitions of houses. This, even as there was widespread public condemnation of terrorism, including vigils and calls to reject violence – something unprecedented in the more than three-decade-long history of rebellion in the region – and even as the investigators indicated foreign militants, not locals, were involved in the killings.</p><p data-start=\"5974\" data-end=\"6447\">In the last three months, the government has demonstrated that its policy of control through harsh security measures and pervasive surveillance would be further accelerated. The ban on 25 books, many of which provide rich, well-researched, and layered historical, political and legal narratives about the complex and trouble-torn region, is an extension of the pattern. Through this ban, there is an attempt to erase every trace of a counter-narrative and alternate memory.</p><p data-start=\"6449\" data-end=\"6913\">By branding all criticism of the state and narratives that are out of sync with the official version as “seditious”, the government can now seize and destroy these books. Not only are the written words being criminalised – even the act of reading will be wrongfully deemed a threat to the security and integrity of the nation. While this may not stop ideas and memory from being suppressed, policing what people write and read is likely to be further intensified.</p><p data-start=\"6915\" data-end=\"7256\">Though senseless, shocking and irrational in scale and scope, the ban, which ironically coincides with a government-backed Chinar Book Festival in Srinagar, sends a chilling message: Knowledge and information will be regulated by the state. What people write and read will be decided by the state. The thought police will penetrate deeper.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\">Last year, during Jammu and Kashmir’s first assembly elections as a Union Territory, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, took a dig at the regional political parties and alleged that while “they (local politicians) gave the youth stones in their hands”, his government had given them “books and laptops”.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\">The hollowness of such claims is laid bare when the daily reality is one of confiscation of digital devices, including laptops, during raids and interrogations, alongside a blanket book ban that only reinforces the central message of my work: Kashmir is anything but normal.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

I was finally seeing Anas, whose reports we had followed throughout our displacement. He didn’t look different from how he did on screen, but he had a strong presence in person.</p><p>We approached Anas after he finished his report and spoke briefly. He knew Abed well, but it was the first time I met him. He spoke with humility and an easy smile during our short conversation – he had to go report across northern Gaza.</p><p>My brief meeting with Anas and Mohammed that day felt like standing before giants, powerful and unshakable.

My parting words to him were: “Stay safe,” because we all knew he could be a target at any moment.</p><p>When the news came of his assassination on Sunday night, it was a catastrophe, not only for journalists, but for all Palestinians who considered Anas a son, someone who told their stories.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3882017\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3882017\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3882017\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/520553085_122094082064964439_5885789456406200080_n-1-1754892231.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mohammed Qraiqea\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3882017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The author first met Mohammed Qreiqeh at the end of January [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone hoped the news was wrong, but it wasn’t.
