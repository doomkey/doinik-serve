They then held several days of talks with Ukrainian officials in Miami, which ended on Saturday with no breakthrough.</p><p>The biggest sticking point is understood to be a requirement that Ukraine cede control of its eastern Donbas region to Russia, which currently illegally occupies most but not all of the territory.</p><p>In comments reported by Bloomburg, Zelenskyy said that the latest proposal requires further discussion on “sensitive issues,” including security guarantees for Ukraine and control of its eastern territories.</p><p>“There are visions of the US, Russia and Ukraine, and we don’t have a unified view on Donbas,” he said early on Monday, adding that Kyiv is seeking a separate pact on security guarantees from Western allies, particularly the US.</p><p>Trump has previously chastised Zelenskyy for refusing to give up Donbas. Ukraine and its European allies have balked at the idea of handing over land to the aggressor.</p><p>Trump expressed concern on Sunday as he asserted that Zelenskyy had not read the latest plan.</p><p>“Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I’m not sure that Zelenskyy’s fine with it. His people love it.

But there has so far been little sign that either Ukraine or Russia is willing to sign a peace deal.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has not publicly expressed approval for the latest plan. Last week, he stated that aspects of the proposal were unworkable, despite the document reportedly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/no-compromise-territory-ukraine-talks-us-kremlin\">heavily favouring Moscow</a>.</p><p>Russia has, however, welcomed a new national security strategy issued last week by the Trump administration, stating it is <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/russia-welcomes-trumps-revised-us-security-strategy\">largely in line with Moscow’s vision</a>.</p><p>The US document last week warns that Europe faces so-called “civilizational erasure”, identifies ending the war in Ukraine as a “core” US interest, and signals a shift towards restoring “strategic stability” with Moscow.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Has he just appeared, or was he there all along? Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"who-is-ghassan-al-duhaini\">Who is Ghassan al-Duhaini?</h2><p>Palestinian media sources say al-Duhaini, 39, has long been the group’s de facto leader, despite being officially the second-in-command.</p><p>They argue that his experience and age made him the operational head, while Abu Shabab, the figure publicly recruited by Israel, served as the face of the militia.</p><p>Al-Duhaini was born on October 3, 1987, in Rafah, southern Gaza. He belongs to the Tarabin Bedouin tribe, one of the largest Palestinian tribes that extends regionally and to which Abu Shabab belonged.</p><p>He was a former officer in the Palestinian Authority security forces, where he held the rank of first lieutenant.</p><p>Then he later joined Jaysh al-Islam, a Gaza-based armed faction with ideological ties to ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"did-he-really-take-over-after-abu-shabab\">Did he really take over after Abu Shabab?</h2><p>The militia announced al-Duhaini as its new commander on its official Facebook page on Friday.</p><p>Al-Duhaini pledged to continue the group’s operations against Hamas.</p><p>In an interview with Israel’s Channel 12, comments later reported by The Times of Israel on Saturday, al-Duhaini insisted he had no fear of Hamas.</p><p>“Why would I fear Hamas when I am fighting Hamas? I fight them, arrest their people, seize their equipment … in the name of the people and the free,” he said.</p><p>On Friday, the militia published a promotional video on an affiliated Facebook page showing al-Duhaini inspecting a formation of armed fighters.</p><p>He told Channel 12 that the footage was intended to demonstrate that the group “remains operational” despite the death of its leader.</p><p>“His absence is painful, but it will not stop the war on terrorism,” he declared.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-he-always-been-against-hamas\">Has he always been against Hamas?</h2><p>Hamas lists al-Duhaini among its most wanted figures, accusing him of collaborating with Israel, looting aid, and gathering intelligence on tunnel routes and military sites.</p><p>Little information is available on why he left the security forces.</p><p>Al-Duhaini has been increasingly active on social media, recently appearing prominently in a video showing the militia capturing and interrogating several Hamas members from a tunnel in Rafah.</p><p>Abu Shabab’s group claimed the detentions were conducted “in accordance with the applicable security directive and in coordination with the international coalition”.</p><p>He also appeared in a social media post beside what appeared to be several bodies, the caption saying they were Hamas men who had been “eliminated” as part of the group’s “counterterrorism” operations.</p><p>Hamas has attempted to assassinate al-Duhaini twice, killing his brother in one operation and narrowly missing al-Duhaini in another, when a booby-trapped house east of Rafah was detonated.</p><p>A Hamas source said al-Duhaini survived the blast “by sheer luck”, while four members of the attacking unit were killed and others wounded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-popular-forces-militia\">What is the Popular Forces militia?</h2><p>The Popular Forces militia first came to prominence in 2024 under the leadership of Abu Shabab. It has an estimated 100 to 300 fighters who operate only metres from Israeli military sites, moving with their weapons under direct Israeli oversight.</p><p>The militia is primarily based in eastern Rafah, near the Karem Abu Salem crossing, the only entry point through which Israel currently permits humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p><p>A second unit is in western Rafah, near the notorious US-Israeli GHF aid distribution point, where hundreds of Palestinians have been shot as they sought aid.</p><p>Security sources told Al Jazeera Arabic that the Israeli army oversaw the arming of Abu Shabab and that he leads “criminal gangs specialising in intercepting aid convoys coming from the [Karem Abu Salem] crossing in southern Gaza and firing on civilians”.</p><p>Israeli newspaper Maariv reported in June that Israel’s intelligence agency, Shin Bet, was behind the recruitment of Abu Shabab’s gang, its chief Ronen Bar advising Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enlist and arm the group.</p><p>The so-called “pilot project” involved supplying the militia a limited and monitored number of rifles and handguns, the paper said.</p><p>Shin Bet’s idea, Maariv continued, was to use the gang to test whether it could impose a form of “alternative governance” to Hamas in a small, contained area of Rafah.</p><p>Still, some Israeli security officials, it added, do not view the group as a credible replacement for Hamas.</p><p>Abu Shabab’s name later appeared in an internal United Nations memo in late 2024 that identified him as a central figure behind the systematic and large-scale looting of humanitarian aid entering Gaza.</p><p>Reports about the group’s finances and operations suggest a pattern of systematic profiteering from Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2025/11/15/china-issues-travel-warning-for-japan-over-threats-to-intervene-in-taiwan\">diplomatic dispute</a>.</p><p>Beijing has summoned the Japanese ambassador, <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/22/china-spat-with-japan-on-taiwan-deepens-reaches-un-whats-it-all-about\">written to the United Nations</a>, urged citizens to avoid travelling to Japan and renewed a <a

<a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan\">have also been hit</a>.</p><p>Takaichi’s “remarks, to Beijing’s ears, is a blatant intervention into China’s domestic own affairs,” Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"accusations-traded\">Accusations traded</h2><p>The incident over the weekend provided a setting for the latest flashpoint in the tensions.</p><p>Both countries have traded quarrelsome accusations, with the Chinese Navy saying on Sunday that the scrambled Japanese F-15s had repeatedly approached its training area and endangered flight safety, while Japan’s chief government spokesman Minoru Kihara insisted on Monday that those claims were unfounded.</p><p>Japan’s military said about 100 take-offs and landings had been conducted from the aircraft carrier as it sailed east into the Pacific Ocean past the Okinawa Islands over the weekend.</p><p>Japan would “respond calmly but firmly and continue to monitor the movements of Chinese forces in the waters around our country”, Kihara said, rejecting China’s claim that Japanese aircraft had obstructed safe flight operations.</p><p>For its part, the Chinese embassy denied Tokyo’s claims, saying in a statement that “China solemnly demands that Japan stop smearing and slandering, strictly restrain its frontline actions, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.”</p><p>Japan hosts the largest foreign deployment of the United States military, including thousands of US Marines stationed in Okinawa.</p><p>Washington’s ambassador to Japan has voiced support for Tokyo in the dispute with Beijing, although US President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to travel to China for trade talks next year, has so far stayed out of the dispute.</p><p> </p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 12 million, according to the United Nations. It has also left some 30 million in need of humanitarian aid.</p><p>The RSF took the city of el-Fasher, the capital of the state of North Darfur, in October after an 18-month campaign of siege and starvation. The city was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in the region.</p><p>Survivors who fled the city in the subsequent days recounted mass killings, rape, pillaging and other atrocities, prompting an international outcry.</p><p>Amnesty International has accused the RSF of “war crimes”, while the UN Human Rights Council has ordered an investigation into the abuses in el-Fasher. Officials who visited Darfur and spoke to survivors described the region as an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/sudans-el-fasher-a-crime-scene-after-rsf-takeover-un-aid-chief\">“absolute horror show”</a> and a “crime scene”.</p><h2 id=\"widespread-sexual-assault\" data-start=\"1037\" data-end=\"1353\">Widespread sexual assault</h2><p>Mohammed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that he was “100 percent sure” that sexual violence committed by RSF fighters is far more widespread than reported.</p><p>“Because most of the communities look at it as a stigma, most of the raped women tend not to disclose this information,” he said.</p><p>Elsheikh said the network had also documented 23 cases of rape among women who fled el-Fasher for the nearby town of Tawila.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the age of these raped victims varies from 15 years to 23 years old,” he said.</p><p>In its statement, the Sudan Doctors Network urged the international community to take urgent action to protect Sudanese women and girls.</p><p>It also called for “serious pressure on RSF leaders to immediately stop these assaults, respect international humanitarian law, and secure safe corridors for women and children”.</p><p>The latest accusations came amid a growing outcry over another RSF attack on a pre-school in the state of South Kordofan that local officials said killed at least 116 people. Some 46 of the victims were children, according to the officials.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Sunday, Justice Minister Abdullah Dirife said Khartoum was willing to pursue political talks aimed at ending the conflict, but insisted that any settlement must “ensure there is no presence for ‘terrorist’ militias in both the political and military arenas”.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera on the sidelines of the Doha Forum, he said the rebels “need to agree to give their weapons in specific areas and leave all these cities, and the police should take over”.</p><p>Dirife also called for putting a stop to the “transfer of weapons and the infiltration of mercenaries into Sudan” and claimed that fighters and arms were entering from regions including South America, Chad and the UAE.</p><p>The RSF currently holds all five states of Darfur, while the Sudanese army retains control of most of the remaining 13 states, including Khartoum.</p><p>Dirife also accused the RSF of repeatedly breaking past commitments to adhere to regional and global mediation initiatives.</p><p>“The last initiative we signed was the Jeddah Declaration. However, this militia didn’t commit to what we agreed on,” he said in Doha.</p><p>The Jeddah Declaration – brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia in May 2023 – was meant to protect civilians and lay the groundwork for humanitarian access. Several ceasefires followed, but both sides were accused of violating them, prompting the mediators to suspend talks.</p><p>The UN has meanwhile formally declared famine in el-Fasher and Kaduguli in South Kordofan and warned of the risk of a hunger crisis in 20 additional areas across the Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan regions.</p><p>The World Food Programme’s Deputy Executive Director Carl Skau told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the agency was providing aid to five million people, including two million in areas that are difficult to reach, but warned that assistance has fallen far short of needs.</p><p>“World attention needs to be on Sudan now, and diplomatic efforts need to be stepped up in order to prevent the same disaster we saw in el-Fasher,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And what are the chances of it continuing into phase two?</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-observed-the-ceasefire\">Has Israel observed the ceasefire?</h2><p>No.</p><p>Since the ceasefire began on October 10, Israel has <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/4/live-gaza-mourns-victims-of-israeli-genocide-that-never-really-ended\">broken it more than 590 times,</a> killing at least 360 Palestinians, and sending the total death toll in Gaza from two years of attacks above 70,000.</p><p>Under the first phase – based on US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan – Israel was required to halt its genocidal war on Gaza, pull back its troops, allow aid in, and exchange hundreds of Palestinian detainees for the remaining captives still held in Gaza.</p><p>Speaking a month after agreeing to the ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s war on Gaza “has not ended” and that Hamas “will be disarmed”.</p><p>Throughout Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Israeli officials have been pledging to “destroy” Hamas and claiming that Israeli bombardment, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/21/israeli-data-shows-83-percent-of-gaza-war-dead-are-civilians-report\">which has killed mostly civilians according to Israel’s own tally</a>, was to achieve that.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza remain <a href=\"/features/2025/11/26/stuck-in-gazas-limbo-palestinians-struggle-to-live-amid-israels-attacks\">in limbo and suffering daily attacks</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-withdrawn-its-troops\">Has Israel withdrawn its troops?</h2><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Israel initially pulled its troops back behind what it called the “yellow line”.</p><p>Running around the land edges of the Strip, the poorly demarcated yellow line separates the areas of Gaza controlled by the Israeli army and those controlled by Hamas.</p><p>Hamas accuses Israel of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/palestinians-squeezed-as-israel-moves-beyond-yellow-line-in-gaza-city\">pushing the yellow line further into Gaza</a> “daily”, displacing those who find themselves on the wrong side and killing Palestinians, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/israeli-attack-kills-two-children-in-southern-gaza-despite-ceasefire\">including children</a>, approaching the unclear boundary.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-allowed-aid-in\">Has Israel allowed aid in?</h2><p>A full Israeli blockade on Gaza this year led to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/starvation-strategy-how-israel-created-famine-in-gaza\">an engineered famine</a> that was recognised by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in Gaza City in August.</p><p>Since the ceasefire, Israel has allowed slightly more aid in, although far less than Gaza’s needs and what the agreement stipulated.</p><p>Aid agencies are reporting that the situation remains desperate, despite cases of malnutrition starting to slow.</p><p>UNICEF and partners in October identified nearly 9,300 children less than five with acute malnutrition, five times the level reported during a previous ceasefire in February.</p><p>“A big portion of the goods coming in is commercial [not humanitarian] – meaning that big aid agencies, including UNRWA, aren’t getting there,” said Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations for Gaza’s principal aid agency, UNRWA.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-israel-really-committed-to-this-ceasefire\">Is Israel really committed to this ceasefire?</h2><p>Considering Israel’s past actions – including unilaterally breaking a ceasefire earlier this year and Netanyahu saying the war isn’t over – it is uncertain.</p><p>According to many Netanyahu critics, much of the genocide Israel unleashed on Gaza has been shaped by his own political circumstances.</p><p>But that makes him more reliant on the Trump administration, which supports the ceasefire, to protect him.</p><p>“Israel has never had a leader in a weaker position, so the US will never have a better chance of pushing their deal through,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said, listing the threats to the PM that Trump’s support might save him from.</p><p>Netanyahu has petitioned Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to grant him a pardon in his ongoing corruption trial. Trump has also asked Herzog to pardon Netanyahu.</p><p>Netanyahu can also use Trump as an excuse if his far-right government members are angered by an end to the war on Gaza.</p><p>“Netanyahu can always shrug and say, ‘it’s not me, it’s Trump,'” Mekelberg said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-planned-for-phase-two\">What’s planned for phase two?</h2><p>Phase two of the deal concerns Gaza’s post-war governance. The most detailed framework so far has been the US-backed plan, now endorsed in part by the UNSC.</p><p>The plan sets out a transitional phase in which Palestinian technocrats – not political factions – would run day-to-day governance.</p><p>Their work would be overseen by a multinational “Board of Peace”, and supported by an International Stabilisation Force tasked with security and demilitarisation. This is meant to allow for the reconstruction of Gaza and stop a return to armed conflict.</p><p>But Hamas and other Palestinian groups have <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/palestine-factions-refuse-foreign-guardianship-on-gaza-as-truce-takes-hold\">rejected the idea of foreign guardianship</a> over Gaza.</p><p>They were also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/hamas-gaza-factions-say-un-resolution-undermines-national-will\">opposed to the UNSC resolution</a>, saying it “paves the way for field arrangements imposed outside the Palestinian national will”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-could-a-final-deal-be-likely\">So, could a final deal be likely?</h2><p>Other than the still escalating death toll in Gaza, nothing is certain.</p><p>Netanyahu, according to his critics, is an opportunist to his core, who is still balancing several competing threats at home.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump and his inexperienced political negotiators drawn from outside of the US’s diplomatic core find themselves negotiating a settlement to both the genocide in Gaza and the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/no-compromise-territory-ukraine-talks-us-kremlin\">war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>And, whatever deal is agreed upon, Israel is almost certain to continue to attack Gaza whenever it likes, much as it does in the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere in the region.</p><p>A Palestinian state also does not look any closer to fruition.</p><p>Mekelberg points out that with so many potentially shifting factors, including Israel’s domestic politics, it is hard to know if a final deal is achievable.</p><p>“It’s Netanyahu,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>“His corruption cuts through everything, from his legitimisation of the far-right at home to the way he’s approached the conscription of the ultra-Orthodox [Jews in the Israeli military]. It’s too messy. There are no lines through.</p><p>“Add to this a US president that is also unpredictable, and it’s close to impossible to predict how this will play out.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
