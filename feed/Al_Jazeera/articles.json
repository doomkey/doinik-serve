But little progress has been made on that front, and the sporadic violence between the two sides turned into intense fighting this week.</p><p>A truce to halt the clashes was announced on Friday, but it appears to be already unravelling. Analysts warn that without a comprehensive resolution to the tensions, more fighting is all but inevitable.</p><p>While it appears that there is no domestic or international appetite for an all-out war in Syria, experts say that with the merger of the SDF – which controls large parts of northeast Syria – into the state stalled, the threat of renewed violence persists.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s a lot of international interest in major fighting at the moment, especially from the US side — so that could help tamp things down,” said Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International.</p><p>“It’s far from over, however. All the main issues remain unresolved, and neither side is willing to compromise on fundamentals, so we’re going to see more clashes eventually.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-clashes\">The clashes</h2><p>This week’s fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people in the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafieh and Bani Zeid neighbourhoods, with both sides accusing each other of initiating the violence.</p><p>Early on Friday, the Syrian Ministry of Defence announced a six-hour temporary ceasefire in the three neighbourhoods, which was later extended to give the SDF fighters more time to leave.</p><p>Syria’s Defence Ministry said SDF fighters based in Aleppo’s neighbourhoods will be redeployed to areas east of the Euphrates River.</p><p>However, ⁠Kurdish councils that run Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh said in a statement that calls to leave were “a call to surrender” and that Kurdish forces would instead “defend their neighbourhoods”.</p><p>The fighting casts its shadow over the March 2025 deal between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s government and the SDF to bring the Kurdish-led forces under state institutions.</p><p>The agreement provides for a nationwide ceasefire, SDF cooperation with the state in confronting pro-al-Assad armed groups, and formal recognition of the Kurds as an integral part of Syria, with guaranteed citizenship and constitutional rights.</p><p>It also places all border crossings with Iraq and Turkiye, along with airports and oilfields in northeastern Syria, under the authority of the central government.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4226502\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4226502\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4226502\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Syria_control_oil_gas_Jan9_2026-01-1767954259.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Syria_control_oil_gas_Jan9_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4226502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-sdf\">The SDF</h2><p>So far, no meaningful progress has been made towards integration. Both sides remain at odds over a number of issues, including the process and structure of integration, for example, whether the SDF would join as a unified bloc or dissolve into individual recruits.</p><p>A meeting on January 4 between senior SDF commanders and government officials concluded with no “tangible” outcomes according to state media, with talks suspended pending further negotiation.</p><p>The SDF rose to prominence as Syria began to fragment under the strain of civil unrest in 2011.</p><p>It was officially established in 2015, with the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), forming the bulk of its fighting force.</p><p>Despite the PKK being listed as a “terrorist” group by the US and most Western countries, Washington quickly allied itself with the SDF in the fight against ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>The group continues to be backed by a US-led international coalition and retains advanced equipment and training that were provided by the US and its partners.</p><p>It is estimated to have 50,000 to 90,000 well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.</p><p>But Turkiye, which struggled with a decades-long PKK rebellion and attacks, views the SDF as a threat to its security.</p><p>In the recent clashes, official Syrian government media outlets have referred to the SDF as “PKK terrorists”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"regional-influences\">Regional influences</h2><p>With Turkiye, a NATO ally of the US, distrustful of the SDF, the country’s defence ministry has said it is ready to “support” Syria in its fight against the group.</p><p>Ankara, an ally of al-Sharaa’s government, has criticised Washington for years over its support for the SDF and launched several military operations in northern Syria to push the group off its border.</p><p>The intensifying rivalry between Turkiye and Israel has also raised concerns that the Israeli government may put its weight behind the SDF to provide a counterweight to Ankara’s influence in Syria.</p><p>Israel has already intervened in the internal Syrian conflict when it <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/ceasefire-collapses-in-syrias-suwayda-as-israel-threatens-escalation\">bombed Damascus</a> in July in support of Druze fighters battling government forces in the south of the country.</p><p>The Israeli military has also expanded its occupation beyond the Golan Heights, and it has been establishing checkpoints and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/israeli-incursions-abductions-stoke-fear-in-syrias-occupied-golan-heights\">abducting people</a> deep inside Syria’s territory.</p><p>The US, which has troops stationed in eastern Syria, is allied with all the parties involved: Turkiye, Israel, the Syrian government and the SDF.</p><p>And so, Washington has been trying to mediate between all the sides. Last week, Syria and Israel agreed to establish an intelligence-sharing mechanism after US-brokered talks.</p><p>US envoy <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate\">Tom Barrack</a> has urged the “utmost restraint” after the clashes in Aleppo and hailed the short-lived ceasefire.</p><p>“Together with our allies and responsible regional partners, we stand ready to facilitate efforts to de-escalate tensions and to afford Syria and its people a renewed opportunity to choose the path of dialogue over division,” Barrack said in a statement calling for de-escalation from all sides.</p><p>“Let us prioritize the exchange of ideas and constructive proposals over the exchange of fire. The future of Aleppo, and of Syria as a whole, belongs to its people and must be shaped through peaceful means, not violence.”</p><h2 id=\"us-can-do-the-most\">US ‘can do the most’</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said with both the government and SDF maintaining relationships with the US, it could limit the risk of the March agreement’s total collapse, saying it keeps a “ceiling on escalation”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“American involvement does not guarantee resolution, but it constrains the range of outcomes and keeps both parties tethered to a negotiating framework neither can afford to abandon,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Reporting from Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna said Washington can “do the most” to boost talks between the Syrian government and the SDF.</p><p>“The US has enjoyed a strong relationship with the SDF for over a decade. The US helped build up and train the SDF, it fought alongside the SDF, and 1,000 US troops remain in SDF territory where they work closely together in the effort to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-says-it-killed-or-captured-25-isil-operatives-in-syria-over-nine-days\">eradicate ISIL</a> from Syria,” Oghanna said.</p><p>“But the US has also recently strengthened its ties with Damascus.”</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Rob Geist Pinfold, an international security lecturer at King’s College London, said the temporary <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/9/syria-live-ceasefire-in-aleppo-after-at-least-22-killed-since-tuesday\">ceasefire in Aleppo</a> simply pushes “the more complicated issues” down the road.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve got a temporary ceasefire … which makes everyone’s lives better, but this means that we are arguably further away from getting to a comprehensive deal.”</p><p>For his part, Lund, the analyst, warned that more clashes could lead to a wider escalation.</p><p>“Unless this situation is managed well, it could prompt foreign interventions and worsen the already bad relationship between Israel and Turkiye,” Lund told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Some analysts have said the key is more talks and less violence.</p><p>Armenak Tokmajyan, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Center, argued that military pressure alone will not resolve Syria’s fragmentation.</p><p>“Reintegration … cannot happen just with force,” he told Al Jazeera, stressing the need for a multi-pronged strategy, including an inclusive national framework.</p><p>“A lot of these armed groups don’t want to lay down their weapons because they don’t know what this state will look like,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"162\" data-end=\"680\">The far right’s success in last month’s regional elections in Extremadura, Spain, was inevitable. After a series of corruption and sexual harassment allegations surrounding Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s socialist government since the summer, everyone in Spain knew he would never pull off a victory. Although the southwestern region has historically been a stronghold of Sanchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), it has been in the hands of the conservative People’s Party (PP) and the far-right Vox party since 2023.</p><p data-start=\"682\" data-end=\"1224\">This alliance, which until recently governed several other strategically important regions of Spain, such as Valencia and Murcia, is poised to take over the Spanish government in the next general elections in 2027. Its victory would potentially leave Europe without any socialist government. Denmark’s government under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen – the only other European government still often cited as genuinely socialist in orientation – has increasingly adopted a harsh anti-immigration rhetoric that sits uneasily with socialist principles.</p><p data-start=\"1226\" data-end=\"1552\">But why is Sanchez heading towards defeat despite making his country the new economic engine of Europe, leading the green transition, and being one of the few leaders denouncing Israel’s genocide in Gaza? How will his inevitable defeat affect the European Parliament, already under threat from far-right leaders across the continent?</p><p data-start=\"1559\" data-end=\"2011\">When Sanchez managed to form a coalition in the 2023 general elections, it was far from perfect. Among his allies were Sumar, a coalition of leftist parties, and Junts, a conservative Catalan independence party, both of which repeatedly threatened to withdraw their support if demands were not met. The prime minister managed to hold the fragile coalition together until this fall, when the Catalan party withdrew its support over immigration powers.</p><p data-start=\"2013\" data-end=\"2451\">Pressured by the rise of a new far-right independent party, Alianca Catalana (Catalan Alliance), Junts demanded the power to deport convicted migrants who re-offend, a demand that proved highly controversial. Although Sumar has not withdrawn its support from the coalition, it has repeatedly accused the socialists of ignoring a series of corruption investigations and harassment allegations involving senior figures in Sanchez’s party.</p><p data-start=\"2453\" data-end=\"3023\">These include serious corruption accusations against the former Public Works and Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos, who has been placed in pre-trial detention. He is under investigation for alleged bribery, influence-peddling, and embezzlement in connection with public contracts during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also include sexual misconduct allegations involving Francisco Salazar, who oversaw institutional coordination at the Moncloa Palace, the office and official residence of the prime minister, and against whom the party has failed to take decisive action.</p><p data-start=\"3030\" data-end=\"3472\">This negligence, together with the former minister’s incarceration, is beginning to erase the achievements of Sanchez’s socialist government, which, among other things, mounted an effective response to the rise of the far right in Spain and abroad. In response to the far-right plan to privatise public institutions and reduce employment, the Spanish prime minister has advanced the welfare state by improving citizens’ material conditions.</p><p data-start=\"3474\" data-end=\"3866\">His labour market reform has increased the minimum wage and protected pensions by linking them to the cost of living. It shouldn’t be a surprise that The Economist ranked Spain top in its rich-world economic performance rankings. Sanchez has also attracted substantial renewable energy investment, turning Spain into one of Europe’s leading destinations for clean energy projects.</p><p data-start=\"3868\" data-end=\"4150\">According to Spain’s social security and migration authorities, around 45 percent of all jobs created since 2022 have been filled by foreign-born workers, who now account for roughly 13 percent of the workforce, underscoring the sector’s contribution to labour market expansion.</p><p data-start=\"4157\" data-end=\"4601\">Unlike most of the European centre left, Sanchez has maintained a traditional socialist stance against the rise in military spending, provoking a furious reaction from many European countries, and especially from United States President Donald Trump. After the Spanish prime minister refused to allocate 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to military spending at a NATO summit, Trump threatened Spain in his usual rough style: “We will make you pay double.”</p><p data-start=\"4603\" data-end=\"5086\">But the military build-up (apparently the only solution of the European elites to exit the continent’s harsh economic crisis) is not the only front that Sanchez has opened against the Trump administration. He asked, in fact, for more rules about the internet and social media. This is a position strongly opposed by Washington, which recently imposed visa sanctions on a former top European Union official and employees of organisations that fight against disinformation for alleged censorship.</p><p data-start=\"5088\" data-end=\"5464\">Behind the US move, there is obviously no opposition to the alarming drift towards European censorship, but rather the will to protect the monopolistic American web giants. No other socialist party shared Sanchez’s stance, and most of the right’s forces, with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government in Italy the most prominent example, are completely subservient to Washington.</p><p data-start=\"5471\" data-end=\"5919\">The crisis of the European centre left is a crisis that affects the very core of the idea of socialism. Almost all the European socialist parties have undergone a transformation over the last 20 years, a change that has led them towards a substantial liberal politics. Take Keir Starmer in the United Kingdom or Elly Schlein in Italy. They are convinced warmongers regarding Ukraine and are indistinguishable from the liberal parties on economic solutions.</p><p data-start=\"5921\" data-end=\"6422\">In a late-December Christmas survey conducted by JL Partners for The Independent, UK Labour voters expressed deep dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Starmer’s leadership. By an overwhelming three-to-one margin, respondents said the party would have a better chance of winning the next election if Starmer were replaced. This discontent is symptomatic of a broader crisis facing Europe’s centre left, where even leaders of nominally “socialist” parties are increasingly indistinguishable from their liberal counterparts.</p><p data-start=\"6424\" data-end=\"6753\">Although Sanchez remains popular among leftist voters, it’s going to be very hard for him to succeed in the upcoming elections in Aragon, Castile and Leon, and Andalusia this spring.

His intervention proved ineffective, however, as Mozambique defender Reinildo eventually shoved Osimhen away amid the confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"688\" data-end=\"922\">The incident seemed to affect Osimhen’s interest thereafter, as he became increasingly disengaged from Nigeria’s play and soon signalled to the bench to be substituted. Head coach Eric Chelle obliged, introducing Moses Simon in his place.</p><p data-start=\"929\" data-end=\"1074\">The drama continued at the final whistle when Osimhen headed straight down the tunnel, while the rest of the Nigerian squad remained on the pitch in a post-match huddle.</p><p data-start=\"929\" data-end=\"1074\">Talking to reporters after the match, Lookman said: “There’s no issue. It’s just football. Always football.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As we look back on 2025, the world experienced a year of both remarkable achievement and profound challenge in global health. Multilateralism, science and solidarity were tested as never before, underscoring a fundamental truth: International cooperation is not optional. It is essential if we are to protect and promote health for everyone, everywhere in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant milestone was the adoption by WHO Member States of the Pandemic Agreement, a landmark step towards making the world safer from future pandemics. Alongside this, amendments to the International Health Regulations came into force, including a new “pandemic emergency” alert level designed to trigger stronger global cooperation. And to sustainably finance the WHO’s work, governments in a historic show of support increased their contributions to our core budget. Together, these measures demonstrate what multilateralism can deliver when countries choose collaboration over division.</p><p>Countries are now negotiating the Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing system of the Pandemic Agreement. This aims to ensure rapid sharing of pathogens and genetic sequence data, as well as equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. We hope this work will be completed by this coming May, allowing the overall Agreement to begin its entry into force as international law.</p><p>Beyond pandemic preparedness, the WHO advanced public health on multiple fronts in 2025. We validated the safety and life-saving effect of vaccines; issued guidance on innovations such as injectable lenacapavir for HIV prevention and GLP-1 therapies for obesity; responded to humanitarian crises from Gaza and Sudan to Ukraine; supported countries in achieving universal health coverage through locally tailored solutions and sustainable financing; and saw the UN General Assembly adopt a landmark political declaration to tackle noncommunicable diseases and mental health challenges – the deadliest and most widespread health threats of our era.</p><p>Science matters. Evidence matters. Trust matters.</p><p>That is why the WHO and its partners devoted sustained effort throughout 2025 to strengthening vaccine safety, effectiveness and use. We commit to sustaining this as a priority in 2026. Immunisation remains one of the most powerful public-health interventions in history, saving millions of lives every year. Its effect is clear: Global measles deaths have fallen by 88% since 2000; malaria vaccines are now being rolled out in 24 African countries; and 86 million girls have been vaccinated against human papillomavirus, helping prevent cervical cancer.</p><p>At the same time, WHO reaffirmed the safety of vaccines, and emphasised the importance of routine immunisation to protect children against highly contagious diseases such as measles, polio, hepatitis B and diphtheria. Over the past 25 years, global under-five mortality has fallen by more than half – from 11 million deaths annually to 4.8 million – and vaccines have been central to this progress. Immunisation is not a luxury; it is an essential health service. It is a cornerstone of universal health coverage and essential for children to be able to grow into healthy adults.</p><p>In 2025, the WHO also validated major achievements in disease elimination. The Maldives became the first country to achieve triple elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. Burundi, Egypt and Fiji eliminated trachoma; Guinea and Kenya eliminated sleeping sickness; Niger became Africa’s first country to eliminate river blindness; and Brazil eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Georgia, Suriname and East Timor were certified malaria-free. We look forward to more such successes this year.</p><p>Last year also marked a major step in addressing obesity, one of the fastest-growing global health challenges. More than one billion people worldwide live with obesity, a chronic and relapsing condition that drives other noncommunicable diseases and worsens outcomes for infectious diseases. The WHO issued its first guideline on the use of GLP-1 therapies for obesity, with conditional recommendations recognising that obesity requires comprehensive, lifelong care. Medication alone will not solve the obesity crisis. But evidence-based tools, used responsibly and equitably, can reduce suffering and improve quality of life.</p><p>Rapid advances in digital technologies – including artificial intelligence, robotics, genomics and advanced data sciences – are also transforming healthcare. In 2026, the WHO will continue helping countries integrate these innovations into their health systems and translate them into scalable solutions. Initiatives such as digital self-monitoring of blood pressure among pregnant women show how innovation can strengthen primary healthcare and expand access, particularly in rural and remote settings.</p><p>Universal health coverage remains our shared destination. Since 2000, access to health services and financial protection have improved for about one-third of people, but progress has stalled. Today, 4.6 billion people still lack access to essential health services, and more than one in four face financial hardship due to health costs. This is not inevitable; we can and must make progress.</p><p>In response to crises, the WHO supported 48 emergencies in 79 countries in 2025, reaching more than 30 million people. This took place amid increased dangers on the ground and drastic cuts to foreign health aid that threaten to persist into 2026. The WHO’s work ranged from cholera vaccination campaigns in Sudan to evacuating severely ill and injured patients from Gaza for treatment abroad. And we will continue working to alleviate the suffering of people in crisis, working with partners to do so. Still, conflict continues to exact a heavy toll, with rising attacks on healthcare in violation of international law. Healthcare must never be a target.</p><p>The past year highlighted the resilience of the global health community and the power of collaboration. The Pandemic Agreement’s adoption and successes in disease elimination reflect our capacity for progress. However, ongoing inequalities and funding cuts persist, putting the world’s most vulnerable at continued risk.</p><p>As we move into 2026, we must prioritise our collective health to ensure universal health coverage and a healthier world for everyone. By doing so, we can fulfil the vision of the World Health Organization from 1948, where people achieve the highest standard of health, not as a privilege for some, but as a right for all.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The USA and Venezuela are working well together, especially as it pertains to rebuilding, in a much bigger, better, and more modern form, their oil and gas infrastructure,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will ​not be needed, however, all ships will stay ‌in place for safety and security purpose,” his post added.</p><p class=\"p1\">Trump’s comments come hours after he indicated in an interview on Fox News’s Hannity programme that Venezuelan opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/venezuelas-machado-says-she-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-since-october\">Maria Corina Machado</a> was ‌coming to Washington next week, after previously dismissing the idea of working with her, saying that “she doesn’t ‌have the support within or the respect within ⁠the country”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Republican president, however, had told The New York Times on Wednesday that the US was “getting along very well” with the Venezuelan government, led by acting interim President Delcy ‌Rodriguez.</p><p class=\"p1\">During the Fox interview, Trump also said he would meet oil executives at the White House on Friday and that the oil companies would spend ‍at least $100bn in Venezuela, which he repeated in his Truth Social post.</p><p class=\"p1\">“At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL, all of whom I will be meeting with today at The White House,” Trump wrote on his social media platform ahead of the gathering, where he was expected to convince the oil heads to support his plans in Venezuela.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">The Trump administration has repeatedly said that it is running Venezuela, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Wednesday asserting that Washington will control the country’s oil industry “indefinitely”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Rodriguez, who was Maduro’s deputy, has said that her government remains in charge, with the state-run oil firm saying only that it was in negotiations with the United States on oil sales.</p><p class=\"p1\">US outlet NBC News reported that the heads of Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are expected at the White House meeting.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It’s just a meeting to discuss, obviously, the immense opportunity that is before these oil companies right now,” Trump’s spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chevron is the only US company that currently has a licence to operate in Venezuela. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after refusing then-President Hugo Chavez’s demand that they give up a majority stake in local operations to the government.</p><p class=\"p1\">Sanctioned by Washington since 2019, Venezuela sits on about a fifth of the world’s oil reserves and was once a major crude supplier to the United States.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it produced only about 1 percent of the world’s total crude output in 2024, according to OPEC, having been hampered by years of underinvestment, sanctions and embargoes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Trump sees the country’s massive oil reserves as a windfall in his fight to further lower US domestic fuel prices, a major political issue.</p><p class=\"p1\">But he could face an uphill task convincing the major US oil companies to invest in Venezuela due to uncertainty about governance post-Maduro, security and the enormous expense of restoring production facilities.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

South”.</p><p>However, STC spokesman Anwar al-Tamimi, who is in Abu Dhabi, rejected the announcement coming out of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“This news is ridiculous,” he told the AFP news agency, confirming he remained out of contact with the delegation in Riyadh, indicating a split was emerging within the group.</p><p>In a post on X, al-Tamimi said decisions related to the STC could only be made by the council in its entirety and under its president.</p><p>“This will be done immediately upon the release of the Southern Transitional Council delegation currently in Riyadh,” he wrote. “The Council will continue its positive and constructive engagement with all political initiatives in a manner that enables the people of the South to determine their future.”</p><p

Somaliland after <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemen-says-stc-leader-al-zubaidi-has-fled\">skipping</a> the talks in Riyadh, accusing the UAE of smuggling him out of the

The plane is primarily used for training purposes. Besides Pakistan, more than 10 countries currently have deployed the plane in their fleet for pilot training, including Azerbaijan, Turkiye, Iran, Iraq and others.</p><p>Just a day later, it was reported by the Reuters news agency that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were in talks to convert about $2bn of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, further strengthening military cooperation between the two longtime allies. The discussions come only months after they signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">mutual defence pact</a> in September last year.</p><p>Both developments followed reports in late December that Pakistan had reached a $4bn deal with a rebel faction in Libya, the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), including the sale of more than a dozen JF-17 Thunder jets.</p><p>While the Pakistani military has yet to formally confirm any agreement with Libya or Saudi Arabia, and Bangladesh has so far only expressed “interest” rather than signing a contract, analysts say events in 2025 have boosted the JF-17’s appeal.</p><p>However, the relatively cheap price of the plane, estimated at $25m-$30m, has meant that several countries in the last 10 years have shown interest in it, with Nigeria, Myanmar and Azerbaijan already having the jet in their fleets. And recent events have bolstered the reputation of Pakistan’s air fighting capabilities, say analysts.</p><p>In May, India and Pakistan fought an intense four-day air war, firing missiles and drones at each other’s territories, parts of Kashmir that they administer, and at military bases, after gunmen shot down 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, which denied any link to the attack.</p><p>Pakistan said it shot down several Indian fighter jets during the aerial combat, a claim Indian officials <a href=\"/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan\">later acknowledged</a> after initially denying any losses, but without specifying the number of jets downed.</p><p>“The PAF demonstrated superior performance against much more expensive Western and Russian systems, which has made these aircraft an attractive option for several air forces,” Adil Sultan, a former Pakistan Air Force air commodore, said.</p><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) has traditionally relied on Russian Mirage-2000 and Su-30 jets, but in the 2025 fighting also used French Rafale jets.</p><p>Pakistan, for its part, relied on its recently imported Chinese J-10C Vigorous Dragon and the JF-17 Thunder as well as the United States’ F-16 Fighting Falcon jets, with 42 planes in the formation that took on 72 IAF planes, according to the PAF.</p><p>So what is the JF-17 Thunder, what can it do, and why are so many countries showing interest?</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-jf-17-thunder\">What is the JF-17 Thunder?</h2><p>The JF-17 Thunder is a lightweight, all-weather, multi-role fighter aircraft jointly manufactured by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC).</p><p>Pakistan and China signed an agreement in the late 1990s to develop the aircraft, with work beginning in the early 2000s at the PAC in Kamra, situated in Pakistan’s Punjab province, just more than 80km (50 miles) away from the capital, Islamabad.</p><p>A retired Pakistan Air Force air commodore who worked closely on the programme said production is split between the two countries, with 58 percent carried out in Pakistan and 42 percent in China.</p><p>“We are manufacturing the front fuselage and vertical tail, whereas China makes the middle and rear fuselage of the plane, with a Russian engine being used, as well as British manufacturer Martin Baker’s seats are installed. However, the complete assembly of the plane is carried out in Pakistan,” he told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity due to his involvement in the project.</p><p>He said the aircraft was first unveiled to the public in March 2007, with the induction of the first variant, Block 1, in 2009. The most advanced Block 3 variant entered service in 2020.</p><p>“The idea was to replace Pakistan’s ageing fleet, and subsequently, in the next decade or so, they made the bulk of our air force, with more than 150 combat jets part of the force,” he said.</p><p>Before the JF-17, Pakistan was primarily relying on French manufacturer Dassault’s Mirage III and Mirage 5, as well as Chinese J-7 fighter planes.</p><p>The Block 3 variant places JF-17 in the so-called 4.5 generation of fighter jets. It has air-to-air and air-to-surface combat capabilities, advanced avionics, an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, electronic warfare systems and the ability to fire beyond-visual-range missiles.</p><p>Their avionics and electronic capabilities are an upgrade from the fourth generation of fighter planes, such as the F-16 and Su-27, which were primarily built for speed and dogfighting.</p><p>The AESA radar gives these planes the capability to track multiple targets at once and provides more visibility at longer distances. However, unlike fifth-generation planes, they lack stealth capabilities.</p><p>The Pakistan Air Force says the jet offers high manoeuvrability at medium and low altitudes and combines firepower, agility and survivability, making it “a potent platform for any air force”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223119\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223119\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223119\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5a781739-b4de-4274-ab94-a1032ce045a5-1767839117.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C480&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A high-level defence delegation led by Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan, Chief of the Air Staff, Bangladesh Air Force called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bangladesh Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan (left) met with the Pakistani Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad on January 6, during which a potential procurement of JF-17 was also discussed [Handout/Inter-Services Public Relations]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-has-bought-the-jf-17\">Who has bought the JF-17?</h2><p>Myanmar was the first country to buy the JF-17, ordering at least 16 Block 2 aircraft in 2015. Seven have been delivered so far.</p><p>Nigeria became the second buyer, inducting three JF-17s into its air force in 2021.</p><p>Azerbaijan followed with an initial order of 16 jets in February 2024, worth more than $1.5bn. In November 2025, Azerbaijan unveiled five JF-17s during its Victory Day parade, formally making it the third foreign operator of the aircraft.</p><p>That same month, the Pakistani military announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with a “friendly country” for procurement of the JF-17, describing it as a “noteworthy development” without naming the buyer.</p><p>Other countries, including Iraq, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia, have also explored the option of buying the JF-17 over the past decade, though those plans did not materialise.</p><p>While JF-17 makes the bulk of the PAF’s fighting squadron, the plane is not used by the Chinese air force, which is more reliant on its J-10, J-20 and developing its latest J-35 fighter planes.</p><p>With the plane’s entire assembly carried out in Kamra, Pakistan is the primary seller of the JF-17 fighter plane, including its after-sales services.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-jf-17-compare-to-other-fighter-jets\">How does the JF-17 compare to other fighter jets?</h2><p>The most advanced fighters currently in service globally are fifth-generation jets such as the US F-22 and F-35, China’s J-20 and J-35, and Russia’s Su-57. These aircraft feature stealth technology – unlike all previous generations of jets.</p><p>The JF-17’s Block 3 variant, by contrast, belongs to the 4.5 generation, alongside jets such as Sweden’s Gripen, France’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, India’s Tejas and China’s J-10, among others.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"0\">Still, while they don’t have stealth capabilities, 4.5 generation planes have specialised coating on them to reduce their radar signature, making them harder – though not impossible – to detect.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"0\">So, for instance, when a 4.5-generation jet enters the enemy’s radar zone, it can get detected, but it can also try to jam signals by using its electronic jamming capabilities, or use long-range missiles to attack the target, before turning back.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"0\">On the other hand, a fifth-generation plane remains entirely undetected by radars due to its physical design and weapons, which are stored internally.</p><p>While official pricing has not been disclosed, estimates put the JF-17’s unit cost at between $25m and $30m. By comparison, the Rafale costs more than $90m per aircraft, while the Gripen is priced at more than $100m.</p><p>An Islamabad-based regional security analyst who has closely monitored the development of the JF-17 planes said the jet’s appeal lies in its cost-effectiveness, lower maintenance requirements and combat record.</p><p>“The JF-17’s appeal is less about headline performance than the overall package, which includes lower price, flexible weapons integration, training, spares and generally fewer Western political strings,” he told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity because of his involvement with the JF-17 project.</p><p>“In that sense, the JF-17 is a ‘good enough’ multirole jet optimised for accessibility. It can suit air forces modernising on tight budgets, but it is not a direct substitute for higher-end fighters like the J-10C or F-16V in range, payload, electronic warfare maturity and long-term upgrade headroom.”</p><p>Sultan, who is also dean of the Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies at Islamabad’s Air University, said the JF-17’s performance against Indian aircraft in 2025 underscored its capabilities.</p><p>However, he cautioned that outcomes in air combat depend not only on the aircraft but on who is operating it.</p><p>“The jets’ integration with other systems such as ground and airborne radars, communication systems and the human skills mastered during training play the most vital role,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223728\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026-1767866414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-is-the-interest-in-jf-17s-growing\">Why is the interest in JF-17s growing?</h2><p>Pakistan’s air force again drew attention during the four-day conflict with India in May 2025, particularly on the night of May 7, when Indian aircraft struck targets inside Pakistani territory.</p><p>According to the PAF, Pakistani squadrons flying Chinese-made J-10C jets shot down at least six Indian aircraft. Indian officials initially denied losses but later acknowledged that “some” planes had been lost.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, who has claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between the two countries, has repeatedly highlighted the performance of Pakistani jets, a claim India has strongly rejected.</p><p>Although the JF-17 was not involved in the reported shoot-downs, the PAF says it was part of the formations that engaged Indian aircraft.</p><p>Three days later, on May 10, the ISPR claimed a JF-17 was used to strike India’s Russian-made S-400 air defence system with a hypersonic missile. India has denied any damage to its defence system.</p><p>The Islamabad-based security analyst said Pakistan is using the May conflict to market the JF-17 as a combat-proven, affordable option for countries with limited defence budgets.</p><p>He added, however, that the possibility of a “potential procurement” should be treated cautiously.</p><p>“‘Expressions of interest’ should be treated cautiously as fighter jet procurements typically take years to translate from exploratory talks to signed contracts and deliveries,” he said, adding that “while PAF is continuing to market the JF-17 aggressively, the JF-17 for debt swap isn’t what PAF envisions.”</p><p>Other observers agree that Islamabad sees an opportunity to leverage its air force’s performance to secure defence exports and project itself as a rising middle power.</p><p>The retired air commodore involved in the JF-17 programme said combat performance remains the ultimate benchmark.</p><p>“Very few countries are making fighter jets, with most of the market dominated by Western developers who often attach many conditions to sales,” he said. “But everybody wants to diversify and avoid putting all their eggs in one basket, and that is where Pakistan comes in.”</p><p>On Bangladesh, he said Dhaka’s posture towards Pakistan has shifted sharply since a change of government in 2024.</p><p>“Such deals are not just about sale of a platform or a plane. It is a collaboration, an agreement at national level, showing strategic alignment between two countries,” he said.</p><p>Fighter jets, he added, are a long-term commitment, with service lives of three to four decades.</p><p>“If Bangladesh is getting a JF-17 or Super Mushshak trainers, you can be certain that they are in it for the long haul with training and after-sales services. They are also showing interest in Chinese J-10s, which means that strategically, they have decided who they want to align with in the future,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
