He visited for the first time in February 2025, then in September and twice in October of last year.</p><p>No other details were provided about the latest diplomatic outing. But it comes at a delicate time for relations in the Middle East.</p><p>Just this week, the US and Iran held a third round of indirect talks, this time in Switzerland, as the two sides attempt to negotiate a deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>A new round of talks is slated to take place in Austria on Monday, the day Rubio arrives in Israel.</p><p>Still, Trump used a public appearance on Friday on the White House lawn to voice frustration at the slow pace of negotiations.</p><p>“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have. I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.</p><p>“We’ll have some additional talks today. But no, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”</p><p>Trump added that he was not averse to using the military to accomplish his aims. “I’d love not to use it, but sometimes you have to. We’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Trump’s latest comments are likely to feed ongoing fears of a military escalation with Iran, a conflict that could spill into the broader region.</p><p>His remarks coincided with an email from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee to embassy staff in Israel, giving them permission to leave the country, another signal that simmering tensions might boil over.</p><p>Huckabee emphasised that those who leave “should do so TODAY”, according to media reports. He added, however, that there is “no need to panic”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://x.com/usembassyjlm/status/2027312031133499902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public notice</a> from the US Embassy in Jerusalem acknowledged the authorisation to leave and cited “safety risks” due to “terrorism and civil unrest”.</p><p>“Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,” the notice said.</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-iran-attack\">Threat of Iran attack</h2><p>Concerns have been mounting, though, that the US may seek to take military action against Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel and the US.</p><p>Since <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January</a>, the administration of US President Donald Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">deployed a “massive armada”</a> to the waters near Iran, including two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Trump has also hinted on several occasions that he is prepared to launch an attack, either to force a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities or intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters.</p><p>On January 1, for instance, Trump responded to a deadly crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in Iran by <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posting</a> a message on Truth Social.</p><p>It said that the US military was “locked and loaded and ready to go” to “rescue” any protesters who might be killed.</p><p>More recently, during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Trump described his military threats as a successful tactic in stopping the execution of protesters.</p><p>“We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that he would not be afraid to act. “I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must,” Trump said in the primetime speech, which accused Iran of having “spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate”.</p><p>On Friday, however, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk signalled that <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2026/02/our-choices-our-voices-our-votes-determine-our-future-says-turk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight protesters</a> have nevertheless been sentenced to death, and 30 more are at risk of receiving the same penalty.</p><p>Turk also warned against the possibility of military action, highlighting the risk of civilian harm.</p><p>“I am extremely alarmed about the potential for regional military escalation and its impact on civilians, and I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"pushing-for-a-deal\">Pushing for a deal</h2><p>But the protesters have not been the only motive Trump has cited for his sabre-rattling.</p><p>Trump has also indicated that military intervention may be necessary should Iran fail to agree to a nuclear deal.</p><p>On February 19, the president told reporters aboard his jet, Air Force One, that Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much maximum” to strike a deal with US negotiators.</p><p>Should it fail to, Trump indicated he would take his “maximum pressure” campaign a “step further”, appearing to imply military action.</p><p>“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump had said earlier in the day at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace panel.</p><p>Iran, meanwhile, has said its position is “close” to that of the US on many issues, but it has called for the Trump administration to drop what it considers “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iran-says-us-must-drop-excessive-demands-in-nuclear-negotiations\">excessive demands</a>“.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that the US government not only wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear programme, but it also seeks to curtail its ballistic missile arsenal and sever its relations with regional allies and proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>Iran, however, has largely dismissed those demands as unrealistic, and it has argued that its nuclear enrichment programme is designed to produce civilian energy, not weaponry.</p><p>It has also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds with another military strike.</p><p>Last June, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facility, as part of a 12-day war initiated by an Israeli attack. The Trump administration dubbed the campaign “Operation Midnight Hammer”.</p><p>The latest negotiations seek to mint a new nuclear deal following the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a multilateral agreement that saw Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>But Trump’s decision, during his first term, to withdraw the US caused the deal to fall apart. As part of his withdrawal, Trump renewed US sanctions against Iran.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-always-a-risk\">‘There’s always a risk’</h2><p>But the pressure on Iran has increased in recent days, particularly as media reports emerged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has been blocked from accessing the three sites targeted in Operation Midnight Hammer.</p><p>The agency has indicated that it cannot confirm whether Iran has suspended nuclear enrichment at the sites, nor can it estimate the size of Iran’s nuclear stockpile.</p><p>That news is likely to fuel the Trump administration’s efforts: It has long warned that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, a claim Tehran denies.</p><p>Still, the government of Oman, which is mediating the talks, issued a statement striking a positive note, following a meeting between its top diplomat and US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>“His excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clarified that the negotiations have thus far achieved significant, important and unprecedented progress, which could form the cornerstone of the desired agreement,” the statement said.</p><p>It added that Oman would continue “its efforts in supporting dialogue and facilitating rapprochement between the concerned parties” and that diplomatic efforts could resolve the impasse.</p><p>Still, as Trump prepared to travel to Texas on Friday, he was asked about the prospect of a military strike sparking a wider, drawn-out regional war with Iran.</p><p>He largely shrugged off the possibility, citing successes with Operation Midnight Hammer as well as his decision to order the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020.</p><p>“I guess you could say there’s always a risk. When there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad. We’ve had tremendous luck,” Trump replied.</p><p>Later, he added, “Everything’s worked out, and we want to keep it that way.”</p><p>He called on Iran to negotiate in “good faith and conscience”. Still, he ended with a note of scepticism: “They are not getting there.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That came on the heels of Netflix’s decision on Thursday evening that it would not match Paramount’s latest $31 per share bid or raise its offer of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros’s studio and streaming assets, stating that the deal was “no longer financially attractive”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Warner had given Netflix four business days to come up with a counteroffer for Paramount’s latest bid — but Netflix, instead, responded less than two hours later, declining to raise its proposal. It said the new price it would have to pay made the deal “no longer financially attractive”.</p><p>“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><p>The decision was welcomed by investors. Shares of the streaming giant had shed more than 18 percent since Netflix announced its deal with Warner Bros on December 5.</p><p>The latest move is a “tick in the box” for discipline, said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot.</p><p>“What you want from a management team is an ability to look at acquisitions, value them, pay what they think is a fair price, but to not overpay.”</p><p>Analysts and investors had questioned whether Netflix’s bid was a defensive attempt to block a future competitor or an offensive shift away from its historically disciplined build-versus-buy approach.</p><p>“A positive turn of events in our view, as we believe NFLX’s withdrawal from the race will leave it free to refocus on its business, while its closest competitors grapple with long and distracting regulatory approval and merger integration processes, and with PSKY saddled with sizable deal debts,” HSBC analysts said.</p><h2 id=\"hollywood-and-ego\">‘Hollywood and ego’</h2><p>Shares of the David Ellison-led Paramount, meanwhile, were up 17 percent.</p><p>Paramount’s deal, valued at $110bn, including debt, represents nearly 13 times Warner Bros’ EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or core profits – this year, according to estimates from LSEG. That is well above what Paramount is worth on the same basis, which is 7 times its estimated earnings.</p><p>A tie-up with Warner Bros would allow Paramount’s storied Hollywood studio to tap into Warner’s deep trove of intellectual property – including franchises such as Fantastic Beasts and The Matrix – across film, television and streaming.</p><p>“WBD’s largest asset is declining, and the company is still under debt from its last failed merger. But this deal is more about Ellison taking over Hollywood and ego than it is about good business sense,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer.</p><p>For Paramount’s streaming unit, a combination with HBO Max and Discovery+ would reshape its position in a streaming era long dominated by Netflix.</p><p>“Paramount was the streaming market laggard, and it needs Warner Bros’ content and capabilities to play catch-up. It will need more than Harry Potter for the deal to work its magic and enable Paramount to fight off Netflix, Disney and Amazon in the streaming wars,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium – backed by Larry Ellison, billionaire and ally of United States President Donald Trump, and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison – also boosted its termination fee to $7bn and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7bn in equity.</p><p>“There is a right price and wrong price for any acquisition, and the pressure is now on Paramount to prove the big financial outlay is worth it,” said Coatsworth.</p><h2 id=\"concerns-of-editorial-shifts\">Concerns of editorial shifts</h2><p>The proposed combination, which will still need the green light from both Warner shareholders and regulators, poses both antitrust concerns and questions of political influence.</p><p>A merger between the two companies would put CNN under the same roof as CBS, which has already seen significant editorial shifts under new Skydance ownership. Paramount took steps to appeal to more conservative viewers in its news operations, notably with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. And if the company’s takeover bid of Warner is successful, critics warn similar shifts could happen to CNN, a network that has long attracted ire from Trump.</p><p>“Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get‑go,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.</p><p>Top Democratic lawmakers have also sounded the alarm about the Republican president’s ties to companies, such as Paramount, and potential consequences of growing corporate power.</p><p>“A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime antitrust hawk, said in a statement on Thursday night. She also called a potential Paramount-Warner combo an “antitrust disaster”.</p><p>How regulators will respond to a Warner-Paramount deal remains to be seen. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so, too.</p><p>Warner shareholders will have to be convinced, too. But Paramount is taking on billions of dollars in debt to finance its offer — something critics have warned could only increase the likelihood of potential job losses and other restructuring down the road. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have also provided equity for the offer, drawing added scrutiny.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Mumbai on Friday, where he is expected to address business leaders before meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Monday to discuss a range of partnerships spanning trade,

partnership is anchored in shared democratic values, strong people-to-people ties, and expanding cooperation across diverse sectors,” said Randhir Jaiswal, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, posting on X.</p><p>The <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/27/canadian-pm-carney-heads-to-india-on-significant-trip-to-consolidate-ties\">trip</a> comes in the wake of tensions with US President Donald Trump, who imposed steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and car parts, leading Carney to speak of doubling his country’s non-US exports over the next decade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last year, Canada and India agreed to resume negotiations on a proposed free-trade agreement. Carney has previously said he wanted to more than double two-way trade with India by 2030, eyeing an annual target of $51bn.</p><p>India, for its part, is seeking to attract more overseas investments, and says Canadian pension and wealth funds have already invested $73bn.</p><p>The energy-hungry country, which is considered the world’s fastest-growing major economy, also hopes Canada can support its ambitious plan to expand nuclear power capacity.</p><h2 id=\"tensions-at-forefront-of-minds\">Tensions at ‘forefront of minds’</h2><p>During his trip, Carney will also need to work on resetting damaged <a href=\"/features/2026/2/27/no-longer-a-threat-how-canada-u-turned-on-india-ahead-of-carney-visit\">relations</a> between the two countries, which nosedived after deadly attacks against Sikh activists in Canada several years ago.</p><p>The administration of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Modi’s government of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a naturalised Canadian citizen who was part of a group advocating for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.</p><p>India has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, which sent diplomatic relations into freefall, with both nations expelling a string of top diplomats in 2024.</p><p>Asked whether Canadian concerns about transnational repression would feature at the New Delhi talks, Foreign Minister Anita Anand told reporters: “That is always at the forefront of our minds.”</p><p>After India, Carney will visit Australia, where he will address parliament and discuss military, trade and defence links.</p><p>En route back to Ottawa, Carney will meet Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and talk about boosting trade in cars, energy and critical minerals.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ahmed’s wrist-spin partner Adil Rashid stepped in, however, to have Tim Seifert stumped for 35 off 25, before off-spinner Will Jacks removed Finn Allen for 29 off 19.</p><p>Over to Ahmed, who picked up the wicket of Rachin Ravindra with his first ball in World Cup cricket. Glenn Phillips topped up the total with 39 off 28 before he became Jacks’ second wicket, while Rashid and Ahmed also went on to claim two scalps.</p><p>“We have seen what Rehan can do in the nets, and he has gone out there and taken the game away from them,” England captain Brooks said.</p><p>“We said from the start of the competition that we will select players based on conditions, and we felt today was the day to bring Rehan in – he did an amazing job.”</p><p>South Africa has already qualified from Group 1. The second spot will be decided by the result of the match between India and the West Indies on Sunday. England will face the winner of that game in the semifinals.</p><p>“We’ve already played against West Indies … both teams are very strong and powerful,” Brooks added.</p><p>“We still haven’t played the perfect game, nor had the starts we would like with the bat and ball, but we have got over the line in some very tight games and in World Cups that can help you.”</p><p>For Pakistan to leapfrog New Zealand and set up a semifinal against South Africa, they must either beat Sri Lanka by roughly 65 runs or more, or chase their target down in fewer than 13 overs. Both equations will be dependent on the outcome of the first innings of the game.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the US embassy in Jerusalem granted permission to nonemergency staff members to leave Israel amid fears of a regional war.</p><p>Abbas Aragchi made the remarks during a phone call with his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdel Ati, according to <a

class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Iran’s top diplomat said that “success on this path requires seriousness and realism on the part of the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”. He did not elaborate on what those demands are.</p><p>Aragchi’s statement tempered down previous comments where he <a href=\"https://x.com/araghchi/status/2027156363097391139/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hailed</a> “progress” at the talks and described the last round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials in Geneva as the “most intense so far”.</p><p>“It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal – including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he said.</p><p>Further negotiations will be conducted in parallel to meetings between technical teams in Vienna in the coming days, the Iranian diplomat added.</p><p>American and Iranian officials left the Swiss city following the indirect talks mediated by Oman on Thursday to consult with their respective governments.</p><p>Since resuming talks last month, the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has said he favours a diplomatic resolution to the standoff, but has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not accept a deal. The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which arrived on Friday in the Israeli port city of Haifa, according to Israeli Channel 12.</p><p>Iran has said that it was not going to initiate a war, but that it was ready to respond if attacked, threatening to strike bases used by US forces in the region.</p><p>The military build-up has left the region bracing for a potential war that could spiral into a regional conflict. On Friday, China told its citizens to evacuate from Iran “as soon as possible” and the US authorised the departure of nonemergency embassy staff from Israel – the same order Washington issued for the US mission in Lebanon earlier this week. Canada, India, UK and Poland have also issued similar orders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Wiles, a close adviser to Trump, has blamed the Republican defeats on Trump’s absence from the ballot.</p><p>\"Typically, in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting in the White House. You localise the election, and you keep federal officials out of it,\" Wiles explained to The Mom View.</p><p>\"We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot, because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.\"</p><p>Her strategy is designed to harness the strong sense of loyalty Trump has engendered in the Republican Party.</p><p>The YouGov poll found conservative voters overwhelmingly approved of his job, at a rate of 82 percent. A mid-January CBS News survey found an even higher approval rating — 90 percent — among US adults who identify as Republicans.</p><p>“Since 2016, our surveys have all been off because we underestimate the Trump vote consistently,\" said political scientist Lonna Rae Atkeson.</p><p>“Trump has definitely drawn more support from irregular voters, people who don't regularly go to the polls, during presidential elections.\"</p><p>But she questioned whether Trump's endorsement would translate into increased support for down-ballot races.</p><p>\"We haven't seen that carry over well to the midterms,” said Atkeson. “So it may not turn out well for him.”</p><p>But putting Trump \"on the ballot\", as Wiles suggests, also risks shifting the focus of the midterm races away from local issues.</p><p>Instead, experts like Gillespie believe that \"nationalising\" the midterm races could homogenise both down-ballot candidates and their policy platforms, as they seek to reflect national priorities, not local ones.</p><p>“One manifestation of polarisation in American politics is that national issues increasingly supplant local ones,” Gillespie said. “As national politics seep into state and local races, it becomes harder for federal candidates to distinguish themselves from Washington.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

United States military used a laser to shoot down a Customs and Border Protection drone, members of Congress said, and the Federal Aviation Administration responded by closing more airspace near El Paso, Texas.</p><p class=\"p1\">It is not clear why the laser was deployed, but it is the second time in two weeks that one has been fired in the area. The military is required to formally notify the FAA anytime it takes any counter-drone action inside US airspace.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">The earlier laser firing did not hit a target. It was carried out by the CBP near Fort Bliss, about 80km (50 miles) to the northwest, prompting the FAA to shut down air traffic at <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/why-was-el-paso-airspace-shut-down-drones-security-fears-and-confusion\">El Paso airport</a> and the surrounding area. This time, the closure was smaller and commercial flights were not affected.</p><p class=\"p1\">US Representative Rick Larsen and two other top Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland Security committees said they were stunned when they were officially notified.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Our heads are exploding over the news,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. They criticised the Trump administration for “sidestepping” a bipartisan bill to train drone operators and improve communication among the Pentagon, FAA and Department of Homeland Security.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence,” they said.</p><h2 id=\"government-defends-use-of-anti-drone-laser\">Government defends use of anti-drone laser</h2><p>The Pentagon, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying the military used a “counter-unmanned aircraft system … to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace”.</p><p>The statement added that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity. These agencies will continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future.</p><p class=\"p1\">“At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War, FAA, and Customs and Border Patrol are working together in an unprecedented fashion to mitigate drone threats by Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organisations at the US-Mexico Border,” the statement said. “The bottom line is the Trump Administration is doing more to secure the border and crack down on cartels than any administration in history.”</p><h2 id=\"second-texas-airspace-shut-down-this-month\" class=\"p1\">Second Texas airspace shut down this month</h2><p class=\"p1\">The El Paso shutdown two weeks ago lasted only a few hours, but it raised alarm and led to several flight cancellations in the city of nearly 700,000 people not far from the Mexican border.</p><p class=\"p1\">In that case, CBP deployed an anti-drone laser near Fort Bliss without coordinating with the FAA, which then decided to close El Paso airspace to ensure commercial air safety, according to sources familiar with what happened who were not authorised to discuss it.</p><p class=\"p1\">Afterwards, members of Congress said it appeared to be another example of government dysfunction, with different agencies failing to coordinate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he was planning to brief members of Congress sometime this week about what happened. He said at an unrelated news conference last Friday that it was not a mistake for the FAA to close the airspace over El Paso and that he does not think a communication issue caused the problems.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"lawmaker-demands-an-investigation\" class=\"p1\">Lawmaker demands an investigation</h2><p class=\"p1\">Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, the ranking member on the Senate’s Aviation Subcommittee, said this incident demands independent investigations.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The Trump administration’s incompetence continues to cause chaos in our skies,” Duckworth said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The investigation into last year’s midair collision near Washington, DC, between an airliner and an <a href=\"/news/2025/1/31/dc-plane-crash-what-we-know-about-the-victims-and-ongoing-investigation\">Army helicopter</a> that killed 67 people highlighted how the FAA and Pentagon were not always working well together.</p><p class=\"p1\">The National Transportation Safety Board said the FAA and the Army did not share safety data on the alarming number of close calls around Reagan National Airport and failed to address the risks.</p></div></div></body></html>"

India also shunned all diplomatic relations with the Taliban.</p><p>At the time, New Delhi viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. Pakistan, together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were the only three countries to have also recognised the Taliban administration at that point.</p><p>Then, in 2001, India supported the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, which toppled the Taliban administration. India then reopened its embassy in Kabul and embraced the new government led by Hamid Karzai. The Taliban, in response, attacked Indian embassies and consulates in Afghanistan. In 2008, at least 58 people were killed when the Taliban bombed India’s embassy in Kabul.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In 2021, after the Taliban returned to power, India closed its embassy in Afghanistan once again and also did not officially recognise the Taliban as the government of the country.</p><p>But a year later, as relations between Pakistan and the Taliban deteriorated over armed groups which Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harbouring, India began engaging with the Taliban.</p><p>In 2022, India sent a team of “technical experts” to run its mission in Kabul and officially reopened its embassy in the Afghan capital last October. New Delhi also allowed the Taliban to operate Afghanistan consulates in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Hyderabad.</p><p>Over the past two years, officials from New Delhi and Afghanistan have also held meetings abroad, in Kabul and in New Delhi.</p><p>In January last year, the Taliban administration’s Foreign Minister <a href=\"/features/2025/1/11/why-is-india-courting-the-taliban-now\">Amir Khan Muttaqi</a> met India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Then, in October 2025, he visited New Delhi and met Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.</p><p>After this meeting, Muttaqi told journalists that Kabul “has always sought good relations with India” and, in a joint statement, Afghanistan and India pledged to have “close communication and continue regular engagement”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4032189\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4032189\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4032189\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-11T120931Z_948224063_RC2I9HASFS47_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AFGHANISTAN-1760352721.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C553&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Taliban Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi at Darul Uloom Deoband in northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4032189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi arrives at Darul Uloom Deoband, an Islamic seminary, in Deoband in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India [File: Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Besides beefing up diplomatic ties, India has also offered humanitarian support to Afghanistan under the Taliban’s rule.</p><p>After a magnitude 6.3 <a href=\"/gallery/2025/11/3/deadly-earthquake-hits-northern-afghanistan\">earthquake</a> struck northern Afghanistan in November last year, India shipped food, medicine and vaccines, and Jaishankar was also among the first foreign ministers to call Muttaqi and offer his support.

While there is little by way of ideological convergence, there are areas of strategic convergence, which is what has pushed India to engage with the Taliban, some of their unpalatable policies notwithstanding,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-a-new-stance-towards-afghanistan\">Is this a new stance towards Afghanistan?</h2><p>No. India’s growing influence and engagement with Afghanistan began well before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.</p><p>Between December 2001 and September 2014, during the US presence in Afghanistan, New Delhi was a strong supporter of the Karzai government, and then of his successor, Ashraf Ghani’s government, which was in power from September 2014 until August 2021, when the US withdrew from the country.</p><p>In October 2011, under Karzai, India and Afghanistan renewed ties by signing an agreement to form a strategic partnership. New Delhi also pledged to support Afghanistan in the face of foreign troops in the nation as a part of this agreement.</p><p>Under both Karzai and his successor, Ghani, India invested more than $3bn in humanitarian aid and reconstruction work in Afghanistan. This included reconstruction projects like schools and hospitals, and also a new National Assembly building in Kabul, which was inaugurated in December 2015 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Afghanistan for the first time.</p><p>India’s Border Road Organisation (BRO) also assisted Afghanistan in the development of infrastructure projects like the 218km Zaranj-Delaram highway in 2009 under Karzai’s government.</p><p>Under Ghani, New Delhi undertook building the Salma Dam project to help with irrigating Afghanistan. In June 2016, when Modi visited Afghanistan once again, he inaugurated this $290m dam project. In May 2016, Iran, India and Afghanistan also signed a trilateral trade and transit agreement on the Chabahar port.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1501747\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1501747\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1501747\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ModiGhani.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi and Ghani\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1501747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hold sweets as they inaugurate Afghanistan’s new parliament building in Kabul, Afghanistan [File: Stringer/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>During this period – 2001-2021 – Pakistan’s unease with New Delhi and Kabul’s new partnership grew.</p><p>In October 2011, after signing a strategic agreement with India, Karzai had assured Islamabad that while “India is a great friend, Pakistan is a twin brother”.</p><p>But Karzai was critical of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban. In his last speech as president of Afghanistan in Kabul in September 2014, he stated that he believed most of the Taliban leadership lived in Pakistan.</p><p>In a 2011 <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/karzais-visit-india-upping-ante-south-asia#:~:text=Karzai%20walks%20a%20fine%20line,linkages%20between%20the%20two%20countries.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by a Washington, DC-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Amer Latif, former director for South Asian affairs in the US Ofﬁce of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted that Karzai was walking a “fine line between criticising Pakistan’s activities while also referring to Pakistan as Afghanistan’s ‘twin brother’.”</p><p>“It is in this context that Karzai appears to be looking to solidify long-term partnerships with countries that will aid his stabilisation efforts,” he said, referring to Karzai’s visit to India and his efforts to improve relations with the subcontinent.</p><p>When Ghani rose to power in September 2014, he tried to reset ties with Pakistan and also visited the country in November that year. But his efforts did not result in improved ties due to border disputes with Pakistan continuing until his administration was overthrown by the Taliban in August 2021.</p><h2 id=\"so-why-has-india-maintained-ties-with-afghanistan-under-the-taliban\">So why has India maintained ties with Afghanistan under the Taliban?</h2><p>Initially, when the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of the US, political analysts largely expected Pakistan to lead the way in recognising the Taliban administration as the official government of Afghanistan, improving bilateral relations which had turned icy under Karzai and Ghani.</p><p>But relations turned hostile, with Pakistan repeatedly accusing the Taliban of allowing anti-Pakistan armed groups like the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil. The Taliban denies this.</p><p>Then, the deportation of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees by Pakistan in recent years further strained ties between the two neighbours.</p><p>India has ultimately taken a pragmatic approach to the Taliban in order to maintain the good relations it built with Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, and has somewhat leveraged poor relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan to cement these.</p><p>“With Pakistan’s increasingly strained relations with Afghanistan, the logic of ‘enemy’s enemy’ is acting as a glue between Kabul and New Delhi,” International Crisis Group’s Donthi said.</p><p>He added that despite the fact that India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government opposes Islamist organisations, “the strategic necessity to counter Pakistan has led it to engage with the Taliban proactively”.</p><p>India and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals which engaged in a four-day conflict in May 2025 after armed rebels killed Indian tourists in <a href=\"/news/2025/4/23/act-of-war-what-happened-in-kashmir-attack-that-killed-26-tourists\">Pahalgam</a>, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, last April. New Delhi accused Pakistan of supporting rebel fighters, a charge Pakistan strongly denied.</p><p>For its part, Afghanistan took the opportunity to strongly condemn the Pahalgam attack and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed “deep appreciation” to the Taliban for its “strong condemnation of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam … as well as for the sincere condolences”.</p><p>India has also condemned Pakistani military action in Afghanistan and has provided aid to thousands of Afghan refugees displaced from Pakistan.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-what-is-india-s-endgame-in-afghanistan\">So what is India’s endgame in Afghanistan?</h2><p>Sharma, the OP Jindal Global University professor, said India wants to ensure that Pakistan and China, whose influence has grown in South Asia in recent years, “do not have a free run”, as “there is a divergence of interest on Afghanistan” with both Pakistan and its ally, China.</p><p>“There are security interests New Delhi is keen to further and protect for which engagement [with the Taliban] is the only option,” he added.</p><p>Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat, noted that while Afghanistan and Pakistan relations have their own dynamic, currently the Taliban leadership, even if not a monolith, refuses to play to the tunes of the Pakistan military and its intelligence agency.</p><p>“Hence they [Pakistan] accuse Indian complicity in Taliban actions in Pakistan,” he said.</p><p>But the Taliban, he said, “understands and appreciates India’s intent, policies and [humanitarian] contributions”, making its leaders keen to continue collaboration with New Delhi.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The group demands the imposition of hardline Islamic law, release of key members arrested by the government and a reversal of the merger of Pakistan’s tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, among other demands.</p><p>Another major armed group, which Pakistan alleges benefits from sanctuary in Afghanistan, is the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an organisation officially designated “terrorist” by several countries and international bodies. The group has been fighting its own war against the Pakistani state, seeking independence for the Balochistan province, which is a natural mineral-rich province in southwest Pakistan, and also shares a border with Afghanistan.</p><p>Kabul said at least 18 people were killed in Pakistani strikes last Sunday and pledged retaliation, which culminated in Thursday night’s cross-border fire.</p><p>For analysts tracking Pakistan’s escalatory ladder over the past year, Friday’s strikes were not surprising, though their scope was unprecedented.</p><p>Tariq Khan, a retired three-star general who has served extensively in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and led operations against the TTP, said this is only the beginning.</p><p>“We have not seen the peak, and there will be more to come,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Pakistan asked the Taliban to control TTP, held several talks along with Turkiye and Qatar, but it was not going to work because the Taliban refused to take responsibility,” he said.</p><p>Tameem Bahiss, a Kabul-based security analyst, said the crisis revolves around a single unresolved dispute.</p><p>“Tensions have been largely driven by Pakistan’s repeated accusations that Afghan authorities are allowing the TTP to operate from Afghan soil, which Kabul has denied,” he said.</p><p>“As long as this core issue remains unresolved, attacks will continue. From Islamabad’s perspective, these operations are framed as counterterrorism measures. From Kabul’s perspective, they are violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Bahiss told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Striking military installations in Kabul and Kandahar marks a shift from peripheral border zones to the Taliban’s administrative and ideological centres. Yet dismantling decentralised and mobile TTP networks embedded along both sides of the porous frontier remains far from guaranteed.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a security researcher at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, questioned the strategic payoff.</p><p>“Whatever has happened represents a dangerous escalation. While I understand the compulsion for Pakistan to retaliate, I do not understand the logic of how it will help address terrorism,” he said.</p><p>“It will lead to instability, and instability is precisely what terrorist networks crave, including TTP and other armed groups which have sought sanctuary in Afghanistan, and have all grown stronger as a result,” Basit told Al Jazeera. “The message is: We will not absorb hits. This is the new normal.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4342386\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4342386\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4342386\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260227__99663ZR__v1__HighRes__PakistanAfghanistanConflict-1772169379.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani soldiers patrol near the PakistanAfghanistan border crossing in Chaman on February 27, 2026, following overnight cross-border fighting between the two countries.

I think they will use both these options in large numbers, and it appears that Pakistani urban centres will see violence for the foreseeable future,” he said.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed drone attacks in three Pakistani cities, blaming the Taliban government. He said “small drones in Abbotabad, Swabi and Nowshera” were brought down. “No damage to life,” he added in his message on social media platform X.</p><p>Another variable is the TTP itself. Kabul’s most potent asymmetric card may be its capacity to restrain or loosen tolerance for TTP operations inside Pakistan.</p><p>“So far, there has been no publicly verified evidence that Kabul is providing extensive, overt military support to the TTP in response to Pakistani strikes,” Bahiss said.</p><p>Iftikhar Firdous, a security analyst and cofounder of The Khorasan Diary, a journalism platform, argued that proxy leverage lies at the heart of this confrontation.</p><p>“Even a cursory sentiment analysis of Afghan social media linked to the Taliban clearly shows the alignment in agenda and, at times, a clear call for action by proxy groups. And while they don’t have an air force, the drone warfare is an indication of what the future of conflict looks like,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4342787\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4342787\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4342787\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26058294237076-1772180710.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A villager looks at damaged solar plates and a portion following overnight cross border fighting between Pakistan and Afghan forces, at a village in Bajaur, a district of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering with Afghanistan, Friday, Feb. 27, 2026\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4342787\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A villager looks at damaged solar plates and a portion following overnight cross-border fighting between Pakistan and Afghan forces, at a village in Bajaur, a district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, on Friday, February 27, 2026 [AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-an-off-ramp\">Is there an off-ramp?</h2><p>Neither side appears to have an obvious exit from all this.</p><p>Pakistan’s operation received backing from the president, prime minister and across the political spectrum, with the government pledging to respond to any attack emanating from Afghan soil.</p><p>For the Taliban, absorbing strikes on Kabul and stepping back risks projecting weakness to fighters and the public it governs.</p><p>Basit said the threshold has already shifted.</p><p>“This has been a step-by-step escalation; not one step has been reversed, we have only moved forward. Tensions may come down temporarily, but in my calculation, there is no going back. Summer has arrived early in the Af-Pak region, and we are bracing for a bloody summer in both countries,” he said.</p><p>Bahiss said the trajectory will depend on two factors: Violence inside Pakistan and external diplomatic pressure.</p><p>“If attacks inside Pakistan continue and there is no meaningful diplomatic intervention, further rounds of escalation remain a real possibility. At this stage, there is little indication that either side is stepping back strategically,” he said.</p><p>Khan, the former general, outlined de-escalation only on Pakistan’s terms.</p><p>“One likely outcome is that the Afghan government concludes it has had enough, signals to its proxies that it is over, and eventually comes to the table. They agree to share intelligence and curtail all proxies, including TTP and others. The second option is that they do not agree and continue as they are, in which case Pakistan’s response will continue as well.”</p><h2 id=\"can-diplomacy-still-work\">Can diplomacy still work?</h2><p>The international community reacted swiftly on Friday in the wake of these tit-for-tat attacks.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to adhere to international humanitarian law and resolve differences through diplomacy.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi invoked the holy month of Ramadan, writing on X that Tehran stood “ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue”.</p><p>Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held urgent discussions with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar, who is in Riyadh on an official visit. Dar, also deputy prime minister, spoke by telephone with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p><p>But Bahiss said durable de-escalation requires more than just statements.</p><p>“A credible de-escalation process would likely involve Pakistan sharing actionable intelligence regarding alleged TTP presence inside Afghanistan, followed by verifiable steps taken by Kabul against any confirmed elements,” he said.</p><p>“The fundamental obstacle is denial and mistrust. Kabul rejects the claim that TTP operates from its territory, while Islamabad insists that it does. As long as one side frames the issue as external aggression and the other as counterterrorism necessity, bridging that gap becomes extremely difficult.”</p><p>Former military official Khan argued Pakistan’s diplomatic approach must widen beyond the Taliban to include Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces.</p><p>“Islamabad should be simultaneously talking to Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces and empowering the locals who stand against the Taliban,” he said.</p><p>Firdous, however, said any sustained de-escalation would require the same external mediators who previously facilitated talks.</p><p>“This, however, will not be possible without the intervention of the same friendly actors involved in the process, all of whom have already been in touch with both countries,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
