So until it’s clear which way this is going, and how much stability is there … the idea that the capture of Maduro will cause US oil companies to jump into Venezuela is also a myth,” Arnson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is a chance things could worsen for the Venezuelan economy before they get better, especially as it is not clear how soon – if at all – the US government will reimburse the country for its sanctioned oil.</p><p>According to Tim Hunter, senior economist for Latin America at Oxford Economics, 78 percent of the Venezuelan government’s budget is allocated to social spending.</p><p>With those finances squeezed, there could be “very quick knock-on consequences in terms of social spending, which in turn comes with a risk of social unrest”, Hunter told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Already, locals are experiencing a sharp increase in prices in some daily essentials, as Al Jazeera has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/price-hikes-queues-and-tension-venezuela-shoppers-uneasy-after-us-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, oil revenues will be key to the revival of Venezuela’s economy, said Benjamin Radd, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations.</p><p>But getting the Latin American country’s oil market ready will take massive investment in infrastructure, “so we are years away before we see any of that in Venezuela”, Radd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While Trump has pledged to “run” Venezuela and control energy sales, there has been little clarity on what that would entail.</p><p>“Trump has been very vague on this entire process,” Radd said.</p><p>A key factor is the structure of Venezuela’s government, which has been left largely in place, in contrast to the de-Ba’athification of Iraq following the US’s 2003 invasion.</p><p>“It is also not clear what is the status of the legitimacy of the current Venezuelan government, [or] what economic measures can they even undertake,” Radd said.</p><p>“There are a lot of unknowns here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in a Wednesday evening post on Truth Social, Trump announced that he would petition congressional Republicans to boost that amount to a record $1.5 trillion for fiscal year 2027.</p><p>“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855894695940909\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>Still, Trump’s threats sent stocks for defence contractors plummeting, amid uncertainty over the future of the high-stakes industry.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term, Trump has taken an aggressive, hands-on approach to private companies that have ties to national security concerns.</p><p>In June, for instance, the Trump administration <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/18/nippon-steel-acquires-us-steel-for-14-9bn-after-months-of-struggle\">was awarded a “golden share”</a> in the metal company US Steel, in exchange for <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/23/us-steel-shares-soar-on-trumps-apparent-blessing-for-deal-with-nippon\">giving a green light</a> to its merger with Japan’s Nippon Steel. That share allows the Trump administration to essentially have a veto over any major action US Steel may take to reorganise or dissolve.</p><p>Then, in August, the technology firm Intel <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/28/intel-receives-5-7bn-as-trump-administration-buys-10-percent-stake\">struck a deal to sell the US government</a> a 10-percent stake in its company, amid <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trump-calls-on-ceo-of-tech-firm-intel-to-resign-over-china-investments\">pressure</a> from Trump.</p><p>The Trump administration has continued to snap up stakes in other private firms, most notably mining companies involved in the production of rare earth minerals and other raw materials used in technology.</p><p>It is not yet clear how Trump plans to enforce his demands for the defence contractors he blasted in Wednesday’s social media messages. Nor is it certain that Trump could legally enforce his orders.</p><p>But Trump aired a list of grievances against the companies, including that their executives’ pay was simply too large.</p><p>“Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies,” he wrote at one point.</p><p>At another, he called on the private firms to invest in new construction projects, a request he has made across industries, from the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\">pharmaceutical sector</a> to <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/2/are-us-car-plants-being-built-at-record-rates-as-trump-claims\">automakers</a>.</p><p>“From this moment forward, these Executives must build NEW and MODERN Production Plants, both for delivering and maintaining this important Equipment, and for building the latest Models of future Military Equipment,” Trump said.</p><p>“Until they do so, no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.”</p><p>He also complained that the defence companies were “far too slow” in offering repairs for their equipment.</p><p>Defence contractors are responsible for a range of services and products, from software to training to missiles and tanks. RTX, for example, designed the Patriot Missile, the US’s flagship surface-to-air missile system, and it keeps the US military supplied with spare parts and other updates.</p><p>Based in Virginia, the company boasted sales exceeding $80bn in 2024. Just this week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded RTX a $438m contract to update its radar system.</p><p>Still, Trump maintained that too much of that income was going to shareholders, executive pay and stock buybacks, wherein a company purchases its own shares in order to limit their supply and increase their value.</p><p>“Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And we’re actually seeing it play out in real time,” Vance said.</p><p>“The way that we control Venezuela is we control the purse strings, we control the energy resources, and we tell the regime, ‘You’re allowed to sell the oil, so long as you serve America’s national interest.'”</p><p>But the question of who is in charge in Venezuela remains a volatile one.</p><p>Before dawn on Saturday, the Trump administration launched a military offensive in Venezuela to capture and remove President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, describing the couple’s abduction as a law enforcement operation.</p><p>Maduro and Flores have since been transported to New York City, where they face charges that they oversaw the shipment of “tons of cocaine into the United States”.</p><p>In the hours immediately after the attack, it was unclear whether the Trump administration would seek to expel the remnants of the Maduro government.</p><p>Trump delivered a news conference from his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, claiming that the country was under US control.</p><p>“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said from his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p><p>“We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rodriguez-maintains-no-foreign-agent-in-charge\">Rodriguez maintains ‘no foreign agent’ in charge</h2><p>Since then, however, the Trump administration has signalled it would prioritise stability in Venezuela over quickly installing new leadership. It has declined to set a timeline for new elections.</p><p>“ It’s too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now,” Leavitt said on Wednesday.</p><p>Earlier this week, Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, was officially sworn in as Venezuela’s interim leader, and the Trump administration has indicated it would work with her as it pursues the extraction and sale of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Still, Rodriguez’s government and the Trump administration have described their relationship in starkly different terms.</p><p>According to the Trump White House, Rodriguez is answerable to US demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.</p><p>On Wednesday, Leavitt echoed that position, saying that the US would wield influence over Venezuela’s decisions.</p><p>“We obviously have maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela right now,” she said.</p><p>Already, in a Tuesday night <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115850817778602689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on Truth Social, Trump announced that Venezuela would be surrendering 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, so that the US could sell it on the international market.</p><p>“That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,” Trump wrote.</p><p>The Rodriguez government, meanwhile, has repeatedly denied that the US is puppeteering its decisions.</p><p>Though Rodriguez has, at times, struck a conciliatory posture towards the Trump administration, she has rejected the idea that foreign powers are leading the country.</p><p>“We are here governing together with the people,” Rodriguez said in remarks broadcast on state television.</p><p>“The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no one else. There is no foreign agent governing Venezuela.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-continuation-of-maduro-era-policies\">A continuation of Maduro-era policies?</h2><p>Like Maduro before her, Rodriguez is part of a political movement founded by the late socialist President Hugo Chavez, known as “chavismo”.</p><p>As a “chavista”, Rodriguez has spoken out against US imperialism in Latin America, and she denounced the recent abduction of Maduro — Chavez’s handpicked successor — and his wife as an unwarranted “kidnapping” and a “brutal attack”.</p><p>Chavez is also seen as a key figure in the nationalisation of Venezuelan oil, expanding state control over the country’s rich petroleum reserves during his time as president.</p><p>Trump and his officials have called such efforts, including the 2007 expropriation of foreign oil assets, as an act of theft against the US.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration has described Rodriguez’s government as cooperative so far.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether behind-the-scenes demands — including reports that Trump has asked Rodriguez to sever ties with key allies, including Russia, China, Cuba and Iran — will lead to public discord.</p><p>“The president has made it very clear that this is a country within the Western Hemisphere, close by the United States, that is no longer going to be sending illegal drugs to the United States of America,” Leavitt said.</p><p>“The president is fully deploying his ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy agenda.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Rodriguez government has continued Maduro’s campaign of stifling internal dissent, according to human rights monitors.</p><p>As part of an emergency declaration, the interim president authorised Venezuelan law enforcement to detain those who supported Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>The nonprofit Foro Penal has reported that, on January 5, in the wake of the US attacks, Venezuelan authorities arrested 14 journalists, all of whom were eventually released. One was deported.</p><p>Another human rights group, Caleidoscopio Humano, has announced that two elderly men from the state of Merida were also arrested for celebrating Maduro’s capture by firing guns into the air.</p><p>The international community has long denounced the human rights abuses in Venezuela. But the US has also faced broad criticism for its attack to remove Maduro, which has been denounced as a violation of sovereignty.</p><p>On Wednesday, a group of United Nations experts <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/un-experts-condemn-us-aggression-against-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> that Trump’s actions constitute an “international crime of aggression”.</p><p>“These actions represent a grave, manifest and deliberate violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, set a dangerous precedent, and risk destabilising the entire region and the world,” they wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Three other protesters, all reported to be teenagers, were injured in the incident. Israeli media reports say the bus driver had previously been attacked by demonstrators before driving into the crowd.</p><p>Netanyahu issued a statement on Wednesday morning, pledging that the incident would be thoroughly investigated and urging “restraint to prevent the mood from becoming further inflamed so that, heaven forbid, we do not have additional tragedies”.</p><p></p><p>Anger over the exemption of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox students dates back to early attempts in 1999 to formalise what had previously been a de facto arrangement, with Haredi leaders arguing that young men should be allowed to focus on full-time religious study to preserve Jewish law and tradition, rather than be conscripted to join the army, as other Israeli Jews are.</p><p>However, legal challenges to the exemption, most recently from the Supreme Court late last year demanding that Haredi recruitment be enforced, combined with reports of manpower shortages linked to Israel’s military conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight.</p><p>Polls show broad public support for the ending of the exemption, a notion publicly backed by Netanyahu. But two of the prime minister’s key coalition partners, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and Shas, have repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the government or vote against the state budget, triggering new elections, unless legislation is passed preserving Haredi exemptions or limiting conscription for students at Israel’s ultra-Orthodox schools, known as yeshivas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“You need to remember, these aren’t political parties in the conventional sense,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said, characterising UTJ and Shas as operating to the benefit of their community and not wider society. “They are elected as parties to operate as pressure groups inside the Knesset [parliament]. They know that no one outside of their own ultra-Orthodox community will vote for them, and they really have no interest in persuading them to do so.”</p><p>“All they have is their own religious base, with a proportion in society that is constantly increasing,” added Mekelberg. “Preserving that base, for the large part, is about keeping them out of the army where they might encounter different types of approaches to religion, including secularism, which their rabbis are afraid would tempt and corrupt them.”</p><h2 id=\"bitter-debate\">Bitter debate</h2><p>Despite the limited deaths, the Israeli army has incurred compared to the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed during its genocidal war on Gaza, anger over the Haredi communities’ apparent exemption from the draft has grown among a society <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/two-years-into-its-war-on-gaza-israel-is-fractured-isolated-analysts\">fractured</a> from two years of unrelenting conflict.</p><p>An autumn poll last year showed an overwhelming number of Israeli respondents saw the societal schism between secular and ultra-Orthodox Israelis as one of the most divisive issues facing contemporary Israel.</p><p>Responding to the death of Eisenthal, UTJ’s Meir Porush told reporters, “It is impossible to ignore the fact that more than once during demonstrations by the ultra-Orthodox public, there is a public atmosphere that it is permissible to harm the demonstrators.”</p><p>“The situation in which incitement is rampant against the ultra-Orthodox public is causing Jews to fear for their safety in the Land of Israel,” Porush continued. “I call on all public leaders to call for an end to the harm and incitement against the ultra-Orthodox public.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-22T172528Z_145204992_RC25HHAT7N13_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-CONSCRIPTION-PROTEST-1765889244.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An Israeli police officer pulls an ultra-Orthodox Jew during a protest.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police clash with ultra-orthodox protesters during a previous protest over compulsory enlistment in West Jerusalem [Ammar Awad/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>“There’s very little sympathy for the ultra-Orthodox among much of Israeli society,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst, said. “They’ve gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the rest of the population, so most people don’t really care … Israeli society is broken.”</p><h2 id=\"divisive\">Divisive</h2><p>From Israel’s creation in 1948, a handful of highly skilled ultra-Orthodox scholars were granted exemptions from Israel’s mandatory military service, which applies to most Jewish citizens. However, over the years, the influence of influential religious parties, such as Shas and UTJ, has led to a significant increase in the number of military exemptions, currently estimated at about 90 percent of the <a href=\"/features/2024/7/21/who-are-israels-ultra-orthodox-and-will-conscripting-them-sow-discord\">13,000 ultra-Orthodox</a> men who reach conscription age each year.</p><p>While Shas and UTJ only hold 18 seats in the parliament, the fractured nature of Israeli politics and Netanyahu’s reliance upon the right have given the ultra-Orthodox a disproportionate level of influence.</p><p>“It’s true that they don’t have many seats, but Netanyahu absolutely needs their support to maintain his coalition and remain prime minister,” Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. “It’s true that the ultra-Orthodox parties also need Netanyahu and his government to have any power and relevance in their own communities. But the draft issue is everything. To them, if they lose this: they have nothing.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3898351\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3898351\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250819__69XX4R6__v2__HighRes__TopshotIsraelPoliticsMilitaryReligion-1755640109.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man stands in front of a burning fire during a protest against Israeli army conscription in Kfar Yona [John Wessels/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"increasing-influence\">Increasing influence</h2><p>Across Israel, the Haredi are a growing social and political constituency, with both their political heft and the influence of religion across society increasing as their numbers do.</p><p>In 2009, the Haredi made up 9.9 percent of Israel’s population. By 2065, they are forecast to make up more than 30 percent. Alongside this growth, ultra-Orthodox parties are making sure their members’ interests are served and that they remain loyal: all of which could spell problems for Israel’s future.</p><p>“Parties like Shas and UTJ rely on keeping its younger members religious and reliant upon benefits,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>“This is a serious problem, because their numbers are growing,” he added. “An ultra-Orthodox family will typically have six to seven children. It’s unlikely that any of the boys will ever study core subjects like maths or science. Instead, they’ll go to the yeshiva and live off benefits. This is a real demographic problem. And this isn’t a future problem. It’s one that’s happening now.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bulls***,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a fiery news conference.</p><p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz also decried the shooting as “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable”. He urged anyone participating in protests to remain peaceful, adding he had put the state’s National Guard on alert.</p><p>“I feel your anger,” he told Minnesotans at a separate news conference.</p><p>The shooting took place in a modest neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area.</p><p>Notably, the area was just 1.6km (one mile) from where <a href=\"/news/2020/6/3/what-happened-the-day-george-floyd-died-in-police-custody\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by policeman Derek Chauvin in May 2020, sparking mass Black Lives Matter protests during Trump’s first presidency.</p><h2 id=\"defensive-shots\">‘Defensive Shots’</h2><p>Authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), are investigating the shooting, which took place after agents on foot surrounded a car on a snow-lined street, according to video shared online of the incident.</p><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed that Good was targeting agents when she was killed, alleging she had “weaponised” ⁠her vehicle.</p><p>“An ICE officer, fearing for ​his ‌life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and ‌the safety of ‌the public, ⁠fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin wrote in a post ‌on the social media platform X, calling the incident an “act of domestic terrorism”.</p><p>After the gunfire, Good’s SUV could be seen with a bullet hole through its windshield and blood splattered ‌across the headrest.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the woman killed was a “professional agitator”. He broadly blamed the situation on the “radical left”, an amorphous label he regularly applies to critics of his policies.</p><p>But a witness at the scene said that Good had been trying to leave when she was shot.</p><p>Emily Heller, who said the incident unfolded near her home, told Minnesota Public Radio that she heard ICE agents tell the driver, “Get out of here.”</p><p>“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like, his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller said.</p><p>Venus de Mars, 65, who also lives nearby, described watching paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car.

It reaffirmed its commitment to streaming giant Netflix’s $82.7bn deal for the film and television studio and other assets.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Some investors, however, pushed back on Warner Bros. Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said that the media giant’s board had “made an error” by not considering Paramount’s bid.</p><p>On CNBC on Wednesday, Halbower called the deal “economically superior”.</p><p>Paramount’s financing plan would saddle the smaller Hollywood studio with $87bn in debt once the acquisition closes, making it the largest leveraged buyout in history, the Warner Bros board told shareholders after voting against the $30-per-share cash offer on Tuesday. The letter accompanied a 67-page amended merger filing that laid out its case for rejecting Paramount’s offer.</p><h2 id=\"paramount-deal-remains-inadequate\">Paramount deal ‘remains inadequate’</h2><p>The revised Paramount offer “remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in Paramount Skydance ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should Paramount Skydance fail to complete the offer”, the Warner Bros board wrote.</p><p>Paramount, which has a market value of about $14bn, proposed to use $40bn in equity, which would be personally guaranteed by Oracle’s billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David is Paramount’s CEO, and $54bn in debt to finance the deal.</p><p>Its financing plan would further weaken its credit rating, which S&amp;P Global already rates at junk levels, and strain its cash flow – heightening the risk that the deal will not close, the Warner Bros board said. Netflix, which has offered $27.75 a share in cash and stock, has a $400bn market value and investment-grade credit rating.</p><p>The decision keeps Warner Bros on track to pursue the deal with Netflix, even after Paramount amended its bid on December 22 to address the earlier concerns about the lack of a personal guarantee from Ellison, who is Paramount’s controlling shareholder.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount and Netflix have been vying to win control of Warner Bros, and with it, its prized film and television studios and its extensive content library. Its lucrative entertainment franchises include  Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, and the DC Comics universe; as well as coveted classic films such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-applauds\">Netflix applauds</h2><p>Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters welcomed Warner Bros’ decision on Wednesday, saying it recognises the streaming giant’s deal “as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry”.</p><p>Warner Bros Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC that the company was not currently in talks with Paramount but remains open to a transaction with the Ellison-led firm, and both the deals have a path to regulatory approval.</p><p>“From our perspective, they’ve got to put something on the table that is compelling,” he said, referring to the Paramount offer.</p><p>Wednesday’s filing said Warner Bros’ board met on December 23 to review Paramount’s amended offer and noted some improvements, including Ellison’s personal guarantee and a higher reverse termination fee of $5.8bn, but found “significant costs” associated with Paramount’s bid compared with a Netflix deal.</p><p>Warner Bros would be obligated to pay the streaming service a $2.8bn termination fee for abandoning its merger agreement with Netflix, $1.5bn in fees to its lenders and about $350m in additional financing costs. Altogether, Warner Bros said it would incur about $4.7bn in additional costs to terminate its deal with Netflix, or $1.79 per share.</p><p>The board repeated some concerns it had laid out on December 17, such as that Paramount would impose operating restrictions on the studio that would harm its business and competitive position, including barring the planned spin-out of the company’s cable television networks into a separate public company, Discovery Global.</p><p>Paramount offered “insufficient compensation” for the damage done to the studio’s business, if the Paramount deal failed to close, Warner Bros said.</p><p>Paramount “repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal” to Warner Bros shareholders, the board wrote, “despite clear direction” on the deficiencies in its bid and potential solutions.</p><p>The jockeying for Warner Bros has become Hollywood’s most closely watched takeover battle, as studios race to scale up amid intensifying competition from streaming platforms and volatile theatrical revenues.</p><p>While Netflix’s offer has a lower headline value, analysts have said it presents a clearer financing structure and fewer execution risks than Paramount’s bid for the entire company, including its cable TV business.</p><p>“WBD does not want to sell to Paramount, so it will keep rejecting Paramount as long as it is able to,” said Ross Benes, an analyst at eMarketer.</p><p>“But this process is not over … Paramount will have opportunity to make further attempts.”</p><p>Harris Oakmark, Warner Bros’ fifth-largest investor, previously told Reuters that Paramount’s revised offer was not “sufficient”, noting it was not enough to cover the breakup fee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount has argued its bid would face fewer regulatory obstacles, but a combined Paramount-Warner Bros entity would create a formidable competitor to industry leader Disney and merge two major television operators and two streaming services.</p><p>The valuation of Warner Bros’ planned Discovery Global spin-off, which includes cable television networks CNN, TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service, is seen as a major sticking point. Analysts peg the cable channels’ value at up to $4 per share, while Paramount has suggested just $1.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about further consolidation in the media industry, and US President Donald Trump has said he plans to <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weigh in</a> on the landmark acquisition.</p><p>On Wall Street, Warner Bros Discovery is up 0.3 percent in midday trading amid the news of the rejected bid. Netflix is also up 0.3. Meanwhile, Paramount is down 0.1 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on January 4.</p><p>The White House statement on Tuesday fleshed out further details on how the US would go about its acquisition of Greenland.</p><p>“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House statement says.</p><p>Over the course of his second term, Trump has talked about wanting Greenland for national security reasons multiple times.</p><p>“We need Greenland for international safety and security. We need it. We have to have it,” he <a href=\"/news/2025/3/28/is-trumps-greenland-plan-part-of-a-scramble-for-the-arctic\">said</a> in March.</p><p>Since 1979, Greenland has been a self-governing territory of Denmark, and since 2009, it has had the right to declare independence through a referendum.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to take control of the island, which hosts a US military base. He first voiced this desire in 2019, during his first term as US president.</p><p>As a response, leaders from Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly said that Greenland is not for sale. They have made it clear that they are especially not interested in becoming part of the US.</p><p>On January 4, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, “It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the US needing to take over Greenland.”</p><p>“The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom,” she said, alluding to the Faroe Islands, which, like Greenland, are also a Danish territory.</p><p>“I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.</p><p>US special forces <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/abduction_n?tl=true\">abducted</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during an operation in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on January 3.</p><p>Hours later, Katie Miller, the wife of close Trump aide and US Homeland Security Advisor <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">Stephen Miller</a>, posted a photo on X showing the US flag imposed on the map of Greenland.</p><p></p><p>Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen hit back in an X post, writing, “Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights.”</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland-so-badly\">Why does Trump want Greenland so badly?</h2><p>The location and natural resources of the Arctic island make it strategically important for Washington.</p><p>Greenland is geographically part of North America, located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It is home to some 56,000 residents, mostly <a href=\"/program/witness/2021/6/17/the-fight-for-greenland-a-new-generation-speaks\">Indigenous Inuit people</a>.</p><p>It is the world’s largest island. Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, is closer to New York City  – some 2,900km (1,800 miles) away – than the Danish capital Copenhagen, which is located 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>Greenland, a NATO territory through Denmark, is an EU-associated overseas country and territory whose residents remain European Union citizens, having joined the European Community with Denmark in 1973 but having withdrawn in 1985.</p><p>“It’s really tricky if the United States decides to use military power to take over Greenland. Denmark is a member of NATO; the United States is a member as well. It really calls into question what the purpose of the military alliance is, if that happens,” Melinda Haring, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Greenland offers the shortest route from North America to Europe. This gives the US a strategic upper hand for its military and its ballistic missile early-warning system.</p><p>The US has expressed interest in expanding its military presence in Greenland by placing radars in the waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom. These waters are a gateway for Russian and Chinese vessels, which Washington aims to track.</p><p>The island is also incredibly rich in minerals, including rare earth minerals used in the high-tech industry and in the manufacture of batteries.</p><p>According to a 2023 survey, 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland.</p><p>Greenland does not carry out the extraction of oil and gas, and its mining sector is opposed by its Indigenous population. The island’s economy is largely reliant on its fishing industry.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3429559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greenland-Map-jan-8-2024-1736341778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Where is Greenland Map\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"are-chinese-and-russian-ships-swarming-greenland\">Are Chinese and Russian ships swarming Greenland?</h2><p>However, while Trump has spoken of Russian and Chinese ships around Greenland, currently, facts don’t bear that out.</p><p>Vessel tracking data from maritime data and intelligence websites such as MarineTraffic do not show the presence of Chinese or Russian ships near Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"are-russia-and-china-a-threat-to-greenland\">Are Russia and China a threat to Greenland?</h2><p>The ships’ location aside, Trump’s rhetoric comes amid a heightened <a href=\"/news/2025/3/28/is-trumps-greenland-plan-part-of-a-scramble-for-the-arctic\">scramble</a> for the Arctic.</p><p>Amid global warming, the vast untapped resources of the Arctic are becoming more accessible. Countries like the US, Canada, China and Russia are now eyeing these resources.</p><p>“Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernising military infrastructure,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said during an address in March 2025 at the International Arctic Forum in the Russian city of Murmansk, the largest city within the Arctic Circle.</p><p>During this address, Putin said that he believed Trump was serious about taking Greenland and that the US will continue with efforts to acquire it.</p><p>In December 2024, <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/why-is-canada-scrambling-to-counter-russia-china-in-the-arctic\">Canada released a policy document</a> detailing plans to ramp up its military and diplomatic presence in the Arctic. Russia is also <a href=\"/features/2022/3/28/what-is-behind-russias-interest-in-a-warming-arctic\">constructing military installations</a> and power plants in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia and China have been <a href=\"/news/2024/7/23/us-wary-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-increasingly-strategic-arctic\">working together</a> to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions while <a href=\"/program/101-east/2022/3/3/behind-chinas-rise-in-the-arctic\">Beijing seeks an alternative shipping route</a> to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca.</p><p>The Northern Sea Route (NSR), a maritime route in the Arctic Ocean, is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice. The NSR can cut shipping trips significantly short. Russia is hoping to ramp up commerce through the NSR to trade more with Asia than Europe due to Western sanctions. Last year, the number of oil shipments from Russia to China via the NSR rose by a quarter.</p><p>China is also probing the region, and has sent 10 scientific expeditions to the Arctic and built research vessels to survey the icy waters north of Russia.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">made similar claims</a> in recent days.</span></p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-the-us-to-take-venezuelan-oil\">What does it mean for the US to take Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>Oil is trading at roughly $56 per barrel.</p><p>Based on this price, 30 million barrels of oil would be worth $1.68bn and 50 million barrels of oil would be worth $2.8bn.</p><p>“Trump’s statement about oil in Venezuela is beyond an act of war; it is an act of colonisation. That is also illegal based on the UN Charter,” Vijay Prashad, the director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research based in Argentina, Brazil, India, and South Africa, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that the US involvement in Venezuela was “less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits”.</p><p>“This [oil] is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources.”</p><p>According to the website of the US Energy Information Administration, the US consumed an average of 20.25 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2023.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-rubio-said-about-venezuelan-oil\">What has Rubio said about Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>In an interview on the NBC TV network’s Meet the Press programme that aired on Sunday, Rubio said: “We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela.”</p><p>“No more drug trafficking … and no more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world and not benefitting the people of Venezuela or, frankly, benefitting the United States and the region,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio said in the interview that since 2014, about eight million Venezuelans have fled the country, which he attributed to theft and corruption by Maduro and his allies. According to a report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from May, nearly 7.9 million people have indeed left Venezuela.</p><p>But he was silent on the US’s own role in creating that crisis.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-us-sanctions-against-venezuela-s-oil\">What are the US sanctions against Venezuela’s oil?</h2><p>Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 under then-President Carlos Andres Perez during an oil boom. He established the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) to control all oil resources.</p><p>Venezuela continued to be a major oil exporter to the US for some years, supplying 1.5 million to 2 million barrels per day in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>After President Hugo Chavez took office in 1998, he nationalised all oil assets, seized foreign-owned assets, restructured the PDVSA and prioritised using oil revenue for social programmes in Venezuela.</p><p>From 2003 to 2007, Venezuela under Chavez managed to <a href=\"https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/93923/weisbrot_revista_fall_08.pdf\">cut its poverty rate in half</a> – from 57 percent to 27.5 percent. Extreme poverty fell even more sharply, by 70 percent.</p><p>But exports declined, and government authorities were accused of mismanagement.</p><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil in retaliation for nationalising US oil assets in 2005.</p><p>Under US sanctions, many senior Venezuelan government officials and companies have been barred from accessing any property or financial assets held in the US. They cannot access US bank accounts, sell property or access their money if it passes through the US financial system.</p><p>Critically, any US companies or citizens doing business with any sanctioned individual or company will be penalised and risk becoming subject to enforcement actions.</p><p>Maduro took over as president in 2013 after Chavez’s death. In 2017, Trump, during his first term in office, imposed more sanctions and tightened them again in 2019. This further restricted sales to the US and access for Venezuelan companies to the global financial system. As a result, oil exports to the US nearly stopped, and Venezuela shifted its trade mainly to China with some sales to India and Cuba.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-family-venezuelan-tankers-what-we-know\">imposed yet more sanctions</a> – this time on Maduro family members and Venezuelan tankers carrying sanctioned oil.</p><p>Today, the PDVSA controls the petroleum industry in Venezuela, and US involvement in Venezuelan oil drilling is limited. Houston-based Chevron is the only US company that still operates in Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-hurt-venezuela-s-oil-flows\">How have sanctions hurt Venezuela’s oil flows?</h2><p>Trump might today be interested in getting Venezuelan oil flowing, but it is US sanctions that blocked that flow in the first place.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a region in the eastern part of the country stretching across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>While the country is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels – it earns only a fraction of the revenue it once did from exporting crude.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, Venezuela exported $4.05bn of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn).</p><h2 id=\"how-have-us-sanctions-hurt-venezuelans-and-the-country-s-oil-infrastructure\">How have US sanctions hurt Venezuelans and the country’s oil infrastructure?</h2><p>The US sanctions on Venezuelan oil prevent US and non-US companies from doing business with the PDVSA. Because the US is a market no one wants to lose, firms, including banks, are wary of taking any steps that could invite Washington’s sanctions.</p><p>In effect, that has meant Venezuela’s oil industry has been almost entirely deprived of international financial investment.</p><p>The sanctions additionally restrict Venezuela from accessing oilfield equipment, specialised software, drilling services and refinery components from Western companies.</p><p>This has resulted in years of underinvestment in the PDVSA’s infrastructure, leading to chronic breakdowns, shutdowns and accidents.</p><p>The sanctions have also resulted in broader economic turmoil.</p><p>The country’s gross domestic product per capita stood at about $4,200 in 2024, according to World Bank data, down from more than $13,600 in 2010.</p><p>From about 2012, the economy went into a sharp decline, driven by domestic economic policies, a slump that was later deepened by US sanctions. The resulting hardships have pushed millions of Venezuelans to leave the country – the same people who Trump and Rubio now argue should benefit from Venezuela’s oil revenues.</p><h2 id=\"does-the-us-have-any-claim-to-venezuelan-oil\">Does the US have any claim to Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>US companies began drilling for oil in Venezuela in the early 1900s.</p><p>In 1922, vast petroleum reserves were initially discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in Lake Maracaibo in Zulia state in northwestern Venezuela.</p><p>At this point, US companies ramped up their investments in the extraction and development of Venezuelan oil reserves. Companies such as Standard Oil led development under concession agreements, propelling Venezuela to a position as a key global supplier, especially for the US.</p><p>Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC, joining at its creation on September 14, 1960. OPEC is a group of major oil-exporting countries that work together to manage supply and influence global oil prices.</p><p>But the claims by Trump and Miller that Venezuela somehow “stole” US oil are baseless under international law, experts said.</p><p>The principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, adopted by the UN General Assembly in a resolution in 1962, is clear that sovereign states have the inherent right to control, use and dispose of their resources for their own development.</p><p>In other words, Venezuela alone owns its oil.</p></div></div></body></html>"
