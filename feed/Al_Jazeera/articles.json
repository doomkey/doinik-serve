The move risks derailing an accord that has been 25 years in the making.</p><p>The EU’s trade agreement with Mercosur, which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, was concluded a year ago but still awaits ratification. It is intended to expand access to overseas markets for European exporters struggling with tariffs imposed recently by the United States and rising competition from China.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>However, the pact has met strong opposition from farmers across Europe, who worry that a flood of cheap agricultural imports produced under the more relaxed environmental and agricultural standards of some South American countries will put them under too much pressure.</p><p>Securing a resolution to this is viewed by some as a test of Europe’s ability to act as a unified bloc, shortly after US President <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/trump-slams-europes-immigration-policies-calls-continent-weak\">Donald Trump hit out at EU leaders</a> for being “weak” and warning of “civilisational erasure” across the bloc.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-in-the-eu-mercosur-trade-deal\">What is in the EU-Mercosur trade deal?</h2><p>Once ratified, the trade deal between the European and South American blocs would be the largest free-trade agreement brokered by Brussels in terms of tariff relief.</p><p>While talks initially began in 1999, progress has been repeatedly stalled by competing interests. For years, EU farmers voiced concerns about excessively cheap agricultural imports, while environmentalists have raised objections over deforestation in the Amazon.</p><p>Designed to cut tariffs and boost trade in goods and services between the two blocs, Mercosur would allow the EU to export more vehicles, machinery and wines to South America, in exchange for easing the entry of beef, sugar, soya beans and rice from the region into Europe.</p><p>At present, tariffs between the two blocs are high – Mercosur levies up to 35 percent on EU cars, machinery and food, while the EU imposes steep duties of up to roughly 15 percent on South American farmed goods.</p><p>This agreement would phase out most of these tariffs over time, but not all. Several key agricultural products would be managed through quotas and partial tariff reductions. Still, critics worry that it gives away too much to the Mercosur countries and would flood Europe’s markets with cheap South American commodities.</p><p>The EU is Mercosur’s second-largest trading partner in goods, with exports worth 57 billion euros ($67bn) in 2024, according to the European Commission. The EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Mercosur, with a stock of 390 billion euros ($458bn) in 2023.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is due to travel to Brazil on Monday next week to sign the agreement and create the world’s largest free-trade area.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-france-hoping-to-delay-ratification\">Why is France hoping to delay ratification?</h2><p>France, the EU’s largest agricultural producer, has been trying to rally other EU member states to form a blocking minority against the deal. It wants more robust safeguards for farmers added to the accord<span>.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, as many as 10,000 farmers are expected to descend on Brussels, the Belgian capital and the de facto capital of the EU, to protest against the deal during the bloc leaders’ summit on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>The European Commission proposed protective measures, such as the suspension of Mercosur imports if inbound goods volumes rose by more than 10 percent or prices fell by the same amount. However, France describes these safeguards as “incomplete”.</p><p>On Sunday, in an interview with the German financial daily Handelsblatt, French Economy Minister Roland Lescure said the treaty, as it stands, “is simply not acceptable”.</p><p>The same day, French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu called on the EU to delay a vote planned in Brussels, ahead of von der Leyen’s visit to Brazil on December 20, where she is expected to sign the agreement.</p><p>The timing of the Mercosur vote coincides with efforts by Lecornu’s minority government to secure <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/frances-prime-minister-faces-crunch-vote-in-parliament\">parliamentary approval for a budget</a>, including suspending President Emmanuel Macron’s controversial <a href=\"/news/2023/3/7/pension-reforms-protests-in-france-what-you-need-to-know\">pension reform</a>, before the end of 2025.</p><p>It also follows an outbreak of lumpy skin disease – a highly contagious livestock virus – in France over the summer, which has resulted in animal culls and protests by cattle farmers against what they see as overly strict measures.</p><p>Opposition to the trade deal is deeply rooted in France, with both far-right and far-left parties presenting it as evidence that Paris is yielding to Brussels at the expense of rural communities.</p><p>France has set out three conditions for approving the agreement: safeguard mechanisms allowing imports to be stopped in cases of dumping, “mirror clauses” requiring Mercosur products to comply with EU rules on pesticides, and tighter food safety inspections.</p><p>But if France’s terms are not met, it could try to block the agreement altogether.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-could-the-deal-be-blocked\">How could the deal be blocked?</h2><p>By voting it down.</p><p>Denmark, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency under which member states take turns setting the collective agenda, will have to decide whether to press ahead with a vote this week as planned.</p><p>If Denmark defies the dissenting countries, the agreement could be shot down. A blocking minority requires support from at least four member states representing 35 percent of the EU’s population. Ireland, Poland, Hungary and Austria have openly opposed the Mercosur deal.</p><p>Together with France, this group of countries represents more than one-third of the EU’s population – enough to form a minority bloc.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-other-eu-member-states-saying\">What are other EU member states saying?</h2><p>Elsewhere in Europe, reactions reflect existing splits. Poland, Hungary, Austria and Ireland have voiced support for France’s position. “Any postponement is a very good signal,” said Polish Agriculture Minister Stefan Krajewski.</p><p>The Netherlands has yet to declare its position.</p><p>European Commission deputy chief spokesperson Olof Gill told reporters on X: “In the view of the Commission signing the deal now is a matter of crucial importance economically, diplomatically, and geopolitically, but also in term of our credibility on the global stage.”</p><p>Echoing that sentiment, Volker Treier of the German Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, said: “The EU must not miss the opportunity to strengthen ties with key trade and raw material partners in South America and to reduce existing trade barriers.”</p><p>Responding to France’s stance, the European Commission said it still expects to sign the deal by the end of the year. “In the view of the Commission, signing the deal now is a matter of crucial importance – economically, diplomatically and geopolitically,” it said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"have-eu-members-objected-to-the-deal-on-other-grounds\">Have EU members objected to the deal on other grounds?</h2><p>Yes. Several EU members have also objected to the deal on environmental grounds, arguing that Brazil has failed to do enough to protect the Amazon rainforest. Critics point to recent spikes in deforestation rates and forest fires, and warn that boosting beef exports could lead to more land clearing.</p><p>At the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, in August 2019, the then‑European Commission President, Donald Tusk, said: “It is hard to imagine a harmonious process of ratification [of the deal] … as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction of the green lungs of Planet Earth.”</p><p>France, Austria and others have also said they will not back the deal without stronger, enforceable safeguards on climate and biodiversity. In response, the EU has sought additional assurances and side instruments committing Mercosur countries to uphold the 2015 <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out\">Paris climate agreement</a>, to which nearly all United Nations member states are signatories.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He grabs the attacker from behind, twists him around and disarms him. He then lifts the gun and points it at the attacker, who has fallen to the ground. The attacker gets up and backs away, eventually leaving the scene.</p><p>Al-Ahmed is an Australian Muslim citizen of Syrian origin, and comes from the village of al-Nayrab, near Idlib in Syria, a relative of his, who identified himself as Mustafa Asad, told the Al Araby television network. Al-Ahmed is understood to have moved to Australia in 2006.</p><p>Al-Ahmed was having lunch in the area when the shooting took place, and he intervened, his brother, Huthaifa, told Australian public broadcaster ABC.</p><p>“I’m really proud about my brother,” Huthaifa told ABC.</p><p>Several social media accounts around the world tried to discredit al-Ahmed, claiming variously that he was a Lebanese Maronite Christian or a Jewish man.

We’re working directly with organizers to ensure funds safely reach Ahmed &amp; his family.

And so deeply inspired by his example.”</p><p>New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also held al-Ahmed up as an example of courage against hate.</p><p>“On Bondi Beach today, as men with long guns targeted innocents, another man ran towards the gunfire and disarmed a shooter,” Mamdani wrote.</p><p>“Tonight, as Jewish New Yorkers light menorahs and usher in a first night of Hanukkah clouded by grief, let us look to his example and confront hatred with the urgency and action it demands.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The small group of putschists, on the one hand, declared victory, but Benin’s forces and government officials said the plot had failed.</p><p>By evening, the situation was clear – Benin’s government was still standing. President Patrice Talon and loyalist forces in the army had managed to hold control, thanks to help from the country’s bigger neighbours, particularly its eastern ally and regional power, Nigeria.</p><p>While Talon now enjoys victory as the president who could not be unseated, the spotlight is also on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The regional bloc rallied to save the day in Benin after their seeming resignation in the face of the crises rocking the region, including just last month, when the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/guinea-bissau-coup-what-happened-why-it-matters-what-happens-next\">military took power in Guinea-Bissau</a>.</p><p>This time, though, after much criticism and embarrassment, ECOWAS was ready to push back against the narrative of it being an ineffective bloc by baring its teeth and biting, political analyst Ryan Cummings told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It wanted to remind the region that it does have the power to intervene when the context allows,” Cummings said. “At some point, there needed to be a line drawn in the sand [and] what was at stake was West Africa’s most stable sovereign country falling.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169470\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169470\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-09T174949Z_676862623_RC20DIAXBN12_RTRMADP_3_BENIN-SECURITY-1765553206.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Benin coup\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People gather at the market of Dantokpa, two days after Benin’s forces thwarted the attempted coup against the government, in Cotonou, December 9, 2025 [Charles Placide Tossou/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-a-new-ecowas-on-the-horizon\">Is a new ECOWAS on the horizon?</h2><p>Benin’s military victory was an astonishing turnaround for an ECOWAS that has been cast as a dead weight in the region since 2020, when a coup in Mali spurred an astonishing series of military takeovers across the region in quick succession.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, nine coup attempts toppled five democratic governments and two military ones. The latest successful coup, in Guinea-Bissau, happened on November 28. Bissau-Guineans had voted in the presidential election some days before and were waiting for the results to be announced when the military seized the national television station, detained incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, and announced a new military leader.</p><p>ECOWAS, whose high-level delegation was in Bissau to monitor the electoral process when the coup happened, appeared on the back foot, unable to do much more than issue condemnatory statements. Those statements sounded similar to those it issued after the coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Guinea. The bloc appeared a far cry from the institution that, between 1990 and 2003, successfully intervened to stop the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and later in the Ivory Coast. The last ECOWAS military intervention, in 2017, halted Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh’s attempt to overturn the election results.</p><p>Indeed, ECOWAS’s success in its heyday hinged on the health of its members. Nigeria, arguably ECOWAS’s backbone, whose troops led the interventions in Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been mired in insecurity and economic crises of its own lately. In July 2023, when Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was the ECOWAS chair, he threatened to invade Niger after the coup there.</p><p>It was disastrous timing. Faced with livelihood-eroding inflation and incessant attacks by armed groups at home, Nigerians were some of the loudest voices resisting an invasion. Many believed Tinubu, sworn in just months earlier, had misplaced his priorities. By the time ECOWAS had finished debating what to do weeks later, the military government in Niger had consolidated support throughout the armed forces and Nigeriens themselves had decided they wanted to back the military. ECOWAS and Tinubu backed off, defeated.</p><p>Niger left the alliance altogether in January this year, forming the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) with fellow military governments in Mali and Burkina Faso. All three share cultural and geographic affinities, but are also linked by their collective dislike for France, the former colonial power, which they blame for interfering in their countries. Even as they battle rampaging armed groups like Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the three governments have cut ties with French forces formerly stationed there and welcomed Russian fighters whose effectiveness, security experts say, fluctuates.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-01T191504Z_2111235108_RC2Q7IAOJIOJ_RTRMADP_3_BISSAU-SECURITY-1765553510.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ecowas\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio, who chairs ECOWAS, walks with Guinea-Bissau’s transitional president, Major-General Horta Inta-A, during a meeting in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, on December 1, 2025 [Delcyo Sanca/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>But Benin was different, and ECOWAS appeared wide awake. Aside from the fact that it was one coup too far, Cummings said, the country’s proximity to Nigeria, and two grave mistakes the putschists made, gave ECOWAS a fighting chance.</p><p>The first mistake was that the rebels had failed to take Talon hostage, as is the modus operandi with putschists in the region. That allowed the president to directly send an SOS to his counterparts following the first failed attacks on the presidential palace at dawn.</p><p>The second mistake was perhaps even graver.</p><p>“Not all the armed forces were on board,” Cummings said, noting that the small group of about 100 rebel soldiers had likely assumed other units would fall in line but had underestimated how loyal other factions were to the president. That was a miscalculation in a country where military rule ended in 1990 and where 73 percent of Beninese believe that democracy is better than any other form of government, according to poll site Afrobarometer. Many take particular pride in their country being hailed as the region’s most stable democracy.</p><p>“There was division within the army, and that was the window of opportunity that allowed ECOWAS to deploy because there wasn’t going to be a case of ‘If we deploy, we will be targeted by the army’. I dare say that if there were no countercoup, there was no way ECOWAS would have gotten involved because it would have been a conventional war,” Cummings added.</p><p>Quickly reading the room, Benin’s neighbours reacted swiftly. For the first time in nearly a decade, the bloc deployed its standby ground forces from Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. Abuja authorised air attacks on rebel soldiers who were effectively cornered in a military base in Cotonou and at the national TV building, but who were putting up a last-ditch attempt at resistance. France also supported the mission by providing intelligence. By nightfall, the rebels had been completely dislodged by Nigerian jets. The battle for Cotonou was over.</p><p>At least 14 people have since been arrested. Several casualties were reported on both sides, with one civilian, the wife of a high-ranking officer marked for assassination, among the dead. On Wednesday, Beninese authorities revealed that the coup leader, Colonel Pascal Tigri, was hiding in neighbouring Togo.</p><p>At stake for ECOWAS was the risk of losing yet another member, possibly to the landlocked AES, said Kabiru Adamu, founder of Abuja-based Beacon Security intelligence firm. “I am 90 percent sure Benin would have joined the AES because they desperately need a littoral state,” he said, referring to Benin’s Cotonou port, which would have expanded AES export capabilities.</p><p>Nigeria could also not afford a military government mismanaging the deteriorating security situation in northern Benin, as has been witnessed in the AES countries, Cummings said. Armed group JNIM launched its <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/al-qaeda-linked-jnim-says-one-killed-in-its-first-nigeria-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first attack</a> on Nigerian soil in October, adding to Abuja’s pressures as it continues to face Boko Haram in the northeast and armed bandit groups in the northwest. Abuja has also come under diplomatic fire from the US, which falsely alleges a “Christian genocide” in the country.</p><p>“We know that this insecurity is the stick with which Tinubu is being beaten, and we already know his nose is bloodied,” Cummings said.</p><p>Revelling in the glory of the Benin mission last Sunday, Tinubu praised Nigeria’s forces in a statement, saying the “Nigerian armed forces stood gallantly as a defender and protector of constitutional order”. A group of Nigerian governors also hailed the president’s action, and said it reinforced Nigeria’s regional power status and would deter further coup plotters.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169468\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169468\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169468\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1996-05-04T120000Z_572182307_PBEAHUMUGDL_RTRMADP_3_LIBERIA-1765553188.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C496&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ECOMOG\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nigerian ECOWAS Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) soldiers guard a corner in downtown Monrovia during fighting between militias loyal to Charles Taylor and Roosevelt Johnson in Liberia in 1996. Between 1990-2003, ECOWAS successfully intervened to help stop the Liberian civil war [File: Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"not-yet-out-of-the-woods\">Not yet out of the woods</h2><p>If there is a perception that ECOWAS has reawakened and future putschists will be discouraged, the reality may not be so positive, analysts say. The bloc still has much to do before it can be taken seriously again, particularly in upholding democracy and calling out sham elections before governments become vulnerable to mass uprisings or coups, Beacon Security’s Adamu said.</p><p>In Benin, for example, ECOWAS did not react as President Talon, in power since 2016, grew increasingly autocratic, barring opposition groups in two previous presidential elections. His government has again barred the main opposition challenger, Renaud Agbodjo, from elections scheduled for next April, while Talon’s pick, former finance minister Romuald Wadagni, is the obvious favourite.</p><p>“It’s clear that the elections have been engineered already,” Adamu said. “In the entire subregion, it’s difficult to point to any single country where the rule of law has not been jettisoned and where the voice of the people is heard without fear.”</p><p>ECOWAS, Adamu added, needs to proactively re-educate member states on democratic principles, hold them accountable when there are lapses, as in the Benin case, and then intervene when threats emerge.</p><p>The bloc appears to be taking heed. On December 9, two days after the failed Benin coup, ECOWAS declared a state of emergency.</p><p>“Events of the last few weeks have shown the imperative of serious introspection on the future of our democracy and the urgent need to invest in the security of our community,” Omar Touray, ECOWAS Commission president, said at a meeting in the Abuja headquarters. Touray cited situations that constitute coup risks, such as the erosion of electoral integrity and mounting geopolitical tensions, as the bloc splits along foreign influences. Currently, ECOWAS member states have stayed close to Western allies like France, while the AES is firmly pro-Russia.</p><p>Another challenge the bloc faces is managing potential fallout with the AES states amid France’s increasing closeness with Abuja. As Paris faces hostility in Francophone West Africa, it has drawn closer to Nigeria, where it does not have the same negative colonial reputation, and which it perceives as useful for protecting French business interests in the region, Cummings said. At the same time, ECOWAS is still hoping to woo the three rogue ex-members back into its fold, and countries like Ghana have already established bilateral ties with the military governments.</p><p>“The challenge with that is that the AES would see the intervention [in Benin] as an act not from ECOWAS itself but something engineered by France,” Adamu said. Seeing France instigating an intervention which could have benefitted AES reinforces their earlier complaints that Paris pokes its nose into the region’s affairs, and could push them further away, he said.</p><p>“So now we have a situation where they feel like France did it, and the sad thing is that we haven’t seen ECOWAS dispel that notion, so the ECOWAS standby force has [re]started on a contentious step,” Adamu added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>A new wave of Israeli policies is changing the reality and boundaries on the ground in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The Israeli government <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/israel-approves-19-new-west-bank-settlements-in-major-annexation-push\">has approved</a> the formalisation of 19 so-called settlement outposts as independent settlements in the occupied West Bank. This is the third wave of such formalisations this year by the government, which considers settlement expansion and annexation a top priority. During an earlier ceremony of formalisation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, “We are advancing de facto sovereignty on the ground to prevent any possibility of establishing an Arab state in [the West Bank].”</p><p>Settlement outposts, which are illegal under international law, are set up by a small group of settlers without prior government authorisation. This does not mean that the settlers, who are often more ideological and violent, do not enjoy government protection. Israeli human rights organisations say that settlers in these so-called outposts enjoy protection, electricity and other services from the Israeli army. The formalisation opens the door to additional government funds, infrastructure and expansion.</p><p>Many of the settlement outposts formalised in this latest decision are concentrated in the northeastern part of the West Bank, an area that traditionally has had very little settlement activity. They also include the formalisation of two outposts evacuated in 2005 by the government of Israeli then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While these government decisions may seem bureaucratic, they are in fact strategic in nature. They support the more ideological and often more violent settlers entrenching their presence and <a href=\"/features/2025/12/15/night-guardians-of-the-mountain-in-the-occupied-west-bank\">taking over</a> yet more Palestinian land, and becoming more brazen in their attacks against Palestinians, which are unprecedented in scope and effect.</p><p>The Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem estimates that settler attacks against Palestinians have forcibly displaced 44 communities across the West Bank in the past two years. These arson attacks, vandalism, physical assault and deadly shootings are done under the protection of Israeli soldiers. During these settler attacks, 34 Palestinians were killed, including three children. None of the perpetrators has been brought to justice. In fact, policing of these groups has dropped under the direction of Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is a settler himself.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently sounded the alarm about Israel’s record-breaking expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank and the unprecedented levels of state-backed settler violence. In a briefing to the UN Security Council, Guterres reminded states that all settlements are illegal under international law. He also warned that they erode Palestinian rights recognised under this law, including to a state of their own.</p><p>In September, United States President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/trump-says-he-will-not-allow-israel-to-annex-occupied-west-bank\">said</a> he “will not allow” Israel to annex the West Bank, without offering details of what actions he would take to prevent such a move.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Israel is undeterred. The government continues to pursue its agenda of land grab, territorial expansion and annexation by a myriad of measures that fragment, dispossess and isolate Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and continues its genocidal violence in Gaza.</p><p>More than 32,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced from their homes in three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank for nearly a year. The Israeli army continues to occupy <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/israel-to-demolish-25-homes-in-occupied-west-bank-nur-shams-camp\">Nur Shams</a>, Tulkarem and Jenin refugee camps and ban residents from returning. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have demolished and damaged 1,460 buildings in those camps, according to a preliminary UN estimate. This huge, destructive campaign has changed the geography of the camps and plunged more families into economic and social despair.</p><p>This is the state hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across the West Bank find themselves in because of Israeli restrictions, home demolitions and land grabs. The Israeli army has set up close to 1,000 gates across the West Bank, turning communities into open-air prisons. This has a direct and devastating effect on the social fabric, economy and vitality of these communities, which live on land that is grabbed from under them to execute the expansion of illegal settlements, roads and so-called buffer zones around them.</p><p>According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, Israeli practices and policies over the past two years have cost the Palestinian people 69 years of development. The organisation recently reported that the Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) has shrunk to 2010 levels. This is visible most starkly in Gaza, but it is palpable in the West Bank as well.</p><p>The results of these policies and this reality are Palestinians leaving their homes and Israel expanding. During the summer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a local news station he was on a “historic and spiritual mission”, in reference to the vision of the Greater Israel that he said he was “very” attached to.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is pitted against a formidable antagonist played by Sanjay Dutt, representing the Pakistani establishment, and gangsters such as one portrayed by Akshaye Khanna, while actors including R Madhavan portray key intelligence officers and strategists who orchestrate complex geopolitical manoeuvering from New Delhi.</p><p>Structurally, the screenplay follows a classic cat-and-mouse trajectory.</p><p>Beneath its high-octane set pieces, the film has sparked an angry debate among critics and audiences over the interpretation of historical events and some key figures.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175865\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175865\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-6.45.08-PM-1765804544.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C481&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A still from the trailer of Dhurandhar.

In this case, the portrayal of Pakistan’s major coastal city, Karachi, and particularly one of its oldest and most densely populated neighbourhoods, Lyari, has drawn strong criticism.</p><p>“The representation in the film is completely based on fantasy. It doesn’t look like Karachi.  It does not represent the city accurately at all,” Nida Kirmani, an associate professor of sociology at Lahore University of Management Sciences, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kirmani, who has produced a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=IcKykf6imdqLiiuX&amp;v=y_YuPBjuYGk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">documentary</a> on the impact of gang violence in Lyari of her own, said that like other megacities in the world, “Karachi had periods of violence that have been particularly intense.”</p><p>However, “reducing the city to violence is one of the major problems in the film, along with the fact the film gets everything about Karachi – from its infrastructure, culture, and language – wrong”, she added.</p><p>Meanwhile, a member of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has taken legal action in a Karachi court alleging the unauthorised use of images of the late former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007, and protesting against the film’s portrayal of the party’s leaders as supporters of “terrorists”.</p><p>Critics, including Kirmani, say the film also bizarrely casts gangs from Lyari into geopolitical tensions with India, when they have only ever operated locally.</p><p>Kirmani said the makers of the movie have cherry-picked historical figures and used them completely out of context, “trying to frame them within this very Indian nationalistic narrative”.</p><p>Mayank Shekhar, a film critic based in Mumbai, pointed out that the film “has been performed, written, directed by those who haven’t ever stepped foot in Karachi, and perhaps never will”.</p><p>“So, never mind this dust bowl for a city that, by and large, seems wholly bereft of a single modern building, and looks mostly bombed-out, between multiple ghettos,” Shekhar said.</p><p>He added that this is also in line with how Hollywood “shows the brown Third World in action with a certain sepia tone, like with Extraction, set in Dhaka, Bangladesh”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175859\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175859\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251201__86PQ6FY__v1__MidRes__IndiaEntertainmentCinemaBollywood-1765804524.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"dhurandhar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4175859\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh (centre) performs during the music launch of his upcoming Indian Hindi-language film Dhurandhar in Mumbai on December 1, 2025 [Sujit Jaiswal/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-the-film-been-received-in-india\">How has the film been received in India?</h2><p>Dhurandhar has been a huge commercial success in India and among the Indian diaspora. However, it has not escaped criticism entirely.</p><p>The family of a decorated Indian Army officer, Major Mohit Sharma, filed a petition in Delhi High Court to stop the release of the film, which, they claim, has exploited his life and work without their consent.</p><p>The makers of the film deny this and claim it is entirely a work of fiction.</p><p>Nonetheless, the film’s storyline is accompanied by real-time intercepted audio recordings of attacks on Indian soil and news footage, film critics and analysts say.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1701147\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1701147\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1701147\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1239256212.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People seen in front of a movie theater that is screening the film Kashmir files that\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1701147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People linger outside a movie theatre that is screening The Kashmir Files, in Kolkata, India, on March 17, 2022.

Critics, however, called the film “propaganda” and said the film had distorted facts.</p><p>Another Bollywood film <a href=\"/news/2023/5/4/kerala-story-film-on-alleged-indian-isil-recruits-gets-pushback\">Kerala Story</a> released in 2023 was accused of falsifying facts. Prime Minister Modi praised the film, but critics said it tried to vilify Muslims and demonise the southern Kerala state known for its progressive politics.</p><p>In the case of Dhurandhar, some critics have faced online harassment.</p><p>One review by The Hollywood Reporter’s India YouTube channel, by critic Anupama Chopra, was taken down after outrage from fans of the film.</p><p></p><p>India’s Film Critics Guild has condemned “coordinated abuse, personal attacks on individual critics, and organised attempts to discredit their professional integrity”, in a statement.</p><p>“More concerningly, there have been attempts to tamper with existing reviews, influence editorial positions, and persuade publications to alter or dilute their stance,” the group noted.</p></div></div></body></html>"
