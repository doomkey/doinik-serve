There are tears in everyone’s eyes.”</p><p>Her funeral at Dhaka’s Manik Mia Avenue on Wednesday drew tens of thousands of BNP supporters from across the country, alongside leaders of other political parties, interim government head Muhammad Yunus and foreign diplomats – underscoring the imprint of Khaleda’s legacy, and how it extended well beyond Bangladesh’s borders.</p><p>But beyond the grief, Khaleda Zia’s death marks a decisive political rupture for the BNP at a critical moment, say political analysts.</p><p>With national elections scheduled for February 12, the party is entering the campaign without the leader who remained its ultimate symbol of unity, even during years of illness and political inactivity.</p><p>Her passing pushes BNP into a fully post-Khaleda phase, concentrating authority and accountability on her son and acting chairperson, Tarique Rahman, as the party seeks to consolidate its base and compete in a reshaped political landscape following the July 2024 upheaval and the subsequent banning of the Awami League’s political activities.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207516\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207516\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207516\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-31T105543Z_75634851_RC2KRIA0M1MV_RTRMADP_3_PEOPLE-KHALEDA-ZIA-FUNERAL-1767235288.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman addresses before the funeral prayers for his mother and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia at the Parliament building area of Manik Mia Avenue, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 31, 2025.

His leadership remains untested.”</p><p>Ahmed noted that Khaleda herself was once an untested political figure, rising to national prominence during the mass pro-democracy movement of the 1980s that ultimately led to the fall of military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Her husband, the then-President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981 during a failed military coup.</p><p>Ahmed argued that the February election could play a similar defining role for Tarique Rahman: Success would validate his leadership, while failure would intensify scrutiny.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207521\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207521\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207521\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-04T030728Z_1764349024_RC2U2IAIKGRJ_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-1767235545.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Leaders of National Citizen Party (NCP) chat during an interview of an aspiring candidate to find out the right choice for the country's upcoming national election, at the party's candidate interviewing event in Dhaka, Bangladesh, November 24, 2025.

The Jamaat coalition includes the National Citizen Party, launched by many of the youth leaders who drove the July 2024 mass movement that forced Hasina out of power and into exile in India.</p><p>“This will not be easy for BNP,” Ahmed said. “Post-July [2024] politics has changed the equation. New polarisation is emerging, and the dominance of two parties no longer holds,” he added.</p><p>Analysts also point to key uncertainties that linger: whether the election will be held on time, whether it will be peaceful, and whether major parties can ensure public confidence in the process.</p><p>Dilara Choudhury, a political scientist who observed both Khaleda and her husband closely, said Khaleda Zia functioned as a “guardian figure” for not just her party, but also the country, and that her death represents the loss of a senior stabilising presence in Bangladesh politics.</p><p>Tarique, Khaleda’s son, was in exile in the United Kingdom from 2008 until December 25, 2025, when he returned after a series of cases against him that were initiated by a military-backed government in power between 2006 and 2009, or by the subsequent Hasina government, were closed.</p><p>She argued that Tarique’s return to the country has reduced fears of internal division within the party and that his recent speeches – reaffirming Bangladeshi nationalism, rejecting authoritarianism and honouring victims of the 2024 July uprising violence – have reassured party supporters about ideological continuity.</p><p>“BNP and Awami League have both been personality-centred parties,” she said. “After Khaleda Zia, it is natural that Tarique Rahman occupies that space within the BNP.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207524\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207524\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207524\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25365351679198-1767235683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Thousands of people gather to attend funeral prayers for former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia outside the national Parliament building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025.

That could be a challenge in decision-making. But I believe he will be able to manage.”</p><p>Kamal Uddin travelled with three other BNP activists from Cox’s Bazar, a coastal city on the Bay of Bengal about 350km (217 miles) south of Dhaka, to attend Khaleda Zia’s funeral on Wednesday.</p><p>Senior BNP leaders, however, dismiss doubts over Tarique’s authority.</p><p>Standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, who served as commerce minister in Khaleda Zia’s cabinet from 2001 to 2004, said Tarique’s leadership credentials were already established.</p><p>“His leadership has been proven,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera earlier this month. “He is capable of leading the party effectively.”</p><p>As BNP prepares for the polls, analysts say the party’s ability to ensure discipline, project reform and contribute to a peaceful election will itself be a test of Tarique’s leadership.</p><p>A separate discussion has emerged on social media and among political rivals.</p><p>On November 29, ahead of his eventual return, Tarique wrote on his verified Facebook page that the decision to come home was not “entirely within his control” and not “under his sole control”. Critics interpreted this as raising questions about possible external influence – particularly India – on whether and when he would return.</p><p>BNP leaders rejected these claims, insisting his return was a political and legal matter tied to domestic realities rather than foreign negotiation, and that national interest would guide the party’s policy if it comes to power.</p><p>For many supporters, however, politics remains deeply personal.</p><p>Fifty-seven-year-old Dulal Mia, who travelled from the northeastern district of Kishoreganj to attend Tarique’s reception rally in Dhaka on December 25, still recalls the moment that made him a lifelong BNP supporter.</p><p>When he was a sixth-grader in 1979, he said, then-President Ziaur Rahman visited the paddy field where he was working and shook his hand. Ziaur Rahman is remembered for addressing drought by digging canals across the country and visiting remote areas barefoot, often without formal protocol.</p><p>“Tarique Rahman will have to carry the legacy of his parents,” Mia said. “If he doesn’t, people will turn away. The BNP’s politics is people’s politics – it began with Ziaur Rahman and was carried by Khaleda Zia for so long. I believe Tarique Rahman will do the same. Otherwise, it is the people who will reject him.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As China carried out <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/china-kicks-off-second-day-of-military-drills-around-taiwan\">live-fire drills and rehearsed a military blockade</a> in the waters surrounding Taiwan this week, 70-year-old Liao said she wasn’t worried about war. She was enjoying life as a retiree, playing mahjong with her friends and keeping an eye on the stock market.</p><p>“Everyday life hasn’t been impacted,” Liao told Al Jazeera as she was having her hair shampooed and cut in time for the new year at a salon in New Taipei City. “I’ve lived in Taiwan for 70 years. I’m used to it. We all still have to wash our hair.”</p><p>“We’re not scared,” Liao’s hairstylist agreed. In fact, she hadn’t even noticed that the drills were happening. “Working people don’t have time to pay attention to these things. All they can do is work,” Liao said.</p><p>It’s not that the Taiwanese don’t care about threats from China. While life, for the most part, remained undisturbed this week during what China called “Justice Mission 2025”, information about them circulated rapidly on social media and was broadcast across Taiwan’s 24-hour news channels.</p><p>Disinformation – a regular component of such exercises – also circulated widely, including a propaganda video showing an aircraft flying close to the Taipei 101 skyscraper that Taiwan’s government <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202512300030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dismissed</a> as fake.</p><p>Threats from China, though, have become a regular part of life for the Taiwanese people. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, since the communists won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and established the People’s Republic of China (PRC). China says it will unify Taiwan with the PRC by force if necessary and has become increasingly assertive in its behaviour around Taiwan as its confidence in its military capabilities and prowess grows.</p><p>State news outlet The China Daily said in an editorial on Monday that the drills were “part of a series of Beijing’s responses” to an $11bn arms package from the United States to Taiwan, “as well as a warning to [Taiwanese President William] Lai Ching-te authorities in Taiwan”.</p><p>Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but it has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian also told reporters on Monday that the exercises were “a punitive and deterrent action against separatist forces who seek Taiwan independence through military build-up and a necessary move to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p><p>But Liao is confident that China won’t launch an attack thanks to the strength of Taiwan’s economy and the “sacred mountain” – a local term for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), or what foreigners might refer to as the “silicon shield” – which many believe will protect Taiwan from invasion. China relies on advanced semiconductors from TSMC for its own high-tech industries. “Look, the stock market is up 200 points today. If fighting were to break out today, everyone would be selling off their stocks, right?” Liao said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206634\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206634\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206634\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_73981-1767182917.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Taiwan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The hair salon where Liao, 70, had her hair washed and cut this week, despite Chinese military drills going on close by [Jordyn Haime/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-feel-a-bit-numb\">‘We feel a bit numb’</h2><p>For many interviewees, this week’s exercises brought reminders of Chinese drills in 2022, which were carried out after then-United States House of Representatives Speaker <a href=\"/news/2022/8/2/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-heightened-us-china-tensions\">Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan</a>, the highest-ranking American official to do so in decades.</p><p>Those exercises included live-fire drills, naval deployments, air sorties and ballistic missile launches and went on for four days in August that year.</p><p>They ushered in an era in which violations of Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) reached unprecedented levels. In November 2021, there were only 41 documented violations. By November this year, that number had soared to 266, according to data from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence. And since the Pelosi visit in 2022, China has launched six large-scale military drills around Taiwan.</p><p>Polling from the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, DC, suggested that this increased activity has taken a toll on the Taiwanese people. In 2023, it found that just under 65 percent of people were worried about a cross-strait war, a moderate increase from just over 57 percent in 2021. Nearly 58 percent of respondents said they believed Chinese President Xi Jinping was more likely to use force against Taiwan compared with 46 percent five years ago in 2021.</p><p>“We’ve become used to it, I think, a bit numb,” said Ms Yeh, who runs a flower shop in New Taipei City. During the two days of Chinese war games this week, customers drifted in and out as usual. No one discussed the drills occurring just offshore.</p><p>But she added that the atmosphere felt <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/how-are-chinas-new-war-games-around-taiwan-different-from-earlier-drills\">different this time</a> and the drills seemed more serious, even if people weren’t showing it on their faces. “I think Taiwanese people are resigned to their fate,” she said. “For ordinary citizens, there’s nothing we can do. Taiwan’s democracy has voting rights, but besides voting, what else can we do?”</p><p>Yeh said escalating cross-strait tensions and the warmth that Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), shows towards China have eroded her trust in the KMT to protect Taiwan.</p><p>In 2016, she voted for Tsai Ing-wen, the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP’s) candidate for president, and again for current DPP President Lai in 2024 after being a lifelong KMT voter.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party has refused to engage with the DPP, which champions Taiwan’s unique identity and sovereignty, while the Kuomintang has repeatedly blocked the DPP’s proposed special defence budget. The KMT’s new chairperson, Cheng Li-wun, has accused Lai of pushing Taiwan towards the brink of war and has prioritised a meeting with Xi in 2026.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"i-can-only-watch\">‘I can only watch’</h2><p>Wang, a 19-year-old university student, expressed similar feelings to Yeh. “I’m a little worried, even to the point of wanting to write a will,” she said as she studied with a friend at a cafe on Wednesday. “This time feels more serious. It feels more realistic, but I feel powerless because I can only watch.”</p><p>The atmosphere in Taiwan had already been feeling tense, Wang said. On December 19, a 27-year-old named Chang Wen set off smoke grenades and stabbed several people in the centre of Taipei, killing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/three-killed-in-taipei-stabbing-smoke-bomb-attack\">three people</a> and injuring 11. Such violence is rarely seen in the city. Chang, who died during a police chase, acted alone, and the motive for his attack is not known.</p><p>Then on Saturday, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Yilan <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/taiwan-rocked-by-7-0-magnitude-quake-but-no-major-damage-reported\">shook the island</a>, although it caused no major damage.</p><p>“There are many troops stationed in Zhongshan [station] and Taipei [Main Station], and the recent earthquakes have made us even more nervous. I think it’s necessary that we should be vigilant, but I think the panic online is excessive,” Wang said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

South American country.</p><p>The sanctions announced on Wednesday target four companies and their associated oil tankers, which are allegedly involved in transporting Venezuelan oil.</p><section

sanctions announcements.</p><p>“Maduro’s regime increasingly depends on a shadow fleet of worldwide vessels to facilitate sanctionable activity, including sanctions evasion, and to generate revenue for its destabilizing operations,” the Treasury said on Wednesday.</p><p>Petroleum is Venezuela’s primary export, but the Trump administration has sought to cut the country off from its international markets.</p><p>Wednesday’s notice accuses four tankers – the Nord Star, the Rosalind, the Valiant and the Della – of helping Venezuela’s oil sector to circumvent existing sanctions, thereby providing the “financial resources that fuel Maduro’s illegitimate narco-terrorist regime”.</p><p>“President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p><p>“The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump’s campaign of pressure on Maduro’s regime.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"claims-on-venezuelan-oil\">Claims on Venezuelan oil</h2><p>The sanctions come a day after Washington imposed <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-issues-iran-venezuela-sanctions-over-alleged-drone-trade\">sanctions</a> on a separate Venezuelan company it says assembled drones designed by Iran.</p><p>In recent months, the Trump administration has cited several motives for ratcheting up pressure against Venezuela, ranging from immigration to Maduro’s contested election in 2024.</p><p>Trump, for instance, has framed the pressure campaign as a means of stemming the trade of illegal drugs, despite Venezuela exporting virtually none of the administration’s main target, fentanyl.</p><p>Critics have also accused Washington of seeking to topple Maduro’s government to take control of the country’s vast oil reserves.</p><p>Trump officials have fuelled those suspicions with remarks seeming to assert ownership over Venezuela’s oil.</p><p>On December 17, a day after Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> a “total and complete blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, his top adviser, Stephen Miller, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">claimed</a> that the US “created the oil industry in Venezuela”.</p><p>He suggested that the oil was stolen from the US when Venezuela nationalised its petroleum industry, starting in 1976.</p><p>That process accelerated after the 1998 election of socialist President Hugo Chavez, who reasserted state control over Venezuela’s oil sector, ultimately leading to the seizure of foreign assets in 2007.</p><p>That “tyrannical expropriation” scheme, Miller <a href=\"https://x.com/StephenM/status/2001287800847474981?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged</a>, “was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property”.</p><p>Still, one major US oil company, Chevron, continues to operate in the country.</p><p>Trump has echoed Miller’s claims, writing online that the US “will not allow a Hostile Regime to take our Oil, Land, or any other

But a defiant Hezbollah has dismissed the efforts to disarm it as a US-Israeli plan demanded at a time when Israel is conducting <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/11/24/what-are-the-implications-of-israels-latest-attack-on-hezbollah\">daily air strikes</a> on Lebanon.</p><p>“To demand exclusive arms control while Israel is committing aggression and America is imposing its will on Lebanon, stripping it of its power, means that you are not working in Lebanon’s interest but rather in the interest of what Israel wants,” Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said this week.</p><h2 id=\"israeli-strikes\">Israeli strikes</h2><p>While the debate inside Lebanon rages around the exclusivity of weapons in the hands of the state, Israeli attacks against the country have not relented.</p><p>On Wednesday, Israeli forces bombed several villages in southern Lebanon and blew up the last undamaged home in the border town of Marwahin, according to the official National News Agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Israeli strikes have not been confined to south of the Litani River. In November, Israel bombed Beirut and killed Hezbollah’s top commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/hezbollah-leader-promises-response-to-israels-strike-killing-top-commander\">Haytham Tabtabai</a>.</p><p>Last week, an Israeli attack <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/at-least-three-killed-in-israeli-attack-on-southern-lebanons-sidon\">killed three people</a>, including a Lebanese army officer, in the coastal city of Sidon, north of the Litani.</p><p>Beyond the air strikes and near constant violations of Lebanon’s airspace with surveillance drones, whose buzz can often be heard in Beirut, Israel continues to occupy five points inside Lebanon.</p><p>Israel has also been preventing the rebuilding of the villages it all but wiped out in last year’s war, regularly carrying out attacks against the construction sector in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah says that when Israel stops its attacks, it’s ready to discuss a national defence strategy for Lebanon that would incorporate the group’s weapons.</p><h2 id=\"the-arguments\">The arguments</h2><p>Opponents of Hezbollah argue that the group has not been able to deter Israeli attacks, so its weapons only invite further strikes without providing meaningful defence.</p><p>They also say the Shia Muslim party should not be able to make war and peace decisions on its own for the entire multireligious country and that meaningful state-building cannot occur with an independent armed force that does not answer to the government.</p><p>Critics also underscore Hezbollah’s alliance with Iran, accusing the group of serving as a tool for Tehran’s <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">“axis of resistance”</a> rather than advancing Lebanon’s interests.</p><p>Hezbollah, however, says without its resistance, Israel could occupy and build settlements in southern Lebanon with the ill-equipped Lebanese military unable to put up a fight.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The United States, Israel’s closest ally, is the main weapons provider to the Lebanese army. In September, US special envoy Tom Barrack admitted that Washington doesn’t support the Lebanese armed forces to confront Israel.</p><p>“We don’t want to arm them … so they can fight Israel. I don’t think so,” Barrack said. “So you’re arming them so they can fight their own people, Hezbollah. Hezbollah is our enemy. Iran is our enemy.”</p><p>Hezbollah also calls Israel an expansionist entity that does not need an excuse to attack Lebanon, pointing to the situation in Syria, where Israeli forces have been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/israeli-incursions-abductions-stoke-fear-in-syrias-occupied-golan-heights\">expanding their occupation</a> beyond the Golan Heights without any provocation.</p><p>Hezbollah supporters note that Israeli violations against Lebanon date back to 1948 because of state neglect in the south – long before the group was founded in 1982.</p><h2 id=\"the-history\">The history</h2><p>Founded during the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli invasion of the country with the help of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah rose over the past decades from a ragtag militia to a regional power.</p><p>Using guerrilla warfare tactics, it forced <a href=\"/news/2006/5/25/lebanese-remember-israeli-withdrawal\">Israel to withdraw</a> from southern Lebanon in 2000 in what was seen as a rare military win for an Arab side in the history of the conflict.</p><p>It then fought Israel to a deadlock in an all-out war in 2006, thwarting the Israeli goals of dismantling or disarming the group.</p><p>In subsequent years, Hezbollah intervened in Syria’s war, helping the Syrian government of former President Bashar al-Assad recapture large parts of the country from opposition fighters.</p><p>It also sent military advisers to help Iran-backed groups in Iraq in the fight against ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Domestically, Hezbollah has yielded great influence over the Lebanese government since 2006, managed to maintain a strong parliamentary bloc with its allies and elevate individuals close to the group into key positions.</p><p>But it all came crashing down for Hezbollah last year. The group opened a “support front” to back Hamas after the outbreak of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>For months, the violence was largely confined to the Lebanon-Israel border region. However, in September 2024, Israel launched an offensive across the country, dealing painful blows to Hezbollah.</p><p>Israeli forces killed most of the group’s top political and military leaders, including its chief <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, who had attained iconic status for Hezbollah’s followers after the 2000 victory and 2006 war.</p><p>The conflict also saw Israel systematically destroy border towns, forcing long-term depopulation of the area, a campaign some analysts likened to ethnic cleansing.</p><p>The war killed thousands of people and displaced millions who spent more than two months away from their homes, many taking shelter in schools and other public buildings.</p><p>The war ended with a ceasefire that Israel has disregarded and Hezbollah has abided by with the exception of a single attack on an Israeli position in December 2024.</p><h2 id=\"the-perils\">The perils</h2><p>Hezbollah – beleaguered, bleeding domestic allies and facing a de facto unilateral ceasefire and continuing Israeli strikes – now finds itself at a crossroads.</p><p>Lebanese officials say the army is <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">making progress</a> in completing the first phase of the disarmament plan. But Hezbollah says it won’t surrender its weapons – or the fight against Israeli occupation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the threat of another Israeli war looms large over the country. US President Donald Trump did not rule out renewing the conflict when asked about it on Monday.</p><p>“We’ll see about it,” Trump said in a joint appearance with Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/five-key-takeaways-from-trump-netanyahu-meeting-in-florida\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> in Florida.</p><p>“The Lebanese government is at a little bit of a disadvantage, if you think of it, with Hezbollah. But Hezbollah has been behaving badly, so we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Inside Lebanon, efforts to disarm Hezbollah by force could lead to civil conflict. Despite the Israeli hits, Hezbollah still has thousands of fighters and retains a considerable arsenal.</p><p>Clashes between the state and Hezbollah would be catastrophic for Lebanon. An internal conflict could also see officers and commanders within the military who may be sympathetic to Hezbollah refuse to “fight their own people”.</p><p>Bottom line, Lebanon and Hezbollah sit at a critical juncture with emerging regional domination by Israel casting a painful shadow over the country and no easy solution to the crisis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

After two military coups in 2020 and 2021, the country severed ties with its former colonial ruler, France, expelled French forces, pushed out the United Nations peacekeeping mission, and redrew its alliances</p><p>Alongside Burkina Faso and Niger, now also ruled by military governments backed by Russian mercenaries, it formed the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2024/7/7/whats-behind-the-creation-of-the-alliance-of-sahel-states\">Alliance of Sahel States (AES)</a> in September 2023. Together, the regional grouping withdrew from the wider Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc, accusing it of serving foreign interests rather than African ones.</p><p>This month, leaders from the three countries converged in Bamako for the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/sahel-summit-what-is-the-biggest-challenge-facing-the-region\">Confederal Summit of Heads of State of the AES</a>, the second such meeting since the alliance was formed. And we were there to cover it.</p><p>The summit was a ribbon-cutting moment. Leaders of the three countries inaugurated a new Sahel Investment and Development Bank meant to finance infrastructure projects without reliance on Western lenders; a new television channel built around a shared narrative and presented as giving voice to the people of the Sahel; and a joint military force intended to operate across borders against armed groups. It was a moment to celebrate achievements more than to sign new agreements.</p><p>But the reason behind the urgency of those announcements lay beyond the summit hall.</p><p>In this layered terrain of fracture and identity, armed groups have found room not only to manoeuvre, but to grow. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has expanded from rural Mali, launching attacks across the region and reaching the coast of Benin, exploiting weak state presence and long-unresolved grievances.</p><p>As our plane descended toward Bamako, I looked out at an endless stretch of earth, wondering how much of it was now under the control of al-Qaeda affiliates.</p><p>From the airport, our minders drove us fast through the city. Motorbikes swerved around us, street hawkers peddled their wares, and Malian pop blared from speakers. At first, this did not feel like a capital under siege. Yet since September, armed groups have been operating a blockade around Bamako, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/fuel-crisis-in-mali-spirals-as-armed-group-chokes-off-supplies-to-capital\">choking off fuel</a> and goods, the military government said.</p><p>We drove past petrol stations where long queues stretched into the night. Life continued even as fuel grew scarce. People sat patiently, waiting their turn. Anger seemed to have given way to indifference, while rumours swirled that the authorities had struck quiet deals with the very fighters they claimed to be fighting, simply to keep the city moving.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206536\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206536\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206536\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-03T202021Z_1056089474_RC21NHA2266X_RTRMADP_3_MALI-SECURITY-1767178947.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C501&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mali\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Motorcycles line up near a closed petrol station, amid ongoing fuel shortages caused by a blockade imposed by al Qaeda-linked fighters in early September, in Bamako, Mali [Stringer/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"to-become-one-country-to-hold-each-other-s-hand\">‘To become one country, to hold each other’s hand’</h2><p>Our minders drove us on to the Sahel Alliance Square, a newly created public space built to celebrate the union of the three countries and its people.</p><p>On the way, Malian forces sped past, perhaps toward a front line that feels ever closer, as gunmen linked to JNIM have set up checkpoints disrupting trade routes to the capital in recent months. In September 2024, they also carried out coordinated attacks inside Bamako, hitting a military police school housing elite units, nearby neighbourhoods, and the military airport on the city’s outskirts. And yet, Bamako carries on, as if the war were taking place in a faraway land.</p><p>At Sahel Alliance Square, a few hundred young people gathered and cheered as the Malian forces went by, drawn by loud music, trivia questions on stage and the MC’s promise of small prizes.</p><p>The questions were simple: Name the AES countries? Name the leaders?</p><p>A microphone was handed to the children. The alliance leaders’ names were drilled in: Abdourahamane Tchiani of Niger. Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. Assimi Goita of Mali. Repeated again and again until they stuck.</p><p>Correct answers won a prize: a T-shirt stamped with the faces of the alliance leaders.</p><p>Moussa Niare, 12 years old and a resident of Bamako, clutched a shirt bearing the faces of the three military leaders.</p><p>“They’ve gathered together to become one country, to hold each other’s hand, and to fight a common enemy,” he told us with buoyant confidence, as the government’s attempt to sell the new alliance to the public appeared to be cultivating loyalty among the young.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"france-out-russia-in\">France out, Russia in</h2><p>While Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger went through separate political transitions, the paths that brought them into a shared alliance followed a similar pattern.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2023, each country saw its democratically elected leadership removed by the military, the takeovers framed as necessary corrections.</p><p>In Mali, Colonel Goita seized power after months of protest and amid claims that President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita had failed to curb corruption or halt the advance of armed groups.</p><p>In Burkina Faso, the army ousted President Roch Marc Christian Kabore in early 2022 as insecurity worsened; later that year, Captain Traore emerged from a counter-coup, promising a more decisive response to the rebellion.</p><p>In Niger, soldiers led by General Tchiani detained President Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023, accusing his government of failing to safeguard national security and of leaning too heavily on foreign partners.</p><p>What began as separate seizures of power have since become a shared political project, now expressed through a formal alliance. The gathering in Bamako was to give shape to their union.</p><p>One of the key conclusions of the AES summit was the announced launch of a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/burkina-faso-leader-vows-sahel-alliance-crackdown-on-armed-groups\">joint military battalion</a> aimed at fighting armed groups across the Sahel.</p><p>This follows months of escalating violence, as regional armies assisted by <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/wagner-vs-africa-corps-the-future-of-russian-paramilitaries-in-mali\">Russian mercenaries</a> push back against armed groups who have been launching attacks for over a decade.</p><p>Under the previous civilian governments, former colonial ruler France had a strong diplomatic and military presence. French troops, whose presence in the region dates back to independence, are now being pushed out, as military rulers recast sovereignty as both a political and security imperative. The last troops left Mali in <a href=\"/news/2022/8/16/last-french-troops-leave-mali-ending-nine-year-deployment\">2022</a>, but at its peak, France had more than 5,000 soldiers deployed there. When they withdrew, the country became a symbol of strategic failure for France’s Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>But even before that, French diplomacy appeared tone deaf, and patronising at best, failing to grasp the aspirations of its former colonies. The common regional currency, the CFA franc, still anchored to the French treasury, has become a powerful symbol of that resentment.</p><p>Now, French state television and radio have been banned in Mali. In what was once the heart of Francophone West Africa, French media has become shorthand for interference. What was lost was not only influence, but credibility. France was no longer seen as guaranteeing stability, but as producing instability.</p><p>Across the Sahel and beyond, anti-French sentiment is surging, often expressed in French itself – the language of the coloniser is now also the language of resistance.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206519\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206519\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206519\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25357459450133-1767178831.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Traore\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Captain Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso attends the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) second summit in Bamako, Mali [Mali Government Information Center via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"like-a-marriage-of-reason\">‘Like a marriage of reason’</h2><p>At the end of the summit, Mali’s Goita was preparing to hand over the AES’s rotating leadership to Traore of Burkina Faso.</p><p>Young, charismatic, and the new rock star of Pan-Africanism, Traore, in particular, has captured young audiences with help from a loose ecosystem of pro-Russian messaging and Africanist influencers. Across social media platforms, short videos circulate relentlessly: speeches clipped for virality, images of defiance, and slogans reduced to shareable fragments.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Burkina Faso, journalists and civil society actors who have criticised the military rules have been sent to the front line under a conscription policy introduced by Traore. Human rights groups outspoken about alleged extrajudicial killings say they have been silenced or sidelined. But much of it is dismissed as collateral, the price, supporters argue, of sovereignty finally reclaimed.</p><p>Before the ceremony, we met Mali’s finance minister. At first, he was confident, rehearsed, assured. But when pressed about financing for the ambitious infrastructure projects the three governments have laid out for the Sahel, his composure faltered and his words stuttered. This was a government official unaccustomed to being questioned. The microphone was removed. Later, away from the camera, he told me, “The IMF won’t release loans until Mali has ironed out its relations with France.”</p><p>The spokesperson, irritated by my questions, took me aside. As he adjusted the collar of my suit, slowly and patronisingly, he said he sometimes thought about putting journalists in jail “just for fun”.</p><p>He did not question the organisation I worked for. He questioned my French passport; my allegiance. I told him my allegiance was to the truth. He smiled, as if that answer confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>In the worldview of Mali’s military government – men shaped by years on the front line, living with a permanent sense of threat – journalists and critics are part of the problem. Creating safety was the challenge. The alliance, the spokesperson explained, was the solution to what they could not find within regional body, ECOWAS.</p><p>The half-century-old West African institution is a bloc that the three countries had once helped shape. Now, the AES leaders say its ageing, democratically elected presidents have grown detached, more invested in maintaining one another in office than in confronting the region’s crises. In response, they are promoting the AES as an alternative.</p><p>As the Sahel alliance grows, it’s also building new infrastructure.</p><p>At its new television channel in Bamako, preparations were under way. The ON AIR sign glowed. State-of-the-art cameras sat on tripods like polished weapons.</p><p>The channel’s director, Salif Sanogo, told me it would be “a tool to fight disinformation,” a way to counter Western, and more specifically French, narratives and “give voice to the people of the Sahel, by the people of the Sahel”.</p><p>The cameras had been bought abroad. The installation was overseen by a French production company. The irony went unremarked.</p><p>To defend the alliance, he offered a metaphor. “It’s like a marriage of reason,” he said. “It’s easier to make decisions when you’re married to three. When you’re married to 15, it’s a mess.” He was referring to the 15 member states of ECOWAS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-will-survive-this-too\">‘We will survive this, too’</h2><p>Two years into the AES alliance, they have moved faster than the legacy regional bloc they left behind. A joint military force now binds their borders together, presented as a matter of survival rather than ambition. A mutual defence pact recasts coups and external pressure as shared threats, not national failures. A common Sahel investment and development bank, meant to finance roads, energy, and mineral extraction without recourse to Western lenders, offers sovereignty, they say, without conditions. A common currency is under discussion.</p><p>A shared news channel is intended to project a single narrative outward, even as space for independent media contracts at home. And after withdrawing from the International Criminal Court, they have proposed a Sahel penal court, one that would try serious crimes and human rights violations on their own terms. Justice brought home, or justice brought under control, depending on who you ask.</p><p>What is taking shape is not just an alliance, but an alternative architecture, built quickly, deliberately, and in full view of its critics.</p><p>Where ECOWAS built norms slowly, through elections, mediation, and consensus, AES is building structure. Where ECOWAS insists on patience, AES insists on speed.</p><p>To supporters, this is overdue self-determination, dignity restored after decades of dependency. To critics, it is power concentrated in uniforms, accountability postponed, repression dressed up as emancipation.</p><p>From the summit stage as he took over the alliance’s leadership, Traore redrew the enemy: Not al-Qaeda. Not ISIL. Not even France. But their African neighbours, cast as the enemy within. He warned of what he called a “black winter”, a speech that held the room and travelled far beyond it, drawing millions of viewers online.</p><p>“Why are we, Black people, trying to cultivate hatred among ourselves,” he asked, “and through hypocrisy calling ourselves brothers? We have only two choices: either we put an end to imperialism once and for all, or we remain slaves until we disappear.”</p><p>Away from the summit’s “black winter”, under a sunlit sky in Bamako, life moved on with a quieter rhythm. Music drifted through public squares and streets, carrying a familiarity that cut across the tension of speeches and slogans. It was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NRtQmqqfdoc?si=ASMymaIMTlpigrnU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amadou and Mariam</a>, Mali’s most internationally known musical duo, whose songs once carried the country’s everyday joys far beyond its borders. Amadou died suddenly this year. But the melody lingers.</p><p>Its lyrics hold the secret of the largest alliance of all. Not one forged by treaties or uniforms, but by people, across Mali and the Sahel, in all their diversity.</p><p>“Sabali”, Mariam sings.</p><p>“Forbearance.</p><p>“We have survived worse. We will survive this, too.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those subsidies expire on December 31.</p><p>“The healthcare issue is a big one because people typically have their health insurance premium deducted from their account on the first, second, or third of the month,” said Daniel Hornung, the former deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.</p><p>“So, in the next few days, we’re likely to see people in many cases have their health insurance premiums double.”</p><h2 id=\"why-hasn-t-congress-extended-the-healthcare-subsidies\">Why hasn’t Congress extended the healthcare subsidies?</h2><p>Congress has been in gridlock over the issue of whether to extend the ACA subsidies.</p><p>Democrats refused to pass budget legislation in September until Congress acted to extend the healthcare subsidies. But Republican leaders said they would only vote on the subsidies after the budget legislation was signed.</p><p>That impasse led to a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/us-house-passes-spending-bill-ending-longest-govt-shutdown-in-history\">43-day government shutdown</a>, the longest in US history.</p><p>The gridlock ended when a handful of Democrats broke ranks with their party members to pass the budget legislation, on the understanding that there would be a December vote to extend the subsidies.</p><p>But rival proposals from Democrats and Republicans to address the subsidies <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/failure-of-rival-health-bills-underscores-impasse-in-us-politics\">both failed</a> earlier this month.</p><p>The expiration takes effect on New Year’s Day, but Congress does not return from recess until January 5.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-people-will-be-affected-by-the-subsidies-expiration\">How many people will be affected by the subsidies’ expiration?</h2><p>Approximately 2.2 million Americans are projected to lose healthcare coverage because of the increased cost, according to analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>Hornung, the former Biden administration official, said that many more stand to be affected by healthcare premium increases.</p><p>“We’re talking about roughly 20 million or so Americans who are on the ACA exchanges, either the national exchanges or the state exchanges, so that’s a major issue,” Hornung said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205249\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205249\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205249\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-01T203214Z_1898224243_RC29MHA6XIC5_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHUTDOWN-HUNGER-1767129322.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A food bank in Texas, with a picture of a Campbell soup can on the wall\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4205249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Critics fear changes in 2026 will reduce accessibility to programmes like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income households [File: Kaylee Greenlee/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-the-new-work-requirements-for-federal-food-assistance\">What are the new work requirements for federal food assistance?</h2><p>Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there are new work requirements to qualify for <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-administration-threatens-to-withhold-food-assistance-from-21-states\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP)</a> benefits, which help low-income households afford groceries.</p><p>Able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 64 must now work or participate in school or a training programme for at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible.</p><p>The policy applies to new applicants and renewals, beginning on January 1.</p><p>For current SNAP recipients, implementation timing varies by state. Some states have already notified existing beneficiaries of the pending changes, while others will begin enforcement later. In New York, for example, the new rules are not expected to take effect until March 2026.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/7/2/restaurant-workers-say-no-tax-on-tips-undermined-by-benefits-cuts\">Critics have told Al Jazeera</a> that the new rules may place an additional burden on service-industry workers, many of whom have irregular schedules that make it difficult to guarantee 80 hours every month.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-inheritances-be-affected\">How will inheritances be affected?</h2><p>Among the changes is an expanded estate tax exemption. Under the new policy, individuals inheriting an estate worth less than $15m are exempt from the federal estate tax. For couples, that threshold is $30m.</p><p>Prior to the 2017 law, the cap for untaxed estate inheritances was about $5.5m ($7.2m in 2025, adjusted for inflation) for individuals and $11m ($14m when adjusted for inflation) for couples.</p><p>Critics point out that the higher thresholds allow significant generational wealth transfers without taxation. As a result of the new provision, fewer than 1 percent of taxpayers ever face the estate tax.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-deductions-change-during-the-us-tax-season\">How will deductions change during the US tax season?</h2><p>January 1 will make several provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term — permanent. Many of these provisions benefit higher-income households.</p><p>One of the 2017 provisions that has been extended permits certain businesses to deduct 20 percent of their qualifying income from federal taxes.</p><p>There are also changes to the deduction limits for state and local taxes (SALT).</p><p>Typically, the federal government allows taxpayers to pay less in federal taxes if they can show they are paying a certain amount in income, sales and property taxes on the state and local levels.</p><p>But that reduction is capped at a certain amount. Upon passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the SALT deduction cap rose from $10,000 to $40,000.</p><p>That cap will increase by 1 percent to $40,400 for the 2026 tax year, with additional 1 percent increases through 2029.</p><p>Opponents say those cap increases will disproportionately benefit residents in high-tax states, such as New York and California.</p><p>For 2026, the OBBBA will also prompt a jump in the standard deductions for taxpayers.</p><p>The standard deduction will increase by $350 for single filers, $700 for joint filers, and $525 for heads of households over the 2025 rates.</p><p>For those over the age of 65, the deduction will also increase modestly by $50 for both joint and single filers, compared with last year.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205252\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205252\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024-08-23T193855Z_1741483687_RC2VL9AAD6CQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-NEVADA-1767129342.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt='Donald Trump rallies in front of a sign that reads, \"No Tax on Tips.\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4205252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump campaigns on the slogan, ‘No tax on tips’, while speaking in Las Vegas, Nevada, on August 23, 2024 [David Swanson/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-any-benefits-for-childcare\">Are there any benefits for childcare?</h2><p>During his 2024 re-election bid, Trump made reducing childcare costs a central campaign pitch.</p><p>“Childcare is childcare,” Trump told the Economic Club of New York in 2024. “It’s something you have to have in this country. You have to have it.”</p><p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to increase the child tax credit marginally.</p><p>In 2026, parents can receive tax credits for up to 50 percent of their eligible childcare expenses.</p><p>Qualifying expenses, however, are capped at $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more. That is up from a maximum of $2,200 per child in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-trump-s-campaign-promise-no-tax-on-tips-or-overtime\">What about Trump’s campaign promise, ‘No tax on tips or overtime’?</h2><p>Some tax code changes are already in place, including the collection of no federal income tax on tips and no federal tax on overtime, both of which are retroactive for income earned after January 1, 2025.</p><p>Income earned in 2026 and beyond will not be taxed, and taxes paid on eligible 2025 income will be refunded through annual tax returns.</p><p>Workers can deduct up to $25,000 in cash tips, including those paid via credit and debit transactions.</p><p>While this will provide relief to some tipped workers, it will not provide significant relief to many on the lower end of the income scale, especially for those <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/2/restaurant-workers-say-no-tax-on-tips-undermined-by-benefits-cuts\">who work in food service</a>.</p><p>Roughly two-thirds of workers in the sector do not make enough money annually to meet the threshold needed to file federal income taxes, which is $15,750 in 2026. The new law would ultimately not benefit them.</p><p>The no-tax-on-overtime policy, meanwhile, allows workers to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime income per year.</p><p>“Policies like ‘no tax on tips’ or ‘no tax on overtime’ do not address the core problem facing millions of workers across the country, which is that wages are simply too low to begin with,” said Saru Jayaraman, the founder of One Fair Wage, a nonprofit advocacy organisation.</p><p>“A policy that keeps base wages low and unstable while offering tax relief many workers will never see does not solve the affordability crisis.”</p><p>These tax exemptions are also not permanent and are scheduled to expire in 2028, Trump’s final year in office, unless extended by Congress.</p><p>The no-tax-on-tips provision applies only to federal income tax. State and local taxes still apply.</p></div></div></body></html>"
