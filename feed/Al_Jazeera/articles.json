Epstein was found dead in his federal jail cell in August 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking charge. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><p>Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence at a prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred last summer from a prison in Florida.</p><p>Robert Menendez, 71, is imprisoned in Pennsylvania.

Trump has used the shooting as the basis for tightening immigration from what he described as “third-world countries”, including Somalia.</p><p>“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” the US president said.</p><p>“These aren’t people that work. These aren’t people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on. Let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing.”</p><p>Trump said he does not know Omar “at all” but has watched her complain about the US for years. “I think she’s an incompetent person. She’s a real terrible person,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A former child refugee who fled Somalia’s long-running civil war, Omar is considered the first Somali American to serve in the US Congress. She represents a congressional district in Minnesota that contains one of the largest Somali diaspora communities in the country.</p><p>While Somalis in the US suffer from higher unemployment and poverty rates, akin to other refugee groups, a 2021 Minnesota Chamber of Commerce Report highlighted the community’s contributions and a trend towards upward mobility.</p><p>“While many Somali refugees arrived with limited education, low workforce participation rates and high poverty levels, their situation two decades later has shifted significantly,” it said.</p><p>“Poverty levels have dropped, workforce participation has increased, median household income has ticked up and educational attainment has made marginal gains.”</p><p>Trump has nevertheless taken a series of hardline steps in response to the National Guard shooting, including <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">suspending all migration</a> from the “third world” and ordering a review of the status of permanent residents from 19 countries.</p><p>The US president — whose first and current wives are immigrants from Eastern Europe — has also been decrying immigration in general as a drain on US resources.</p><p>Minnesota’s sizeable Somali community has long been in Trump’s crosshairs.</p><p>During his first term in office, for instance, Trump implemented sweeping migration restrictions against five predominantly Muslim countries, plus North Korea and Venezuela. One of the countries swept up in the so-called “Muslim ban” was Somalia.</p><p>Recently, Trump has also criticised the Somali community for a COVID-era welfare embezzlement scandal in which dozens of people, including some Somali immigrants, have been charged.</p><p>Omar herself has been a years-long target of Trump’s criticisms. He repeatedly berated her and other immigrant politicians for “telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run”.</p><p>“Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381395078000643\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media in 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration recently launched an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota that appears to be targeting <a href=\"/features/2025/3/12/somalia-is-dangerous-former-us-deportees-struggle-with-fear-uncertainty\">the Somali community</a>.</p><p>During the Thanksgiving holiday last week, Trump sparked outcry when he called Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously retarded” and accused him of doing nothing to confront Somali gangs allegedly “roving the streets”.</p><p>The US president also taunted Omar by appearing to mock her Islamic headscarf, saying that she is “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.</p><p>On Tuesday, the progressive group <a href=\"/news/2024/3/11/reject-aipac-us-progressives-join-forces-against-pro-israel-lobby-group\">Justice Democrats</a> decried Trump’s attacks on Omar and the Somali community as “disgustingly racist”.</p><p>“This is all Trump knows how to do when he has to distract from his own administration’s failures,” Justice Democrats said in a social media post.</p><p>“Stoke hate, divide our communities, &amp; send ICE in to terrorize our neighbors. Pathetic.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to the CNE, approximately 20 percent of the votes have yet to be tallied.</p><h2 id=\"infighting-on-the-council\">Infighting on the council</h2><p>But even before the first ballots were cast in Sunday’s election, controversies had gripped the council, resulting in accusations of malpractice from all three leading parties.</p><p>The CNE is led by a three-person panel. Each CNE councillor is selected by Honduras’s legislature to represent the three main political parties: the Liberal Party, the National Party and LIBRE, the party of outgoing President Xiomara Castro.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio represents the National Party. She has had a tumultuous relationship with her LIBRE counterpart, Ochoa.</p><p>In October, Ochoa filed a complaint with federal prosecutors, alleging that Lopez-Osorio had been caught in audio recordings conspiring with the Honduran military to influence the results.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio has denied the allegations. “These are fabricated recordings,” she told the Honduran newspaper La Prensa, calling Ochoa’s complaint “outrageous”.</p><p>Attorney General Johel Zelaya nevertheless opened an investigation into the audio recordings on October 29.</p><p>Ochoa, meanwhile, continued to raise doubts about the election proceedings as the November 30 vote drew near.</p><p>On November 9, for instance, he <a href=\"https://x.com/MarlonOchoaHN/status/1987670757795885119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media that a test of the voting system had “failed”, citing connectivity issues.</p><p>That result, he said, “constitutes further proof that the leaked audios are true and that there is a conspiracy against the electoral process, orchestrated from within the electoral body itself”.</p><p>The CNE has faced other high-profile conflicts as well. Also in October, the head of Honduras’s joint chiefs of staff, Roosevelt Hernandez, said the armed forces would seek to hold its own vote count.</p><p>But the president of the CNE, Liberal Party member Ana Paola Hall, rejected his demand, and legal experts have said there is no constitutional basis for the Honduran military to review the results.</p><h2 id=\"trouble-at-the-ballot-box\">Trouble at the ballot box</h2><p>Fears of irregularities and electoral interference have long loomed over Honduras’s presidential race.</p><p>In March, for example, advocates argued that long lines and delays in the distribution of election material impeded voters from participating in the election. Some polling stations stayed open late into the night as a result of the delays.</p><p>This week’s vote count also stuttered amid government website crashes. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Lopez-Osorio addressed some of the “technical failures” and “transmission issues” that have marred the proceedings.</p><p>She denied that the hiccups were part of any kind of conspiracy. “It is literally a technical failure in the disclosure platform,” she told CNN host Fernando del Rincon.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio explained that the CNE was “searching for explanations” and had been in contact with the company in charge of the technology, ASD SAS. The vote count, she added, would continue.</p><p>“We have very narrow margins, and we also have a large proportion of ballots to process in these remaining days,” she said.</p><p>A statement published on the CNE website echoed her comments. “The CNE has demanded that ASD SAS provide the fastest possible technical solution, so that all citizens have full and permanent access to the statistical data,” it read in part.</p><p>Still, those comments are unlikely to dampen efforts to contest the election results in the coming days.</p><p>Already, United States President Donald Trump — supporter of the right-wing Asfura — has amplified election fraud claims with posts on his online platform Truth Social.</p><p>“Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election. If they do, there will be hell to pay!” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115647697688351327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on Monday.</p><p>Moncada, the left-wing candidate, also appears poised to challenge the results. In a statement this week, she denounced Trump for his “imperial foreign interference” in the election process. She also called the initial election results proof that October’s audio leak was authentic.</p><p>“The elections are not lost,” she wrote. “The two-party system imposed its electoral plot on us, following the trap revealed by the 26 audio recordings.”</p><p>She added, “I declare that I will maintain my positions and that I will not surrender.”</p><p>For her part, Lopez-Osorio also called on the electorate to be vigilant, ending her post about her colleague Ochoa with the message: Stay “alert, Honduran people”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Currently, Republicans have a narrow majority in that chamber, as well as in the US Senate.</p><p>Given how small the margins are, both Democrats and Republicans have been angling to win every seat they can.</p><p>The right-wing stronghold of Texas, for instance, passed a bill in August that would redraw the state’s congressional districts with the aim of giving Republican politicians five extra seats in the midterms.</p><p>That Trump-backed redistricting push has inspired other states to take similar efforts. In Democrat-leaning California, for instance, voters approved a ballot initiative in November to redraw the state’s congressional map to help Democrats gain five more seats, effectively negating the Texas effort.</p><p>Tennessee’s 7th congressional district was not part of this year’s partisan redistricting push. But in 2022, the Republican-held state legislature did rework its congressional maps to give Republicans a greater edge.</p><p>The 2022 map split Nashville — a Democratic-leaning city — into three separate congressional districts, thereby diluting the power of its Democratic voters. The 7th congressional district is one of the districts that now represents a part of Nashville.</p><p>Previously, it was considered a safely Republican district. But Behn trails Van Epps closely in most polls.</p><p>A survey by Emerson College put her at 46 percent support, compared to 48 percent for Van Epps. An additional 5 percent of those surveyed remained undecided.</p><p>A victory for Behn would further narrow the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>Money from national groups has flowed into the race, given how close the two candidates are in the polls.</p><p>MAGA Inc — a super PAC named for Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement — has poured $1m into the race, in its first donation since the 2024 presidential election season. The left-leaning House Majority PAC has also spent $1m to back Behn.</p><p>Republicans are hoping to recover from a series of stinging election losses to Democrats in November’s off-year elections.</p><p>In New Jersey, for instance, Democrat Mikie Sherrill trounced a Trump-backed candidate to win the governor’s seat, and another Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, likewise emerged victorious in Virginia’s gubernatorial race.</p><p>Political analysts believe that Tennessee’s tight race could point towards an increasingly hostile political landscape for Republicans before the 2026 midterms.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trumps-approval-rating-in-us-drops-to-lowest-level-of-his-second-term\">Trump</a> won Tennessee’s 7th congressional district by 22 points in 2024.</p><p>But a recent Gallup poll found that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/donald-trumps-disapproval-rating-jumps-to-58-percent-poll\">Trump’s popularity</a> has dropped to the lowest levels of his second term, with just 36 percent of voters saying they approve of his work. Disapproval also reached a new high, with 60 percent saying they disapprove.</p><p>In the lead-up to Tuesday’s vote, Republican leaders urged supporters to make their voices heard at the ballot box.</p><p>“Special elections are strange animals, and anything can happen. And when you’re in a deep-red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative, will win,” Republican House Speaker <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/us-house-speaker-mike-johnson-visits-israeli-west-bank-settlement\">Mike Johnson</a> told reporters.</p><p>“You cannot assume that, because anything can happen.

As of the latest count in the November 30 election, right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura was said to be holding a narrow lead, though the race remains effectively a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trump-cries-foul-over-technical-tie-in-honduras-presidential-race\">“technical tie”</a> and no official winner has yet been declared.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump has publicly endorsed Asfura and threatened to cut off United States aid to Honduras if his preferred candidate does not win. He has also accused CNE of “trying to change” the outcome by calling a “technical tie” at this stage, and doubled down on vague threats of retaliation in posts published on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>Observers claim this is the latest example of Trump’s attempts to meddle with the internal affairs of other countries – several of which are in South America.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-main-candidates-and-what-do-they-stand-for\">Who are the main candidates, and what do they stand for?</h2><p>Asfura, 67, from the right-wing National Party of Honduras, has campaigned on a promise of economic stability, foreign investment and a tougher security stance.</p><p>Trump has thrown his support behind Asfura, calling him the “only real friend of Freedom in Honduras” in a Truth Social post and urging people to vote for him.</p><p>Asfura’s main rival, 72-year-old Salvador Nasralla, is running under the Liberal Party banner and positions himself as a centrist reformer focused on restoring the rule of law and on battling corruption.</p><p>The candidate for the left-wing ruling party, Liberty and Refoundation, Rixi Moncada, presents herself as the defender of President Xiomara Castro’s left-leaning legacy.</p><p>Moncada, 60, has proposed “democratising the economy” by expanding credit, strengthening national production, and building an economic model that generates “real opportunities for everyone”. She has also proposed changes to the Constitution to underpin a judicial overhaul in an effort to battle corruption.</p><p>“Our fight against corruption is head-on and without fear. To reform the justice system, there is only one way: to have a majority in Congress,” Moncada said during the campaign.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, polling has suggested a fragmented electorate with no clear favourite, setting the stage for the tight count now unfolding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-involved-himself-in-this-election\">How has Trump involved himself in this election?</h2><p>Trump pledged that there would be “hell to pay” in Honduras if election officials tampered with the results of the vote. He has threatened to cut off US aid to the country if his favoured, right-wing candidate does not win.</p><p>Trump has not specified the precise aid he would suspend, but the US provides Honduras, which has a population of around 11 million, with a substantial package of economic, development and security assistance each year.</p><p>The US president has also shown favour to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras and member of the country’s right-wing National Party, by pardoning his US drug conviction and releasing him from a 45-year jail sentence. On Monday, Hernandez was released from the high-security facility of USP Hazelton in West Virginia in the US.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He was extradited to the US in 2022 and was found guilty of conspiring to import cocaine to the US, and of possessing machine guns, in 2024. Justifying his decision to pardon him, Trump said Hernandez had been “treated very harshly and unfairly” in a social media post on Friday.</p><h2 id=\"what-aid-does-the-us-provide-to-honduras\">What aid does the US provide to Honduras?</h2><p>In 2024, the US provided just under $193.5m in aid to Honduras, according to <a href=\"https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/honduras/\">government data</a>.</p><p>Much of that flowed via the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and through programmes aimed at supporting small businesses, strengthening local governance, improving the agricultural sector and expanding education and health services, according to the US State Department’s website. About $10m was paid directly to the Honduran government.</p><p>USAID was closed down by the Trump administration earlier this year. It is unclear how that portion of aid would be distributed in the future.</p><p>Another major pillar is security cooperation through the US State Department and the Central America Regional Security Initiative, which trains police, supports anti-drug operations, and funds youth and community-violence-prevention initiatives.</p><p>These programmes are deeply embedded in Honduras’s security and social infrastructure. A sudden cutoff could disrupt everything from the police’s ability to operate to the basic work NGOs are able to carry out, according to experts.</p><h2 id=\"just-how-would-honduras-be-affected-if-trump-cuts-off-aid\">Just how would Honduras be affected if Trump cuts off aid?</h2><p>For one of the poorest countries in the region – and a major source of migration to the US – aid is far from just symbolic. It supports critical state functions in areas where violence, poverty and climate disasters drive migration.</p><p>Experts and rights groups <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/honduras/cut-too-deep-us-foreign-aid-withdrawals-and-collapse-protection-women-and-girls-honduras\">warned</a> earlier this year that abrupt cuts to funding to Honduras would likely worsen insecurity, weaken already strained public services and accelerate migration.</p><p>Nearly 30,000 Honduran people have been deported from the US since Trump returned to office in January, according to Honduran government data. The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country, where remittances from workers overseas represented about 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-another-instance-of-trump-meddling-in-the-affairs-of-countries-in-south-america\">Is this another instance of Trump meddling in the affairs of countries in South America?</h2><p>Trump’s comments about the election in Honduras fit a broader pattern observers say they have seen this year. He has publicly pressured governments or sided with specific opposition parties in several countries, most obviously in Venezuela.</p><p>In Venezuela, Trump has been accused of angling for <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/is-trump-pushing-for-regime-change-in-venezuela-where-else-is-he-meddling\">a “regime change”</a> against President Nicolas Maduro’s government, via a military campaign of strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific that the Trump administration claims are trafficking drugs.</p><p>Since September 2, US forces have carried out <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">at least 21 strikes</a> on boats, killing more than 80 people. Trump says he has not ruled out military action by land as well. The US has not shown evidence of drug trafficking, however.</p><p>The US has also built up a huge <a href=\"/amp/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast\">military presence</a> in the Caribbean, claiming this is necessary for national security and to push back an “invasion” by Venezuelan drug gangs.</p><p>Maduro has accused the US government of “fabricating a new eternal war” against him.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Brazil, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/terrible-thing-trump-defends-brazils-jair-bolsonaro-against-coup-trial\">publicly questioned</a> the legitimacy of criminal coup charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro earlier this year, bolstering Bolsonaro’s claims of political persecution and suggesting the country’s courts were being used to sideline a right-wing ally of the US. Bolsonaro was ultimately sentenced to 27 years in prison.</p><p>The US president’s comments were heavily criticised by Brazilian lawmakers, who claim he is attempting to delegitimise their institutions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This year, Trump has also said Mexico is being “run by the cartels” and has blamed the Mexican government for fentanyl trafficking. He has threatened to increase trade tariffs if the government does not extradite anyone involved, and has also hinted at US military action.</p><p>In Argentina, Trump has lavished praise on right-wing, populist President Javier Milei and said the US would not “waste our time” with helping Argentina if Milei’s party does not win future elections. A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027, but Trump said if “a socialist wins” then the US would feel “a lot differently” about supporting the country.</p><p>Following Trump’s threat over aid, Milei’s party went on to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">win</a> legislative elections in October with more than 40 percent ​​of the vote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was later found and killed inside a car. The body is now being withheld by Israeli forces in what is now standard operating procedure.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in the north of Ramallah, 18-year-old Muhammad Asmar was killed near the village of Umm Safa. Odeh added that the alleged assailant was “held by soldiers and was then shot while on the ground and left to bleed for hours”.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli army said it had killed a Palestinian who “had begun to stab soldiers near the settlement”. According to the Magen David Adom ambulance service, two Israelis were lightly wounded.</p><p>Hamas praised what it called a “heroic stabbing operation”, saying the attack “is a natural response to the crimes of the [Israeli] occupation, and a clear message that its attempts to break the will of our people through military operations, daily killings, arrests, and field executions will not succeed”.</p><p>Across the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have continued to carry out raids. Troops stormed the vicinity of three hospitals in Hebron and demolished two apartments in al-Walaja village, west of Bethlehem.</p><p>Israeli settlers also attacked Burqa village northwest of Nablus, setting fire to a tractor and attempting to torch a vehicle, while others sprayed graffiti on a home.</p><p>Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal under international law. The International Court of Justice reaffirmed last year that Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">is unlawful</a> and must end.</p><h2 id=\"journalist-killed-in-gaza-drone-strike\">Journalist killed in Gaza drone strike</h2><p>Meanwhile, Israel has continued its attacks in Gaza, where an Israeli drone strike in central Khan Younis killed Palestinian photojournalist Mahmoud Wadi.</p><p>The Wafa news agency reported that journalist Muhammad Abdel Fattah Aslih was also wounded in the same attack.</p><p>Aslih is the brother of Hassan Aslih, a photographer killed in a drone strike on Nasser Hospital in May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A video posted on Instagram and verified by Al Jazeera shows Wadi’s body with a press vest laid on top, surrounded by mourners.</p><p>More than 260 media workers have been <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/here-are-the-names-of-the-journalists-israel-killed-in-gaza\">killed in Gaza</a> since October 2023, making it the deadliest conflict for journalists on record.</p><p>Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 70,100 Palestinians and wounded 170,965 since October 2023. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7 attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.</p><p>Israel has continued to attack Gaza despite a ceasefire, which began on October 10. More than 356 Palestinians have been <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/gaza-tracker\">killed in Israeli attacks</a> during that period.</p><h2 id=\"health-system-on-the-brink\">Health system on the brink</h2><p>The Israeli prime minister’s office said authorities have received “findings” from Gaza that could be the remains of two captives whose bodies have not yet been returned.</p><p>The office said the material was transferred via the Red Cross and would be received in a military ceremony before being taken to Israel’s forensic medicine centre for identification.</p><p>Hamas had agreed to return the bodies of captives as part of the ceasefire agreement, but has said that widespread destruction across Gaza has made recovery efforts difficult.</p><p>Meanwhile, healthcare workers in Gaza say they face critical shortages of medicines and equipment. The UN has described the situation as “catastrophic”.</p><p>Less than half of Gaza’s hospitals, and just over a third of its clinics, are functioning at minimal capacity.</p><p>Al-Ahli Hospital is treating more than three times the patients it was built for, while al-Shifa, Nasser and al-Rantisi hospitals are also overwhelmed. More than half of essential medicines and two-thirds of medical supplies are out of stock, the UN has said.</p><p>Monitoring groups say Israeli forces have killed about 1,000 healthcare workers since the war began. At least 25 medical staff from Gaza are being held in Israeli prisons without charge.</p></div></div></body></html>"
