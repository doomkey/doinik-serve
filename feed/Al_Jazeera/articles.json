In addition to allowing Jews to buy property in the West Bank – a Palestinian territory that Israel has occupied since 1967 in defiance of international law – the Israeli government has also ordered that land registries in the West Bank be opened up to the public.</p><p>That means that it will be easier for Israelis looking to take territory in the West Bank to find out who the owner of the land is, opening them up to harassment and pressure.</p><p>The cabinet also decreed that authority over building permits for illegal Jewish settlements in Hebron, and the Ibrahimi Mosque compound, would pass to Israel from the Palestinian Hebron municipality.</p><p>Moataz Abu Sneina has seen Israel’s efforts to seize Palestinian land first hand. He is the director of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a Palestinian national symbol and an important Islamic holy site due to its connection to the Prophet Ibrahim, also known as Abraham.</p><p>Abu Sneina said that the latest Israeli decisions reflect a clear intention to increase Israeli control over Hebron’s Old City, and the <a href=\"/news/2021/8/13/israeli-forces-attack-palestinian-worshippers-ibrahimi-mosque-hebron\">Ibrahimi Mosque</a> compound.</p><p>“What is happening today is the most serious development since 1967,” Abu Sneina said. “We view it with grave concern for the Old City and the Ibrahimi Mosque, which is the symbol and beating heart of Hebron, and the shrine of the patriarchs and prophets.”</p><p>The Ibrahimi Mosque site is also revered by Jews, who refer to it as the Tomb of the Patriarchs.</p><p>An Israeli Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians after opening fire on Muslims praying at the mosque in 1994. Shortly afterwards, Israeli authorities divided the site into Jewish and Muslim prayer areas, and far-right Israeli settlers continue to strengthen their control over areas of Hebron.</p><p>Despite only numbering a few hundred, the settlers have taken over large areas of the city centre, protected by the Israeli military.</p><p>Abu Sneina explained that Israel has repeatedly attempted to strengthen its foothold inside Hebron and the mosque, and that the latest government moves are a continuation of Israeli policy that has only increased since the October 2023 start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“This has taken the form of increased settler incursions, restrictions on worshippers, control over entry and exit, and bans on the call to prayer – all part of a systematic policy aimed at complete control over the holy site,” Abu Sneina said.</p><p>“[Israel] continues to violate all agreements, foremost the Hebron Protocol, closing most entrances to the mosque and leaving only one fully controlled access point,” he added. “This paves the way for a new division or an even harsher reality than the temporal and spatial division imposed since the 1994 massacre.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"taking-over-hebron\">Taking over Hebron</h2><p>Mohannad al-Jaabari, the director of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee, a Palestinian organisation focused on the restoration of Hebron’s Old City, said that the Israeli government was already increasing its presence on the ground, in an effort to take control of the city.</p><p>He pointed to the confiscation of shops belonging to the Hebron Municipality in the Old City, the construction of dozens of illegal settlement units, and the reconfiguration of water pipes by connecting them to an Israeli water company’s network, creating what he described as “a massive apartheid system”.</p><p>Al-Jaabari warned that the ultimate goal is to establish a Jewish quarter linking settlements to the Ibrahimi Mosque by emptying Palestinian neighbourhoods of their residents.</p><p>“All Hebron institutions are preparing for a difficult phase,” he said. “We are bracing for a fierce attack on Palestinian institutions, foremost the Rehabilitation Committee.”</p><p>The Israeli government’s latest decisions open the door for what has happened in Hebron to happen elsewhere, with Israeli settlers establishing a presence in other Palestinian cities, forcing locals out, experts say.</p><p>Nabil Faraj, a Palestinian journalist and political analyst, called the Israeli government’s moves “dangerous” and added that they “have driven the final nail into the coffin of the peace process”.</p><p>He explained that Israel is reengineering the geographic landscape of the West Bank, expanding infrastructure to serve settlements, and seeking to strip the Palestinian Authority of administrative and security control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-hebron-model\">The Hebron model</h2><p>Palestinians in Bethlehem are now worried that they will get a taste of what Hebron has already experienced.</p><p>One of the Israeli cabinet’s decisions on Sunday stipulated that the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque in the city, known to Jews as Rachel’s Tomb, would be placed under Israeli administration for cleaning and maintenance, after previously being under the jurisdiction of the Bethlehem municipality. The mosque’s cemetery has also been affected.</p><p>“It will affect the living and the dead,” said Bassam Abu Srour, who lives in Bethlehem’s Aida refugee camp. “Annexing the area would prevent burials and visits to the Islamic cemetery. This is extremely serious and completely unacceptable to us.”</p><p>In Bethlehem, Hebron, and the rest of the West Bank, Palestinians feel powerless to stop what they view as a creeping annexation.</p><p>Mamdouh al-Natsheh, a shop owner in Hebron, said he now has a growing sense that what is unfolding is an attempt to impose a permanent reality.</p><p>“The city is being taken from its people step by step,” he said. “Daily restrictions are turning it into a fixed policy that suffocates every detail of life.”</p><p>He added that the deepest impact is on children and young people, growing up in a city that is “divided and constantly monitored”, stripping them of a natural sense of the future.</p><p>“I fear the day will come when we are told this area has been officially annexed, and that our presence depends on permits,” al-Natsheh said. “In Hebron, a house is not just walls – it is history and identity. Any annexation means the loss of security and stability.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

As of February 2023, the trust had plummeted to a mere <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/grassley_to_doi_oig_-_bikini_atoll.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$100,000</a>, and payments to Bikini Atoll survivors and descendants have ceased.</p><p>Critics have blamed Jibas, who was elected in 2016 to lead the Kili, Bikini and Ejit islands as mayor. He campaigned on having more local autonomy over the fund.</p><p>But reports in The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets accused him of misappropriating the funds for purchases including vacations, travel and a new pick-up truck.</p><p>In Tuesday’s announcement, the State Department connected Jibas’s alleged abuse to the spread of Chinese power in the Pacific and an increase in immigration to the US, two key issues in Trump’s platform.</p><p>“The theft, misuse, and abuse of the U.S.-provided money for the fund wasted U.S. taxpayer money and contributed to a loss of jobs, food insecurity, migration to the United States,” the department wrote.</p><p>“The lack of accountability for Jibas’ acts of corruption has eroded public trust in the government of the Marshall Islands, creating an opportunity for malign foreign influence from China and others.”</p><p>Both Palau and the Marshall Islands were US territories, occupied during World War II and granted independence in the late 20th century.</p><p>They both continue to be part of a Compact of Free Association with the US, which allows the North American superpower to continue military operations in the area and control the region’s defence.</p><p>They are also part of a dwindling list of countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan’s government, much to the ire of the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>Only about a dozen remain, and they are largely concentrated in Central America, the Caribbean or the Pacific islands.</p><p>But China has sought to pressure those smaller countries into rupturing their ties with Taiwan and recognising its government in Beijing instead.</p><p>The Asian superpower – often seen as a rival to the US – has also attempted to expand its sphere of influence to the southern Pacific, by building trade relations and countering US military authority in the area.</p><p>Baules, for example, is among the local politicians who have advocated for recognising Beijing’s government over Taipei’s, and he is a vocal proponent for increased ties with China.</p><p>Those shifting views have placed island nations like Palau and the Marshall Islands in the midst of a geopolitical tug-of-war, as the US struggles with China to maintain dominance in the region.</p><p>In other parts of the world, the US has also used sanctions to dissuade local officials from seeking closer ties with China.</p><p>Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino, for instance, has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/panamas-president-alleges-us-threatening-to-revoke-visas-over-china-ties\">accused the US embassy</a> in his country of threatening to strip local officials of their visas, as the US and China jockey for influence over the Panama Canal.</p><p>Similar reports have emerged in neighbouring Costa Rica, where officials like lawmaker Vanessa Castro and former President Oscar Arias have accused the US of revoking their visas over ties to China.</p><p>But there have been other points of tension between the Pacific Islands and the US in recent years.</p><p>The Trump administration has withdrawn from accords designed to limit climate change and <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions\">quashed international efforts</a> to reduce emissions, straining ties with the islands, which are vulnerable to rising sea levels.</p><p>Still, the US State Department framed the sanctions on Tuesday as an effort to ensure local accountability and defend US interests in the region.</p><p>“The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who abuse public power for personal gain and steal from our citizens to enrich themselves,” it said.</p><p>“These designations reaffirm the United States’ commitment to countering global corruption affecting U.S. interests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Syniehubov later declared an energy emergency, citing “constant enemy fire” across the region.</li>\n<li>A Russian missile attack killed a mother and her 11-year-old daughter, and injured 16 people, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office said in a post on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Five people were killed in a Ukrainian attack on Vasylivka, in a Russian-occupied area of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, Moscow-appointed local official Natalya Romanichenko told Russia’s TASS state news agency.</li>\n<li>A priest was killed in a Ukrainian attack on a funeral procession in Skelki, also in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia, according to TASS, citing Russian officials who widely condemned the attack.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks caused power outages in Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhia and heating outages in Enerhodar, also in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia, Russian-appointed officials said, according to TASS.</li>\n<li>One of two external power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia, has been cut as a result of a Ukrainian attack, the Russian-installed management of the power station said on Tuesday.</li>\n<li>A man was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on a van in the Shebekinsky district of Russia’s Belgorod region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</li>\n<li>Russian air defence systems shot down three guided aerial bombs and 72 Ukrainian drones in one day, TASS reported.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"weapons\">Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The US ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said in an online briefing that 21 NATO allies and two partners have pledged to buy more than $4.5bn in US weapons through the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative. Whitaker said he expects more announcements of pledges to buy weapons for Kyiv when defence ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian forces received an additional injection of 4.5 billion Ukrainian hryvnias ($104.5m) to order drones and electronic warfare systems over the past month, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"politics-and-diplomacy\">Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his country’s support for efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, the president’s office said. The Kremlin also confirmed that the two leaders discussed the war.</li>\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that France has not officially re-established relations with Russia, but that Moscow had “noted Mr Macron’s statement on the need to restore relations with Russia”, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron. “We are impressed by such statements,” Peskov added.</li>\n<li>Moscow’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it would further restrict the Telegram platform in Russia, saying the messaging app was not “observing” Russian law, that “personal data is not protected”, and that the app has “no effective measures to counter fraud and the use of the messaging app for criminal and terrorist purposes”.</li>\n<li>Telegram’s Russian-born founder, Pavel Durov, defended the app, which is used widely in Ukraine and Russia, saying Telegram would remain committed to protecting freedom of speech and user privacy, “no matter the pressure”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The management of the PCK Schwedt refinery in Germany, controlled by Russia’s Rosneft energy company, made an “urgent appeal” to German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Katherina Reiche, saying the threat of US sanctions could harm fuel supply to Berlin and the region. Berlin had secured a sanctions exception for the refinery, but it is set to expire on April 29.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

Her cousin, Hamzah Abushaban, said the family was “stonewalled, like hardcore”, as they searched for answers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Full transparency: Many people in her family thought she might have died, especially with the secrecy of her condition,” Abushaban told Al Jazeera. “Sometimes, silence speaks for itself.”</p><p>Her family and legal team confirmed on Tuesday that she has been released from the hospital. Kordia had suffered a seizure, but her family has only had fleeting contact with her since the medical emergency.</p><p>The ordeal is the latest turn in Kordia’s nearly <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/who-is-leqaa-kordia-the-columbia-protester-still-in-ice-detention\">yearlong detention</a>, which began when she was among several protesters targeted by immigration officials for taking part in pro-Palestine demonstrations at Columbia University in 2024.</p><p>Kordia remains the only person targeted in connection with the demonstration who is still in immigration detention.</p><p>Personal losses helped inspire her protest: Nearly 200 members of her family have been killed in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Her recent medical emergency underscores the dangers she faces from her continued detention, not to mention the urgent need for her release, according to Abushaban.</p><p>“She’s a fighter, but she’s not fooling anyone,” he said. “She’s still very sick”</p><h2 id=\"arbitrarily-detained\">‘Arbitrarily detained’</h2><p>On Monday, Amnesty International joined calls for Kordia’s release, echoing her family’s assertion that she is being unfairly targeted for her pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>“She has been arbitrarily detained for over ten months for exercising her rights to free speech and protest,” Justin Mazzola, the deputy director of research at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.</p><p>“The Trump administration must stop playing cruel political games with Leqaa’s life. Leqaa Kordia must be immediately released, and there must be accountability for the flagrant violation of her human rights.”</p><p>Kordia’s lawyers have also alleged unjust treatment, noting that federal judges had twice ruled she was eligible to be released on bond.</p><p>Each time, her release has been blocked after immigration officials filed “discretionary stay” requests to keep her in custody while the government appealed.</p><p>Since March 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump has targeted a range of student activists for deportation. They include Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, both of Columbia University, and Rumeysa Ozturk, who attended Tufts University in Massachusetts.</p><p>But those pro-Palestinian student activists have all successfully petitioned for their release as their cases continue in immigration court, though courts have signalled that they could be taken back into custody.</p><p>Kordia, however, has not had that same success.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kordia came to the US in 2016 from the town of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Initially, she arrived using a visitor’s visa, later transitioning to a student visa.</p><p>Eventually, she applied for permanent residency through her mother, a US citizen residing in New Jersey.</p><p>But her legal team has said she was wrongly advised by a trusted mentor that the initial approval of her application meant she had legal status. She subsequently allowed her student visa to lapse.</p><p>Immigration officials have, in turn, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/30/100-days-fighting-fake-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintained</a> that Kordia was detained for overstaying her student visa, not for her pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>However, in an initial news release announcing Kordia’s arrest in March 2025, the Department of Homeland Security suggested that she and a second protester – who allegedly “self-deported” – were targeted for their advocacy.</p><p><span>“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in the release.</span></p><p>“When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”</p><h2 id=\"intentionally-dehumanising\">‘Intentionally dehumanising’</h2><p>In his statement on Monday, Mazzola accused immigration officials of showing “blatant disregard” for Kordia’s human rights in detention, pointing to the deterioration of her health.</p><p>Kordia has been held at the Prairieland Detention Facility, some 2,400km (1,500 miles) away from her family in New Jersey.</p><p>Laila El-Haddad, an author and advocate, said she visited Kordia in December, finding her “very thin, very gaunt” as she complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of nutritious food at the crowded facility.</p><p>“She talked about this being a place that is intentionally dehumanising; that aims to strip her and others of their dignity and their humanity,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kordia’s lawyers and family, meanwhile, said she regularly suffers dizzy spells, fainting and other signs of subpar nutrition.</p><p>Still, El-Haddad found that Kordia remained upbeat, and she described the 33-year-old as a pillar of support for other detainees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“She’s very humble. She kept talking about how ‘I’m not a leader or an activist,'” El-Haddad remembered.</p><p>El-Hadded added that Kordia’s case has not gotten as much attention as those of other student protesters, but her story is just as powerful.</p><p>“She wasn’t a public-facing activist or speaker in the way some of the other [targeted protesters] were,” El-Hadded explained.</p><p>“But she found herself in a position and felt compelled [to protest] because of her own humanity and because she was a person with a deep moral compass and consciousness to act and to speak out.”</p><p>Abushaban said he has felt Kordia’s absence acutely at family events. It has been a year of missed birthdays, holidays and other gatherings.</p><p>He called for US officials, regardless of political affiliation, to have empathy for her plight.</p><p>“I was born and raised here, and the rest of my family were all born and raised here,” he said. “And just because we are Palestinians, we still have to feel suppressed in this country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked if that meant another election would not happen for another five years.</p><p>“The only thing I could say is that there will not be an election in this immediate period of time where the stabilisation has to be achieved,” Rodriguez replied.</p><p>He explained that the decision is tied to a wider effort to rebuild and strengthen Venezuela’s state institutions.</p><p>“What we’re working on at the moment is what we call the re-institutionalisation of the country, so that every single institution of the country can again be brought to full power and full recognition by everybody,” he said.</p><p>Rodriguez, who has led the National Assembly since 2021, added that Venezuelans are seeking a return to normalcy following the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">abduction of President Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>“The government of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a> is actually looking for that, to stabilise the country completely and to make it all good and reconcile everybody, all the population of Venezuela,” he said.</p><p>The US abducted Maduro in a military action on January 3.

An estimated 25 people were killed, according to the US State Department.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">In Monday’s interview, Rodriguez rejected the assertion that the 2024 race was not legitimate. Instead, he emphasised his push for national unity, saying, “We have been divided for a very long time.”</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">He highlighted the legislature’s efforts to pass a mass <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/venezuelas-national-assembly-approves-amnesty-bill-in-first-of-two-votes\">amnesty law</a>, which would result in the release of all political prisoners and forgive any crimes related to political dissent since 1999.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">The bill was approved unanimously in the first of two votes on Thursday and is expected to pass this week.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Still, questions have surrounded the bill. Critics fear that political repression could take other forms after the prisoners’ release.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Schmitt asked whether opposition leader Maria Corina Machado would be able to return to Venezuela and campaign freely in a future election, following the bill’s passage.</p><p data-start=\"203\" data-end=\"338\">“So, allow me not to speak about only one single name, because there are many, many actors abroad that have to be included in this discussion,” Rodriguez responded.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“There is an amnesty law that is being done at the moment that contemplates working with people, but there are sectors of the opposition abroad which have promoted violence.”</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">He then indicated that the amnesty bill would not apply to the opposition leaders accused of violent crimes.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“Through this amnesty law, we are promoting for all the sections of the opposition who are abroad to comply with the law, so they can come back to the country,” Rodriguez said.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Opposition leaders, however, have long alleged that the government has peddled false accusations of violent crime to arrest and jail them.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Machado herself was accused of conspiring to assassinate Maduro in 2014, leading to her expulsion from the National Assembly.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Rodriguez’s comments also come amid developments in the case of former lawmaker <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/venezuela-rearrests-opposition-figure-guanipa-after-release-prosecutor\">Juan Pablo Guanipa</a>.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">The leader was released on Sunday after spending more than eight months in pretrial detention, but he was rearrested less than 12 hours later, after speaking with the media and supporters.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">According to his family, he was detained by armed men without identification or a court order. His son, Ramon Guanipa, described the incident as an “abduction”.</p><p data-start=\"2596\" data-end=\"2766\">Officials later stated that they had requested the revocation of his release order, citing his alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed upon his release.</p><p data-start=\"2768\" data-end=\"2890\">In the early hours of Tuesday, Guanipa was transferred to his residence in Maracaibo, where he remains under house arrest.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">Machado condemned the actions, stating that Guanipa’s case demonstrates that the releases announced by the government do not guarantee the full exercise of political and civil rights.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“What was Juan Pablo’s crime? Telling the truth. So are these releases, or what are they?” Machado said on Monday.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">She proceeded to question whether the released prisoners were truly free from what she described as the repressive machinery of the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“Can’t we talk in Venezuela about those who have been in prison?

The deployment includes the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Channel 12 and the news outlet Axios reported on Tuesday that Trump is also thinking about sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.</p><p>That <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/iran-ready-for-nuclear-focused-talks-rejects-us-military-build-up\">military build-up</a> has spurred fears of an impending US strike against Iran. Critics fear such an attack could destabilise the region.</p><p>Already, on Monday, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/us-urges-american-ships-to-stay-as-far-as-possible-from-iranian-waters\">the US issued guidelines</a> to US-flagged commercial ships, warning them to stay “as far as possible” from Iranian territorial waters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-demands\">Heightened demands</h2><p>Since January, Trump has heightened US pressure on Iran, warning that his country’s military is “locked and loaded and ready to go”.</p><p>Trump has also compared Iran’s situation with that of Venezuela, where a US military operation on January 3 resulted in the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>“Like with Venezuela, [the US military] is ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary. Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on January 28.</p><p>Late last month, the Trump administration issued Iran three overarching demands. They include an end to Iran’s uranium enrichment, a requirement to sever ties with regional proxies, and limits on the country’s ballistic missile stockpiles, a goal long sought by Israel.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his position that Iran should comply with his demands, telling the news outlet Fox Business that it would be “foolish” not to.</p><p>During his first term, the US president pulled his country out of a 2015 <a href=\"/features/2025/4/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-iran-us-nuclear-negotiations\">deal that placed strict limits</a> on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has resumed his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p>The push has included severe sanctions and pressure to dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme, which Tehran insists is for civilian energy purposes only.</p><p>Already, last June, Trump authorised a military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, as part of a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"responding-to-antigovernment-protests\">Responding to antigovernment protests</h2><p>Trump’s renewed threats in January coincided with a recent wave of antigovernment protests in Iran.</p><p>The government in Tehran reacted to the demonstrations with a violent crackdown that killed thousands of people, drawing widespread condemnation from rights groups.</p><p>Reports have found that state security forces opened fire on crowds of protesters as the country was under an internet blackout.</p><p>On January 2 – one day before his military operation in Venezuela – Trump threatened to intervene on behalf of the protesters and “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">come to their rescue</a>“, although he ultimately declined to do so.</p><p>Some analysts have pointed out that the proposed strikes on Iran would do little to aid the protesters, but would align with longstanding US and Israeli goals of reducing Iran’s military capacity.</p><p>Tehran has argued that the protests included the violent targeting of security forces by armed groups, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of officers. It has also accused outside powers like the US and Israel of backing the antigovernment demonstrations.</p><p>Details around the protests and their crackdown remain difficult to verify, but Iranian officials have conceded that the government’s response killed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">thousands of people</a>.</p><h2 id=\"chaotic-wars-of-choice\">‘Chaotic wars of choice’</h2><p>The prospect that the US might intervene in Iran has prompted domestic pushback for Trump.</p><p>On Tuesday, a coalition of 25 advocacy groups called on the US Congress to assert greater oversight over Trump’s use of the military, in the face of his threats against Iran.</p><p>Their letter coincided with a new war powers <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/sjres104/BILLS-119sjres104is.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resolution</a>, introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Rand Paul on January 29.</p><p>The bill calls for the US military to be removed “from hostilities within or against… Iran”, unless authorised by Congress to take action.</p><p>The advocacy groups urged other Congress members to support the bill and ensure its passage.</p><p>“Iran has not attacked the United States nor threatened an offensive strike, and Congress has not authorized any military action against Iran,” the letter said.</p><p>“As a coalition of groups concerned with reckless military escalation, we urge Congress to represent its constituents, assert its Constitutional role and block an unauthorized war with Iran.”</p><p>The Center for International Policy, J Street, CODEPINK, Common Defense, and Just Foreign Policy were among the letter’s signatories.</p><p>Previous war powers resolutions, however, have failed to pass. In June, after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, lawmakers failed to advance <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">a similar bill</a>, which sought to prohibit further “unauthorized hostilities” against Iran.</p><p>Legislation to limit Trump’s military actions in Venezuela also <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-senate-defeats-war-powers-resolution-designed-to-rein-in-trump\">faced defeat</a> last month.</p><p>Ordinarily, Congress has the sole power to authorise war and similar military actions under the US Constitution. But critics say that presidents in recent decades have exerted ever-growing control over the country’s military.</p><p>Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council Action (NIAC), told Al Jazeera that a war powers resolution on Iran could face a tough path forward. His organisation was among the groups that signed Tuesday’s letter.</p><p>Still, Costello expressed optimism. He pointed out that Congress had passed such resolutions during Trump’s first term, once in 2019 and again in 2020, though the Republican president ultimately vetoed both bills.</p><p>Congress should take action again, Costello said, given the high stakes of a war between the US and Iran.</p><p>“The messiness and bloodiness of a new war with Iran, combined with the prospect of pressure from Congress on war powers resolutions, likely makes diplomatic off-ramps look much more attractive,” said Costello.</p><p>“While it is a high bar to pass war powers resolutions, Congress did so in Trump’s first term and forced him to exercise a rare veto. We hope they keep the pressure up and do what their voters want, which is to keep the US out of new, chaotic wars of choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He formerly served as a congressmemeber representing a different New Jersey district from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>In his <a href=\"https://x.com/Malinowski/status/2021244666063081981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> conceding defeat, Malinowski applauded Mejia, saying she deserves “unequivocal praise and credit for running a positive campaign and for inspiring so many voters on election day”.</p><p>But he nevertheless acknowledged the role AIPAC played in the results.</p><p>“The outcome of this race cannot be understood without also taking into account the massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,” Malinowski wrote.</p><p>“The threat unlimited dark money poses to our democracy is far more significant than the views of a single member of Congress on Middle East policy.”</p><h2 id=\"an-ineffective-strategy\">An ineffective strategy?</h2><p>With Mejia’s victory, many observers see AIPAC’s newest approach backfiring.</p><p>Malinowski has long been a supporter of US funding for Israel. But he has suggested <span>that Washington should not provide a “blank cheque” to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span></p><p>Mejia, in contrast, was the only candidate in the race to refer to Israel’s war in Gaza as a genocide.</p><p>She will face two Republicans in a special election in April, competing for a district that swung heavily Democratic in the 2024 vote.</p><p>While the Democratic Party’s progressive branch has long criticised AIPAC’s tactics, the campaign against Malinowski has brought criticism from what is considered its more moderate flank.</p><p>The advertisements bought by UDP did not specifically reference Malinowski’s support for Israel.</p><p>Instead, they attacked the former Congress member over domestic issues, including a 2019 vote in support of funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Representative Brad Schneider, the leader of the centrist caucus New Democrat Coalition, told the publication Politico that AIPAC’s strategy “raised eyebrows”.</p><p>He questioned the group for “spending against a candidate that would’ve been a New Dem and instead electing a far-left candidate”.</p><p>“Come on, guys, this is not what we were hoping for here,” said Schneider, who himself has enjoyed AIPAC support.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mark Pocan, a Democratic Congressman and longtime AIPAC critic, meanwhile called the strategy a “monumental failure”.</p><p>He said the spending showed that Democratic voters were becoming increasingly averse not just to AIPAC but to groups associated with it, like the UDP, as outrage over Israel’s genocide in Gaza continues to grow.</p><p>“Their money is so toxic that the very people they are trying to help are now hurt by their involvement, no matter how well disguised,” Pocan <a href=\"https://x.com/MarkPocan/status/2020505199761338478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>For its part, AIPAC sent a letter to supporters last week, downplaying the situation. It noted that, because Mejia is running in a special election, even if she wins in April, her term will only run through January of next year. She will face another Democratic primary in June before the general election.</p><p>It pledged to get involved in that race as well.</p><p>“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, her prospective win was an anticipated possibility,” AIPAC said in its email.</p><p>“Our ultimate focus for this race remains the June primary that will likely determine who represents this district for the full term beginning in January 2027.”</p><p><em><strong>Ali Harb contributed reporting. </strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

For many countries, economic stability is a matter of national survival. Faced with repeated shocks from Washington, they can’t remain dependent on an increasingly erratic trading partner,” Rogowsky said.</p><p>Last month, Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade, seeking to reset ties that had been frozen since Canadian authorities arrested a top official of Chinese telecommunications giant <a href=\"/economy/2022/5/19/huawei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huawei</a> in December 2018.</p><p>During Carney’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the two leaders agreed to slash tariffs on certain goods and allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into Canada with minimal tariffs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, Canadian Industry Minister Melanie Joly said her government was working with China to launch a joint EV assembly facility in Canada to export to the world.</p><p>The move marks a significant departure from Canada’s previous efforts to restrict China’s EV industry, including a 100 percent tariff on imports introduced after a similar move by the US.</p><p>Canada is also trying <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/canada-moves-to-rebuild-trade-ties-with-india-after-years-of-tension\">to rebuild ties</a> with India, another key trading partner, after years of tensions over the killing of a Canadian Sikh activist, with Carney expected to visit New Delhi in the next few months.</p><h2 id=\"reconfiguration-of-trade\">‘Reconfiguration of trade’</h2><p>“The reconfiguration of global trade is under way,” Rogowsky said.</p><p>Although remaking supply chains and trade relationships that evolved in the aftermath of World War II will be neither quick nor easy, particularly when they involve the world’s largest economy, “the pace of change is accelerating”, he added.</p><p>While two-way trade between the US and 19 of its trade partners grew slightly last year, total global trade grew much faster, according to Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.</p><p>In dollar terms, US trade with its partners grew 3.6 percent, compared with a 6.3 percent increase in global trade, he said.</p><p>One reason for the marginal change in US trade, despite Trump’s tariffs and threats, is that many countries ramped up their exports in anticipation of new taxes. Deeply embedded supply chains also take time to change.</p><p>“There is no doubt Trump has shaken the world trade order. Most importantly, trading rules once agreed in the WTO, or FTAs, no longer bind the US,” Hufbauer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“From a diplomatic standpoint, trust in the US has dropped to a post-Second World War low. Carney is right to describe the current geopolitical context as a ‘rupture’ from the past 80 years.”</p><p>Hufbauer said he expected to see further trade diversion away from US trade this year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“There is a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and countries are proactively looking to hedge,” Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s almost like trade agreements and partnerships today are strategic signals that there are friends and partners beyond Washington. However, there is a parallel effort in keeping ties with Washington as stable as possible. It is a big market and carries major global weight. A stable relationship with the US is pragmatic.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the move does not raise its offer of $30 per share, or $108.4bn including debt, for the whole of Warner Bros including cable assets.</p><p>Both Netflix and Paramount covet Warner Bros for its leading film and television studios, extensive content library and major franchises such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and DC Comics’ superheroes Batman and Superman.</p><p id=\"the-sweetened-deal-is-unlikely-to-sway-wbd-away-from-netflix-and-toward-paramount-paramount-is-throwing-spaghetti-at-the-wall-and-hoping-something-sticks-said-ross-benes-senior-analyst-at-emarketer-told-the-reuters-news-agency-outside-of-raising-its-price-paramount-s-best-chance-at-stealing-wbd-is-from-outside-regulators-blocking-netflix\">“The sweetened deal is unlikely to sway WBD away from Netflix and toward Paramount. Paramount is throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks,” Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, told the Reuters news agency. “Outside of raising its price, Paramount’s best chance at stealing WBD is from outside regulators blocking Netflix.”</p><h2 id=\"conflict-of-interest-concerns-loom\">Conflict of interest concerns loom</h2><p>Paramount leadership’s ties with the administration of United States President Donald Trump have long <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised conflict-of-interest concerns</a>. Paramount is led by the Ellison family, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a key Trump ally.</p><p>Paramount raised a personal guarantee from Ellison to $43.3bn and expects to fund the deal with $54bn of debt from Bank of America, Citigroup and Apollo.</p><p>The future of CNN is in the spotlight as part of the deal. Netflix has voiced little interest in the cable news channel, which the US president has long criticised. But Paramount has expressed a different opinion.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported late last year that Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, Larry Ellison’s son, promised Trump “sweeping changes” to CNN if his company was ultimately successful in the acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount has already reshaped CBS after Skydance’s acquisition of the storied broadcaster, including <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no previous television experience, to lead one of the US’s largest news organisations.</p><p>Press freedom experts argue that the acquisition could hurt Warner Bros in the long term.</p><p>“WBD shareholders should push back against any transaction that would result in CNN being controlled by people who have already shown willingness to sell out journalism and journalists to benefit their other interests,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera. “And that’s not to mention WBD’s other holdings, which also rely on a strong First Amendment. What happens when Donald Trump objects to the content of an HBO show? Authoritarianism isn’t just bad for democracy; it’s bad for business.”</p><p>While Democrats, including US Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have voiced concern about political bias in the Paramount Skydance deal, Republicans allege that Netflix is being politically biased.</p><p>Last week, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared at the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights and faced questions about alleged political bias from Republicans.</p><p>“Netflix has no political agenda of any kind,” Sarandos said.</p><p>Republicans have often treated transgender identity as a political position, labelling it an ideology. At the hearing, US Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri pressed the platform on why it allowed content he claimed “promotes a transgender ideology”.</p><p>“We feature a wide variety of stories and programmes to meet a wide variety of people’s tastes,” Sarandos said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Netflix were to succeed in the merger fight, it would become the world’s largest streaming platform, with roughly half a billion subscribers.</p><h2 id=\"financial-questions\">Financial questions</h2><p>Paramount offered other measures that would address financial concerns posed by the Warner Bros board, including a backstop debt exchange that Paramount argues will eliminate the risk of a $1.5bn fee owed to the bondholders.</p><p>The company also said it certified compliance with the US Department of Justice’s second request on Monday, triggering a 10-day waiting period, and has already secured foreign investment clearance in Germany. It added that it is in talks with antitrust regulators in the US, the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p><p>“Paramount’s latest offer attempts to address regulatory concerns about successfully closing a deal, but both bids from Netflix and Paramount Skydance could face lengthy, contentious regulatory reviews in the US and internationally with no guarantee of a successful outcome,” Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global, told Reuters.</p><p>The company also yet again extended the deadline for Warner Bros Discovery to consider its <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/22/paramount-skydance-extends-warner-bros-takeover-bid-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offer by February 20.</a> Warner Bros will hold a special investor meeting to vote on the Netflix deal, with the streaming pioneer saying that the meeting was expected to be held by April.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Netflix had last month switched to an all-cash offer for Warner Bros without increasing its $82.7bn price.
