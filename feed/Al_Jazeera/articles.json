The report suggested that the economy has sharply weakened during Trump’s tenure, a pattern consistent with a slowdown in economic growth during the first half of the year and an increase in inflation during June that appeared to reflect the price pressures created by the president’s tariffs.</p><p>“What does a bad leader do when they get bad news? Shoot the messenger,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a Friday speech.</p><h2 id=\"revisions-to-hiring-data\">Revisions to hiring data</h2><p>Trump has sought to attack institutions that rely on objective data for assessing the economy, including the Federal Reserve and, now, the BLS. The actions are part of a broader mission to bring the totality of the executive branch – including independent agencies designed to objectively measure the nation’s wellbeing – under the White House’s control.</p><p>McEntarfer was nominated by Biden in 2023 and became the commissioner of the BLS in January 2024. Commissioners typically serve four-year terms, but since they are political appointees, they can be fired. The commissioner is the only political appointee of the agency, which has hundreds of career civil servants.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The Senate confirmed McEntarfer to her post 86-8, with now Vice President JD Vance among the yea votes.</p><p>Trump focused much of his ire on the revisions the agency made to previous hiring data. Job gains in May were revised down to just 19,000 from 125,000, and for June they were cut to 14,000 from 147,000. In July, only 73,000 positions were added. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.2 percent from 4.1 percent.</p><p>“No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.”</p><p>The monthly employment report is one of the most closely-watched pieces of government economic data and can cause sharp swings in financial markets. The disappointing figure sent US market indexes about 1.5 percent lower on Friday.</p><p>While the jobs numbers are often the subject of political spin, economists and Wall Street investors – with millions of dollars at stake – have always accepted US government economic data as free from political manipulation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The only additions were in the healthcare sector, which added 55,000 jobs, and the social services sector added 18,000.</p><p>US employers also cut 62,075 jobs in July — up 29 percent from cuts in the month before, and 140 percent higher than this time last year, according to the firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which tracks monthly job cuts. Government, tech, and retail sectors are the industries that saw the biggest declines so far this year.</p><p>It comes as this month’s jobs and labour turnover report showed an economic slowdown. There were 7.4 million open jobs in the US, down from 7.7 million a month before.</p><p>The Department of Labour on Friday released downward revisions to both the May and June jobs reports, significantly changing the picture the White House had previously painted.</p><p>“For the FOURTH month in a row, jobs numbers have beat market expectations with nearly 150,000 good jobs created in June,” the White House said in a July 3 release following the initial June report.</p><p>The Labor Department had reported an addition of 147,000 jobs in June. On Friday, it sharply revised down that number to just 14,000. May’s report also saw a big downgrade from 144,000 to only 19,000 jobs gained. Trump has since <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-fires-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-dismal-employment-numbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fired</a> the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs data, alleging that the data had been manipulated to make him look bad.</p><p>Even before the revisions, June’s report was the first to reflect early signs of economic strain tied to the administration’s tariff threats, as it revealed that job growth was concentrated in areas such as state and local government and healthcare. Sectors more exposed to trade policy – including construction, wholesale trade, and manufacturing – were flat. Meanwhile, leisure and hospitality showed weak growth, even in peak summer, reflecting falling travel demand both at home and abroad.</p><p>The administration also claimed that native-born workers accounted for all job gains since January. That assertion is misleading as it implies that no naturalised citizens or legally present foreign workers gained employment.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>However, it is true that employment among foreign-born workers has declined – by over half a million jobs – claims that native-born workers are replacing foreign-born labour, are not supported by the jobs data.</p><p>Jobs lost in sectors with high foreign-born employment, including tech, have been abundant, driven by tariffs and automation, particularly AI. In fact, recent layoffs in tech have been explicitly attributed to AI advancements, not labour displacement by other groups.</p><p>Companies including Recruit Holdings — the parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor, Axel Springer, IBM, Duolingo and others have already made headcount reductions directly attributed to AI advancements.</p><h2 id=\"wage-growth\">Wage growth</h2><p>The pace of rise of wage growth, an indicator of economic success, has slowed in recent months. That is partly due to the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates steady in hopes of keeping inflation stable.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages have been outpacing inflation since 2023, after a period of declining real wages following the COVID pandemic.</p><p>Wage growth ticked up by 0.3 percent in July from a month prior. Compared with this time last year, wage growth is 3.9 percent, according to Friday’s Labor Department jobs report.</p><p>Earlier this year, the White House painted a picture that wage growth differed between the era of former President Joe Biden and now under Trump because of policy.</p><p>“Blue-collar workers have seen real wages grow almost two percent in the first five months of President Trump’s second term — a stark contrast from the negative wage growth seen during the first five months of the Biden Administration,” the White House said in a release.</p><p>However, Biden and Trump inherited two very different economies when they took office. Biden has to deal with a massive global economic downturn driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Trump, on the other hand, during his second term, inherited “unquestionably the strongest economy” in more than two decades, per the Economic Policy Institute, particularly because of the US economy’s rebound compared with peer nations.</p><h2 id=\"inflation\">Inflation</h2><p>Inflation peaked in mid-2022 during Biden’s term at 9 percent, before falling steadily because of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to manage a soft landing.</p><p>A July 21 White House statement claimed, “Since President Trump took office, core inflation has tracked at just 2.1 percent.” On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett said “<a href=\"https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1950575608494227932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation is cooling</a>” in a post on X.</p><p>However, the Consumer Price Index report, which tracks core inflation – a measure that excludes the price of volatile items such as food and energy – was 2.9 percent in the most recent report and overall inflation was at 2.7 percent in June.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"prices\">Prices</h2><p>The most recent Consumer Price Index report, published July 15, shows that on a monthly basis, prices on all goods went up in June by 0.3 ,percent which is 2.7 percent higher from this time last year.</p><p>Grocery prices in particular are up 2.4 percent from this time last year and 0.3 percent from the prior month. The cost of fruits and vegetables went up 0.9 percent, the price of coffee increased by 2.2 percent and the cost of beef went up 2 percent.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/7/11/trumps-new-brazil-tariffs-could-raise-us-beef-prices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New pending tariffs on Brazil</a>, as Al Jazeera previously reported, could further drive up the cost of beef in the months to come.</p><p>Trump has pointed to falling egg prices in particular as evidence of economic success, after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eggs-democrats-trump-biden-tariffs-ca0e8d9c557e849f4715628d5313b622\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democrats attacked</a> his administration over their price in March. He has even gone so far as to claim that prices are down by 400 percent. That figure is mathematically impossible – a 100 percent decrease would mean eggs are free.</p><p>During the first few months of Trump’s term <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/24/trump-says-petrol-and-grocery-prices-are-down-facts-say-otherwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">egg prices surged</a>, and then dropped due to an outbreak of, and then recovery from, a severe avian flue outbreak, which had been hindering supply – not because of any specific policy intervention.</p><p>In January, when Trump took office egg prices were $4.95 per dozen as supply was constrained by the virus. By March, the average egg price was $6.23.  But outbreak and high prices drove away consumers, allowing farmers with healthier flocks to catch up on the supply side. As a result, prices fell to an average of $3.38. That would be a 32 percent drop since the beginning of his term and a 46 percent drop from their peak price – far from the 400 percent Trump claimed.</p><p>Trump also recently said petrol prices are at $1.98 per gallon ($0.52 per litre) in some states. He doubled down on that again on Wednesday. That is untrue. There is not a single state that has those petrol prices.</p><p>According to Gasbuddy, a platform that helps consumers find the lowest prices on petrol, Mississippi at $2.70 a gallon ($0.71 per litre) has the cheapest gas, and the cheapest petrol station in that state is currently selling gas at $2.37 ($0.62 per litre).</p><p>AAA, which tracks the average petrol price, has it at $3.15 per gallon ($0.83 per litre) nationwide, this is up from the end of January when it was $3.11 ($0.82 per litre).</p><p>While petrol prices have gone down since Trump took office, they are nowhere close to the rate he has continually suggested. In July 2024, for instance, the average price for a gallon of petrol nationwide was $3.50 ($0.93 per litre).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"gdp\">GDP</h2><p>On Wednesday, the White House said that “President Trump has reduced America’s reliance on foreign products, boosted investment in the US”, citing the positive GDP data that had come out that morning.</p><p>That is misleading. While the US economy grew at a 3 percent annualised rate in the second quarter, surpassing expectations, that was a combination of a rebound after a weak first quarter, a drop in imports – which boosted GDP, and a modest rise in consumer spending.</p><p>The data beneath the headline showed that private sector investment fell sharply by 15.6 percent and inventories of <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/30/us-q2-gdp-growth-masks-broader-economic-downturn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goods and services declined by 3.2 percent</a>, indicating a slowdown.</p><h2 id=\"manufacturing\">Manufacturing</h2><p>The administration recently highlighted gains in industrial production, pointing to a boost in domestic manufacturing. Overall, there was a 0.3 percent increase in US industrial production in June. That was after stagnating for two months.</p><p>There have been isolated gains, such as increases in aerospace and petroleum-related sectors—1.6 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.</p><p>But production of durable goods — items that are not necessarily for immediate consumption— remained flat, and auto manufacturing fell by 2.6 percent last month as tariffs dampened demand. Mining output also decreased by 0.3 percent.</p><p>According to the Department of Commerce’s gross domestic product report, manufacturing growth among non-durable goods has slowed. While there was a 1.3 percent increase, that’s a decline from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter.</p><p>This could change in the future, as several companies across a range of sectors have pledged to increase US production, including carmaker Hyundai and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which just pledged a $50bn investment over the next five years.</p><h2 id=\"trade-deals-and-tariffs\">Trade deals and tariffs</h2><p>In April, the White House replaced country-specific tariffs with a <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/2/us-labour-market-holds-steady-despite-tariffs-adding-177000-jobs-in-april\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10-percent blanket tariff</a> while maintaining additional levies on steel, cars, and some other items. It then promised to deliver “90 trade deals in 90 days.” That benchmark was not met. By the deadline, only one loosely fleshed out deal — with the United Kingdom — had been announced. As of 113 days later, the US has announced comparable deals with just a handful more countries and the European Union. The EU deal still needs parliamentary approval.</p><p>Contrary to the administration’s claims, tariffs do not pressure foreign exporters — they are paid by US importers and ultimately are likely to be passed on to US consumers. Companies, including big box retailer <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/15/largest-us-retailer-walmart-warns-of-price-hikes-because-of-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart</a> and toymaker Mattel, have announced price hikes as a direct result. <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/7/ford-to-raise-prices-on-three-cars-produced-in-mexico-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ford, for example, raised prices</a> on three Mexico-assembled models due to tariff pressures.</p><p>To protect their own economies, many countries have pivoted their trade policies away from the US. Brazil and Mexico recently announced a new trade pact.</p><p>The White House and its allies continue to defend tariffs by highlighting the increased revenue they bring to the federal government, which is true. Since Trump took office, the US has brought in more than $100bn in revenue, compared with $77bn in the entire fiscal year 2024. The price of imports for consumers <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/what-has-been-the-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-so-far\">has only risen</a> about 3 percent, but many expect that will change as the import taxes are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5477470/prices-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed on</a> to consumers.</p><p>The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Recession.</p><p>An advocate for greater investments in the US economy, Trump has been arguing that inflation is now at sustainable levels, so there is no need for interest rates to remain high.</p><p>Over the past year, the central bank slashed interest rates by about 1 percent, but Trump has been demanding more aggressive cuts.</p><p>On Wednesday, Powell cited a risk of inflation linked to Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/trump-sets-new-tariffs-on-dozens-of-countries-exports\">trade policies</a> as the reason behind his decision not to drop interest rates.</p><p>“Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,” he told reporters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this month, a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/15/us-inflation-from-tariffs-that-economists-feared-begins-to-emerge\">government report</a> showed that consumer prices rose by 0.3 percent from May to June, compared with 0.1 percent the previous month, as Trump’s tariffs started to set in.</p><p>Powell did not rule out that the uptick in prices could be “short-lived”, but he also warned that it may become persistent, arguing for a cautious approach while monitoring inflation.</p><p>“For the time being, we’re well positioned to learn more about the likely course of the economy and the evolving balance of risks before adjusting our policy stance,” he said. “We see our current policy stance as appropriate to guard against inflation risks.”</p><p>The decision proved controversial, with the Fed board seeing rare dissent from two members, both Trump appointees, who publicly argued for more rate cuts.</p><p>On Friday, <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/25/trump-signals-positive-meeting-with-powell-on-us-interest-rates\">Trump warned</a> Powell that the dissent “<a

The South Sudanese soldiers refused to leave after being told to do so, Kulayigye said, resulting in the Ugandan side having “to apply force”.</p><p>A Ugandan soldier was killed in the skirmish that ensued, Kulayigye added, after which the Ugandan side retaliated and opened fire, killing three South Sudanese soldiers.</p><p>However, South Sudan military spokesperson Major-General Lul Ruai Koang said in a Facebook post earlier on Tuesday that armies of the “two sisterly republics” had exchanged fire on the South Sudanese side, in the Kajo Keji County of Central Equatoria state. Both sides suffered casualties, he said, without giving more details.</p><p>Wani Jackson Mule, a local leader in Kajo-Keji County, backed up this account in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid023xxMFozSs3MZm5NJrXhdLfxfSDCepG61w7gX5cTGLmW5EMciM4dTraXmHgZkTPGEl&amp;id=61565198096015&amp;rdid=Rurv8UQEDlmuhnD5#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook pos</a>t on Wednesday and added that Ugandan forces had launched a “surprise attack” on South Sudanese territory. Mule said local officials had counted the bodies of five South Sudanese officers.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Kajo-Keji County army commander Brigadier General Henry Buri, in the same statement as Mule, said the Ugandan forces had been “heavily armed with tanks and artillery”, and that they had targeted a joint security force unit stationed to protect civilians, who are often attacked by criminal groups in the area. The army general identified the deceased men as two South Sudanese soldiers, two police officers and one prison officer.</p><p>The fighting affected border villages and caused panic as people fled from the area, packing their belongings hurriedly on their backs, according to residents speaking to the media. Children were lost in the chaos. Photos on social media showed crowds gathered as local priests supervised the collection and transport of remains.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865741\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1000X562-WEBMAP-SOUTH-SUDAN-UGANDA-1753880533.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Map of Uganda and South Sudan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Map of Uganda and South Sudan [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-the-border-conflict-about\">What is the border conflict about?</h2><p>Uganda and South Sudan have previously clashed over demarcations along their joint border, although those events have been few and far between. As with the Monday clash, the fighting is often characterised by tension and violence. However, heavy artillery fighting, which occurred on Monday, is rare.</p><p>Problems at the border date back to the demarcations made during the British colonial era between Sudan, which South Sudan was once a part of, and Uganda. Despite setting up a joint demarcation committee (unknown when), the two countries have failed to agree on border points.</p><p>In November 2010, just months before an anticipated South Sudanese referendum on independence from Sudan, clashes erupted after the Ugandan government accused the Sudanese army of attacking Dengolo village in the West Nile district of Moyo on the Ugandan side<b> </b>in multiple raids, and of arresting Ugandan villagers who were accused of crossing the border to cut down timber.</p><p>A South Sudanese army spokesperson denied the allegations and suggested that the assailants could have been from the forestry commission. Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni and South Sudan’s Kiir met a few days later and pledged to finalise the border issue, but that did not happen.</p><p>Little was reported on the matter for several years after that, but in October 2020, two Ugandan soldiers and two South Sudanese soldiers were killed when the two sides attacked each other in Pogee, Magwi County of South Sudan, which connects to Gulu district of northern Uganda. The area includes disputed territory. Some reports claimed that three South Sudanese were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the fight.</p><p>In September 2024, the Ugandan parliament urged the government to expedite the demarcation process, adding that the lack of clear borders was fuelling insecurity in parts of rural Uganda, and Ugandan forces could not effectively pursue criminal cattle rustling groups operating in the border area as a result.</p><p>Following the latest flare-up of violence this week, the countries have pledged to form a new joint committee to investigate the clashes, South Sudan military spokesperson, General Koang, said in a statement on Tuesday. The committee will also investigate any recurring issues along the border in a bid to resolve them, the statement read.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3600718\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3600718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3600718\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25064407228850-1742884459.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"South Sudan's President Salva Kiir, right, and Vice President Riek Machar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3600718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir, right, and Vice President Riek Machar, left, attend a mass led by Pope Francis at the John Garang Mausoleum in Juba, South Sudan, on Sunday, February 5, 2023 [Ben Curtis/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-does-uganda-provide-military-support-to-south-sudan-s-president-kiir\">Why does Uganda provide military support to South Sudan’s President Kiir?</h2><p>Uganda’s Museveni has been a staunch ally of South Sudan’s independence leader, Kiir, and his Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) party for many years.</p><p>Museveni supported South Sudan’s liberation war against Sudan, especially following alleged collusion between the former Sudanese leader <a href=\"/news/2023/4/26/ousted-sudanese-president-omar-al-bashir-held-at-army-hospital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Omar al-Bashir</a> and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group originally formed in Uganda but which regularly attacks both Ugandan and South Sudanese locations in its efforts to overthrow the Ugandan government.</p><p>South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in January 2011.

Sometimes the laws have different names, such as “extreme risk protection orders” or, in Nevada, “high risk protection orders”.</p><p>The state attorney general does not list a mental health crisis hold as a reason for a high-risk protection order. Nevada’s law allows law enforcement or family members to ask a court to issue an order to temporarily remove a person’s firearms or the right to possess a gun if the person poses a threat to themselves or others.</p><p>We asked the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department if it had taken steps to use that law to remove Tamura’s access to firearms and received no reply to that question.</p><p>Nevada’s high-risk protection orders are part of a growing number of state laws that aim to prevent firearm injuries and deaths.</p><p>The Nevada law has been little used since it took effect in 2020. Experts said it’s not unusual for states to implement their red flag laws slowly, with some exceptions. Florida, for example, issued about 2,500 orders during the first 18 months after its 2018 law went into effect, said Veronica Pear, an expert on violence prevention and University of California, Davis assistant professor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-red-flag-laws\">What are red flag laws?</h2><p>Twenty-one states and Washington, DC, have passed red flag laws since 1999, many with Republican support.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>State laws specify who can start a civil petition process to remove or restrict access to weapons. Some states allow only law enforcement to request the orders. Other states allow family members or close contacts, such as coworkers or teachers, to file a petition. Most petitions are filed by law enforcement and are usually granted by courts.</p><p>The application used by Nevada law enforcement asks the petitioner whether the person has a firearm and requests a detailed description of conduct and acts of high-risk behaviour.</p><p>Nevada has weeklong and longer-term orders. The seven-day order comes after a hearing in which only one party’s argument for action has been heard. An extended order can last up to a year.</p><p>The 2022 <a href=\"/news/2022/6/25/president-biden-signs-first-major-federal-gun-reform-in-decades\">Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a>, signed by former President Joe Biden, provided funding for states to implement red flag laws.</p><p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness said when “appropriately implemented, these laws can be lifesaving”. The organisation also said it is a harmful stereotype to link mental illness and violence.</p><p>About 3 percent to 5 percent of violent acts are committed by people with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression. People living with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than members of the general population.</p><h2 id=\"nevada-s-red-flag-law\">Nevada’s red flag law</h2><p>Nevada Democratic State Representative Sandra Jauregui, who was at a 2017 music festival where a gunman killed 58 people, sponsored Nevada’s 2020 law.</p><p>Former Governor Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, signed the legislation, which Republicans opposed. Former Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the current Republican governor, campaigned in 2022 on a promise to “remove antiquated laws”, including Nevada’s red flag law. But the law remains on the books with Democrats controlling the Legislature.</p><p>Nationwide, these laws have been used more than 49,000 times through 2023, Everytown for Gun Safety found.</p><p>Law enforcement attitudes and knowledge about red flag laws can affect how often they are used. Florida, New York, California and Connecticut filed orders a few thousand times each year.</p><p>Nevada got off to a slow start, but has increased its use of the law in recent years.</p><p>The Nevada attorney general’s website shows 28 high-risk protection orders in 2024, and 20 in 2023. An office spokesperson said there were six orders so far in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"are-red-flag-laws-effective\">Are red flag laws effective?</h2><p>Analyses about whether red flag laws work as intended are mixed.</p><p>The Rand Corp, a nonprofit public policy research organisation, reviewed studies about red flag laws in July 2024. Researchers found that evidence of the laws’ effects on mass shootings and violent crime was inconclusive, and limited for suicide.</p><p>Most of the laws have been implemented in the past decade, Rand found, so it is difficult to determine the effects of the laws. Also, there are state and local differences in how often the laws are used.</p><p>Other researchers point to studies showing some benefits of red flag laws in reducing crime or suicide.</p><p>In an August 2024 study, Columbia University public health researchers found that Florida’s red flag gun law, passed in response to the 2018 Parkland mass shooting, was associated with an 11 percent reduction in firearm homicide rates from 2019 to 2021. One of the authors said the study did not find a significant reduction in firearm suicides and called for further study.</p><p>Extreme risk protection orders are one important law in a network of laws that work to prevent people who may harm themselves or others from accessing firearms, Pear, the University of California, Davis professor, told PolitiFact in 2022. “But there are other laws that are supported by evidence as well, such as prohibiting the purchase and possession of firearms after a violent misdemeanour conviction, waiting periods and firearm licensing laws.”</p><p><em>Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this article.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But now, herders report that precipitation patterns have grown unpredictable, diminishing the grass available for their yaks.</p><p>“Earlier, it used to snow and rain, but now it has reduced a lot,” the 32-year-old says. “Even the winters are getting warmer than before.”</p><p>In Ladakh, a region near Tibet that once formed part of the ancient Silk Route, women primarily handle the herding, milking, and wool gathering – labour that remains largely manual.</p><p>In a neighbouring valley, 73-year-old Kunzias Dolma prepares yak milk tea and inspects her yak butter while simultaneously spinning her Buddhist prayer wheel with her right hand.</p><p>Unrelated to Tsering Dolma, she has dedicated her life to working with yaks, spending countless hours creating products from their milk and crafting blankets from their wool.</p><p>“We wake up early morning, about 5am every day,” she says. “My husband and I milk the yaks and do all of the other yak-related work until about lunch. Then we take a break and get back to work in the evening. We have been doing this all our life.”</p><p>This traditional lifestyle now faces dual threats: Climate change making Ladakh increasingly inhospitable for yaks, and younger generations pursuing alternative livelihoods.</p><p>Rising temperatures and irregular rainfall have made nutritious vegetation scarcer while subjecting the shaggy, cold-adapted animals to greater physical stress.
