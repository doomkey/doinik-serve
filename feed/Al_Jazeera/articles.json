Rubio suggested that the school’s “continued eligibility as a sponsor” would hang in the balance of Wednesday’s investigation.</p>\n<p>“To maintain their privilege to sponsor exchange visitors, sponsors must comply with all regulations, including conducting their programs in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States,” Rubio wrote.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852826\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852826\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852826\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-21T174023Z_638325211_RC24RFA7EP7E_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD-1753287312.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='A protester holds up a sign that reads: \"Hands off Harvard\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852826\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The group Crimson Courage led a show of support for Harvard outside the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 21 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"questions-of-national-security\">Questions of national security</h2>\n<p>Under President Trump’s second term, the US has repeatedly cited questions of national security and foreign policy in its attempts to expel foreign students, particularly those involved in pro-Palestinian and antiwar movements.</p>\n<p>Rubio himself has drawn on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 — a relatively obscure Cold War-era law — in his efforts to deport student protest leaders like Mahmoud Khalil.</p>\n<p>The law allows the secretary of state to expel foreign nationals “whose presence or activities” could pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.</p>\n<p>The government’s use of such laws, however, is currently being challenged in court. Critics argue they violate the constitutional right to free speech and protest.</p>\n<p>It was President Trump’s opposition to the pro-Palestinian protests that led him to engage in a high-profile confrontation with Harvard, the country’s oldest university and a member of the much-vaunted Ivy League.</p>\n<p>Schools like Harvard in Massachusetts and Columbia University in New York were considered the epicentre of the protest movement. At Columbia, for instance, students erected a tent encampment that inspired similar demonstrations across the world.</p>\n<p>The schools’ crackdowns on those protests, however, were also emulated at other campuses. Columbia, for instance, called in police to clear pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and other schools took similar action, leading to more than 3,000 campus arrests across the country last year.</p>\n<p>Critics of the protests, including President Trump, have called the demonstrations anti-Semitic and warned they create an unsafe learning environment for Jewish students.</p>\n<p>Protest leaders, however, point out that most of the demonstrations were peaceful and have forcefully rejected anti-Jewish hate. Rather, they argue their protests are about shining a light on the abuses Israel has perpetrated in Gaza — and the crackdowns are aimed at stamping out views that run contrary to the US’s close relationship with Israel.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852828\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852828\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-21T173457Z_1882899708_RC24RFAJONGL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD-1753287327.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A drag performer dresses as Trump with a regal cape and sceptre.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852828\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Prum, parodying President Donald Trump, demonstrates against attempts to strip Harvard of its federal funding [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"pressure-on-schools\">Pressure on schools</h2>\n<p>Upon taking office in January, however, Trump pledged to take “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forceful and unprecedented steps</a>” to root out alleged anti-Semitism on campus.</p>\n<p>In early March, he began his broadside on Ivy League campuses like Columbia and Harvard. He began by stripping Columbia of $400m in federal contracts and grants and then by requesting compliance with a list of demands, including disciplinary reform and <a href=\"/news/2025/3/14/us-arrests-second-student-imposes-receivership-on-columbia-university\">external oversight</a> for certain academic departments.</p>\n<p>By March 22, Columbia <a href=\"/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">had agreed</a> to make concessions.</p>\n<p>But Trump encountered greater resistance at Harvard University. On April 11, the Trump administration likewise issued a list of demands that would have required Harvard to commit to “structural and personnel changes” to foster “viewpoint diversity”, eliminate its diversity programmes and agree to external audits.</p>\n<p>It refused. Instead, Harvard President Alan Garber said such requests would violate Harvard’s rights as a private institution committed to academic freedom.</p>\n<p>Since then, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/5/14/trump-administration-cuts-another-450m-in-harvard-grants-in-escalating-row\">has stripped</a> Harvard of <a href=\"/news/2025/3/31/trump-threatens-to-yank-billions-in-harvard-university-contracts-and-grants\">billions of dollars</a> in federal contracts, research funding and grants. A federal court in Boston began hearing a legal challenge against that decision this week.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-multi-pronged-attack\">A multipronged attack</h2>\n<p>But the Trump administration has also explored other avenues to pressure Harvard into compliance.</p>\n<p>Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/donald-trump-renews-threats-against-harvard-universitys-tax-exempt-status\">threatened to revoke</a> Harvard’s tax-exempt status — though critics warn it would be illegal to do so — and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trump-blocks-harvards-ability-to-enroll-international-students-nyt-report\">blocked</a> Harvard from accessing the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP), a system that schools are required to use to enrol international students.</p>\n<p>Foreign students make up about a quarter of Harvard’s student body. Losing access to the SEVP system effectively meant those students were no longer able to attend the school.</p>\n<p>Harvard <a href=\"/news/2025/6/6/harvard-challenges-trumps-efforts-to-block-us-entry-for-foreign-students\">challenged</a> the Trump administration’s ban on its foreign students in court and received a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/23/blatant-violation-harvard-sues-trump-over-move-to-block-foreign-students\">preliminary injunction</a> that allows its international students to remain while the case plays out.</p>\n<p>But other hurdles have since emerged. Earlier this month, for instance, the Trump administration accused Harvard of civil rights violations and called for a <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-education-harvard-accreditor-notice.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review of its accreditation</a>, the industry-wide quality standard that gives university diplomas their value.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, news outlets have reported that officials from the Trump administration and Harvard continue to negotiate over whether a deal can be struck to defuse the ongoing tensions.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

They captured Belaya Gora on Sunday and Novotoretskoye on Tuesday, both in Donetsk.</p>\n<p>While holding its front line, Ukraine has targeted Moscow with long-range weapons for the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>Russian air defences downed 13 drones approaching Moscow on Saturday, said its mayor, and Ukrainian drones disrupted traffic in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday, said Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation.</p>\n<p>Then, on Monday, Russia claimed to have shot down 74 Ukrainian drones, a third of them near Moscow. Others must have hit their targets, because a fire at Kamenolomny station in the Rostov region caused delays to train services in the Caucasus.</p>\n<p>Kovalenko also said that on June 11, Ukrainian drones attacked the Lukhovitsky Aviation Plant in the Moscow region, which produces MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighters. Ukraine’s General Staff said drones also hit the Shipunov Design Bureau – a manufacturer of anti-aircraft missiles.</p>\n<p>The following day, Ukraine reportedly blew up a gas pipeline in Khanty-Mansiysk, about 3,000km (1,900 miles) from Moscow.

Putin would attend China’s 80th anniversary celebrations commemorating its defeat of Japan in World War II, the Kremlin said, and could meet with Trump if the latter accepted the invitation.</p>\n<p>Trump has spent most of his political career demonising China, however, and might resist casting it in the role of peace broker.</p>\n<p>US Air Force general Alexus Grynkewich told Bild last week that “the EU and the US have only 18 months to prepare for a global military conflict with China and Russia.</p>\n<p>“China and Russia are preparing for a simultaneous strike on Taiwan and Europe,” Grynkewich was quoted as saying.</p>\n<p>“The conflict could start with a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Since Russia is currently a satellite of the PRC, Xi Jinping will undoubtedly coordinate actions with Putin. We will need every piece of equipment, all available machinery, and every munition we can get to be ready,” reported the commander-in-chief of NATO’s European forces.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The movement drew national attention before university administrators called NYPD officers to dismantle the camps, resulting in dozens of arrests.</p>\n<p>“Suspension from Columbia for protesting genocide is the highest honour,” said Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an umbrella coalition of student groups, <a href=\"https://x.com/columbiabds?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a post on X</a>.</p>\n<p>“We reject that Columbia has any reputation worth upholding and we categorically state that we do not wish to uphold it,” the student body said.</p>\n<p>So, why has Columbia expelled these students? And why has the Trump administration clamped down on universities?</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-has-happened\">What has happened?</h2>\n<p>Columbia University has disciplined nearly 80 students for their participation in pro-Palestinian protests – to “separate them from the University”.</p>\n<p>The disciplinary action follows a series of demonstrations on campus, including a student-led occupation of Butler Library during final exams on May 7 earlier this year.</p>\n<p>The NYPD arrested 78 individuals that day. The protests are part of a call for the university to divest from companies linked to the Israeli military, cut all financial ties with Israel, and express solidarity with Palestinians amid the continuing war in Gaza.</p>\n<p>According to student organisers, the suspended students took part in a “peaceful teach-in” which included readings and discussions about Palestinian writer and activist <a href=\"/features/2017/3/7/basil-al-araj-was-a-beacon-for-palestinian-youth\">Basil al-Araj</a>, killed by Israeli forces in 2017.</p>\n<p>The mass disciplinary action, described as the biggest of its kind in Columbia’s history, has sparked backlash from civil liberties groups and fellow students.</p>\n<p>Organisers argue the crackdown is part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on US campuses and have linked it to a pending agreement between Columbia and Trump administration officials.</p>\n<p>The University’s student newspaper, Columbia Spectator, reported that the majority of students received a two-year suspension. The students have reportedly been asked to apologise to the university before they can be allowed to return to campus.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced it would withhold approximately $400m in funding for Columbia University, citing the institution’s alleged failure to adequately address anti-Semitism amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus.</p>\n<p>That move prompted Columbia to concede to a list of demands laid down by the government in return for negotiations to reinstate its funding. Among other concessions, the university agreed to ban face masks and to empower 36 campus police officers with special powers to arrest students.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852414\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852414\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852414\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-05-08T021835Z_1645505848_RC2BDEA7FOE7_RTRMADP_3_USA-COLUMBIA-PROTESTS-1753273425.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852414\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pro-Palestinian protesters are loaded into NYPD buses after being detained by public safety officers, following a protest at Butler Library on the campus of Columbia University in New York, US, on May 7, 2025 [Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-has-columbia-said\">What has Columbia said?</h2>\n<p>In a statement published on Tuesday, the University stated that the disruption at Butler Library during reading period had affected hundreds of students and subsequently led to the interim suspension of Columbia participants.</p>\n<p>The University said sanctions would include probation, suspensions ranging from one year to three years, degree revocations, and expulsions.</p>\n<p>It did not state how many faced each of these sanctions, nor did it reveal any of the students’ identities, citing student privacy.</p>\n<p>“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community. And to create a thriving academic community, there must be respect for each other and the institution’s fundamental work, policies, and rules,” the statement noted. “Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and Rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-have-students-responded\">How have students responded?</h2>\n<p>News of the suspensions and expulsions came on the same day that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/my-duty-columbia-protester-mahmoud-khalil-meets-lawmakers-at-us-capitol\">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, the Columbia University protest leader targeted for deportation by President Donald Trump, met with lawmakers in Washington, DC, just over a month after the 30-year-old, a legal permanent resident of the United States, was <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/us-judge-orders-release-of-palestine-advocate-mahmoud-khalil\">released from immigration custody</a> in Louisiana.</p>\n<p>Khalil continues to face deportation under the Trump administration, which has relied on an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in its attempts to expel international students involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>\n<p>In response to the suspensions and expulsion announced by Columbia on Tuesday, the student activist group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an umbrella coalition of student groups, noted that while “the US and Israel starve 2.1 million Gazans to death, Columbia has worked diligently with [Trump’s administration] to suspend dozens of students for pro-Palestine activism”.</p>\n<p>The group noted the suspensions were the highest ever for a single political protest in Columbia’s history and “hugely exceed sentencing precedent for teach-ins or non-Palestine-related building occupations”.</p>\n<p>“Students remain committed to ending US- and Columbia-backed Israeli genocide regardless of the school’s sanctions,” the student body said in its statement.</p>\n<p>Quoting a testimony from students’ July disciplinary hearings, the group reiterated: “Every university in Gaza has been destroyed. Hundreds of academics have been killed. Books and archives have been incinerated. Entire families have been erased from the civil registry. This is not a war. It is a campaign of erasure.”</p>\n<p>“We will not be deterred.

Bolsonaro, often dubbed the “Trump of the tropics”, is facing trial for allegedly attempting to orchestrate a coup to remain in power despite his 2022 election loss to Lula.</p>\n<p>Trump also erroneously claimed a trade deficit with Brazil. Brazil has a deficit of about $7.4bn with the US, and a surplus of about $31bn with China.</p>\n<p>The political nature of the tariffs marked a sharp departure from Trump’s usual rationale, drawing widespread condemnation across Brazil’s political spectrum, and from China.</p>\n<p>“Tariffs should not be a tool of coercion, intimidation, or interference,” a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>By using tariffs for political leverage rather than economic reasons, Trump risks tarnishing the US’s reputation as a reliable trade partner, experts say, making China appear more stable and predictable by comparison.</p>\n<p>“China, to date, has shown no indication of backtracking on decisions or making sudden changes,” said Mauricio Weiss, an economics professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"strengthening-chinese-ties\">Strengthening Chinese ties</h2>\n<p>The Asian country overtook the US as Brazil’s biggest export market in 2009, and the two countries’ trade and investment ties have only grown stronger since then.</p>\n<p>A notable signal of deepening ties came on Monday, when Brazil’s Ministry of Finance announced plans to establish a tax advisory office in Beijing. Brazil only has four other such offices globally – three in South America and one in the US.</p>\n<p>“The motivation is not politically driven, but rather justified by the growing importance of bilateral trade relations and the need to deepen cooperation on fiscal and customs matters,” Brazil’s ministry said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>China has sought to fuel its own domestic growth through access to natural resources and raw materials, such as oil, iron ore, copper, lithium and agricultural products.</p>\n<p>But since 2007, China has also invested more than $73bn in Brazil, according to CEBC. Much of those funds are pouring into strategic sectors such as energy, infrastructure, agribusiness and technology.</p>\n<p>“The United States still invests more heavily in Brazil, but China’s investments are more targeted and coordinated between governments,” said Weiss.</p>\n<p>Chinese products are also becoming increasingly common in Brazil. Electric cars made by Chinese manufacturer BYD are now a common sight, with seven out of 10 electric vehicles sold in Brazil coming from the company.</p>\n<p>Particularly symbolic of China’s growing presence to the detriment of the US was BYD’s purchase of a massive factory previously owned by Ford in Brazil’s northeastern state of Bahia.</p>\n<p>The two countries have also agreed to explore transportation integration. Those plans include a bi-oceanic rail corridor linking Brazil to the Chinese-built port of Chancay in Peru.</p>\n<p>Xi’s inauguration in November of the mega-port – where total investment is expected to top $3.5bn over the next decade – put China’s regional influence on stark display.</p>\n<p>Other Latin American nations, including Peru, Colombia, and Chile, have also signalled their rapprochement with China, amid fears of Trump’s intentions for the region. He has previously pledged to “take back” the Panama Canal, including by force.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>But some have pointed out the deepening relation between China and Brazil does not mean the South American country will start exporting the goods it currently sends to the US to China, as the two countries buy very different products from Brazilian companies.</p>\n<p>“Brazil isn’t going to export manufactured products to China. That doesn’t make much sense,” said Livio Ribeiro, a researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Economics at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.</p>\n<p>Even then, Chinese investments could play a crucial role in enabling Brazil to boost its industrial capacity and diversify its economy, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“Simply being able to produce more of these products domestically and for other South American partners will already be a significant growth opportunity,” Weiss said.</p>\n<p>Speaking during a state visit in China in May, Lula said Brazil and China will be “indispensable partners” because “China needs Brazil and Brazil needs China.”</p>\n<p>“Together, we can make the Global South respected in the world like never before,” Lula added.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The western state tallied 8,110 blazes in 2024 alone — more than any other part of the country.</p>\n<p>Just last week, the insurance company Gallagher Re <a href=\"https://www.ajg.com/gallagherre/-/media/files/gallagher/gallagherre/news-and-insights/2025/july/h1-2025-natural-catastrophe-and-climate-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that two blazes this year in the Los Angeles area — the Eaton and Palisades fires — were responsible for nearly $40bn in insured losses alone. An estimated 30 people died in those fires.</p>\n<p>That toll has put California in the crosshairs of a nationwide debate about how best to deal with wildfires and what the state and federal roles should be.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, on the six-month anniversary of the deadly infernos, US Senator Alex Padilla called on the federal government to invest more in fire preparedness, rather than scale back, as President Donald Trump has suggested he may do.</p>\n<p>“We’re entering the next peak fire season. Fire season is year-round in California, but peak fire season is just beginning,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that the Los Angeles conflagrations sparked in the relatively mild month of January: “These fires took place in wintertime, not in the hot dry months of summer.”</p>\n<p>That, experts say, is an indication of the potential scale of California’s wildfires, even under less-than-ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"potential-for-a-fairly-severe-season\">Potential for a ‘fairly severe’ season</h2>\n<p>Scientists say that California’s wildfires have been fairly subdued so far this year, but they are expected to pick up as summer progresses into August, especially in parts of the state that have struggled with drought in recent months.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a number of small-to-medium-sized fires, but nothing too startling so far,” Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), told Al Jazeera in a recent phone call.</p>\n<p>“But that’s kind of where we’d expect to be at this point in the season. And we’ve seen some factors that point to what could be a fairly severe fire season as we enter the drier months.”</p>\n<p>Scientists are quick to stress that wildfire seasons can be affected by a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>Events associated with wildfire, such as periods of high winds, extreme heat or lightning storms, are themselves mercurial. Acts of human error or negligence, like a downed power line or a failure to properly extinguish a campfire, can also set a landscape ablaze.</p>\n<p>Once a burn starts, elements like wind strength and firefighter access can make the difference between a fire that is quickly snuffed out and one that grows larger and more intense.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to come up with a single rationale for why some seasons are so much more intense than others,” said Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science and forest policy at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>The fire seasons of 2020 and 2021 in California, for example, saw record-breaking fires that spread across enormous portions of land.</p>\n<p>The next several years were, by comparison, fairly tame, although scientists say that factors such as <a href=\"/news/2025/1/11/is-climate-change-to-blame-for-the-california-wildfires\">climate change</a> have contributed to fire seasons that see higher-than-average levels of activity.</p>\n<p>But there are some indicators that scientists and fire officials look to as clues, such as the prevalence of drought and the level of moisture present in soil and plant life. While many catalysts can spark a fire, how quickly it spreads and how unstoppable it becomes is largely a matter of fuel, in the form of thick, dry vegetation.</p>\n<p>Stephens says that southern California’s chaparral landscape — typified by low-lying shrubs like sage — is especially prone to fire, and it has had a “very dry” year.</p>\n<p>The US Drought Monitor says that about 23 percent of the state is currently experiencing conditions ranging from severe to exceptional drought, with many of those areas concentrated in southern California.</p>\n<p>California’s largest fire of the year thus far, the Madre Fire, took place in San Luis Obispo County in central California and reached about 80,000 acres (32,400 hectares), according to the state agency Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>That blaze is more than 95 percent contained, the term fire officials use to reference the portion of a fire effectively surrounded by protective lines built to stop it from spreading.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3573144\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3573144\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3573144\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-01-23T061857Z_760650648_RC28FCAK6XS4_RTRMADP_3_CALIFORNIA-WILDFIRES-1741739931.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A pair of firefighters stand silhouetted against a burning blaze at night: One points.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3573144\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Firefighters battle the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, north of Santa Clarita, California, on January 22 [Ringo Chiu/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"shifting-policies-for-emergency-management\">Shifting policies for emergency management</h2>\n<p>Political changes are also looming over this year’s fire season, as cuts to weather forecasting and emergency services under the Trump administration spark concern.</p>\n<p>Scientists argue that such services play an essential role in trying to understand each fire season.</p>\n<p>“We rely a lot on modelled forecasts for different weather events, and fire weather is certainly an example of that,” said Moritz. “If these services take a hit, we’re all at risk of worse outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Since returning to office for a second term, Trump has led an effort to downscale the federal government, including by reducing its emergency services and scientific research.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, for instance, the National Weather Service (NWS) lost nearly 600 workers as part of the Trump-led employee reduction. The president has since faced criticism after a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/as-deadly-storms-in-texas-subside-eyes-turn-to-govt-response-to-flooding\">series of floods</a> in the state of Texas killed nearly 135 people: Democratic lawmakers have blamed staffing cuts for hindering forecasting and emergency response efforts.</p>\n<p>The administration has also sought to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees the federal response to disaster recovery.</p>\n<p>Trump had proposed redistributing FEMA’s responsibilities to state and local governments. In the meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reportedly implemented a policy in June that required any FEMA expenses over $100,000 to be approved by her personally.</p>\n<p>That, critics say, has led to a slowdown in services. Just last Monday, CNN broke the news that Ken Pagurek, the head of FEMA’s search and rescue operations for urban areas, resigned in frustration over the bureaucratic hurdles.</p>\n<p>Trump himself has threatened to withhold disaster aid from states like California if they do not align with his policies on immigration and other issues. He and his allies have blamed Democrats for the Los Angeles wildfires.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in January.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"preventing-out-of-control-wildfires\">Preventing out-of-control wildfires</h2>\n<p>California, however, has sought to implement its own measures to address the challenges that come with longer and more intense fire seasons.</p>\n<p>Those tactics include a greater emphasis on fuel reduction efforts, including through prescribed burns, in which fire is intentionally introduced to a landscape under controlled circumstances to help thin excess vegetation.</p>\n<p>“Prescribed burns are something we’ve definitely encouraged. We’re doing a lot more of them than we used to,” said Jesse Torres, a spokesperson with Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>He says that such efforts typically take place in late spring, after periods of rainfall when wetter conditions reduce the risk of a prescribed burn spreading out of control.</p>\n<p>Fire scientists, however, say that the scale of those efforts has yet to reach the levels needed to have a serious impact on the state’s fire activity.</p>\n<p>While Cal Fire has a yearly goal of treating 500,000 acres (202,300 hectares) of land through fuel reduction efforts, Cal Fire says it has only covered about 156,000 acres (63,100 hectares) during the current fiscal year, although it expects that figure to increase.</p>\n<p>“There is still a lack of sufficient burning and thinning efforts,” said Stephens. “If forests were more resilient, the impact of these fires would be less extreme.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Some have now been living in the basement for nearly two months.</p>\n<p>Most of these men – along with a handful of women – are former prisoners in Russia who have been deported after serving their sentences, but some have been expelled for other reasons, such as problems with their immigration documents.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, July 20, they mounted a protest.</p>\n<p>“We’re not allowed outside!” one of the men shouted as they were surrounded by security personnel on the premises.</p>\n<p>“We’re being tortured here,” called another.</p>\n<p>“It’s damp, there’s [disabled people] here without medical attention, there’s nothing here at all,” he added.</p>\n<p>A video sent by the deportees to Al Jazeera shows one man very seriously harming himself during the Sunday night protest.</p>\n<p>“He’s been here more than a month,” 45-year-old Nikolai Lopata, one of the other detainees, told Al Jazeera by phone.</p>\n<p>“He was promised twice [that] he would be taken away. He bought [travel] tickets twice, and both times no one returned the money,” Lopata said, noting that the man, who suffers from anxiety, has repeatedly been denied permission to travel through Georgia to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>An ambulance arrived after more than an hour, and paramedics bandaged his wounds, then left without him. The man, who appeared in the video to be in his late 30s or early 40s, was not hospitalised and remains at the checkpoint,<strong> </strong>volunteers at the scene who are in contact with Al Jazeera said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852445\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852445\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852445\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_20250722_031512_451-1753274206.jpg?w=720&amp;resize=720%2C1280&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia-Georgia border\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian detainees wait in an underground holding area at the Russia-Georgia border, where men sleep in shifts due to the lack of beds [Courtesy of Nikolai Lopata]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"they-won-t-let-us-in-or-out\">‘They won’t let us in or out’</h2>\n<p>The detainees, who have arrived from Russia or territories occupied by Russia and have been released from prison in recent months, are now stuck in limbo in this buffer zone, Lopata explained.</p>\n<p>“They [Georgian border officials] took our documents. They won’t let us in or out of Georgia. They keep telling us ‘tomorrow, tomorrow’. Some people have been here for more than a month and a half in terrible, unbearable conditions,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Originally from Dnipro in central Ukraine, Lopata said he had been living in Russia, where he has a Russian wife, two children and a sister, since 2005. But in 2010, he was convicted of murder. When he completed his sentence in 2024, he was sent to a deportation centre for another year. By then, the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine was raging, so getting a one-way flight to Kyiv was impossible.</p>\n<p>“Last summer, they [the Russian authorities] promised to send me to Georgia. Then, in winter, they promised to send me to Ukraine through Belarus. Then, we were taken to the border of Georgia, which supposedly accepts us, but Georgia is not accepting,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Instead, when he reached the border on July 4, Lopata said, he was photographed, fingerprinted and had his documents confiscated by Georgian border officials before being taken to a cellar.</p>\n<p>“We don’t do anything. We sit in the basement,” Lopata continued, explaining that the men sleep in shifts because there are only 40 beds.</p>\n<p>The men are provided with very little and lack reliable medical assistance, instead having to rely on emergency care.</p>\n<p>“An ambulance comes almost every day, sometimes twice a day, because there are disabled people, there are sick people,” Lopata said, adding that there is someone with epilepsy, a person with HIV, and another with tuberculosis. “But they don’t offer anything besides immediate help. Yesterday, for example, they made an injection of painkiller, then said, ‘That’s it, we can’t help with anything else.’”</p>\n<p>Activists and volunteers try to bring essentials to the detainees each week.</p>\n<p>Food, household items and personal hygiene products are delivered by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMKVq3qIVHm/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volunteers Tbilisi</a>, an organisation helping Ukrainian refugees in Georgia.</p>\n<p>“There is no access to fresh air, there is a lot of heat and the cellars are closed,” organiser Maria Belkina told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“These are not conditions you can live in at all.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_20250722_031524_459-1753274221.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia deportees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian deportees held at the Russia-Georgia borders are not allowed to cross the red barrier except under supervision [Courtesy of Nikolai Lopata]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"route-through-moldova-cancelled\">Route through Moldova cancelled</h2>\n<p>Anna Skripka, a lawyer for the NGO, Protection of Prisoners of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera that this problem has been mounting for the past two years of the war in Ukraine: “This humanitarian disaster started in 2023.”</p>\n<p>Skripka said some people have become so desperate they have tried to kill themselves. “They didn’t understand what was going on,” she said.</p>\n<p>“The conditions there are terrible.”</p>\n<p>According to Skripka, there are 84 men and seven women currently being detained, and while the women are held in a separate room, their conditions are also poor.</p>\n<p>“The women complain to me that they’re not being taken to the toilet,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>“They asked us to buy them a bucket with a lid to go to the toilet.”</p>\n<p>Previously, deportees at this border crossing were transferred by bus to Tbilisi Airport to fly to Moldova and then on to Ukraine. That’s how Ukrainian activist Andriy Kolomiyets, considered a political prisoner by the Russian human rights group Memorial, returned home earlier this month after serving 10 years on drug and attempted murder charges.</p>\n<p>Skripka explained that 43 detainees managed to leave between early June and July, landing in Moldova and then getting a bus to Ukraine. But four of them got off the bus and stayed in Moldova, prompting the landlocked Eastern European country to halt cooperation.</p>\n<p>“They’re already back in Ukraine,” Skripka said about the missing four, which Al Jazeera could not confirm, “but Moldova said, ‘Stop, we do not want to risk it.’”</p>\n<p>As a result, since mid-July, Moldova has refused passage for Ukrainian deportees from Russia.</p>\n<p>While Georgia was cooperative at first, it has also begun refusing to allow deportees through on the basis that many are ex-convicts who have served prison time in Russia, seriously limiting the options for Ukrainians trying to return.</p>\n<p>“Most of these individuals have a serious criminal past and have been convicted numerous times for grave or particularly grave crimes,” the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>\n<p>But Skripka said that it is unfair to smear them all as hardened criminals. Some were expelled from Russia for lacking proper paperwork. Others have had their Russian citizenship revoked.</p>\n<p>Their treatment, Skripka argues, goes beyond bureaucratic injustice; it raises serious legal and moral questions.</p>\n<p>“They were beaten, pushed from another country by the barrel of a machinegun … they are victims of war crimes,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>Further complicating things, many of the deportees lack the proper documentation.</p>\n<p>Ukraine has been issuing “white passports” – emergency documents to allow citizens to travel home – but these only last for 30 days<b>.</b></p>\n<p>Some Ukrainian politicians have spoken out.</p>\n<p>Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha <a href=\"https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1946526214425813071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> Russia of “weaponizing the deportation of Ukrainian citizens through Georgia”.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>“We are actively working with the Georgian and Moldovan sides to get the rest of our people transited to Ukraine,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“To avoid further complications, we publicly offer Russia to send these categories of Ukrainian citizens directly to the Ukrainian border. We will be prepared to take them on from there. There are relevant parts of the border where this can be done.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-matter-of-national-security\">A matter of national security</h2>\n<p>Once detainees have returned to Ukraine, they must undergo a thorough security check.</p>\n<p>“They were in Russia for a long time. Everything is possible. They could have been recruited [by Russian intelligence]. This is a matter of national security for Ukraine,” Skripka explained.</p>\n<p>There are also fears that the number of deportees will soar in the coming months as there are hundreds of Ukrainians who are still waiting in Russian deportation camps.</p>\n<p>“According to our calculations, there are about 800 people. And if they are all brought to Georgia, it will be a disaster,” Skripka warned.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in March, an edict issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin demands that Ukrainians living in the territories claimed by Moscow must either <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/06/19/a-false-semblance-of-choice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leave or accept</a> Russian citizenship by September 10. This could potentially lead to mass deportations.</p>\n<p>Lopata, meanwhile, can’t wait to leave, although not necessarily home.</p>\n<p>“My house in Ukraine has been bombed. My parents have been killed, and I don’t know where to go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I just really want to get out of here any way I can.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

He called the climate crisis “an existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet”.</p>\n<p>Notably, the court said a “clean, healthy and sustainable environment” is a human right. That paves the way for other legal actions, including states returning to the ICJ to hold each other to account as well as domestic lawsuits.</p>\n<p>While the ICJ’s ruling is not binding, it said that countries themselves have an obligation to take binding measures to comply with climate treaties. But crucially, the ICJ said industrialised nations have a legal obligation to take the lead in combating climate change, due to their greater historical responsibility for emissions.</p>\n<p>The judges also affirmed that countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement must ensure their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), their individual national climate plans, are “progressive” and reflect the “highest possible ambition,” in line with the treaty’s aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>The opinion was immediately welcomed by environmental groups. Oxfam climate change policy lead Nafkote Dabi said: “This ruling elevates national climate commitments everywhere by confirming that countries must reduce emissions enough to protect the universal rights to life, food, health and a clean environment.</p>\n<p>“All countries, particularly rich ones, now have to cut their emissions faster and phase out fossil fuels. Rich countries have to increase their financing to Global South countries to help them reduce emissions and protect their people from past and future harm. This is not a wish list – it is international law.”</p>\n<p>Danilo Garrido, legal counsel at Greenpeace International, said the opinion marked the “start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level”.</p>\n<p>“The message of the court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licences and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law,” he said. “Polluters must stop emitting and must pay for the harms they have caused.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"two-fundamental-questions\">Two fundamental questions</h2>\n<p>After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations fearing they could be submerged under rising sea waters, the United Nations General Assembly asked the ICJ in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a nonbinding but important basis for international obligations.</p>\n<p>The landmark opinion of the 15 judges of the ICJ – who all voted unanimously in favour of the opinion – will carry legal and political weight and is likely to determine the course of future climate action across the world, including whether polluters should be made to pay for their actions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852830\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852830\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852830\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/afp_68810b168d5f-1753287446.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Yuji Iwasawa (C) and members issue first Advisory Opinion (AO) on States' legal obligations to address climate change, in The Hague on July 23, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852830\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Yuji Iwasawa (centre) and members issue their first advisory opinion on states’ legal obligations to address climate change, The Hague, the Netherlands, July 23, 2025 [AFP]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Judges waded through tens of thousands of pages of written submissions and heard two weeks of <a href=\"/news/2024/12/14/icj-weighs-legal-responsibility-for-climate-change-future-of-our-planet\">oral arguments</a> during the ICJ’s biggest-ever case, as they sought to pull together different strands of environmental law into a definitive international standard.</p>\n<p>The UN asked the ICJ, a UN court that adjudicates disputes between nations, to address two key questions. What are states obliged to do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions now and for future generations? And what are the consequences for states whose emissions cause harm, particularly to vulnerable island states?</p>\n<p>The case was led by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries.</p>\n<p>Before the ruling, supporters of climate action gathered outside the court, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</h2>\n<p>In two weeks of hearings last December at the ICJ, the United States, the world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, along with other top polluters, told the judges that existing climate treaties like the 2015 Paris Agreement, which are largely nonbinding, should be the basis for determining their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement does not explicitly provide for direct compensation for past damage caused by pollution, although at UN talks in 2022, wealthy nations did agree to <a href=\"/news/2024/11/23/un-climate-talks-in-disarray-as-developing-nations-stage-walkout\">create a fund</a> to help vulnerable countries deal with current impacts caused by past pollution.</p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement saw more than 190 countries commit efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>But it has failed to curb global greenhouse gas emissions, and last year, the UN warned in a report that current climate policies will result in global warming of more than 3C (5.4F) above preindustrial levels by 2100.</p>\n<p>Legal experts say the ruling is a victory for small island and low-lying states that had asked the court to clarify states’ responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The ICJ rejected arguments by the likes of the US and UK that governments are bound only by climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement and did not have stronger obligations under international law,” Dabi said.</p>\n<p>“We now have a powerful tool for holding countries to account for their obligations, especially in protecting the world’s most marginalised people and future generations of humanity.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The Israelis certainly owe Bret Stephens a favour.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, The New York Times opinion columnist took to the pages of the United States newspaper of record to promote his latest deranged argument, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/opinion/no-israel-is-not-committing-genocide-in-gaza.html\">headlined</a>: “No, Israel Is Not Committing Genocide in Gaza”.</p>\n<p>Never mind that numerous global institutions, ranging from various United Nations bodies to Amnesty International, have determined that Israel is committing just that. These are organisations that hardly throw the G-word around lightly, but Stephens knows better. And he will tell us why.</p>\n<p>In the very first paragraph of his Times intervention – which should perhaps come accompanied by a trigger warning for readers prone to aneurysms – Stephens demands defiantly: “If the Israeli government’s intentions and actions are truly genocidal – if it is so malevolent that it is committed to the annihilation of Gazans – why hasn’t it been more methodical and vastly more deadly?”</p>\n<p>It would seem, of course, that the Israeli military’s near-comprehensive conversion of much of the Gaza Strip into rubble – via the bombardment of homes, hospitals, schools, and everything else that can be bombed – would be rather “methodical”. As for the perceived insufficient deadliness of Israel’s ongoing “actions”, Stephens cites the official Palestinian death count of “nearly 60,000” in less than two years, and wonders why there are “not, say, hundreds of thousands of deaths”.</p>\n<p>He goes on to proclaim that “the first question the anti-Israel genocide chorus needs to answer is: Why isn’t the death count higher?”</p>\n<p>Among the many questions that Stephens himself needs to answer, meanwhile, is why he thinks slaughtering 60,000 people is no big deal. As of November 2024, Israel had killed <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2024/11/21/an-a-to-z-of-the-children-killed-by-israel-in-gaza\">at least 17,400 children</a> in Gaza – but even this is apparently not “malevolent” enough. Furthermore, according to a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says\">study</a> published in the Lancet medical journal more than one year ago, the true death toll in Gaza was already potentially set to exceed 186,000. How’s that for “hundreds of thousands”?</p>\n<p>In lieu of waiting for an answer from the “anti-Israel genocide chorus”, Stephens presents his own, which is that “Israel is manifestly not committing genocide.” Citing the UN genocide convention’s definition of the term as the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”, Stephens proceeds to announce that “I am aware of no evidence of an Israeli plan to deliberately target and kill Gazan civilians.”</p>\n<p>Objectively speaking, this is the equivalent in terms of ludicrousness of claiming that there is no evidence of a plan by the operators of a chicken slaughterhouse to deliberately end the lives of the poultry therein. You don’t kill 17,400 children in 13 months by accident; nor do you repeatedly bomb hospitals and ambulances if you aren’t, you know, deliberately aiming to kill civilians.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about bombs. <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/7/22/is-israel-implementing-a-strategy-of-genocide-by-starvation-in-gaza\">Forced starvation</a> is genocide, too. And on that note, another question Stephens might answer is how intentionally depriving a population of two million people of the food and water that is necessary for human survival does not constitute an “intent to destroy” that group. Yesterday alone, Gaza health officials <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/at-least-15-starve-to-death-in-24-hours-in-gaza-as-israel-continues-attacks\">reported</a> that at least 15 Palestinians had starved to death, including four children.</p>\n<p>Since the end of May, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">more than 1,000 Palestinians</a> have also been killed while trying to procure food from the so-called <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/2/in-gaza-aid-kills\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF). This diabolical outfit, backed by Israel and the US, not only concentrates large numbers of starving Palestinians in a single location for easier mowing down by the Israeli army, but also furthers Israel’s US-backed vision of forcibly expelling the surviving Palestinian population.</p>\n<p>While Stephens does deign to mention the “chaotic food distribution system” in Gaza, he insists that “bungled humanitarian schemes or trigger-happy soldiers or strikes that hit the wrong target or [Israeli] politicians reaching for vengeful sound bites do not come close to adding up to a genocide.”</p>\n<p>And yet in his war on the use of the G-word in the Gaza context, Stephens refuses to acknowledge that Israel itself has been a genocidal endeavour from the get-go. Zionists were well aware of the need to dispense with the majority of the Indigenous population of Palestine even before the formal creation of the state of Israel on Palestinian land in 1948, a process that entailed mass killing and the destruction of hundreds of villages. Some three-quarters of a million people were made refugees.</p>\n<p>Since then, Israel has continued on what is fundamentally genocidal footing, working to disappear the Palestinians both physically and conceptually – as exemplified in the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir’s famous <a href=\"/features/2019/3/18/the-mixed-legacy-of-golda-meir-israels-first-female-pm\">assertion</a> that the Palestinians “did not exist”. Indeed, Israel’s existence as a Jewish settler-colonial state is predicated on the very “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”.</p>\n<p>Anyway, forget history and reality. Stephens warns us that, if the word genocide “is to retain its status as a uniquely horrific crime, then the term can’t be promiscuously applied to any military situation we don’t like”.</p>\n<p>Speaking of promiscuity, the Israeli military has long been in bed with <a href=\"/opinions/2024/2/17/thomas-friedman-dehumanisation-par-excellence-amid-a-genocide\">The New York Times</a> and a host of other US corporate media outlets, which do their best to sanitise Israeli atrocities as self-defence. But as Israel now continues to carry out a uniquely horrific crime in Gaza with the firm backing of the global superpower, Stephens’s genocidal journalism is also uniquely horrific.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

They condemned the Israeli government’s siege for creating conditions of “chaos, starvation, and death”, citing that food, clean water, and medical supplies are unable to reach those in need due to severe access restrictions.</p>\n<p data-start=\"525\" data-end=\"898\">At least 10 Palestinians have died of <a href=\"/features/2025/7/22/flour-fire-and-fear-as-i-try-to-parent-in-a-starving\">forced starvation</a> in the past 24 hours in Gaza, bringing the death toll from hunger to 111, including at least 80 children, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1228\" data-end=\"1596\">More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while attempting to reach food, mostly in mass shootings by Israeli forces near Israel- and United States-backed GHF distribution points. The agency has come under sharp criticism, including from the United Nations, for its lack of neutrality and for allowing military involvement in aid distribution.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1927\" data-end=\"2198\">Israel, which maintains control over all entry points into Gaza, denies responsibility for the food shortages.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
