Khan and Bibi have denied all of the charges against them.</p><p>Here is what we know about why visits to Khan have been blocked.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-khan-in-jail\">Why is Khan in jail?</h2><p>Khan, who was prime minister of Pakistan from 2018 to 2022, has been in prison since his arrest in August 2023 on corruption charges. He is serving prison sentences following a slew of legal cases, including:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Al-Qadir Trust case:</strong> Khan and his wife were accused of accepting land worth 7 billion rupees ($25.12m) as a bribe from a real estate developer in exchange for illegal favours, via a trust called al-Qadir, which was established in 2018. In January 2025, Khan was sentenced by an Islamabad accountability court to 14 years in prison and Bibi to seven years, after being found guilty.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Toshakhana case:</strong> In August 2023, Khan was arrested and later found guilty of <a href=\"/news/2024/4/1/pakistan-court-suspends-imran-khans-prison-sentence-in-state-gifts-case\">selling state gifts</a> worth more than 140 million Pakistani rupees ($497,000), which he allegedly received during his premiership. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Anti-terrorism charges:</strong> Following Khan’s arrest in May 2023, his supporters staged often-violent protests across Pakistan. Khan now also faces anti-terrorism charges in relation to the protests. He was indicted in December 2024 in an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi and pleaded not guilty. He has not been tried yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Cypher case:</strong> Khan was charged with making public a classified cable – a cypher – sent to Islamabad by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington in 2022. He was indicted alongside senior PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in October 2023. Khan and Qureshi were found guilty by a special court established under the Official Secrets Act and were convicted in January 2024. Qureshi and Khan were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</li>\n<li><strong>Iddat case:</strong> Khan and his wife were accused of marrying before his wife’s mandatory waiting period following her divorce from her previous husband. They were acquitted in July.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khan argues that all the cases brought against him are politically motivated.</p><h2>What did Uzma Khanum say about her visit to Khan?</h2><p>Following her visit with her brother on Tuesday, Khanum, who is a doctor, told reporters in Rawalpindi that her brother is confined to his cell for most of the day and is allowed outside for only a short period of time.</p><p>“He is physically well. But he is kept inside all the time and only goes out for a short while. There is no contact with anybody. He was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”</p><p>She added that her 30-minute meeting with Khan had been closely supervised, with no mobile devices allowed.</p><p>Later, alongside her sister Aleema Khanum and leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), she told the media: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”</p><h2 id=\"have-visits-to-khan-been-officially-blocked\">Have visits to Khan been officially blocked?</h2><p>Pakistan’s authorities have not confirmed whether there is an official block on visits to Khan or what the reason for that might be.</p><p>Tuesday’s meeting with his sister followed claims from Khan’s family and PTI leaders that visits to him had been blocked despite court orders allowing them.</p><p>In late October this year, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement an order it issued in March permitting Khan to meet with designated visitors on Tuesday and Thursday each week.</p><p>Family members say these visits were never allowed, however. As a result, rumours began to circulate among Khan’s supporters that he was either ill or being transferred to another jail. Some even speculated that Khan had died.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-action-have-his-family-and-supporters-taken\">What action have his family and supporters taken?</h2><p>Khan’s sisters and supporters have long protested against Khan’s imprisonment. They first staged a physical protest outside Adiala jail over the blocked access on November 18.</p><p>They said their protest was also in solidarity with the families of PTI members who were killed during clashes with security forces during earlier popular protests calling for Khan’s release from prison on May 9, 2023; October 4, 2024; and November 26, 2024.</p><p>On November 18, Khan’s sisters alleged that they were “violently detained” and manhandled while camping outside Adiala jail.</p><p>In a second protest outside the jail on November 25, which was livestreamed on the PTI YouTube channel, Aleema said: “Who knows, maybe Imran has been shifted. Why are they not letting us meet him?”</p><p>Then, Sohail Afridi, PTI member and chief minister of Pakistan’s northwestern province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, staged an overnight, livestreamed sit-in outside Adiala jail on November 28, claiming he had been denied access to Khan eight times.</p><p>Protests calling for Khan’s release also broke out in the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has been a PTI stronghold since 2013 when the party first formed a provincial government there.</p><p>Tuesday’s meeting between Khan and his sister finally took place as protests continued outside Adiala jail.</p><p>Then on Tuesday, local authorities enacted Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, allowing district administrations to forbid the assembly of four or more people in public areas for limited periods of time in two places – for two months in Islamabad and until Wednesday this week in Rawalpindi.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-government-said\">What has the government said?</h2><p>The government has not explicitly confirmed that visits to Khan have been barred or cited any reason for blocking access.</p><p>Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, a politician from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) told the National Assembly on November 28 that Khan was in good health and that rumours about his health had been spread by Indian and Afghan media.</p><p>“His health is perfectly fine and there is no danger to his life,” Chaudhry said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4147810\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4147810\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4147810\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-02T182023Z_1959443505_RC2B8IAGNJCW_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-POLITICS-KHAN-1764761871.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Imran Khan protest\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4147810\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of the jailed former prime minister of Pakistan and leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, Imran Khan, gather during a protest over concerns about his health, near Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on December 2, 2025 [Salahuddin/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-have-khan-s-jail-visits-caused-a-political-storm-in-pakistan\">Why have Khan’s jail visits caused a political storm in Pakistan?</h2><p>Some experts say that barring visits to Khan in jail is a political strategy that may backfire on Pakistan’s governing party, PML-N.</p><p>“The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into [agreeing to] a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of antigovernment sentiment,” political analyst Imtiaz Gul, who is executive director of Islamabad-based think tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Usama Khilji, a columnist based in Pakistan and director of digital rights advocacy organisation Bolo Bhi, told Al Jazeera: “In Pakistan, politicians are either in government or in jail, with the security establishment having the main say behind the scenes in who gets to govern. Imran Khan is currently a victim of politically motivated cases where due process is undermined through an increasingly managed judiciary.”</p><p>Khan’s PTI was barred from contesting in the 2024 national elections, and several party leaders have been arrested. Party members contested the elections as independent candidates and won more seats than any other party.</p><p>But the PTI alleged that the government and military rigged the election to deny them even more seats – and independent observers also pointed to several irregularities in vote counting. The government and military have repeatedly rejected accusations that the elections were manipulated.</p><p>“As the most popular politician in Pakistan at the moment, his political party has faced systematic persecution, and their protests have been met with violent pushback and a virtual outlawing of any kind of demonstrations,” Khilji said.</p><p>“Restricting access to him in jail is being done in violation of court orders and prisoners’ rights in order to send a message to his party and other politicians: if you don’t toe the line, there will be severe consequences.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Pipeline gas imports will stop by November 2027.</p><p>The effort to halt purchases has struggled over the last four years due to the deep dependence of many member states on Russian energy. The bloc’s overall reliance was close to 50 percent before Moscow unleashed its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.</p><p>The move aims “to end dependency on Russian energy following Russia’s weaponisation of gas supplies with significant effects on the European energy market”, said a European Council statement.</p><p>Welcoming the announcement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “Europe is closing the tap on Russian fossil fuels once and for all.

Ministry of Transport said.</p><p>The aircraft, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished from radars shortly after takeoff on March 8, 2014 from Malaysia’s capital Kuala

a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>The ministry said the renewed search effort “underscores the Government of Malaysia’s commitment to providing closure to the families affected by the tragedy”, according to the official Bernama news agency.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2024/3/7/mh370-went-missing-10-years-ago-an-indonesian-family-hopes-it-can-be-found\">Two-thirds of passengers</a> on the ill-fated

investigators</a> said in a 495-page report into the disappearance that they did not know why the plane had vanished and refused to rule out the possibility that someone other than the pilots had diverted the jet from its scheduled route.</p><p>Satellite data showed the plane diverted from its flight path and headed south, to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have run out of fuel and crashed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Initially, an Australia-led search operation scoured 120,000sq km (46,300sq miles) of ocean over three years, but only some pieces of possible debris were found along the coastlines in East African and Indian Ocean countries, including Mozambique, Madagascar and Reunion Island.</p><p>The most recent search for MH370 wrapped up in early April due to bad weather after several weeks of fruitless underwater reconnaissance by the maritime exploration company Ocean Infinity.</p><p>Ocean Infinity, which also led an unsuccessful search in 2018, will restart its hunt for the missing airliner on December 30, Bernama reported.</p><p>Malaysia’s government agreed in March to a “no-find, no-fee” contract with the United Kingdom and United States-based Ocean Infinity to resume a seabed search operation at a new 15,000sq km (5,800sq miles) site in the Indian Ocean, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Ocean Infinity will be paid a $70m fee only if substantial amounts of plane wreckage are discovered.</p><p>Relatives of the passengers and crew have lobbied for years for the hunt to continue and have demanded compensation

Today, 1kg of opium costs $329 in Myanmar, the UNODC said.</p><p>The UNODC report also notes “emerging signs” of heroin flowing from Myanmar to international markets that were previously supplied by narcotics originating in Afghanistan, warning of <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/methamphetamine-trafficking-surges-from-golden-triangle-region\">global demand increasing for opiates</a> originating in the Southeast Asia region due to “heroin supply shortages from Afghanistan”.

Weeks later, the president was impeached and removed from office, ending an extraordinary moment in South Korea’s democratic history.</p><p data-start=\"1117\" data-end=\"1198\">Yoon later issued a public apology for the “anxiety and inconvenience” he caused.</p><p data-start=\"1200\" data-end=\"1256\">But elsewhere, the story often unfolds very differently.</p><p data-start=\"1258\" data-end=\"1417\">Several countries remain under martial law or effective military rule, with wide-ranging implications for civil liberties, political opposition and daily life.</p><p data-start=\"1419\" data-end=\"1525\">So, where does martial law exist today and what does it mean for the people living under it?</p><h2 id=\"what-is-martial-law\" data-start=\"1419\" data-end=\"1525\">What is martial law?</h2><p>Martial law is an emergency system of governance in which the military assumes authority over some or all civilian functions.</p><p>Depending on the country, this can involve the suspension of constitutional rights, curfews and movement restrictions, military trials for civilians, expanded arrest and detention powers, restrictions on media and assembly, and more.</p><p>Sometimes, it also includes the temporary replacement of civilian institutions with military administrators.</p><p>Governments usually justify martial law on grounds of war, mass unrest, armed rebellion or a threat to national stability. Rights groups, however, warn that it is often used to suppress dissent, consolidate power or sideline democratic processes.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-are-under-some-kind-of-military-rule-today\">Which countries are under some kind of military rule today?</h2><h3>Ukraine</h3><p>Ukraine has been under nationwide, self-described martial law since February 24, 2022 – the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. But unlike how martial law is traditionally understood, Ukraine is governed by a civilian administration.</p><p>Ukraine’s situation is closer to what Vina Nadjibulla, vice president for research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, described as a “state of emergency, where governments activate special powers – such as curfews, bans on gatherings, or expanded policing – but within a constitutional framework that keeps civilian institutions, including parliament and the judiciary, formally in charge”.</p><p>Nevertheless, under the martial law decree, the Ukrainian government has granted extended powers to the armed forces, banned men of fighting age – typically those aged 18 to 60 – from leaving the country, and restricted political activity deemed harmful to the war effort.</p><p>Public gatherings also require approval, and media outlets must comply with rules intended to protect national security. These include prohibiting the publishing of reports on air defence systems, and banning footage of missile launches.</p><p data-start=\"158\" data-end=\"456\">The restrictions are broadly accepted by much of the population, but they have raised questions about political accountability and transparency in the country, especially as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government faces growing accusations of corruption.</p><p data-start=\"158\" data-end=\"456\">Ukraine’s martial law has also led to criticism for effectively eliminating political challenges to Zelenskyy, with some critics, including United States President Donald Trump, arguing that the country needs new elections.</p><p>Petro Poroshenko, a former president and leader of the largest opposition party, said earlier this year that while martial law was needed, Zelenskyy, according to him, was using the restrictions to strengthen his power.</p><p>“I want to stress that we should recognise the obvious – the government has started to abuse martial law, using it not only to defend the country, but to build an authoritarian regime,” Poroshenko said during parliamentary debates in April.</p><h3>Myanmar</h3><p>Myanmar’s army seized power in a February 2021 coup, overthrowing the elected government of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The military government has since declared martial law in dozens of townships, especially in major cities like Yangon, Mandalay and conflict-hit ethnic regions, granting commanders sweeping powers to detain, try and execute civilians in military courts.</p><p data-start=\"3201\" data-end=\"3624\">The military’s campaign against anti-coup resistance has plunged parts of the country into full-scale civil war. Internet blackouts and mass arrests have been documented across martial law zones.</p><p data-start=\"3201\" data-end=\"3624\">“Military commanders have taken over local administration, civilian courts have been sidelined, and open criticism of the regime or its proposed elections can lead to harsh punishment,” Nadjibulla said, describing Myanmar as the “clearest example [of martial law] in the Asia Pacific”.</p><p>Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say that <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/01/myanmar-four-years-after-coup-world-must-demand-accountability-for-atrocity-crimes/\">more than 6,000 people have been killed</a> and tens of thousands detained since the coup. For many communities, daily life involves checkpoints, curfews and the constant threat of raids or air strikes.</p><p>The army has bombed schools, hospitals and religious buildings with total impunity, Amnesty said, in “widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population nationwide”.</p><p>In late July, the military announced that it was <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/myanmar-ends-state-of-emergency-before-planned-elections\">lifting the state of emergency</a> from some parts of the country, ahead of national elections scheduled for December 28.</p><p>But some 22,689 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, remain in detention as of December 2, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent organisation that keeps detailed tallies of arrests.</p><p>The United Nations has warned that the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166472\">“military-controlled” elections</a> at the end of the year are unlikely to lead to any democratic transition, and might only “ingrain insecurity, fear and polarisation throughout the country”. Major political parties are barred from contesting the vote.</p><h3>Thailand</h3><p>Thailand is not under nationwide martial law, but specific areas along the country’s southern provinces, including Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, remain under longstanding emergency and security laws that grant the military expanded powers, similar to martial law.</p><p>These measures allow sudden searches, broad arrest powers and heavy military presence as the government continues to combat a longrunning armed rebellion.</p><p>Thailand has recently also declared martial law in the border districts of Chanthaburi, Trat, and Sa Kaeo provinces following clashes with Cambodia.</p><p>The declaration was made to safeguard “national sovereignty, territorial integrity and the lives and property of Thai citizens”, a statement by Apichart Sapprasert, commander of the Border Defence Command, said in July.</p><h3>Burkina Faso</h3><p>Burkina Faso has been under military rule since twin coups that the country underwent in 2022, first in January, then again in September.</p><p>Since then, while the government has not declared nationwide martial law, the country’s military leaders exercise full executive and legislative control, with restrictions on political parties, and curfews are frequently imposed during security operations.</p><p>The military claims its takeover was necessary to restore stability amid escalating attacks by various armed groups. But censorship, arrests of critics and limits on public assembly have tightened over the past year, according to rights groups.</p><p>The European Union and United Nations, among other bodies, have accused Burkina Faso of serious <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/03/un-committee-enforced-disappearances-publishes-findings-cambodia-burkina\">human rights violations</a> in its fight against armed groups, including the indiscriminate killings and forced disappearances of dozens of civilians, among them journalists and human rights defenders.</p><h3>Guinea</h3><p>Guinea’s military seized power in September 2021, suspending the constitution and dissolving parliament. Although martial law is not formally in place, the military government rules by decree.</p><p>Demonstrations have been repeatedly banned, and security forces have been accused of using lethal force against protesters demanding a return to civilian government.</p><p data-start=\"5326\" data-end=\"5446\">Opposition figures face travel bans and arrest threats, and the transition timeline has been repeatedly pushed back.</p><p>In September, voters in <a href=\"/where/guinea/\">Guinea</a> overwhelmingly backed a new constitution that could allow coup leader Mamady Doumbouya to run for president if he chooses to.</p><p>Critics called the results a power grab, but the military government said the referendum paves the way for a return to civilian government. The presidential election is currently expected to take place later this month.</p><p>A charter adopted after the coup barred members of the transitional government from seeking office.</p><p>The country’s two main opposition leaders, Cellou Dalein Diallo and deposed former President Alpha Conde, are among those who called for a boycott of the referendum.</p><p>Their political parties are currently suspended, and Human Rights Watch has accused the government of disappearing political opponents and arbitrarily suspending media outlets.</p><h3 id=\"guinea-bissau\">Guinea-Bissau</h3><p>Guinea-Bissau slipped under military control in late November 2025, after soldiers seized the election commission just as presidential results were due. According to the commission, ballot papers, tally sheets and even the data servers were destroyed, making it <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/guinea-bissaus-electoral-commission-says-coup-destroyed-election-results\">impossible to finalise</a> the count.</p><p data-start=\"436\" data-end=\"644\">The army then installed Major-General Horta Inta-A as a transitional leader under a new “High Military Command”, dissolving civilian authority, and imposing curfews and bans on protests and strikes.</p><p>Guinea-Bissau’s new military authorities are facing growing pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to restore constitutional rule and allow the election process to resume.</p><h3>Madagascar</h3><p>Madagascar has lived under some form of military-backed governance since 2009, when Andry Rajoelina, then a former mayor supported by key army factions, seized power in a coup that set the tone for years of political instability in the country.</p><p>Although several elections have since been held, the military remains a central political actor, often intervening during periods of tension or protest.</p><p>That pattern resurfaced in October 2025, when weeks of youth-led demonstrations over corruption and economic frustration prompted the elite CAPSAT military unit to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/madagascars-new-prime-minister-named-after-military-coup\">defect</a> and take control of the capital.</p><p>As the government collapsed, the army forced out President Rajoelina and installed CAPSAT commander Michael Randrianirina as interim leader.</p><p>The military leadership suspended most national political institutions and the constitution, forming a Council of the Presidency for the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar.</p><p>Randrianirina’s military takeover has been condemned by the United Nations and by the African Union, which suspended Madagascar’s membership.</p><h2 id=\"are-other-countries-veering-towards-m-law\">Are other countries veering towards martial law?</h2><p>Though both are ruled by civilian administrations, the interim governments that came to power in Bangladesh (2024) and Nepal (2025) after their leaders were overthrown rely heavily on the military, Nadjibulla pointed out.</p><p>In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024 after a mass uprising against her rule that intensified following a bloody crackdown on protesters. “Because the police and civilian security services were badly discredited during the unrest, the army has remained highly visible across the country since mid-2024,” Nadjibulla said. “The interim authorities are ruling mainly through executive decrees while preparing elections, with the military acting as a key guarantor of order and of the transition itself.” Bangladesh is poised for elections in February.</p><p>In Nepal, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had to leave office in September 2025 amid youth-led protests.</p><p>An interim administration “took office through procedures that stretched the constitution,” Nadjibulla said. “Human rights groups have reported extensive use of force by police and, in some instances, by army units. This is not martial law on paper, but it shows how quickly security institutions can become the decisive political players in periods of crisis.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The only exception would be an executive order that has effect only until rescinded by the same or another president,” she told Al Jazeera by email.</p><p>“Those orders could be undone by Trump, so presumably, this statement would undo any orders of that kind. But pardons and laws remain valid.”</p><p>PolitiFact, a fact-checking website based at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, separately found that there is “no constitutional mechanism for overturning pardons, and an 1869 judicial ruling found that once delivered, a pardon is final”.</p><p>The US Constitution also does not specify whether a pardon must be signed by hand, PolitiFact said on its website.</p><h2 id=\"who-might-be-affected-by-trump-s-move\">Who might be affected by Trump’s move?</h2><p>Trump has previously insisted that a series of “preemptive” pardons that Biden issued to US legislators who investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol were signed by autopen.</p><p>A mob of Trump supporters, seeking to prevent Biden’s certification as president by Congress, had attacked the Capitol, claiming that the 2020 election was stolen. Trump and his allies have repeatedly failed to demonstrate mass fraud in the election.</p><p>The US president and his allies view Republicans who chose to investigate Trump, such as former members of Congress Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, as traitors to their movement.</p><p>In March, Trump said on Truth Social that the pardons for these legislators were “VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.”</p><h2 id=\"was-biden-the-first-to-use-an-autopen\">Was Biden the first to use an autopen?</h2><p>Biden was not the only US president to rely on an autopen, according to PolitiFact.</p><p>Similar devices have been used throughout most of US history, though as technology has advanced, so has the nature of autopens.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson, the third US president, used what was known as a polygraph: A device consisting of two pens rigged in a way that the second could copy the action of the first.</p><p>In the early 1960s, John F Kennedy used a more modern version of the autopen. More recently, Barack Obama used autopens on some occasions.</p><p>PolitiFact also found two legal memos from 1929 and 2005 stating that the US president does not have to sign documents by hand.</p></div></div></body></html>"
