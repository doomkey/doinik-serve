            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Ever since the crackdown on protests in Iran between January 8 and 10, there has been contention on what the true death toll of those bloody events is. According to figures provided by the Iranian government, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">3,117 people were killed</a>, including civilians and security forces. Yet estimates from outside the country have put the number at anywhere between 5,000 and a staggering 36,500.</p><p>This wide range not only reflects the fact that it has been extremely difficult to verify these reports, but also that there has been a concerted effort to use the death count to manufacture global consent for an attack on Iran and, in a deceitful rhetoric, downplay the official death toll of the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>Since the outbreak of the protests, there has been a race to estimate and report on the casualties – something I call a “Death Toll Olympics”.</p><p>Iran-focused human rights organisations led by dissident activists have been going through all sorts of evidence and testimonies to verify the number of the dead. As of writing this piece, the US-based organisation HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) has cited more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">6,000 deaths</a> and a further 17,000-plus cases under examination.</p><p>However, there are valid doubts about the speed of the activist-led verification process.</p><p>For every reported death, multiple accounts have to be examined, possible duplications must be identified and eliminated; and dates, locations and specific circumstances must be cross-checked against the timeline of events.</p><p>Furthermore, any visual evidence has to be localised and authenticated based on open-source data or corroborated by the accounts of multiple witnesses. From an investigative standpoint, the reliability and quality of activist-led counts that increase rapidly on a daily basis, therefore warrants caution.</p><p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, has cited a conservative estimate of <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">around 5,000 deaths</a>. At the same time, she has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">mentioned</a> that unverified numbers of up to 20,000 have been reported to her by medical sources.</p><p>The described obstacles, and difficulties of verification over the past weeks, have been further exacerbated by Iran’s severely restricted internet access. Despite this, major media outlets have begun distributing much higher figures, solely based on vague anonymous sources who claim privileged access within Iran’s government or health sector.</p><p>On January 25, for example, UK-based TV network Iran International <a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198\">published</a> a report claiming 36,500 were killed, citing “extensive reports” allegedly obtained from the Iranian security apparatus – reports it has neither published nor otherwise made transparent.</p><p>The same day, United States news magazine Time <a href=\"https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/\">published</a> an article titled “Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30,000, According to Local Health Officials”. It claimed that “as many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone” based on the accounts of two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health, whose identities were not revealed for security reasons. Notably, the magazine admitted in the text that it did not possess any means to independently confirm that number.</p><p>Two days later, British newspaper The Guardian followed the same trend with an article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">titled</a> “Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?” The piece introduced the figure of 30,000 based on estimates of an anonymous doctor, who spoke to the newspaper. He and his colleagues in Iran, the outlet admitted, were actually hesitant to provide a concrete figure.</p><p>Other media – from the Sunday Times to the Pierce Morgan Uncensored show – have cited papers circulated by Germany-based ophthalmologist Amir Parasta claiming death toll numbers between <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/iran-young-protesters-news-nsdztp5t2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16,500</a> and 33,000. However, the latest available version of the paper, dating back to January 23 uses disputable extrapolation methods to reach its figures. Strikingly, Parasta does not make any secret of his affiliation with Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s ousted Shah</p><p>The exiled crown prince and his team, whose extensive social media manipulation and disinformation efforts have been exposed by <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-10-03/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-israeli-influence-operation-in-iran-pushing-to-reinstate-the-shah-monarchy/00000199-9f12-df33-a5dd-9f770d7a0000\">recent investigations</a> by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab, have been key actors in inciting and escalating the recent protests towards confrontation. Accordingly, the fatality numbers disseminated by Mr Parasta cannot be perceived as neutral and constitute partisan estimates at best.</p><p>Despite acknowledging their own inability to verify these estimates, the media in question nevertheless put these extreme figures in titles and subheadings. It didn’t take long for other outlets to report on these inflated numbers, referring to these major publications as primary sources. Activists and Western politicians have also used them to push their respective agendas, thereby further fuelling a spiral of disinformation campaigns on social media. – In other words, a “death toll olympics” was born.</p><p>All of this has served two ends.</p><p>First, it has supported efforts to manufacture consent for foreign military intervention and malicious political action. While the protests were still ongoing, US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran in the event of a deadly crackdown. As of writing these lines, there has been a significant US military build-up around Iran, effectively thickening the war cloud.</p><p>Second, the speculation about the Iranian death toll has helped pro-Israel politicians and commentators in the West to downplay the casualties of the Israeli war on Gaza. In this way, it has become a utilitarian tool for relativising the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p><p>Confronted with mounting pressure regarding the death toll, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the authorities to “publicly publish the names and personal data of those deceased during the recent bitter incidents”. His director of communication has even promised that a procedure has been set up to examine and verify any conflicting claims.</p><p>It remains to be seen how effective and transparent the promised procedure will turn out. It is undeniable that thousands have been killed in Iran, mostly by Iranian security forces, amid a multi-day brutal crowd and riot control effort.</p><p>Structural obscurity and the restricted access to Iran for independent experts will likely mean that the exact death toll will never be determined. However, the more transparency can be established regarding the scale of the killings, the more likely it is that the perpetrators can be held accountable.</p><p>An arduous verification process of the recent deaths is crucial not only for the sake of accountability, but also to expose the media manipulation that is once again preparing the ground for a unilateral US-led act of aggression in the Middle East. In light of this, the “Death Toll Olympics” remains an ignominious disservice to the wretched of the Earth from Palestine to Iran.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In one exchange in 2012, Musk writes: “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”</p><p>One planned meeting with Musk in 2013 appears to have been cancelled by Epstein due to scheduling. The emails do not indicate that Musk ultimately visited Epstein’s island, but challenge previous Musk claims that he is the one to have rebuffed Epstein’s invitations.</p><p>Musk responded on Saturday on his X social media platform that he had been “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name.”</p><p>“No one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened,” Musk wrote. “I had very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to ‌go to his island or fly on his ‘Lolita Express.’”</p><p>The files also include email correspondence showing Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick arranging to visit Epstein’s island in December 2012. One email, forwarded from Epstein’s assistant to Lutnick, appears to confirm the two men met during that period.</p><p>In October 2025, Lutnick called Epstein “gross” and “the greatest blackmailer ever,” claiming he had severed ties with the man years earlier.</p><p>A ‌Department of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement that Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”</p><h2 id=\"abusers-still-hidden-and-protected\">Abusers still ‘hidden and protected’</h2><p>Despite the new disclosures, a group of survivors of Epstein’s alleged abuses said some of their alleged abusers “remain hidden and protected”.</p><p>A statement from 19 of the survivors, some using aliases or initials, said information about them still remained in the files, “while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected.” The letter demanded “the full release of the Epstein files” and that Attorney General Pam Bondi directly address the matter when she testifies before Congress next month.</p><p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/trump-says-he-signed-bill-to-release-epstein-files\">signed into law by Trump on November 19</a>, called for all the Epstein-related documents held by the Justice Department to be published by December 19.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday’s release “marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process”.

The order alleged that the government of communist-run Cuba was an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trump-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-end-of-the-year-us-media-report\">“unusual and extraordinary threat”</a> to US national security.</p><p>In a social media post on Friday, Diaz-Canel said that under “a false and baseless pretext”, Trump plans “to suffocate” Cuba’s economy by slapping tariffs “on countries that sovereignly trade oil” with it.</p><p>“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal and genocidal nature of a clique that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal ends,” he said, in an apparent allusion to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American and a known anti-Cuban government hawk.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cuba, which is suffering rolling electricity blackouts blamed on fuel shortages, was cut off from critical supplies of Venezuelan oil after the US abducted Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a bloody military night raid on the capital, Caracas, earlier this month. At least 32 members of Cuba’s armed forces and intelligence agencies <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/cuba-pays-tribute-to-soldiers-killed-in-us-attack-on-venezuela\">were killed</a> in the January 3 attack.</p><p>The US has since taken effective control of Venezuela’s oil sector, and Trump, a Republican, has issued threats against other left-wing governments in the region, promising to stop oil shipments previously sent to Cuba.</p><p>Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Friday declared an “international emergency” in response to Trump’s move, which he said constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat”.</p><p>Venezuela’s government also condemned the measure in a statement on Friday, saying it violates international law and the principles of global commerce.</p><p>Reporting from Cuba’s capital, Al Jazeera’s Ed Augustin said Trump’s announcement “is a massive psychological blow”, noting that analysts describe it as the “most powerful economic blow the United States has ever dealt the island”.</p><p>Days after Maduro’s abduction and transfer to the US, Trump urged Cuba to make a deal “before it is too late,” without specifying what kind of agreement he was referring to.</p><p>In a post on social media, Trump suggested Rubio could become the president of Cuba. “Sounds good to me!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-no-solution\">‘There’s no solution’</h2><p>In Havana, residents expressed anger at Trump’s tariff threat, which will only make life harder for Cubans already struggling with an increase in US sanctions.</p><p>“My food is going bad. We haven’t had electricity since 6am,” Yenia Leon told Al Jazeera. “You can’t sleep. You have to buy food every day. There’s no solution to the power situation,” she said.</p><p>“This is a war,” Lazaro Alfonso, an 89-year-old retired graphic designer, told The Associated Press news agency, describing Trump as the “sheriff of the world” and saying he feels like he is living in the Wild West, where anything goes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4277503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4277503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4277503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-30T195347Z_1431135769_RC2N6JAVP5OT_RTRMADP_3_USA-CUBA-ECONOMY-1769854644.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man sells vegetables on the street during a blackout in Havan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4277503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man sells vegetables on the street during a blackout in Havana on January 22 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Alfonso, who lived through the severe economic depression in the 1990s known as the “Special Period” following cuts in Soviet aid, said the current situation in Cuba is worse, given the severe blackouts, a lack of basic goods and a scarcity of fuel.</p><p>“The only thing that’s missing here in Cuba … is for bombs to start falling,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would seek alternatives to continue helping Cuba after Trump’s announcement following a decision this week to temporarily halt oil shipments to the island amid heightened rhetoric from Trump.</p><p>Mexico became a key supplier of fuel to Cuba, along with Russia, after the US sanctions on Venezuela paralysed the delivery of crude oil to the island.</p><p>Sheinbaum said cutting off oil shipments to Cuba could trigger a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis” on the island, affecting transportation, hospitals and access to food. She did not say whether Mexico would cut shipments of oil or refined products to Cuba, which ‌she said accounted for 1 percent of Mexico’s production.</p><p>“Our interest is that the Cuban people don’t suffer,” Sheinbaum said, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to contact the US ‌State Department to better understand the scope of the executive order.</p><p>Mexico supplied 44 percent of Cuban oil imports and Venezuela exported 33 percent until last month, while some 10 percent of Cuban oil is sourced from Russia. Some oil is also sourced from Algeria, according to The Financial Times figures.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November last year, a senior United Nations expert <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/us-sanctions-must-be-stopped-as-they-reshape-life-in-cuba-un-rapporteur\">said</a> the long-running US sanctions on Cuba must be lifted as they are “causing significant effects across all aspects of life”.</p><p>The US imposed a near-total trade embargo on Cuba in 1962, with the goal of toppling the government put in place by Fidel Castro after he took power in a 1959 revolution. Castro himself was the target of numerous assassination attempts by the US’s Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA.</p><p>Alena Douhan, special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, said the “extensive regime of economic, trade and financial restrictions” against Cuba marks the longest-running unilateral sanctions policy in US history.</p><p>She noted that there are shortages of food, medicine, electricity, water, essential machinery and spare parts in Cuba, while a growing emigration of skilled workers, including medical staff, engineers and teachers, is further straining the country.</p><p>The accumulative effect has “severe consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, food, health and development”, Douhan said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

ruling represents the latest legal setback to the administration’s broader push to end temporary protections for more than one million people across multiple countries.</p><p>Murphy’s decision came during a virtual hearing, where he said the delay would provide time for the Department of Homeland Security to produce records explaining its decision-making process before he considers blocking the move for longer.</p><p>“I want to do everything I can to keep this case going,” the judge said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case was brought by three Ethiopian nationals and the advocacy group African Communities Together, who filed suit after the DHS announced in December it was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/trump-strips-legal-protections-from-ethiopian-refugees-in-latest-crackdown\">terminating</a> the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) first granted to Ethiopia in 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit argues the administration unlawfully ended the protections with just 60 days’ notice despite ongoing armed conflict in the African nation.</p><p>Plaintiffs also claim Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted based on an “unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants”.</p><p>The move came even as the State Department continues urging Americans to <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ethiopia-travel-advisory.html\">reconsider travel</a> to Ethiopia due to “sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping”.</p><p>The DHS defended the termination by pointing to recent peace agreements, including a 2022 ceasefire in Tigray, despite <a

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The January 14 announcement of the new Palestinian technical committee to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction comes at a critical moment. While states are discussing the governance and reconstruction of Gaza, on the ground, the basic survival of 2.1 million people hangs by a thread. This moment demands immediate action to lift the ongoing and suffocating restrictions that are systematically dismantling the very means for Palestinians to survive.</p><p>Famine conditions in Gaza have moderately stabilised, but the humanitarian catastrophe continues to deepen. Families remain displaced without adequate shelter; children still go to bed hungry; and basic healthcare is out of reach for hundreds of thousands.</p><p>Winter rains have turned displacement camps into seas of mud, exacerbating suffering and significantly increasing the risk of disease outbreaks. Daily Israeli air attacks and bombardments continue, with more than <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/31/live-israel-kills-12-palestinians-in-gaza-as-rafah-crossing-set-to-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500 Palestinians killed</a> since the ceasefire agreement was announced in October. This month alone, seven UNRWA school compounds in eastern Gaza have been demolished by Israeli forces.</p><p>UNRWA remains Gaza’s largest and most comprehensive service provider, effectively acting as the public sector for more than half the population. Our 11,000 staff continue to operate despite immense risks, as they have done each day since October 7, 2023.</p><p>They are providing healthcare to almost 100,000 people each week and education to 70,000 children in damaged school premises across Gaza. Our schools also shelter tens of thousands of displaced families.</p><p>UNRWA teams essentially function like a local municipality; we distribute water and collect solid waste from entire communities, covering the needs of more than half the population. When we speak of “service delivery”, these are not abstract programmes. We are talking about the clinics where children are vaccinated, the classrooms where traumatised boys and girls find some collective care, and the distribution points where families are provided with basic sustenance.</p><p>Yet our ability to respond remains severely impeded by systematic barriers. What should we understand from the entire and complete assault on the most basic services needed for any community to survive?</p><p>Our goods are prevented from entering Gaza. We are unable to communicate with Israeli authorities – the occupying power that controls all of Gaza’s land, air and sea crossings – due to the <a href=\"/news/2024/10/28/israel-parliament-approves-bill-to-ban-unrwa\">“no contact” law</a> passed by the Israeli parliament in October 2024.</p><p>Our international staff – myself included – are barred from entering Gaza to support the work of our teams on the ground.</p><p>Nowhere is the inhumanity of these restrictions more evident than in the denial of children’s basic rights. About 700,000 Palestinian children in Gaza are being systematically denied their right to education. Before the war, UNRWA was educating 300,000 of these children, accounting for two-thirds of all primary schooling.</p><p>UNRWA alone has the capacity, expertise and reach to resume this work at scale across Gaza, yet we are prevented from doing so by the same restrictions that target our broader operations.</p><p>We have launched a “Back to Learning” campaign to bring some hope and normality to children who have known only war, displacement and loss for more than two years. But instead of supporting this effort, the restrictions we face mean that most children remain in the rubble-strewn streets. This is a continuous and deliberate attack on their future.</p><p>We are not alone in facing unacceptable challenges that defy the most basic obligations of an occupying power under international law. The registration process for international NGOs has become a de facto blockade in itself, with the vast majority of the existing aid system now on the brink of shutdown.</p><p>Restrictions on so-called dual-use items have turned basic shelter and construction materials, among other essential supplies, into contraband, leaving families exposed to the elements and rendering reconstruction impossible as harsh winter weather persists.</p><p>This brings us to the uncomfortable truth: These restrictions are not merely bureaucratic impediments. They appear to be part of ongoing efforts to systematically dismantle the means for Palestinians to survive. Every restriction, every obstacle, every denial of basic materials adds another layer of evidence to <a href=\"/news/2024/1/11/a-quick-guide-to-south-africas-icj-case-against-israel\">South Africa’s case</a> at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). So too do the attacks on the one United Nations agency – UNRWA – that is able to provide basic education and healthcare at scale, but is prevented from doing so.</p><p>UNRWA has a proven ability to provide continuous education, healthcare, social welfare, sanitation, humanitarian assistance and other support. It enjoys the trust and confidence of the Gaza population, whose world has been erased since October 2023.</p><p>Preserving UNRWA until there is a lasting peace is a pragmatic solution for anyone serious about Gaza’s future. It is essential for the wellbeing and recovery of more than two million people who have suffered beyond imagination.</p><p>Make no mistake – this is about far more than the future of a single UN agency. This is about defending the international rules-based order. When states pressure humanitarian responders, restrict humanitarian access and ignore ICJ rulings, they are targeting Palestinians while also attacking the very foundations of international law.</p><p>This has transcended the Palestine context and become a test case for the viability of humanitarian action and international law worldwide.</p><p>The time for half-measures and diplomatic ambiguity is over. The survival of Gaza is intrinsically linked to UNRWA’s continued operation. Defending this is about defending humanity, international law, and the possibility that even in the darkest circumstances, the world will continue to support compassion over cruelty.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of states voted in December 2025 to renew UNRWA’s mandate in the UN General Assembly. But that decision is impeded by the perpetrator of what the ICJ has found to be an illegal occupation and what the UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded is a genocide. The choice must now be clear: We can either stand by as Gaza’s lifeline is systematically cut, or we can act collectively to protect what remains and rebuild what has been destroyed.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
