            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last week, I saw aid dropping from the sky near my central Gaza neighbourhood of az-Zawayda. Neither I nor any of my neighbours had the courage to chase after it because we knew that the moment it hit the ground, a battle would erupt. If the aid survived the air, it wouldn’t survive the looters.</p><p>It is almost always the same scene. Gunfire breaks out the second the plane drops the boxes. Armed gangs are already waiting on the ground, ready to take the goods by force. Whoever gets there first, whoever shoots first, also walks away with the food. It is never those who need it the most.</p><p>Later, we would see those same “aid boxes” in the market in Deir el-Balah, their contents up for sale at exorbitant prices.</p><p>Recently, my little brother was craving a biscuit. I saw biscuits from an aid package at the market and asked for the price. It was 20 shekels ($5) for a biscuit, something we could not afford.</p><p>The aid dropped from the sky not only fails to feed the hungry, but it also kills them. On Monday, an airdropped pallet hit a tent for the displaced and <a href=\"https://aje.io/6n5fcc?update=3872151\">killed</a> Uday al-Quraan, a medic working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. A week ago, 11 people were injured when another airdropped pallet hit tents in northern Gaza.</p><p>Last year, in other failed airdrops, people also died. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/08/gaza-aid-airdrop-kills-civilians-when-parachute-fails-to-open-witness-says\">Five</a> were killed in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City when the parachute of a pallet did not open; <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/18-palestinians-killed-in-gaza-by-aid-airdrop-malfunction/3175307\">12 drowned</a> trying to reach boxes that dropped into the sea; six were killed in a stampede after a crowd of people rushed to an airdrop location.</p><p>The idea for these latest airdrops came from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called on the world to help with the process. Many governments welcomed the idea and some joined the effort, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and European countries.</p><p>But Netanyahu knows very well that the airdrops will not stop the starvation of Palestinians, which is why he called for them instead of opening the land crossings into Gaza and allowing United Nations agencies to distribute aid in a fair and orderly fashion, just like they have always done.</p><p>While, the global public may be deceived that something is being done about the hunger, inside Gaza, these airdrops aren’t seen as a real solution or a humanitarian gesture. We see them as nothing more than a PR show – a way to cover up a crime that hasn’t stopped: starving an entire population under tight siege by preventing thousands of trucks from entering while a few boxes fall from the sky for the cameras. It’s all part of a strategy to extend the starvation and ease international pressure on Israel.</p><p>And so the famine proceeds at full speed. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, more than 180 people have died from hunger, including 92 children.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>It is not just in Gaza that airdrops are seen as inefficient and dangerous. In Afghanistan in 2001, airdropped aid was packaged in the same way as cluster bombs. The latter would get mistaken for food boxes by children who would get killed running after them. In Syria, aid airdropped into a besieged area did not reach the starving civilians because it was either damaged or fell into ISIL (ISIS)-held territory.</p><p>It is well known that airdrops do not work and when other options are available, there is no reason to use them. The UN has repeatedly said this method is ineffective and ground delivery is safer and far better. A truck can carry four to 10 times more aid than a parachute. It is also much cheaper. Thousands of trucks are waiting on the Egyptian side of the border, enough to feed people and prevent more deaths from starvation.</p><p>And yet, we see this futile spectacle once again in Gaza. Here we know not to look to the sky with hope. The same sky that drops bombs can’t be trusted to drop food.</p><p>This “humanity with parachutes” is a fig leaf deployed to try to cover the world’s shame and its decision to silently watch starvation.</p><p>Gaza is not only under siege by bombs but also by lies, by complicity, by soft language covering bloody massacres. Everyone who stays silent, who justifies, who treats the killer and victim as equal is a partner in this crime.</p><p>And we, the Palestinians, are not just victims – we are witnesses. We see the world refuse to act, we see countries continue to arm Israel, to trade with it, to give it diplomatic cover. We see governments think of pitiful excuses not to impose embargoes – as they are obliged to do under international law – on a nation committing genocide.</p><p>And tomorrow, when history is written, it won’t be in the language of diplomacy with euphemisms and excuses. It will be in the language of facts with the names of those complicit in the mass killing and starvation of Palestinians written in clear letters.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-maxwell-found-guilty-of\">What was Maxwell found guilty of?</h2><p>At her trial, four women testified that Maxwell groomed them as teenagers to participate in sexual acts with Epstein and sometimes participated in the abuse.</p><p>She was ultimately found guilty on five of six counts: sex trafficking of minors, conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.</p><p>Epstein himself faced federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-these-records-being-sought-now\">Why are these records being sought now?</h2><p>Conspiracy theories have long swirled around Epstein’s influence and his death. The wealthy financier, whose high-profile friends included current US President Donald Trump and powerful figures on both the liberal and conservative sides of the political spectrum, was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 before he could stand trial.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>While his death was ruled a suicide, many prominent figures in Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement have long doubted that narrative, insisting – without firm evidence – that Epstein might have been killed to stop him from revealing the identities of some of his clients.</p><p>Some government officials appointed by Trump in his second term, including FBI Director Kash Patel, have previously fanned the flames of those conspiracy theories.</p><p>In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi said an Epstein client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, adding that she was following a directive from Trump to look at the files.</p><p>But in July, Bondi’s Justice Department issued a memo concluding that there was no client list and the financier had died by suicide – an apparent turnaround that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/who-are-the-maga-influencers-calling-for-pam-bondis-head-over-epstein\">sparked calls for Bondi’s resignation</a> from parts of the MAGA movement.</p><p>Trump initially tried to dismiss that response from his support base and then tried to portray the criticism his administration was facing as orchestrated by opposition Democrats to distract from his supposed achievements as president.</p><p>But the pressure hasn’t let up. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had written a birthday note to Epstein in 2003 with the implication that the two knew each other better than the president has let on.</p><p>Trump denied writing the letter and has sued the newspaper and the author of the article. But amid the mounting scrutiny, he also ordered Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony in the Epstein case.</p><p>Still, scrutiny over his administration’s actions has only grown. Last week, Maxwell was moved to an all-women federal prison camp after a meeting with a senior DOJ official.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-people-named-in-the-epstein-case\">Who are the people named in the Epstein case?</h2><p>In 2024, a court unsealed about 950 pages of documents that included the <a href=\"/news/2024/1/4/jeffrey-epstein-list-whose-names-are-on-the-newly-unsealed-documents\">names of several public figures</a> who had known Epstein well. The presence of their names on the documents does not in itself imply any wrongdoing – although some have faced accusations that they sexually exploited women.</p><p>Some of the most prominent figures in the documents include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Prince Andrew: </strong></strong>Johanna Sjoberg, who is one of the many women who have accused Epstein of sexual abuse, said in the documents that the British royal put his hand on her breast in Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in 2001. Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein’s accusers, also <a href=\"/news/2022/1/4/explainer-virginia-giuffres-lawsuit-against-prince-andrew\">alleged that Andrew</a><span> sexually abused her two decades ago when she was 17, an allegation the prince called baseless. Giuffre’s lawsuit against Andrew was </span><a href=\"/news/2022/2/15/prince-andrew-settles-sex-abuse-lawsuit-with-virginia-giuffre\">settled in 2022</a><span>.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Alan Dershowitz: </strong>An unnamed accuser said Epstein “required” her to have sexual relations with the Harvard University law professor on multiple occasions when she was a minor.</li>\n<li><strong>David Copperfield: </strong>Sjoberg testified to meeting the American magician at one of Epstein’s houses. She added that she observed him to be a friend of Epstein’s.</li>\n<li><strong>Bill Clinton: </strong>While Sjoberg said she did not meet the former US president, she testified that Epstein said to her: “Clinton likes them young,” apparently referring to girls. Clinton has repeatedly rejected all allegations that he was involved in anything unlawful and has said he had no interactions with Epstein for several years before the financier’s arrest.</li>\n<li><strong>Trump: </strong>Sjoberg mentioned an incident when she flew with Epstein, Giuffre and a few others on a plane from Palm Beach, Florida, in 2001. When the plane was unable to land in New York due to a storm, they had to land in Atlantic City and went to one of Trump’s casinos.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"why-does-it-matter-whether-these-trial-transcripts-are-unsealed\">Why does it matter whether these trial transcripts are unsealed?</h2><p>The documents could show the information that the grand jury had before it while deliberating the case. Bondi’s DOJ said in a filing that the transcripts contain nothing that is not already known publicly.</p><p>It could help Trump and his team beat back accusations from the president’s base that they have anything to hide.</p><h2 id=\"ell-going-to-testify-to-congress\">Is Maxwell going to testify to Congress?</h2><p>The House of Representatives Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell in late July, seeking her deposition on Monday. Maxwell’s lawyer has said she is willing to testify before Congress.</p><p>But the committee has since said it is willing to postpone Maxwell’s deposition while the Supreme Court decides whether to take up her appeal against her 2021 conviction.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the country only produces about 30 percent of its domestic fuel consumption demand from its lone oil refinery, which dates to the colonial era.</p><p>What’s more, Angola based its 2025 budget on an oil price of $70 per barrel, but Brent oil futures fell below $60 in April after United States President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/4/4/have-trumps-tariffs-killed-us-africa-preferential-trade\">announced a sharp increase in tariffs</a>.</p><p>Carlos Rosado de Carvalho, a professor of economics at the Catholic University of Angola, said the volatility of the oil market leaves Angola in a precarious position.</p><p>“It’s a real problem, because the [fuel] subsidies cost annually about $3bn. This is more than the government spending on health and education together,” de Carvalho said, suggesting that the government’s hand was forced.</p><p>Nevertheless, he concedes that the timing of the new policy was far from ideal. It coincided with tariff increases in electricity and water bills of up to 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p><p>De Carvalho estimates that in July 2025, the minimum wage also only covered 66 percent of the basket of goods and services it did in 2017 – the year Lourenco came to power.</p><p>At the same time, low wages and rising unemployment have left millions of Angolans facing poverty and hunger. “This is where we must look for the causes of the popular uprisings that have marked Angola, especially Luanda,” he said.</p><p>To make matters worse, government leaders failed to explain the motivation for the increases.</p><p>Commercial oil production in Angola started in the mid-1950s. In 2024, the government said, it generated $31.4bn from oil exports; that revenue is more than ten times the amount spent on fuel subsidies.</p><p>The government’s critics say most of the country’s 36 million people have yet to see the benefits of living in a country blessed with natural wealth.</p><p>“Ordinary Angolans are not benefitting from the country’s natural resources wealth because of high levels of corruption,” Candero said.</p><p>“And, as you see in all rich natural resources countries in Africa, particularly where this exploitation is happening, the people live in misery.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3863397\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3863397\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3863397\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AFP__20250728__68348QF__v1__HighRes__AngolaUnrest-1753799124.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A group of shops are targeted as looting erupted in the Kalemba 2 district of Luanda on July 28, 2025 during a general strike in the taxi sector declared for three days to protest against the rising prices of fuel.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3863397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shops are looted in the Kalemba 2 district of Luanda on July 28, during a general strike in the taxi sector declared for three days to protest against the rising prices of fuel [AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>He does not accept the justification that President Lourenco gave in an interview following the protests, that Angola’s comparatively low fuel prices justify the reduction in subsidies. The government has also pointed out that the discounted prices have attracted illicit cross-border traders from neighbouring countries.</p><p>Candero insists this is no justification for increasing fuel prices. He blames the status quo on decades of mismanagement by the ruling People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party and believes there are other means of bringing public spending under control.</p><p>“If the government really wants to cut spending, it should start by cutting spending on superfluous goods and services, extravagant perks for high public officeholders and stop running up debt to buy fleets of luxury cars, trips with numerous entourages, each person with extra perks,” Candero said.</p><h2 id=\"keep-goods-cheap\">‘Keep goods cheap’</h2><p>Attiya Waris, a development expert based at the University of Nairobi, has called on Angola’s government to reconsider the reduction of subsidies.</p><p>“Fuel subsidies are important in Angola as they keep goods cheap. The government needs to make sure that any change in fuel prices does not affect movement and the cost of the basket of goods [for] people in the country,” said Waris, who reported to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in February this year as an independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on human rights in Angola.</p><p>In her report, Waris, who is Kenyan, warns that the subsidy cuts could push up food price inflation and negatively affect vulnerable groups. She points out that the price of basic staples like eggs had already increased by 400 percent.</p><p>The report recommends that the government conduct a comprehensive assessment of the economic and social impacts of cutting fuel subsidies and urges it to seek alternative support mechanisms to mitigate the negative impact it may have on low-income households.</p><p>World Bank researchers have also backed up Waris’s findings. They point out that removing subsidies could deepen poverty and inequality and may have dire consequences for specific sectors, such as fishing and agriculture; not to mention that it could lead to a nutritional crisis.</p><p>“To mitigate these effects, subsidies should be gradually eliminated and paired with targeted support for specific producers, cash transfers for affected households, and public awareness campaigns about the benefits of subsidy reform,” an <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/africacan/preventing-adverse-effects-while-reforming-fuel-subsidies-afe-in-angola\">article</a> published in May on the World Bank blog site reads.</p><p>The authors point out, however, that fuel subsidies have drawbacks, too, including disproportionately benefitting wealthier households, straining public finances, limiting investments in physical and human capital and promoting the over-consumption of fossil fuels.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3873124\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873124\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873124\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250726__67X73RH__v1__HighRes__AngolaPoliticsEconomyDemo-1754375123.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Angola\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3873124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Angolan anti-riot police officers stand in formation as protesters gather in Luanda on July 26 during a protest over high living costs [Julio Pacheco Ntela/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-fight-will-continue\">‘The fight will continue’</h2><p>The government’s handling of the subsidy reforms has been widely criticised, especially after the crackdown on protesters.</p><p>Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/18/angola-police-use-excessive-force-against-peaceful-protesters\">accused</a> police of using excessive force after they fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters on July 12 during the first round of protests against the reduction of subsidies.</p><p>Ashwanee Budoo-Scholtz, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the use of force was part of a broader trend of security force problems in Angola. She cited a protest in 2023 by 400 women traders in Luanda, which was met with tear gas and police beatings.</p><p>When Lourenco was elected for a second term in August 2022, Human Rights Watch made a series of recommendations to place human rights at the centre of his government’s policies, including investigating repeated allegations of rights violations by Angola’s state security forces, such as summary executions, excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, and arbitrary detentions.</p><p>“Angolans should be able to peacefully protest government policies without being met with excessive force and other violations of their basic rights,” Budoo-Scholtz said in a statement last month.</p><p>Despite the criticisms, President Lourenco on Friday praised the police for “acting within the scope of their duties”.</p><p>In a national address, he reminded Angolans that this year marks five decades of independence, nearly half of which were marked by civil war. “[We] cannot accept or tolerate any more pain and mourning among Angolans,” he said.</p><p>He ended his address with the words: “Long live Angola.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Candero and other civil society groups feel nowhere near as triumphant.</p><p>Overnight, transport costs have doubled to about 4,000 kwanza ($4.36) a day for workers who rely on public transport such as minibus taxes, exceeding the daily wages of 53 percent of Angolans, who earn less than $3.65 per day, and 31 percent who live on less than $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Candero said it is almost inevitable that the rising costs of living will lead to more protests.</p><p>And with economically desperate people out in the streets, this can also lead to looting, observers note.</p><p>“Some people do not agree with destruction of businesses or other public goods. Others think that causing economic and financial consequences is a payback to the government that [harms many] by allowing corruption,” Candero said.</p><p>“For others, especially young people from poor suburbs, the fight will continue until the improvement of their social conditions, especially hunger reduction.</p><p>“These were only symptoms. Until we deal with the root causes, these demonstrations will never stop. This is no longer a taxi strike. It is the cry of a hungry people for a piece of bread and for some dignity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two hours after Trump’s latest announcement, New Delhi issued a statement accusing the US and EU of double standards and of, in fact, quietly encouraging India to buy Russian crude earlier.</p><p>As India’s relations with the West – otherwise warm and growing until recently – now fray over its purchase of Russian energy, how true are New Delhi’s claims that the West is as guilty of enabling the Kremlin’s war machine as those it blames?</p><h2 id=\"what-did-india-say-on-monday\">What did India say on Monday?</h2><p>After hesitating for days to publicly take on Washington and Brussels directly, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government issued a terse statement on August 4, calling the targeting of India “unjustified and unreasonable”.</p><p>“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, in words that suggest New Delhi is in no mood to back down.</p><p>But Jaiswal also directly pushed back against suggestions from the US and EU that India – in buying large volumes of Russian crude – had acted in a way that broke with the West’s own behaviour.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” Jaiswal said, referring to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>“The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets’ stability,” he added.</p><p>He said India’s decision to import Russian oil was “meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer”.</p><p>“However, it is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” he added.</p><p>The EU, he said, had traded more with Russia in goods in 2024 than India had. “European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5 million tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.21 million tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, “continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry, fertilisers as well as chemicals,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>India’s response is not surprising, said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has been involved with multiple Indian trade negotiations.</p><p>“The aggressiveness that the Trump administration has shown – there had to be some reaction from India,” he told Al Jazeera. “For a sovereign country to hear this kind of a threat from another country is unacceptable.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873391\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-Russias-biggest-trade-partners-August-5-2025-1754385613.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who are Russia’s biggest trade partners - August 5, 2025-1754385613\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-are-the-us-eu-sanctions-and-tariffs-against-india\">How significant are the US, EU sanctions and tariffs against India?</h2><p>India’s pushback reflects just how much is at stake for its economy.</p><p>The US is India’s largest export destination: Americans bought $87bn worth of Indian goods in 2024. By contrast, India imported $41bn worth of US goods last year, leading to a large $46bn trade deficit for the US.</p><p>Trump’s earlier threat of 25 percent tariffs on Indian goods was already threatening to dramatically disrupt that trade. His announcement of even higher tariffs could bleed India’s export revenue further.</p><p>The decision by Brussels to bar the import of refined petroleum sourced from Russian crude could also batter the profits of Indian refineries. According to market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global, Indian exports of petroleum products to Europe have jumped from $5.9bn in 2019 to $20.5bn, largely because of India’s ability to buy subsidised Russian oil, refine it, and then sell it to the West.</p><p>But stopping the purchase of Russian oil would come with its costs: After the US and Europe imposed tough sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, Russia offered discounted crude to India. The EU also introduced price caps on Russian oil shipped by European tankers. As a result, India saved billions of dollars, with Russia becoming its biggest source of imported crude.</p><p>For India, say experts, it isn’t just the economic calculations that make the recent threats and sanctions problematic. The West is “just changing goalposts”, Anil Trigunayat, a retired Indian diplomat, told Al Jazeera. “So, India is just showing them the mirror with facts and figures now.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873394\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-buys-Russian-crude-oil-August-5-2025-1754385618.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who buys Russian crude oil - August 5, 2025-1754385618\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"did-the-us-and-eu-encourage-india-to-buy-russian-oil-until-now\">Did the US and EU encourage India to buy Russian oil until now?</h2><p>Trump, in his latest post targeting India, claimed that “they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.”</p><p>India is arguing that the same accusations levelled against it hold true against the US and EU – and that they actually acquiesced to New Delhi buying Russian oil when the West no longer wanted to.</p><p>“They [India] bought Russian oil because we wanted someone to buy Russian oil at a price cap – that was not a violation or anything, that was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity, we did not want the price of oil to go up,” Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India under former President Joe Biden, said at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations in May 2024. “They fulfilled that.”</p><p></p><p>The logic was simple: If no one had bought Russian oil, that would have shrunk the total available oil supply with the same global demand, driving up costs. As Garcetti pointed out, Indian purchases of Russian crude helped avoid that – while allowing the West to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>Until July, the EU, too, had not imposed any restrictions on the import of petroleum products sourced from Russian crude.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873389\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-EU-imports-of-Russian-LNG-are-on-the-rise-August-5-2025-1754385608.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-EU imports of Russian LNG are on the rise - August 5, 2025-1754385608\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"is-the-west-trading-more-with-russia-than-india-is\">Is the West trading more with Russia than India is?</h2><p>That’s the other major claim from India.</p><p>And the facts suggest that New Delhi is right. According to the EU, its total trade with Russia was worth 67.5 billion euros ($77.9 bn) in 2024. India’s total trade with Russia in 2024-25 was <a href=\"https://indianembassy-moscow.gov.in/overview.php#:~:text=Bilateral%20trade%20between%20India%20and,amounting%20to%20USD%2063.84%20billion.\">worth $68.7bn</a>.</p><p>To be sure, Europe’s trade with Russia has fallen sharply, from 257.5 billion euros ($297.4bn) in 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, while India’s trade with Russia has surged from about $10bn before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>But data shows that the bloc continues to buy Russian gas. Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the grouping has paid Moscow $105.6bn for gas imports – an amount equivalent to 75 percent of Russia’s 2024 military budget – according to the Finnish think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which has been tracking Russian energy trade through the war.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/presentation-russian-lng-exports-to-the-eu-implications-for-the-us-lng-market/\">EU imports of Russian LNG</a> rose 9 percent compared with the year before.</p><p>Mineral fuels make up almost two-thirds of EU imports from Russia, followed by food, raw materials, machinery and transport equipment, according to the bloc.</p><p>And the US does indeed still import a range of chemicals from Russia, as Jaiswal claimed. Total Russia-US trade in 2024 stood at <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/russia-and-eurasia/russia\">$5.2bn</a>, according to the US Trade Representative’s office – though the numbers are down significantly from 2021, when their trade in goods stood at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html#2023\">$36bn</a>.</p><p>Given this backdrop, India’s Foreign Ministry was “absolutely right to call out the US and EU”, Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera. “They are still importing from Russia. They’re allowed to do it; we are not. That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Russia, too, criticised the Western measures against India.</p><p>“Sovereign countries have the right to choose their own trade partners,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the AFP news agency, accusing the West of trying to “sever” trade ties between other countries and Russia, and describing those moves as illegitimate.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-all-a-trade-negotiating-tactic\">Is this all a trade negotiating tactic?</h2><p>Some Indian experts believe that the threats and tariffs from Trump are bargaining measures aimed at securing a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/who-has-a-deal-who-doesnt-the-state-of-play-on-eve-of-trumps-tariffs\">trade deal with India</a> that is favourable to the US.</p><p>The two countries have been locked in negotiations over a trade agreement to minimise Trump’s tariffs, but have yet to agree on a pact, even though India has cut tariffs on several US imports.</p><p>A key sticking point is agriculture, where India has long imposed high tariffs to protect its farm sector, which represents about half of the country’s population.</p><p>“The way the Trump administration has been demanding that India open its market to US agribusiness – that’s a no-go for India,” Dhar said. “Our small farmers will face a serious adverse situation; so it’s economically and politically completely unacceptable to India.”</p><p>Ghosh echoed those sentiments.</p><p>“There’s no question of giving in on agriculture,” she said. “In India, you cannot give in and allow US heavily subsidised multinational conglomerates to invade our markets, when a majority of our population still depends on agriculture for a livelihood.”</p><p>But in recent weeks, Trump has also tried to ramp up pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine, and choking Moscow’s oil exports would make it harder for Russian President Vladimir Putin to sustain his economy.</p><p>On Monday, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-ukraine-war-through-oil\">accused India of “financing this (Russia’s) war</a>“.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Medvedev, who serves as deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Trump wrote on his Truth Social network on August 1.</p><p>“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump wrote, without specifying the regions or the submarines’ class.</p><p>Medvedev, who, despite his title, has no power to order nuclear strikes, retorted with a gloating remark.</p><p>“If some words of Russia’s former president cause such a nervous response from the oh-so-scary US president, it means that Russia is right about everything and will keep going its own way,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram.</p><p>“Let [Trump] remember his favourite movies about the Walking Dead [zombie apocalypse series] and about how dangerous can be the ‘dead hand’ that doesn’t exist naturally,” Medvedev wrote.</p><p>The online feud began in mid-July, when Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin, Medvedev’s boss and mentor for three decades, 50 days to make a peace deal with Ukraine.</p><p>Medvedev called the ultimatum “theatrical” and said that “Russia didn’t care”.</p><h2 id=\"uclear-weapons-are-not-moscow-s-monopoly\">‘Nuclear weapons are not Moscow’s monopoly’</h2><p>According to a former Russian diplomat, while Trump’s warnings send a signal to the Kremlin, the “noise” around the submarines has no military significance.</p><p>“What matters far more is that Trump’s words served as a reminder – nuclear weapons are not Moscow’s monopoly,” Boris Bondarev, who focused on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, told Al Jazeera.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Medvedev’s comments reflect Putin’s views – and Trump’s response could return both down to the earth of realpolitik, he added.</p><p>“Had such an approach been part of a general strategy to make Putin’s view on the world and his own place in it more adequate, it would have been the beginning of a real end of the war” in Ukraine, said Bondarev, who quit his foreign ministry job to protest against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“But it seems to me that Donald just uttered [his threat] and doesn’t mean anything serious,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"a-pawn-in-the-us-china-game\">A pawn in the US-China game</h2><p>To a Ukrainian military analyst, the Trump-Medvedev feud is part of Moscow’s and Washington’s bigger political games.</p><p>“Putin uses Medvedev as a tool to express statements related to nuclear weapons, he doesn’t want to discredit his own good peacekeeper’s name,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said ironically.</p><p>In Moscow’s “media spectacle” with Washington, Medvedev plays the “bad cop”, Romanenko told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s order to reposition the subs is a step to score a diplomatic victory ahead of his summit with China’s Xi Jinping.</p><p>The summit may take place on September 3, when Beijing will lavishly celebrate the 80th anniversary of Japan’s surrender that ended World War II.</p><p>Putin has already been invited to oversee a military parade in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, but Trump is still mulling his response.</p><p>The online feud may be presented to Xi as a victory of sorts, Romanenko said – along with Moscow’s possible agreement to an air and sea ceasefire.</p><p>The agreement will be forced by the heavy damage Ukrainian drones inflicted on Russia’s military depots, transport infrastructure and oil refineries, Romanenko said.</p><h2 id=\"playing-the-fool\">‘Playing the fool’</h2><p>Trump may not realise that some Russians see Medvedev as a political has-been whose online rants are <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/06/17/this-job-simply-cannot-be-done-sober\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly</a> fuelled by his worsening alcoholism.</p><p>He was elected Russia’s president in 2008, after Putin had completed two consecutive presidential terms and could not run for a third time.</p><p>The move and the ensuing propaganda campaign to promote Medvedev’s candidacy were nicknamed a “castling” after the chess term.</p><p>It immediately spawned political jokes that ridiculed the real power dynamic between Medvedev and Putin.</p><p>In one of them, Putin arrives at a restaurant with Medvedev and orders a steak. The waiter asks, “And what about the vegetable?” referring to the choice of a side dish. After a long look at Medvedev, Putin answers, “The vegetable will have steak, too.”</p><p>However, Medvedev cultivated a personal and political image that contrasted with Putin’s.</p><p>He started using social networks, met with the rock bands U2 and Deep Purple, and began cautious reforms that made analysts talk about a political thaw and a reset of Russia’s ties with the West.</p><p>However, Medvedev’s failed perestroika ended with giant rallies against Putin’s 2012 return to the presidency and massive vote rigging.</p><p>The resulting tightening of political screws ended with Putin’s turn to belligerent nationalism and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Five years later, another wave of popular protests throughout Russia followed the release of a documentary about Medvedev’s luxurious, Monaco-sized palatial complex.</p><p>The documentary was made by the late opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2024/2/16/hold-alexei-navalny-timeline-from-poisoning-to-prison\">Alexey Navalny</a>‘s team and got tens of millions of views on YouTube.</p><p>At the time, as Medvedev served as prime minister, his approval ratings kept waning.</p><p>In 2022, Putin unceremoniously sacked him – and gave him the Security Council job, a sinecure for demoted allies.</p><p>The fall from Putin’s grace prompted Medvedev’s transformation into an online troll who <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/russias-medvedev-issues-warning-as-moscow-says-not-bound-by-missile-treaty\">posts</a> threats to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and sabre-rattles Moscow’s nuclear might. Many posts appeared online long after midnight.</p><h2 id=\"degraded\">‘Degraded’</h2><p>There are three viewpoints on why Medvedev changed his tune to become the Kremlin’s attack dog, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University.</p><p>One is that after not being allowed to run for president for the second time in 2012, Medvedev started drinking and “degraded to the current state”, Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The second one is that by “playing fool”, he repeats what Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had done to survive under his ruthless predecessor Joseph Stalin to survive and compete for the Kremlin throne after his boss’s death, Mitrokhin said.</p><p>And the third explanation Mitrokhin agrees with is that Medvedev “as a character, has always been very vile and warlike”.</p><p>But his aggression was only limited to what Putin allowed him to do – such as nominally order Russia’s 2008 war with ex-Soviet Georgia or be in charge of supplying weaponry to pro-Moscow rebels in southeastern Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>Mitrokhin described him as “a very aggressive small man with plenty of psychological complexes – a Napoleon’s syndrome – who has a chance to reveal his ‘inner self’. And he does – with his master’s approval”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump hopes to boost Republicans’ chances of maintaining a narrow House majority amid the headwinds of the midterm election.</p><p>The manoeuvre in Texas would be legal and not unprecedented for the state, which also undertook a Republican-driven redistricting in 2003. But Democrats have called the move a partisan power grab and an affront to the traditional practice of drawing new congressional districts every 10 years, after a new Census.</p><p>But the debate over Texas’s electoral map has also prompted broader questions over the fairness of the way in which voting districts are outlined. And the one state bigger than Texas – California – has caught the attention of Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>“The gerrymander in California is outrageous,” Vance posted July 30 on X. “Of their 52 congressional districts, 9 of them are Republican. That means 17 percent of their delegation is Republican when Republicans regularly win 40 percent of the vote in that state. How can this possibly be allowed?”</p><p>So, does California have an unfair map, as Vance said?</p><p>By the numbers, California is not a dramatic outlier when it comes to the difference between its congressional and presidential vote. However, because this difference is multiplied by a large number of districts – since California is the United States’ most populous state – it produces a bounty of House seats beyond what the state’s presidential vote alone would predict.</p><p>Vance’s description of California’s map as a “gerrymander” is also doubtful – it was drawn by a bipartisan commission, not Democratic legislators. Gerrymandering is done by politicians and political parties.</p><p>Vance’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>What the numbers show</strong></h2><p>Our first step was to measure the difference between each state’s House-seat breakdown by party and its <a href=\"/news/2024/11/10/us-election-results-map-2024-how-does-it-compare-to-2020\">presidential-vote breakdown</a> by party, which is what Vance cited. (Our analysis builds off of a 2023 Sabato’s Crystal Ball story written by this author. Sabato’s Crystal Ball is a publication of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.) We removed from consideration any state with one, two or three House members in its delegation, because these small states have wide differentials that skew the comparison.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>For red states won by Trump, we took the percentage of Republican seats in the House delegation and subtracted the percentage of the vote Trump won in that state. Conversely, for <a href=\"/news/2024/11/7/us-election-results-how-did-donald-trump-break-the-blue-wall\">blue states</a> won by <a href=\"/news/2024/11/6/us-election-results-key-takeaways-as-trump-wins\">Kamala Harris</a>, we took the percentage of Democratic seats in the House delegation and subtracted the percentage of the vote Harris won in the state.</p><p>Our analysis found that California did elect more Democrats to the House than its presidential vote share would have predicted, but the state was not an outlier. With 83% of its House seats held by Democrats and 58% of its 2024 presidential votes going to Democrats, California ranked 13th nationally among 35 states that have at least four seats in their delegation.</p><p></p><p><strong>California has the nation’s 13th widest difference between House and presidential results</strong></p><p>The top 13 differentials were split roughly evenly between blue and red states.</p><p>In six states that have at least four House seats – red Iowa, Utah, Arkansas and Oklahoma, and blue Connecticut and Massachusetts – a single party controls every House seat, even though the <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/how-big-was-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory\">winning presidential candidate</a> won between 56% and 66% of the vote in those states.</p><p>Another six states had a differential equal to or wider than California’s: Red South Carolina and Tennessee, and blue Oregon, Illinois and Maryland, plus purple Wisconsin.</p><p>California does stand out by another measure, because of its size.</p><p>If you multiply the House-to-presidential differential by the number of House seats in the delegation, you get a figure for “excess House seats”, the term used in the 2023 Sabato’s Crystal Ball article – essentially, a majority party’s bonus in House seats beyond what presidential performance would predict.</p><p>Because <a href=\"/news/2024/10/12/trump-to-rally-in-solid-blue-california-in-unorthodox-campaign-move\">California</a> has a large population represented by many House districts, even its modest differential produces a lot of extra Democratic House seats – 12, to be exact. That’s the largest of any state; the closest competitors are blue Illinois and New York, and red Florida, each of which has more than four excess seats for the majority party.</p><p>Texas’s current congressional map has 3.7 excess seats for the Republicans. That would increase to an 8.7-seat GOP bonus if the GOP can flip the five seats they’re hoping for in 2026.</p><h2><strong>Is California a “gerrymander”?</strong></h2><p>Vance described California’s map as a gerrymander, but political experts doubted that this term applies. A gerrymander typically refers to a map drawn by partisan lawmakers, and California’s is drawn by a commission approved by voters specifically to remove the partisanship from congressional map drawing.</p><p>“California’s congressional map is no gerrymander,” said Nathaniel Rakich, a contributing analyst to Inside Elections, a political analytics publication. “It was drawn by an independent commission consisting of five Republicans, five Democrats, and four independents that is generally upheld as one of the fairest map-drawing entities in any state.”</p><p>Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, said commissions tend to produce a more competitive House battleground than a fully partisan system. Of the 19 House seats his outlet currently rates as toss-ups going into 2026, only two come from states where one party had a free hand to gerrymander the current district lines.</p><p>“I think it’s fair to say that commission and court-drawn maps can inject some competitiveness into the process,” Kondik said.</p><p>Because the seats were drawn by a commission, California has a lot of competitive seats. This helps California Republicans despite the state’s Democratic tilt.</p><p>According to the 2024 pre-election ratings by Sabato’s Crystal Ball, California had three Democratic-held seats in the “lean Democratic” category, and two more that were rated “likely Democratic”.</p><p>So, going into the election, five of California’s 40 Democratic-held seats are at least somewhat vulnerable to a Republican takeover. Texas Democrats aren’t so lucky, under its existing map: They are able to realistically target only one “likely Republican” seat out of 25 held by the GOP.</p><h2><strong>Sometimes, geography is the enemy of a “fair” map</strong></h2><p>Despite map makers’ efforts, it is sometimes impossible to produce a map that jibes perfectly with a state’s overall partisan balance. The cold facts of geography can prevent this.</p><p>One oft-cited example is Massachusetts, which hasn’t elected a Republican to the US House since 1994. There are few Republican hotbeds in Massachusetts, and experts say they can’t be easily connected into coherent congressional districts.</p><p>“Especially in deep-red or deep-blue states, parties tend to get a higher share of seats than they do of votes,” Rakich said. “Imagine a state where Republicans get two-thirds of the vote in every district; obviously, they would get 100 percent of their seats.”</p><p>Rakich said Democrats are geographically distributed more favourably in California. But in other states, Republicans benefit from better geographic distribution.</p><p>“I haven’t heard Vance complain about the fact that Democrats only get 25 percent of Wisconsin’s congressional seats despite regularly getting 50 percent of the vote there,” Rakich added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The salinity of the water has risen by about 70 percent since 1990, making it impossible to grow crops and severely affecting the shrimp and crab populations.</p><p>“The delta is both sinking and shrinking,” said Muhammad Ali Anjum, a local WWF conservationist.</p><p>Beginning in Tibet, the Indus River flows through disputed Kashmir before traversing the entire length of Pakistan. The river and its tributaries irrigate about 80 percent of the country’s farmland, supporting millions of livelihoods. The delta, formed by rich sediment deposited by the river as it meets the sea, was once ideal for farming, fishing, mangroves and wildlife.</p><p>But more than 16 percent of fertile land has become unproductive due to encroaching seawater, a government water agency study found in 2019.</p><p>In the town of Keti Bandar, which spreads inland from the water’s edge, a white layer of salt crystals covers the ground.

Earlier this year, several military-led canal projects on the Indus River were halted when farmers in the low-lying riverine areas of Sindh province protested.</p><p>To combat the degradation of the Indus River Basin, the government and the United Nations launched the “Living Indus Initiative” in 2021. One intervention focuses on restoring the delta by addressing soil salinity and protecting local agriculture and ecosystems.</p><p>The Sindh government is currently running its own mangrove restoration project, aiming to revive forests that serve as a natural barrier against saltwater intrusion. Even as mangroves are restored in some parts of the coastline, land grabbing and residential development projects drive clearing in other areas.</p><p>Neighbouring India, meanwhile, poses a looming threat to the river and its delta, after revoking a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan, which divides control over the Indus basin rivers. It has threatened never to reinstate the treaty and to build dams upstream, squeezing the flow of water to Pakistan, which has called it “an act of war”.</p><p>Alongside their homes, the communities have lost a way of life tightly bound up in the delta, said climate activist Fatima Majeed, who works with the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.</p><p>Women, in particular, who for generations have stitched nets and packed the day’s catches, struggle to find work when they migrate to cities, said Majeed, whose grandfather relocated the family from Kharo Chan to the outskirts of Karachi.</p><p>“We haven’t just lost our land; we’ve lost our culture.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
