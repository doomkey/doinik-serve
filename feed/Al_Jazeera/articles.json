agreement signed between the two countries, granting exemptions for some textiles and garments manufactured with US material.</p><p>The trade deal was announced on Monday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser heading Bangladesh’s interim government, said Washington had “committed to establishing a mechanism for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh using US-produced cotton and man-made fibre to receive zero reciprocal tariff in [the] US market”.</p><p>The White House said Bangladesh had agreed to provide significant preferential market access for US industrial and agricultural goods, including chemicals, medical devices, machinery, motor vehicles and parts, soya products and dairy goods, beef, poultry, tree nuts and fruit.</p><p>Bangladesh will also ease non-tariff barriers by accepting US vehicle safety and emissions standards, recognising US Food and Drug Administration certifications, and removing import restrictions on remanufactured goods, the White House added.</p><p>The nations also noted recent and upcoming commercial deals including aircraft procurement, around $3.5bn in purchases of US agricultural products, and an estimated $15bn in US energy product purchases over 15 years.</p><p>Yunus said the agreement followed nine months of negotiations that began in April last year.</p><p>Bangladesh also pledged to uphold internationally recognised labour rights and strengthen environmental protections.</p><p>The South Asian nation in August had secured a reduction in US tariffs on its exports to 20 percent, down from 37 percent initially proposed by Washington, offering much-needed relief to the nation’s apparel exporters.</p><p>The ready-made garments sector is the backbone of Bangladesh’s economy, accounting for more than 80 percent of total export earnings, employing about four million workers and contributing about 10 percent to gross domestic product.</p><p>At the 19 percent tariff rate, Bangladesh will compete comfortably with next-door neighbour India, for which the tariff rate has been set at <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 percent</a>, down from a crippling 50 percent. Both countries make clothing and footwear for clients in the US. When the first round of tariffs was announced on April 2, India had been slammed with 25 percent while Dhaka had been given a much stiffer 37 percent. At the time, Bangladeshi manufacturers feared that they would lose clients to the Indian market. Now both are on an equal footing.</p><p>Bangladesh goes to the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polls on Thursday</a> to elect new leadership after being governed by an interim government since August 2024, when ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, where she remains.</p></div></div></body></html>"

While most of the public clapped, cheered and waved British flags, one person shouted, “How long have you known about Andrew?”</p><p>Last week, King Charles forced Mountbatten-Windsor to leave his longtime home at Royal Lodge near Windsor Castle, accelerating a move that was first announced in October but was not expected to be completed until later this year.</p><p>The former royal is now living temporarily at Wood Farm Cottage on the king’s Sandringham Estate in eastern England.

Maxwell has asked Trump to commute her sentence, which she was given in 2022 after being convicted on charges of sex trafficking minors.</p><p>She is the only person convicted of crimes related to Epstein, whose connections to a wide array of individuals at the height of political and economic power in the US and around the world have been revealed in the Epstein files.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under the proposal, federal employees seeking to challenge their termination would be required to appeal directly to OPM, which reports to the president, rather than to an independent body known as the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The MSPB acts as a mediator between federal workers and the government and has been in place since 1978. After Trump took office, the board’s caseload surged by 266 percent between October 2024 and September 2025. Federal workers who were cut in early 2025 and accepted buyouts received their final paycheques at the end of September.</p><p>If implemented, the proposal would build on Trump’s broader push to shrink the federal government and limit workers’ ability to challenge those decisions. The administration forced out roughly 317,000 federal employees last year.</p><p>The move comes amid a separate proposal announced last week that would reclassify high-level career civil servants as “at will” employees. That change would give the administration broader authority to fire career officials who do not align with the sitting president’s agenda, affecting roughly 50,000 workers at the nation’s largest employer.</p><p>Outlined in a more than 250-page document, the directive would <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/5/new-trump-administration-rule-makes-it-easier-to-fire-career-civil-servants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allow workers to be fired</a> if they were “intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.</p><p>“Congress gave OPM the authority to set how reduction-in-force appeals are handled, and this rule puts that responsibility to work,” an OPM spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement. “It replaces a slow, costly process with a single, streamlined review led by OPM experts. That means agencies can restructure without years of litigation, and employees get faster, fairer resolution if mistakes occur.”</p><p>The proposal also comes as the administration has sought to fire political appointees from previous administrations without just cause. Since last year, the White House has been attempting to remove US Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.</p><p>Cook challenged the decision in federal court, which ruled that the president did not have the authority to fire her. The White House appealed, and the case is now before the Supreme Court.</p><p>While the court <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has not yet issued a ruling</a>, a decision in the president’s favour would make it easier to remove political appointees who do not align with a given administration’s agenda.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The set even featured a live wedding ceremony during the song Titi Me Pregunto – a track about having many girlfriends and a wedding.</p><p>However, the celebration was underscored by tension; many viewed the performance as an act of defiance amidst ongoing deadly raids by <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/public-opinion-shifts-on-ice-as-advocates-warn-of-us-inflection-point\">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE</a>) targeting immigrant communities across the country.</p><p>And US President Donald Trump contributed to the political atmosphere of the event, blasting Bad Bunny’s act as “the worst performance ever” and “a slap in the face to our country”, skipping the live show and watching the game instead from an event in Florida.</p><p>“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the USA, and all over the World,” Trump railed in a Truth Social post.</p><p>His “Make America Great Agains” (MAGA) supporters followed suit, also questioning why it was in a “foreign” language and decrying it as “anti-American”. Many conservatives instead tuned in to the “All-American Halftime Show”, a live entertainment event featuring country artists presented as an alternative, and organised by the right-wing non-profit Turning Point USA, which was founded by the late Charlie Kirk.</p><p>The divisive political climate in the US is why those with Latin American heritage felt pride in Bad Bunny’s cultural performance, in which he strutted and swayed to his most famous songs, from Titi Me Pregunto to Baile Inolvidable.</p><p>“Bad Bunny symbolises hope for the Latino community in a deeply divided time, when Latinos are often reduced to harmful stereotypes,” Claudia Ruiz, a Cuban-American who lives in Modesto, California, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He represents unity in a rich, cultural, family- centred, and joyful way that restores pride.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-re-not-savages-we-re-not-aliens\">‘We’re not savages … we’re not aliens’</h2><p>Last week, the singer and rapper, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, and who is one of the most listened-to artists worldwide, made history at the Grammy Awards, with his album, Debi Tirar Mas Fotos, scooping up the Best Album award, the first Spanish-language one to ever do so.</p><p>During his acceptance speech, Bad Bunny <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/stars-target-ice-crackdown-at-grammys-ceremony\">spoke against ICE</a> and stated, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans”, a stance that was amplified by his Super Bowl performance.</p><p>Ruiz said that Bad Bunny is a reminder that she should not be made to feel apologetic for celebrating her identity, which is very much a part of the American fabric.</p><p>“As a Latina, I want to be reminded of my roots positively and feel grounded in who I am, without needing to shrink myself to make others comfortable,” she said. “Seeing our culture celebrated without apology feels powerful.”</p><blockquote><p>“Our music can [take] a stand in the most ‘US’ event in existence to say we’re more than just land you can take militarily or recreationally. We also matter; we have a voice.”</p></blockquote><p>In one climactic moment, after crooning cameos by Lady Gaga and another Puerto Rican star of a past generation, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny belted out the words “God Bless America!”</p><p>The only English phrase of the performance was followed by a roll call of the countries of North, South and Central America, from Cuba to Canada, and a parade of their flags.</p><p>For Bernardo Garcia Espinosa, who watched the Super Bowl from Mexico, the roll call was the “most powerful moment” of the whole show.</p><p>“Benito took this well-known US-ism of ‘God bless America’ and then flips it on its head by reciting the names of the countries in the Americas,” Espinosa told Al Jazeera from Mexico City.</p><p>“Since I’ve been young, there’s this sense that people from the US claim the whole continent by reserving the ‘American’ demonym exclusively for themselves, and this was Bad Bunny saying, ‘Screw that, we are all Americans because we all live in the Americas’,” said Espinosa, who used to live in Canada.</p><p>Espinosa referenced Trump’s recent actions in the region, including the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/26/the-discombobulator-did-us-use-secret-weapon-in-maduro-abduction\">abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a>. The US leader had justified his action by invoking <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/what-is-the-monroe-doctrine-which-trump-has-cited-over-venezuela\">the Monroe Doctrine</a>, a 19th-century policy that urged the division of the world into spheres of influence overseen by different powers.</p><p>“When the US is renewing its Monroe Doctrine approach, it feels very empowering that our music can [take] a stand in the most ‘US’ event in existence to say we’re more than just land you can take militarily or recreationally.

But beyond overt political statements, Rugerio enjoyed the simple, everyday nods to Latino culture in Bad Bunny’s performance.</p><p>“There were so many hints to Latin American culture that we all share, like a kid sleeping in a chair while the adults are still partying,” Rugerio told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She said she could never have dreamed of a Super Bowl performance entirely in Spanish.</p><p>“I think it was well deserved for all the Latino immigrants to see this,” Rugerio said.</p><p>Bad Bunny’s show also featured roving dancers dressed as mechanics, shopkeepers, and hairdressers – jobs taken up by many Latino immigrants in the US. Those scenes moved Natalia Bustamante, a Chilean-Ecuadorean living in Montreal, Canada.</p><p>“Our immigrant brothers and sisters go through hell in order to get to the States,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that it felt good to be celebrated “for once”.</p><p>“It was so overwhelming, [by] the end, I was crying.”</p><p>Abril Boniche Porras, a Costa Rican-American from Richmond, Virginia, meanwhile, said it was disheartening to witness the alternative halftime show organised by Turning Point USA. She was also dismayed to see people post photos to social media using headphones to block out Bad Bunny’s performance during the live event.</p><p>“[All] because they didn’t want to hear someone speak in a language they could not understand,” Porras told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The show was all about love, and community, and music … [Trump] supporters forget that we are all Americans.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300346\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300346\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300346\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6989e132107d-1770643762.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Performers wave the flags of sovereign countries in the Americas at the conclusion of Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performance during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4300346\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Performers wave the flags of sovereign countries in the Americas at the conclusion of Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny’s performance during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California [AFP]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

meeting with representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).</p><p>Top officials of the ICC held reconciliatory talks with BCB President Aminul Islam and Naqvi on Sunday with the aim of convincing Pakistan to call off its boycott of the marquee clash.</p><p>Pakistan’s government said it had “reviewed formal requests extended by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations” which sought “a viable solution to recent challenges”.</p><p>Additionally, Pakistan’s PM Sharif

But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli Defence Forces, and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Ten days since the US Department of Justice last released millions of documents related to Epstein – and ten and a half years since his death in US custody – details of his interactions with other members of the global elite continue to dominate the world’s headlines.</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"was-epstein-a-spy-for-israel\">Was Epstein a spy for Israel?</h2><p>While the documents provide more evidence for those who believe that Epstein was an Israeli intelligence asset, it is still not something we can say for certain.</p><p>An FBI memo produced by the bureau’s Los Angeles field office in October 2020 reported that one of its sources had come to believe Epstein “was a co-opted Mossad agent”.</p><p>According to the document, the disgraced financier was described as having been “trained as a spy” for Israel’s intelligence service.</p><p>The source also claimed Epstein maintained links to US and allied intelligence circles through his longtime lawyer Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard University law professor whose network, it said, included “many students from wealthy families”. Among those cited were Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and envoy, and his brother, Josh Kushner, both described in the memo as former students.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Epstein’s email correspondence also shows him to have had extensive contact with senior Ehud Barak aide and Israeli military intelligence Yoni Koren, who made regular stays at Epstein’s New York residence and whose cancer treatment in 2012, the emails show, Epstein appears to have paid for.</p><p>The links to Israel go back much further. Robert Maxwell, a British newspaper tycoon who was the father of Epstein’s former girlfriend and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, was long rumoured to have been linked to Israeli intelligence.</p><p>Maxwell poured money into the Israeli economy and died in mysterious circumstances after he was said to have fallen from his yacht in 1991, after embezzling millions from his company’s pension fund.</p><p>Epstein himself appeared to have suspected that the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency had a role in Maxwell’s death. An email Epstein sent in 2018 had the subject line “he was passed away”, referring to Maxwell.</p><p>In the message, Epstein claimed that Maxwell had previously threatened Israel’s intelligence service, writing that “unless they [the Mossad] gave him £400 million to save his [Maxwell’s] crumbling empire, he would expose all he had done for them”.</p><p>Epstein also alleged that Maxwell had acted as an informal operative, gathering information on the US, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300477\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300477\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300477\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Epstein-Maxwell-1770647539.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C249&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Correspondence from Jeffrey Epstein concerning the death of UK publihing boss, Robert Mawell [Screen Grab/Department of Justice]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4300477\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Correspondence from Jeffrey Epstein concerning the death of British publishing tycoon Robert Mawell [Screen Grab/Department of Justice]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"would-epstein-have-been-of-interest-to-intelligence-agencies\">Would Epstein have been of interest to intelligence agencies?</h2><p>As an international financier with strong ties to global elites, as well as potentially compromising information on them, Epstein is the kind of person intelligence agencies would turn to.</p><p>“It is unlikely that Epstein was not approached by the Mossad,” said Ahron Bregman, a lecturer at King’s College London, whose relationship with the alleged Egyptian Mossad agent <a href=\"/features/2016/10/14/the-egyptian-spy-who-saved-israel\">Ashraf Marwan</a> formed the basis of the book and film The Spy Who Fell to Earth.</p><p>“It is like with Ashraf Marwan: even though he was not needed to report on Egypt anymore because there was peace between the two countries, the Mossad renewed contact with him to use him to open doors,” Bregman said.</p><p>Dershowitz – himself a controversial figure who is avowedly pro-Israel – has denied the claims, saying of Epstein that “No intelligence agency would really trust him”. Dershowitz added that if Epstein had been an intelligence operative, he would have informed his lawyer – referring to himself.</p><p>Israel’s current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also pushed back on claims Epstein was a Mossad agent, writing on Twitter: “Jeffrey Epstein’s unusually close relationship with Ehud Barak doesn’t suggest Epstein worked for Israel. It proves the opposite.”</p><p>Barak has long been one of Netanyahu’s political opponents.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Other sources, including Christopher Steele, who used to head up the British spy agency MI6’s Russia desk, have suggested that it was “quite likely” that Epstein may have been “recruited by Russian organised criminals”. Elsewhere, the Polish government has launched an investigation into the late sex offender’s links to Russia’s state intelligence.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-epstein-s-relationship-with-israel-linked-organisations\">What do we know about Epstein’s relationship with Israel-linked organisations?</h2><p>Through Epstein’s COUQ Foundation, he provided Friends of the Israeli Defence Forces (FIDF) and the Jewish National Fund (JNF) with funds on at least one occasion, when he gifted $25,000 to the FIDF and $15,000 to the JNF in 2006.</p><p>According to the FIDF’s website, the organisation funds programmes for Israeli soldiers. Through its website, the organisation invites donors to adopt a brigade or battalion, such as the <a href=\"/news/2024/4/25/what-is-netzah-yehuda-the-israeli-battalion-facing-possible-us-sanctions\">97th Netzah Yehuda Battalion</a>, which has been widely accused of killing unarmed civilians, killing detainees, torture, and mistreatment.</p><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2021/3/12/for-love-charity-washing-colonialism-fascism-and-genocide\">JNF</a> has also been accused of historically privileging Jewish citizens to land inside Israel while restricting Palestinians’ access under the guise of “environmentalism”.</p><p>Activists accuse the JNF of contributing to the displacement of Palestinian communities through forestation projects built over depopulated villages. Its alleged support for settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, principally in the settlement cluster of Gush Etzion, has prompted calls in some countries to revoke its charitable status. The organisation has additionally been challenged over environmental practices seen as damaging to local ecosystems.</p></div></div></body></html>"

By exposing the identities of Palestinian landowners in the registry, settlers and real estate companies can now target specific individuals for pressure, extortion, or entrapment to force land sales.</p><p>“This government puts settlement expansion at the centre of its policy,” Daoud told Al Jazeera Arabic. “By facilitating the leak of Palestinian land to settlers, they are adding a new layer of apartheid.”</p><p>The Yesha Council, a gathering of illegal settlements, celebrated the decision as the “most important in 58 years”, stating that the Israeli government is now declaring, in practice, that “the land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people”.</p><h2 id=\"breaching-areas-a-and-b\">Breaching Areas A and B</h2><p>Perhaps the most aggressive shift in the new directives is the authorisation for Israeli forces to conduct enforcement and demolitions in Area A and B zones, which under the Oslo Accords, are supposed to be under Palestinian civil and security control.</p><p>Area C, which is under total Israeli control, constitutes 60 percent of the West Bank. More than 700,000 illegal Israeli settlers live in Area C and occupied East Jerusalem across more than 250 illegal settlements.</p><p>To bypass international law, Israel has introduced a new legal mechanism: the “Protection of Antiquities and Environment”.</p><p>“Israel has erased the distinctions between Areas A, B, and C,” Daoud noted, explaining that this policy was financially primed three years ago when the cabinet allocated 120 million shekels ($39m) to “protect Jewish heritage sites” in the West Bank.</p><h2 id=\"municipal-apartheid\">Municipal apartheid</h2><p>The decision also institutionalises a system of “municipal apartheid” in key Palestinian cities, removing them from PA jurisdiction.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Hebron:</strong> Planning and construction powers have been stripped from the Palestinian municipality and transferred to the Israeli Civil Administration. A “separate municipal entity” will be created for the Jewish settlers in the heart of the city to manage their affairs independently, bypassing Palestinian mechanisms entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Rachel’s Tomb (Bethlehem):</strong> The site has been removed from the jurisdiction of the Bethlehem municipality and placed under direct Israeli administration for maintenance and services.</li>\n</ul><p>Adel Shadid, an expert on Israeli affairs, warned that these administrative changes have profound religious and political implications.</p><p>“The Ibrahimi Mosque is no longer treated as a Muslim holy site managed by the Palestinian Awqaf,” Shadid told Al Jazeera Arabic. “Its management has been transferred to the Jewish Religious Council in Kiryat Arba. Israel has effectively Judaized its identity by law, not just by force”.</p><p>In 2010, the Israeli government had already <a href=\"/news/2010/3/3/israels-new-war-on-islamic-sites\">proclaimed</a> the Ibrahimi Mosque located in Hebron as a “Jewish Heritage site”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4237632\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4237632\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4237632\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HeritageSites_INTERACTIVE-Palestines-World-Heritage-Sites-1768390146.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Palestines World Heritage Sites-1768390146 UNESCO\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4237632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"pre-empting-trump\">Pre-empting Trump</h2><p>The timing of this “legal overhaul” is not accidental. According to Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Smotrich and Katz pushed to ratify these decisions immediately prior to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming visit to the United States.</p><p>Analysts believe Israel’s far-right government is racing against time to establish irreversible “facts on the ground” before October elections for the Israeli parliament or Knesset, and amid fears that US President Donald Trump might shift his stance on annexation.</p><p>James Moran, a former adviser to the European Union, believes the intent is clear.</p><p>“Smotrich was quoted saying: ‘We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,'” Moran told Al Jazeera Arabic from Brussels. “This decision shows there is absolutely no intention for a just solution”.</p><p>Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he is against the formation of a sovereign Palestinian state. He has worked to undermine the Oslo Accords that called for the so-called two-state solution. Several Western governments, including France and the United Kingdom, last year recognised Palestinian statehood. But they have done little to deter Israel from expanding illegal settlements on Palestinian lands – the biggest stumbling block in the realisation of a Palestinian state.</p><p>Moran argued that international condemnations are no longer sufficient. “It is time for sanctions,” he said, suggesting that the EU should consider suspending trade agreements with Israel, given that a third of Israel’s trade is with the bloc.</p><h2 id=\"violence-unleashed\">Violence unleashed</h2><p>On the ground, the cabinet’s decisions were interpreted by the settler movement as a “green light” for total impunity.</p><p>Al Jazeera Arabic’s correspondent in Hebron, Montaser Nassar, reported an immediate spike in violence following the announcement. “What is happening on the ground is the true translation of these decisions,” Nassar said.</p><p>Within hours of the ratification:</p><ul>\n<li>Settlers raided the Al-Rashaydeh Mosque east of Bethlehem, stealing its contents and causing severe damage.</li>\n<li>In Bani Naim, east of Hebron, settlers brutally beat an 80-year-old disabled Palestinian man.</li>\n<li>Demolition notices were handed to Palestinians in Berin (east of Hebron), while demolitions were carried out in Bedouin communities in the northern Jordan Valley.</li>\n</ul><p>Dalal Iriqat, a professor of diplomacy and conflict resolution, warned that the situation has moved beyond the point of political manoeuvring.</p><p>“We are witnessing the institutional and legal annexation of the West Bank,” Iriqat told Al Jazeera Arabic.</p><p>“Israel is imposing a reality of ‘Greater Israel’ and apartheid. If the international community does not move from statements to action, the situation on the ground will explode.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were part of a 20-point plan Trump proposed to try to end the war in Gaza. The plan began with a “ceasefire” that started in October. In later stages, the international peacekeeping force is to be created and deployed to provide security and oversight of the “truce” between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.</p><p>The Board of Peace was initially framed as a mechanism to support the administration, reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.</p><p>The White House <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">formally announced</a> its creation in January.

Only 6 percent opposed the deployment while 16 percent were undecided.</p><p>Gilani said the most striking takeaway is the divergence between Pakistan’s elites and the broader public.</p><p>“The public opinion, at least in my reading, with respect to sending troops to Gaza is more unanimous whereas joining BoP is a little divided but still more in support of joining, so I think this is an interesting juncture where elite and public opinion varies,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Salman Shahid, a 29-year-old lawyer in Lahore, said Pakistan’s diplomatic standing improves when it acts as a “voice of reason, law and unity, not when it rushes into confrontational positions”.</p><p>“A mature, lawful and humanitarian approach strengthens our credibility far more than military posturing. However, any military involvement outside Pakistan’s borders must strictly follow Pakistan’s Constitution and must align with UN mandates,” Shahid told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Masroor Hussain, 33, a software developer from Karachi, said Pakistan should avoid joining the stabilisation force but believes participation in Trump’s board could be beneficial.</p><p>Despite criticism, the body is currently the only platform offering countries a role in shaping a resolution to the Gaza war while potentially providing a long-term solution, he said.</p><p>“Pakistan being in BoP will mean it is more involved in the Middle East as far as talks go, but how it turns into something concrete for Pakistan is hard to say as the region has multiple sides with their own agendas,” Hussain told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2741704\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2741704\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2741704\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AFP__20240228__34KE9T6__v1__Preview__DrcongoPakistanConflictUn-1709272513.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani peacekeepers hold the Pakistani and UN flags\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2741704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistani peacekeepers are deployed with the UN’s stabilisation force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [File: Glody Murhabazi/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"vague-objectives\">‘Vague objectives’</h2><p>Support cuts across demographic lines although with variations.

About 67 percent of respondents with less than a high school diploma supported a deployment compared with 84 percent of those with post-secondary educations.</p><p>Anam Nadeem, 38, a communications professional from Sialkot, is firmly opposed.</p><p>“The ISF’s role, leadership and objectives are vague, and it appears to be aligned with a US-led framework that lacks broad regional legitimacy. Joining such a force risks placing Pakistan in direct conflict with Palestinian factions, including Hamas, potentially against the will of the Palestinian people,” she said.</p><p>Pakistan is neither politically nor strategically prepared for a military entanglement in Gaza under unclear terms, Nadeem said.</p><p>“Without a transparent mandate, UN authorisation and explicit Palestinian consent, supporting this decision would be irresponsible,” she added.</p><p>These concerns echo conditions highlighted in the survey. A joint alliance of Muslim countries emerged as the most crucial prerequisite for deployment with 64 percent rating it “important” and 35 percent calling it “very important”.</p><p>A formal request from the Palestinian leadership was deemed necessary by 86 percent of respondents while 81 percent said UN approval was essential.</p><p>Approval from major powers, including the US and China, ranked lowest.

But even from that standpoint, it seems to be overall in support.”</p><p>Nadeem said he remained sceptical, warning that the timing and political context could make participation appear as an endorsement of actions shaped by “bad-faith actors” rather than an inclusive peace process.</p><p>“If the BoP delivers real, tangible benefits for Palestinians, engagement makes sense. Otherwise, it risks becoming symbolic optics rather than a meaningful step toward peace,” she said.</p><p>Pakistan’s credibility, Nadeem added, “ultimately depends on principled alignment with peace, justice and Palestinian rights – not just strategic proximity to powerful actors”.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3995566\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Trump-20-point-Gaza-plan-1759216486.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE Trump 20-point Gaza plan-1759216486\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"calculated-gamble\">Calculated gamble?</h2><p>Throughout 2025, Field Marshal Asim Munir, Pakistan’s military chief, emerged as a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">central figure</a> in the country’s diplomatic manoeuvring.</p><p>In<a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\"> June</a>, Munir had a solo White House lunch with Trump, the first time a US president hosted a Pakistani army chief without civilian officials present.</p><p>Pakistan also attended a conference organised by the US military’s Central Command in Qatar in December in which representatives from nearly 45 countries discussed the operational framework of a peacekeeping force for Gaza.</p><p>Officials have repeatedly stressed no final decision has been made. They say any deployment would require a “transparent, politically neutral mandate focused on humanitarian stabilisation rather than disarmament of Palestinian groups”.</p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also stated in December that while Pakistan could consider contributing peacekeepers, “disarming Hamas is not our job.”</p><p>The prospect of a military deployment has historical parallels, particularly the disputed role of Pakistani soldiers in Jordan during the 1970 <a href=\"/news/2022/9/5/germany-israel-mark-50-years-since-1972-munich-olympics-attacks]\">Black September crisis</a>. While Pakistan maintains its troops were only training Jordanian forces and did not engage in combat, the episode remains politically sensitive.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a former Pakistani diplomat and envoy to India, told Al Jazeera that although the UN established Trump’s BoP specifically for Gaza, Washington appears to view it much more broadly.</p><p>“The irony is President Trump is not talking about the state of Palestine. How can a one-sided ceasefire be termed as peace … as Palestinians continue living under Israeli occupation?” he asked.</p><p>Basit was unequivocal that Pakistan “should not be part of any exercise that seeks to disarm Palestinians”.</p><p>“Armed struggle against foreign occupation is legitimate in international law and in conformity with the UN Charter. If push comes to shove, Pakistan may send its medical and engineering corps. That would go down well with Palestinians,” he said.</p><p>Uzair Younus, a partner at The Asia Group, a Washington, DC-based geopolitical consulting firm, said the survey suggested Pakistanis have a pragmatic view.</p><p>“The results are not surprising but do show that compared to elites, ordinary citizens do have a more measured perspective on Pakistan’s policy choices,” Younus told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The findings offer guidance to the government as it communicates Pakistan’s potential role to stabilise Gaza, likely tied to broader efforts by Middle East powers, he added.</p><p>“The regional push is being led by Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, in particular, and so long as Pakistan remains in close coordination with these countries, engagement in the ISF and BoP is unlikely to create major risks for Islamabad,” Younus said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
