In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that issuing refunds would present practical challenges and said it would be “a mess”.</p><p>The case will now return to the Court of International Trade to oversee the refund process.</p><p>More than 1,000 lawsuits have already been filed by importers in the trade court seeking refunds, and a wave of new cases is expected. Legal experts say the administration will likely require importers to apply for refunds individually. That process could disproportionately <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/9/i-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-these-tariffs-us-small-biz-suffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">burden smaller businesses</a> affected by the tariffs.</p><p>“The government is probably not going to voluntarily pay back the money it unlawfully took. Rather, the government is going to make everyone request a refund through different procedures by filing formal protests. They’re going to delay things procedurally as long as they can. Hiring lawyers and going through these procedures costs money and time,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I imagine the largest companies, who have been prepared for this eventuality, will eventually get their money back. But smaller importers, it’s a cost-benefit analysis where they might shrug their shoulders and say it’s not worth going through the hassle to get the unlawfully imposed taxes paid back to them.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-path-forward\">Trump’s path forward</h2><p>Despite Friday’s ruling, other sweeping levies remain in place. Trump had invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to impose sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminium, cars, copper, lumber, and other products, such as kitchen cabinets, worldwide.</p><p>On Friday, Trump said he would impose a 10 percent global tariff for 150 days to replace some of his emergency duties that were struck down. The order would be made under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and the duties would be over and above tariffs that are currently in place, Trump said.</p><p>The statute allows the president to impose duties of up to 15 percent for up to 150 days on any and all countries related to “large and serious” balance of payments issues. It does not require investigations or impose other procedural limits.</p><p>The president also has other legal avenues available to continue taxing imports aggressively.</p><p>“Our trading partners were well aware of the risks the President faced in using IEEPA as the basis for reciprocal and other tariffs. Nevertheless, they chose to conclude deals with Washington, convinced by Washington that other statutes would be utilised to keep the tariffs in place,” Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“With respect to China, USTR [United States trade representative] still has an active Section 301 investigation on China’s compliance with the Phase One agreement, which could be a major feature of the back-up plan for Beijing.”</p><p>The president is expected to travel to Beijing next month to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to discuss trade.</p><p>“The two main options include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the traditional mechanism for imposing tariffs in response to unfair trade practices by other countries. It requires an investigation and a report, but ultimately gives the president considerable discretion to impose tariffs. It has been used in the past and will likely be the most frequently used measure going forward,” Shaffer, the law professor, said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He noted, however, that the administration’s tariff options could not be applied retroactively, meaning any new tariffs would apply only to future imports rather than covering duties already paid.</p><p>Raj Bhala, professor of law at The University of Kansas School of Law, argues there are remedies at the president’s disposal in addition to Section 122. Bhala said that Trump could use Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also known as the Smoot-Hawley Act). That allows the president to impose a 50 percent tariff to challenge discriminatory trade practices from other countries.</p><p>“Each option involves procedural hurdles,” Bhala said.</p><h2 id=\"congressional-pressure\">Congressional pressure</h2><p>Roberts wrote that the president must “point to clear congressional authorization” to impose tariffs. The ruling has increased pressure on both Trump’s allies and critics in Congress to clarify the scope of executive trade authority.</p><p>“What a fantastic ruling for a feckless branch of government. While its current tendency is to abdicate, the court has told Congress to do its job,” a former official in the White House Office of Management and Budget told Al Jazeera in response to the decision.</p><p>“Congress must either act with specific legislation, or declare war, which would grant the President the emergency powers to levy tariffs.”</p><p>“Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, by contrast, welcomed the ruling, saying it will “finally give families and small businesses the relief they deserve” and that Trump should end “this reckless trade war for good.”</p><p>But how that money will get paid back, and if it was already spent, will require Congress to step in.</p><p>“If it has been spent, the money will have to be reallocated by Congress. Congress will have to determine how much is owed to importers, pass a law to fund it, and create a mechanism for repayment. There’s also the question of who is entitled to it. Is it only the importer, or does it extend to the end consumer? Where does the line stop?” Babak Hafezi, professor of international business at American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not something that will be fixed in 24 hours. It will most likely take years, possibly even a decade, to resolve all the issues this less-than-a-year-old law has imposed on Americans.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is expected to become law before the end of the month, after the Senate reviews modifications to the version it first passed last week.</p><p>Members of La Libertad Avanza say the legislation will modernise the labour market by making it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, including through limits on severance pay and collective bargaining.</p><p>It also allows employers to extend the workday from 8 to 12 hours, creates a “time bank” to replace paid overtime and reduces the amount of uninterrupted holiday a worker can take, among other provisions.</p><p>Supporters <a href=\"https://x.com/PatoBullrich/status/2021837703709446374\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argue</a> the changes are essential to boost productivity, attract foreign investment and limit labour lawsuits.</p><p>They have also praised provisions that offer new tax incentives for hiring and pathways to legally register Argentina’s large population of informal workers.</p><p>“We have labour modernisation. Javier Milei gives answers to the millions of Argentines who are currently in the informal economy,” Bornoroni posted on social media after the vote.</p><p>Since the bill was first drafted, business leaders have been divided over its potential effectiveness.</p><p>Some warned that its provisions, including those affecting collective bargaining and contract stability, could generate feelings of uncertainty among employees.</p><p>Others questioned how much it would boost hiring. Ricardo Diab, president of the Argentinian Confederation of Medium-Sized Enterprises (CAME), said in an interview with Cadena 3 that a law alone is not enough to create jobs.</p><p>“To hire [people], I need to have a need, and for there to be a need, there must be production and consumption,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, opposition politicians and trade unionists argue that the law will strip workers of their basic rights.</p><p>“Workers were already under pressure, and this just delivers another heavy hit, leaving them with very little room to negotiate anything,” Roxana Monzon, a national deputy for the opposition party Union por la Patria, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It means job insecurity for workers, and it will affect the most vulnerable even more.”</p><p>She pointed to the “time bank” as an example of the bill’s problematic proposals.</p><p>Instead of mandating paid overtime, the legislation would allow employers to compensate workers with time off later on, subject to the company’s approval.</p><p>That system, Monzon explained, is ripe for exploitation, since some workers rely on overtime to pay the bills.</p><p>“The hour bank, for example, will affect women in particular, as employers can decide what hours they must work, regardless of other responsibilities they have, such as caring,” Monzon said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326996\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-View-of-the-National-Congress-of-Argentina-after-the-repression-of-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-08-1771611706.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police stand behind a metal barricade around Argentina's Congress\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Law enforcement erects a barricade around Argentina’s Congress in Buenos Aires [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"anxiety-among-workers\">Anxiety among workers</h2><p>As members of Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies debated the bill on Thursday, thousands of people protested outside Congress in solidarity with a nationwide strike organised by the country’s main unions.</p><p>Gabriela Quiroz, a 31-year-old primary school teacher from Villa Soldati, near Buenos Aires, said she already works two jobs to make ends meet. She described the bill as an “abysmal step backwards”.</p><p>“I’m very concerned and anxious about what could happen. As a teacher, I do many extra hours, and now they won’t be paid in cash,” Quiroz said. “I barely make it to the end of the month as it is, and there are many people like me.”</p><p>She added that slashing overtime pay could have wider impacts on Argentina’s economy, with consumers spending less.</p><p>“When people don’t have money, everybody is affected,” she said. “If I don’t have money to spend, I don’t shop in my local shops, so they start to struggle. It’s a vicious circle.”</p><p>Quiroz was among the thousands of people who made their way to Congress, undeterred by the heat and the lack of public transport, one of the services disrupted by the strike.</p><p>The general strike also left airports empty, as hundreds of flights were cancelled. Factories and banks also shuttered for the day, and hospitals only provided emergency services.</p><p>As demonstrations in Buenos Aires drew to a close in the evening, security forces used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters, a violent response that has become <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/14/they-could-have-killed-me-protesters-condemn-state-violence-in-argentina\">increasingly common</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326975\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Josefina-Salomon-Gabriela-Quiroz-with-sign-is-the-first-formally-employed-woman-in-her-family-at-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-1771610980.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gabriela Quiroz holds a sign protesting Argentina's labour reform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gabriela Quiroz holds up a sign that says, ‘I am the first formal worker in my family.

The bill tries to tackle the issue from several angles.</p><p>Think tanks like the Argentina Institute of Fiscal Analysis have reported that the companies face high costs in hiring new workers, and as many as 40 percent of Argentina’s workers work in the informal sector, without job protections.</p><p>The bill offers incentives to address those issues. But analysts say what is needed is a broader look at the country’s economy.</p><p>While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, that growth has been uneven. While sectors such as banking and agriculture have improved, manufacturing and commerce have experienced sharp declines in recent years.</p><p>More than <a href=\"https://centrocepa.com.ar/informes/725-analisis-de-la-dinamica-laboral-y-de-empleadores-datos-a-septiembre-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20,000</a> businesses with registered employees shut down between November 2023 and September 2025, at a pace of roughly 30 a day, according to the Center for Political Economics in Argentina (CEPA), a think tank.</p><p>During that same period, CEPA added, about 280,000 workers lost their jobs.</p><p>Stagnant salaries have also struggled to keep up with price increases for basic products and services <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/16/in-argentina-locals-are-taking-loans-to-buy-food\">like food</a>.</p><p>“While in Congress, we are debating the cost of employing people, in many homes, families are discussing whether their children can continue to go to school or need to find any job to help pay for rent and food.

Argentina will be great again,” he wrote, offering his twist on a slogan made famous by United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>Andres Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, said that for a country like Argentina, with a heavily regulated economy, the labour reform is not the most important bill, but it is the most symbolic.</p><p>It offers a blow to the historical power of Argentina’s unions, long associated with Peronism, the political movement that has governed since 1946, Malamud explained.</p><p>Milei, meanwhile, has rejected Peronism, and his party notched a decisive victory against the left-wing Peronist movement in October during Argentina’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">midterm elections</a>.</p><p>“If international conditions do not worsen and social patience holds, Milei will have achieved what no president since 1983 has: governing longer than non-Peronists while reforming more than Peronists,” Malamud said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, Susana Amatrudo, 54, a nurse from Avellaneda, told Al Jazeera she fears the changes will have a trickle-down effect across society.</p><p>“When factories close, and people lose their jobs, it affects everybody. People have less money, and they can buy less. This has been happening for a while and will only get worse,” Amatrudo said, tears streaming down her eyes, as she waved a large Argentinian flag in front of Congress.</p><p>“I’m OK, but I know a lot of people who are not, and that’s why we need to keep fighting.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thursday’s arrest was not related to that allegation.</p><p>In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the US by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.</p><p>Other police forces are also conducting their own investigations into Epstein’s links to the UK, including the assessment of flight logs at airports. They are coordinating their work within a national group.</p><p>On Friday, London’s Metropolitan Police said it was assessing, with the help of US counterparts, whether the capital’s airports, which include Heathrow, “may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation”.</p><p>It also said that it is asking past and present officers who protected Mountbatten-Windsor to “consider carefully” whether they saw or heard anything that may be relevant to the investigations.</p><p>As of now, it said no new criminal allegations have been made regarding sexual offences within its jurisdiction.</p><p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.

The opposition, meanwhile, published evidence suggesting its candidate had won by a considerable margin.</p><p>That prompted a sweeping government crackdown on dissenters.</p><p>In December 2024, Armas was arrested. He said he was taken to a house where he was blindfolded, tied to a chair for days and suffocated with a plastic bag.</p><p>Later, he shared a dingy cell with dozens of other prisoners – and rats. Once he was transferred to El Helicoide, his friends and family had no contact with him for 10 months.</p><p>His release, however, has not meant freedom. The day he stepped out of prison, he celebrated by joining a motorcycle parade with Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent politician who had also been freed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325401\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325401\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039811205752-1771525517.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Juan Pablo Guanipa and Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorcycles in a parade\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa, right, and political activist Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorbikes after their release [Cristian Hernandez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>There was a feeling of energy and optimism, Armas recalled, as they visited the families of other political prisoners. But within hours, Guanipa was abducted by masked individuals. No one knew where he had been taken.</p><p>\"I couldn’t sleep because I was scared,\" he said. His first night home was spent lying in bed, checking for news about Guanipa.</p><p>\"I had all this adrenaline, all these mixed emotions. I was happy because I was with my parents, but there was also fear.\"</p><p>Officials accused Guanipa of breaching the rules of his release, although it is not clear what those limits were. He was held incommunicado for hours before being fitted with an electronic ankle monitor and placed under house arrest.</p><p>Only after the passage of the amnesty bill on Thursday was Guanipa released from house arrest, according to a statement from his brother Tomas Guanipa.</p><p>Still, Guanipa himself warned that the amnesty law would not end the government's oppressive tactics. He highlighted its exclusions and loopholes.</p><p>\"What was approved today in the legislative palace is no amnesty,\" Guanipa <a href=\"https://x.com/JuanPGuanipa/status/2024710922296500571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media after his second release in less than two weeks.</p><p>\"It is a flawed document intended to blackmail many innocent Venezuelans and excludes several brothers and sisters who remain unjustly behind bars.\"</p><p>For Tineo, cases of re-arrest like Guanipa's show that Venezuela is not sincere about ending government repression.</p><p>\"As long as judicial restrictions remain in place for those released and the 'revolving door' practice continues – new detentions following releases – it can’t be said that there is an end to the policy of persecution,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A small portion will come to Gaza so they can say they supported Gaza and justify the continuation of their luxury club called the Board of Peace .”&lt;/ p&gt;</p><p>“So this project is a failure from the start and unclear in vision, like the failure of the aid distribution foundation established by America a year ago, which became death traps for thousands.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326497 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A5988-copy-1771587431.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir al-Balah believes that the Peace Council and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir el-Balah believes that the Board of Peace and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Jamal Abu Makhdeh agrees.</p><p>“They won’t do anything for Gaza. It’s all lies,” the 66-year-old man says. “Anything Israel agrees to certainly won’t be in our interest,” he tells Al Jazeera in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“Trump, together with Israel, wants to use the Board of Peace to impose their decisions on the world by force. This is about power, control, and domination, without regard for weaker nations like us,” he added.</p><p>Over the past two years, reconstruction plans have been discussed after every ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, Israeli restrictions on the entry of construction materials have hindered the full implementation of those pledges.</p><p>“Even if the board decides to rebuild Gaza, this is unlikely and won’t happen. We’ve heard this many times and nothing happened,” he adds.</p><p>“How can we trust a peace board in which Israel is a member? It is the one that killed us, destroyed us, and committed genocide.”</p><p>While Abu Makhdeh insists he is not optimistic about the board’s decisions, he also expresses concern about Trump and Israel’s insistence on disarming Hamas. Under the truce accord, Hamas is required to hand over its weapons.</p><p>“Their main goal is to disarm Hamas so that we drown in internal and civil disputes,” he adds.</p><p>He said he sees talk of peace as deceptive, pointing to ongoing violations in the occupied West Bank, including the destruction of Palestinian houses and property, settlement expansion, and restrictions on normal life, alongside the deepening tragedy in Gaza.</p><p>“There is no optimism in American decisions. This is just media talk.”</p><p>Al-Ghoul expressed cautious optimism over the idea of sending an international peacekeeping force to Gaza.</p><p>“Personally, I hope this force is sent, but it must act as a deterrent to Israel’s continued attacks, like UNIFIL in Lebanon. I don’t imagine Israel would attack a force imposed by a Board of Peace managed by Trump,” he says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326493 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A6017-copy-1771587425.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to Deir al-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza to Deir el-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"reconstruction-the-biggest-absence-in-the-speech\">Reconstruction: The biggest absence in the speech</h2><p>Despite talk of “stability” and “peace”, the board’s announcement did not include any concrete decision on reconstruction in Gaza or its infrastructure destroyed over two years of war.</p><p>For al-Ghoul, reconstruction is not the priority if Israel continues to violate the truce.</p><p>“Reconstruction has no value if Israel’s hand continues destroying and killing.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.</p><p>The majority did not address whether companies could get refunded for the billions they have collectively paid in tariffs. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up for refunds in court, and Kavanaugh noted the process could be complicated.</p><p>“The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument,” he wrote.</p><p>Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera that the court ruling was “definitely a big repudiation of Trump’s tariff agenda and will force him to rely more on other tools, most of which require more public comment period and Congressional authorisation”.</p><p>Friday’s ruling will also, in particular, “rein in Trump’s ability to threaten tariffs against any country for any reason”, Ziemba told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"additional-tariffs\">Additional tariffs</h2><p>Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate, over the next decade, trillions of dollars in revenue for the US, which possesses the world’s largest economy.</p><p>Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since December 14. But Penn Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) stood at more than $175bn. That amount likely would need to be refunded with the Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.</p><p>Ziemba said she expects Congress to support tariffs on China and perhaps approve secondary tariffs, but many other tariffs, like fentanyl tariffs on Canada and Mexico or broad reciprocal tariffs, “are unlikely to pass”.</p><p>Trump described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenceless and ruined without them. In November, he told reporters that without his tariffs, “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.” Trump said the US was abused by other countries, including China, the world’s second-largest economy.</p><p>After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan.”</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.</p><p>Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security, and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against US exporters.</p><p>None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and they may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.</p><p>But, “the administration is likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, [and] the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels,” warned Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. That said, the by-sector and by-country implications could end up looking very different, “which will create another bout of trade policy uncertainty for business, investors, and households. This uncertainty is a key downside risk that could ding, rather than derail, growth this year,” Pearce added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Epstein <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">died by suicide</a> in a United States prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2021, Giuffre sued Mountbatten-Windsor for sexual assault. She claimed she had been forced to have sex with him on multiple occasions when she was 17, a minor under US law. Giuffre <a href=\"/news/2025/4/26/epstein-prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-by-suicide-family\">died by suicide</a> in April last year after reaching a settlement in this case.</p><p>When he was still a prince, Mountbatten-Windsor served as the UK’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, only stepping down when controversy over his links to Epstein intensified. Throughout his time in the role, he faced persistent criticism over his “party prince” image, his conduct on overseas trips, and the cost of his lavish taxpayer‑funded trips and hospitality.</p><p>But Mountbatten-Windsor is far from the first British royal to be engulfed in scandal. In 1936, the monarchy was rocked when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II largely kept the institution steady in the early decades of her reign, but as her children reached adulthood, a new wave of marital crises and personal controversies engulfed the family.</p><p>Here is a closer look at some of the major scandals to have roiled the royals and their reputation in recent decades.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1992-queen-elizabeth-s-annus-horribilis\">1992: Queen Elizabeth’s ‘annus horribilis’</h2><p>During a speech to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession in November 1992, Queen Elizabeth II described the year as her “annus horribilis”, which is Latin for “horrible year”, following a series of scandals.</p><p>Three of her children’s marriages had failed: Then‑Prince of Wales – now King – Charles and Princess Diana separated, as did Mountbatten-Windsor and his wife, Sarah Ferguson. Princess Anne and Mark Phillips got divorced.</p><p>In August 1992, while separated but still married to Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson was photographed on holiday in the south of France with her American financial adviser John Bryan. Bryan was seen kissing her toes, much to the uproar of the general public.</p><p>The same year, a phone call between Diana and her friend, James Gilbey, was leaked and became tabloid fodder. It was believed that the call had been illegally recorded and sold to the media. The intimate and emotional nature of the call led to speculation that Gilbey and Diana were more than friends. On the call, Gilbey called Diana “Squidgy”, and hence the incident became known as “Squidgygate”.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4324805\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"1993-camillagate\">1993: Camillagate</h2><p>An end to the Queen’s “annus horribilis” was not to be.</p><p>Soon after Squidgygate came “Camillagate”. In 1993, the recording of a salacious phone call between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was leaked. The call was from 1989 when Charles and Diana were still married and revealed that Charles and Camilla were in an intimate relationship.</p><p>Public anger over the affair endured for years, but Charles and Camilla eventually married in 2005 and remain married today, with Camilla now serving as Queen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326526\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326526\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-618251936-1771588406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C611&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Charles and Camilla 2005\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles attend a Royal Gala together in 2005, the year they finally married [File: Pool Photograph/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1995-diana-s-panorama-interview\">1995: Diana’s Panorama interview</h2><p>Diana was interviewed by journalist Martin Bashir on the BBC programme Panorama that was broadcast on November 20, 1995.</p><p>During the interview, Diana commented on several controversies, including the relationship between Charles and Camilla. About the affair, she said: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,” which garnered huge public sympathy. She also spoke openly about her mental health struggles – in particular with the condition bulimia nervosa.</p><p>Diana’s candid interview opened the lid on life in the royal family, and she was widely viewed as the “people’s princess” after it was aired.</p><p>Following the interview, Queen Elizabeth II recommended that the couple divorce quickly – the marriage was legally dissolved the following year.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding the interview came under scrutiny more than 20 years later when Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, alleged that Bashir had used false documents and other dishonest tactics to enlist him to persuade Diana to do the interview.</p><p>The BBC appointed a retired senior judge in 2020 to lead an investigation into the matter. A report from the inquiry said Bashir used “deceitful behaviour” and breached BBC rules by mocking up fake bank statements and showing them to Spencer to gain access to the princess.</p><p>In 2021, Princes William and Harry – Diana’s now-grown children – issued a strong criticism of the BBC and British media for what they called unethical practices after the investigation concluded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-52103891-1771587553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C522&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diana, Princess Of Wales, visits The National Children’s Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in February 1995, the year she was interviewed on Panorama [Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1997-death-of-diana\">1997: Death of Diana</h2><p>Two years after the Panorama interview, the princess died aged 36 in a Paris traffic accident as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi photographers.</p><p>On August 30, 1997, a group of paparazzi had camped outside the Ritz hotel in Paris in hopes of obtaining shots of Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. The photographers pursued their car to the Pont de l’Alma tunnel, where their driver lost control and crashed. Both Diana and Fayed were killed.</p><p>The public outpouring of grief over Diana’s death contrasted sharply with what was seen as stony silence from the royal family in the immediate aftermath. The family, including the queen, was strongly criticised for not quickly appearing in public and failing to lower the flag over Buckingham Palace to half-staff.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326520\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326520\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-534249928-1771588216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana death\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners left thousands of bouquets, cards and photographs outside Kensington Palace to mark the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 [File: Ralf-Finn Hestoft/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"2002-princess-anne-s-criminal-conviction\">2002: Princess Anne’s criminal conviction</h2><p>In November 2002, Princess Anne, the Queen’s only daughter, pleaded guilty to losing control of her dog, an English bull terrier, who then proceeded to bite two children in Windsor Great Park.</p><p>Anne was fined and became the first working royal in modern times to have a criminal record.</p><h2 id=\"2005-prince-harry-s-nazi-costume\">2005: Prince Harry’s Nazi costume</h2><p>Photos of Prince Harry wearing a Nazi armband at a costume party in 2005 caused global outrage and forced him to issue a public apology.</p><p>In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Harry claimed that his older brother, the now-Prince of Wales William and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Kate Middleton had encouraged the choice of outfit and “howled” with laughter when they saw it.</p><h2 id=\"2020-megxit\">2020: Megxit</h2><p>After years of rising tensions with the media, Prince Harry and his wife, the former actor Meghan Markle – now styled the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – announced plans to quit their senior royal duties, move part-time to North America, seek financial independence and withdraw from regular media scrutiny.</p><p>The couple believed that Meghan’s lack of popularity in the UK was down to the mostly negative media coverage she received from the British press. Rumours were also rife that they clashed with other members of the royal family.</p><p>In 2021, the couple appeared on television with Oprah Winfrey, and Harry revealed a rift with his father and brother.</p><p>Meghan described feeling so isolated and miserable inside the royal family that she had suicidal thoughts and said a member of the family had voiced “concerns” about the colour of her unborn child’s skin.
