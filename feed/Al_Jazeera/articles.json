It then spread to other provinces of Iran.</p><p>On Monday, the rial was trading at more than 1.4 million to $1, a sharp decline from around 700,000 a year earlier in January 2025 and around 900,000 in mid-2025. The plummeting currency has triggered steep inflation, with food prices an average of 72 percent higher than last year. Annual inflation is currently around 40 percent.</p><p>Iran’s economy is ailing for several reasons. The country fought a 12-day war with Israel in June 2025, which resulted in infrastructural damage in several Iranian cities.</p><p>Additionally, in September 2025, the United Nations re-imposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme when the UN Security Council <a href=\"/news/2025/9/19/un-security-council-rejects-resolution-to-extend-iran-sanctions-relief\">voted against</a> permanently lifting economic sanctions on Iran.</p><p>In December, Iran introduced a new tier in its national fuel subsidy system, effectively raising the price of what had been some of the world’s cheapest petrol or gasoline and adding to the financial strain on households.</p><p>Officials will now reassess fuel prices every three months, opening the door to further hikes. At the same time, food prices are set to climb after the Central Bank recently scrapped a preferential, subsidised dollar-rial rate for all imports except medicine and wheat.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If only the government, instead of just focusing on fuel, could bring down the price of other goods,” taxi driver Majid Ebrahimi <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2026/1/1/how-far-will-the-latest-protests-go-in-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told</a> Al Jazeera in late December. “The prices of dairy products have gone up six times this year and other goods more than 10 times.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While chants by protesters initially focused on the ailing economy, they have switched to opposition to the clerical establishment in Iran. Some protesters have also begun chanting in support of <a href=\"/features/2026/1/12/who-is-reza-pahlavi-the-exiled-prince-urging-iranians-to-seize\">Reza Pahlavi</a>, the exiled son of deposed Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the heir to the former Pahlavi monarchy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Many supporters of Pahlavi are calling for a return to the monarchy, although Pahlavi himself says he favours holding a referendum to determine what type of government structure Iranians want.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran’s prime minister who was democratically elected in 1951, nationalised the British-controlled oil industry in Iran, he was overthrown in a 1953 coup backed by the US and the United Kingdom to secure Western oil interests. A repressive royal rule was reinstated until 1979, when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, fled the country as the Islamic revolution took hold. He died in Egypt in 1980.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“There were chants in his [Pahlavi’s] support on the streets of Iran among other chants in this round of protests,” Maryam Alemzadeh, an associate professor in the history and politics of Iran at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Demands for democracy and opposition to the Islamic government’s strict laws have been building for some time, especially since the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in police custody in 2022.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2022, <a href=\"/news/2022/9/23/iran-morality-police-root-cause-iranian-protest-anger-explainer\">Amini</a> was arrested in Tehran by Iran’s notorious morality police for alleged non-compliance with Iran’s strict dress code. She was taken to a re-education centre where she collapsed. She died in hospital a few days later.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"where-are-the-protests-happening\" dir=\"ltr\">Where are the protests happening?</h2><p>The initial protests were staged by shopkeepers in Tehran angered by rising prices. However, protests have now become more widespread. A large, fragmented opposition base is emerging both inside Iran and within Iranian diaspora communities in other countries.</p><p>Iran’s Fars News Agency said “limited” demonstrations were held on Sunday night in Tehran’s Navvab and Saadat Abad neighbourhoods.</p><p>Protesters also gathered in the cities of Hafshejan and Junqan in the southwestern province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and a separate rally took place in Taybad county in the northeastern province of Razavi Khorasan.</p><p>Fars reported that security forces moved in and broke up those gatherings, while the rest of the country’s cities and provinces remained calm overnight.</p><p>Protests have also spread to other countries where there are significant Iranian communities, including the US, UK, Germany, France, Turkiye, and Pakistan, in solidarity with the protesters in Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-many-people-have-died-in-the-protests\">How many people have died in the protests?</h2><p>More than <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2026/1/11/iran-says-dozens-of-officers-killed-as-protesters-defy-government-crackdown\">100 security personnel</a> have been killed in recent days, state media has reported, while opposition activists say the death toll is higher and includes hundreds of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/several-killed-as-iran-protests-over-rising-cost-of-living-spread\">protesters</a>.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify these figures.</p><p>Experts fear that the death toll could be far higher. “Minimal news that makes it out of the total internet shutdown signifies that thousands of citizens might have been killed by government forces,” Alemzadeh said.</p><h2 id=\"is-the-internet-down\">Is the internet down?</h2><p>Iran’s internet blackout entered its fourth day on Monday, according to watchdog NetBlocks.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the internet was actively blocked by the government. However, in a post on social media on Thursday, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/iran-experiencing-nationwide-internet-blackout-monitor-says\">NetBlocks said</a> the blackout follows “a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public’s right to communicate at a critical moment”.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told foreign diplomats in Tehran on Monday that the internet would soon be restored in Iran, adding that the government was coordinating with the security establishment on the issue.</p><p>The foreign minister said connectivity would also be restored to embassies and government ministries.</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-involved-in-the-protests\">Is the US involved in the protests?</h2><p>Since protests began in December, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that Washington could intervene militarily in Iran if there is a violent crackdown.</p><p>Araghchi alleged that <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/12/iran-protests-live-us-rhetoric-rises-as-tehran-announces-3-days-mourning\">nationwide protests</a> have “turned violent and bloody to give an excuse” for Trump to intervene militarily.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He added that Trump’s warning of military action against Tehran should ‌protests turn ‌violent had motivated “terrorists” ⁠to target protesters and security forces ‌to encourage foreign intervention. “We are ready for war but also for dialogue,” he said.</p><p>Araghchi also said that the Iranian authorities have gathered video footage of weapons being distributed to protesters, adding that they will soon release confessions from detainees.</p><p>The demonstrations had been “stoked and fuelled” by foreign elements, he said, noting security forces would “hunt down” those responsible.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Alemzadeh said an uprising could escalate in Iran if protesters’ demands are not addressed.</p><p>“Protesters have been faced with repression that is unprecedented in brutality, even with the Islamic Republic’s notorious standard,” she said.</p><p>She added: “The grievances, however, are not going to be quieted this time around.”</p><p>Alemzadeh said that life for many in Iran has become intolerable under the current economic conditions, which many see as caused by corruption, mismanagement and international sanctions. Additionally, Iranians have been denied freedom of speech and lifestyle for decades, she added.</p><p>“Even if this round of protests is repressed by extreme violence, another could emerge in no time until a radical shift occurs,” she said.</p><p>“This might be initiated domestically by factions of the political elite, by marginalising [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and destroying the oligarchic economy, effectively abandoning the ‘Islamic’ part of the republic and its beneficiaries, or through US/Israeli intervention, which is likely to lead to chaos and more – but perhaps different – grievances for Iranians.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The operation comes after the last SDF fighters left Aleppo on Sunday following a ceasefire deal that allowed <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/11/sdf-fighters-withdraw-from-syrian-city-of-aleppo-after-days-of-fighting\">evacuations</a> from the Ashrafieh and Sheikh Maqsoud neighbourhoods to parts of northeastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led forces run a semi-autonomous zone.</p><p>The intense fighting that erupted last week was linked to stalled negotiations over the integration of Kurdish-run institutions and SDF fighters into the Syrian state following an <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/syria-merges-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-into-state-institutions\">agreement</a> reached between both sides in March last

and broken glass littering the streets on Sunday.</p><p>“Most people are returning to Ashrafieh, and they have begun to rebuild as there has been a lot of destruction,” said Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Aleppo.</p><p>He added that this was not the case for Sheikh Maqsoud, where government forces were still searching for explosives.</p><p>Smith added that Syrian forces were also looking for opposition prisoners arrested by the SDF during the rule of former leader Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown in December 2024 by forces led by the incumbent, Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p><h2

people in Aleppo”.</p><p>Abdi, in his statement, called on “the mediators to abide by their promises to stop the violations”.</p><p>US envoy Tom Barrack met al-Sharaa on Saturday and afterwards issued a call for a “return to dialogue” in accordance with the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/12/integration-of-armed-factions-remains-one-of-syrias-biggest-challenges\">integration</a> agreement.</p><p>The departure of the fighters marks the removal of SDF from pockets of Aleppo, which it has held since Syria’s war began in 2011.</p><p>“Even though the SDF has been bussed to its stronghold in northeastern Syria, this has still played out well for the government in Damascus,” said Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from the capital, calling it a “strategic victory” for Syria’s new

The STC along with the PLC fought against the Houthis, who control northwest of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.</p><p>On Friday, the STC was dissolved, and its leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, fled the country after forces loyal to the PLC took control of most of the south and eastern Yemen.</p><p>The future of the STC, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, remains uncertain amid internal divisions and the exile of its leader.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is now planning to host a conference of the main political factions from the south to shape the future of Yemen.</p><p>So what’s the latest political and security situation in Yemen, and what are the challenges in uniting Yemen?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-did-the-plc-chief-al-alimi-say\">What did the PLC chief al-Alimi say?</h2><p>In his televised address on Saturday, al-Alimi called on all parties to unite ranks to restore state institutions.</p><p>He announced the formation of a Supreme Military Committee, which has been tasked with preparing military forces for the next phase of the conflict and readying them if the Houthis reject peaceful solutions.</p><p>The Yemeni leader warned armed groups to surrender their weapons and rejoin the ranks of the state, underlining “the importance of strengthening security, protecting social peace and working closely with the [governing] coalition and the international community to combat terrorism”.</p><p>He accused the Houthis of refusing to engage in dialogue and blamed the Iran-linked group for prolonging Yemen’s suffering because of their “coup against constitutional legitimacy”.</p><p>“South Yemen has for the first time in 10 years one political and military authority. No more military factions, no more divisions over ethnic and sectarian lines for the time being. There is going to be one Supreme Military Committee under the control of President Al-Alimi,” Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“Rashad al-Alimi has told the Houthis that they have two options: negotiate a settlement or face repercussions, including the potential for a military offensive,” he said.</p><p>Al-Alimi is a successor of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the leader of a United Nations-backed government who was evicted by the Houthis in 2014. The Houthis insist they are the legitimate authority across Yemen and do not recognise the PLC, which was formed in 2022.</p><p>“Now the PLC, backed by Saudi Arabia, is reforming institutions, disbanding STC institutions, and they are saying that their focus in the near future would be confrontation with the Houthis,” Ahelbarra said.</p><p>The president said the issue of self-determination in southern Yemen would remain a top priority, backing a southern dialogue conference under Saudi Arabia’s sponsorship.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-status-of-the-stc\">What’s the status of the STC?</h2><p>As the Saudi-backed military campaign against STC forces intensified in Hadramout and al-Mahra provinces, the southern separatist movement announced plans to hold a referendum on independence from the north on January 2.</p><p>But days later, the southern separatist force suffered major territorial losses at the hands of the PLC forces, who expanded their control over most of southern Yemen, where the STC had sway for more than a decade. The group’s now-exiled leader remains defiant, but some of its other leaders have switched loyalties.</p><p>On Friday, STC Secretary-General Abdulrahman Jalal al-Subaihi said in a broadcast on Yemeni television that the dissolution of the group was taken to preserve peace and security in the south and in neighbouring countries.</p><p>He praised “the measures taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the solutions it has provided that meet the needs of the people of the South”.</p><p>However, STC spokesman Anwar al-Tamimi, who is in Abu Dhabi, rejected the announcement coming out of Saudi Arabia, calling it “ridiculous news”.</p><p>On Saturday, thousands of STC supporters poured onto the streets of Aden, the capital of anti-Houthi forces in southern Yemen.</p><p>“The STC members who joined Riyadh say they are waiting to see what happens next when it comes to details of the Riyadh conference,” Ahelbarra said, referring to talks between the PLC and STC in the Saudi capital.</p><p>“I think the consensus is that everybody is willing to talk about federal system, some sort of autonomy. But the very notion of separatism is over.</p><p>“Will people in the south willing to accept the notion of autonomy or federalism, that remains to be seen,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The disenfranchisement of southern Yemen after the region was merged with the north to form a united Yemen in 1990 has also been one of the grievances.</p><p>“Al-Alimi said these are genuine concerns which are going to be taken into account at the conference. Whether he will be able to address some of those concerns remains to be seen,” the Al Jazeera correspondent said. The date of the conference is yet to be announced.</p><p>Since its formation in 2017, the STC’s goal has been separation from the rest of Yemen. Two years later, it took control of Aden and other areas in the south from the Yemeni government.</p><p>Al-Zubaidi later joined the PLC as vice president, but he continued to nurse the ambition for a “two-state solution” as STC fighters continued to expand their control in the south, weakening the fight against the Houthis.</p><p>The current conflict was triggered after the STC forces captured Hadramout and al-Mahra, drawing the Saudi intervention.</p><p>Al-Zubaidi has since been removed from his post as a PLC member, stripped of his immunity, and charged with “high treason” and “inciting internal strife”.</p><p>The Saudi military said in a statement on Thursday that al-Zubaidi fled by boat to Somalia and then flew to Abu Dhabi.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-recent-weeks\">What happened in recent weeks?</h2><p>In November, a Saudi-backed umbrella group of tribes from the Hadramout region seized the PetroMasila oil facility, seeking a bigger share of oil revenues and an improvement of services for Hadramout residents.</p><p>The STC used the seizure as a pretext for advancing in Hadramout and al-Mahra. These two regions hold nearly all of Yemen’s oil reserves.</p><p>Tensions soared after Saudi-backed forces attacked the Yemeni port city of Mukalla in the south, alleging incoming shipments of arms from the UAE for the STC.</p><p>The UAE said it had been surprised by the Saudi air strikes and the shipments in question did not contain weapons and were destined for Emirati forces, not the STC.</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Yemen’s Saudi-backed government had taken control of the south and east of the country from STC forces.</p><p>Hesham Alghannam, a Saudi scholar with the Malcolm H Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, said the kingdom’s move “made it very clear” that it views Yemen’s eastern provinces, especially Hadramout, as a “core national security matter”.</p><p>Riyadh views the region as critical, Alghannam said, because of its geography and strategic oil and port assets. “From Riyadh’s view, losing influence there would be more than a local setback,” he told Al Jazeera. “It would create a major security gap. It would weaken energy resilience and open space for hostile or competing powers to position themselves directly south of the kingdom.”</p><p>The Saudi-backed governing coalition then asked the UAE to withdraw its forces from Yemen within 24 hours.</p><p>The UAE withdrew all its “counterterrorism” units from Yemen. The UAE’s Ministry of Defence said it carried out a “comprehensive assessment” of its role in Yemen and decided to end its mission there.</p><p>The episode has strained ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4233543\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4233543\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4233543\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-07T144447Z_1620937072_RC2AWIAZTFA3_RTRMADP_3_YEMEN-SECURITY-1768223677.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yemen\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4233543\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Giants Forces, which were part of the STC, have switched sides throwing their weight behind the PLC [Fawaz Salman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2><p>The STC will find it hard to bounce back without military support from the UAE while many of its leaders have shown a willingness to participate in the Saudi-led dialogue.</p><p>However, it is believed to still hold influence in the region.</p><p>Abdulaziz Alghashian, an adjunct professor at Naif Arab University, said the dissolution of the STC was inevitable.</p><p>“I think the legacy of the STC has now become just too poisonous. I think the recent developments have just illustrated the fact that there is probably no goodwill for the STC to be part of a genuine political process,” Alghashian told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The dissolution of the STC suggests clearly there is a clear restructuring of the political process within Yemen. And the political framework that Saudi Arabia is trying to work with is also being redeveloped and restructured in a manner that creates a lot of confidence for Saudi to get involved in,” he said.</p><p>But some experts said the Saudi goal of a united Yemen would be difficult to achieve due to southern divisions and the Houthis’ control of northwest Yemen.</p><p>Yousef Mawry, a journalist based in Sanaa, said Yemen’s conflict will shift from the south to the north and a showdown is expected between PLC forces and the Houthis.</p><p>He added that both sides believe in a unified Yemeni state but each side believes they are the ones who should be ruling over the affairs of both the north and the south.</p><p>“The big question: Is there a common ground that al-Alimi’s government and the Houthis can agree on?” he said.</p><p>“The Houthis believe that al-Alimi’s government is nothing but a Saudi proxy that is working on behalf of the US and Saudi interests over Yemeni land. Al-Alimi has pointed fingers at the Houthis, accusing them of being an Iranian proxy,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The Saudi-led military coalition, which included the UAE, intervened in support of Hadi’s UN-recognised government in 2015 but failed to defeat the Houthis. The war ended in a deadlock with the Houthis still in control of Sanaa and the regions around it.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the Houthis agreed to release prisoners and pledged not to attack each other’s territory. But the larger political questions remain to be resolved.</p><p>“What we are seeing is that al-Alimi is taking over full control of the south. Once they have full control, whatever political framework that works in, the Houthis are not going to accept it,” Mawry said.</p><p>There is mistrust between the two sides with the Houthis accusing the PLC of catering to the interests of foreign powers while the PLC accuses the Houthis of running Iranian propaganda. Saudi Arabia has historically maintained influence in its southern neighbour – Arab region’s poorest country. Houthis challenged Riyadh’s traditional role in the country.</p><p>Mawry fears the conflict will likely grow as both sides have drawn red lines. “They want full control of Yemen,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last week, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s tripartite presidency approved the participation of Bosnian troops in the international stabilisation mission in Gaza. The decision was a rare instance of interethnic consensus, which has been ostensibly missing since the end of the Bosnian War in the 1990s.</p><p>The mission was authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted on November 17, based on United States President Donald Trump’s controversial plan to end the genocidal war in Gaza. The resolution allows for the deployment of international forces to oversee demilitarisation and the destruction of military infrastructure, and to help legitimise a transitional governance arrangement for the enclave.</p><p>It is clear that the plan favours Israel and is meant to assist it in further consolidating its occupation of Palestinian territory. The question is, why would a country that itself has experienced a genocide and has seen regular protests condemning the one in Gaza decide to participate in such a mission?</p><h2 id=\"popular-solidarity-with-gaza\">Popular solidarity with Gaza</h2><p>Few societies in Europe identify with Palestinian suffering as viscerally as the Bosnian society does. In a December 2023 survey, 61 percent of respondents said Bosnia should support Palestine. Among Bosniaks, the percentage of those who felt solidarity with the Palestinian cause was even higher; Croats and Serbs were split between backing Israel, Palestine and neutrality.</p><p>In Sarajevo, support for Gaza is more than evident. For the past two years, thousands have taken to the streets of the capital in regular protests condemning Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. International brands such as Zara and US fast-food chains like KFC, Burger King, and Coca-Cola have been boycotted.</p><p>Every week, people gather near Sarajevo’s Eternal Flame memorial to read aloud the names of Palestinian children killed in Gaza — a quiet, devastating ritual of remembrance.</p><p>In October, nearly 6,000 people marched through Sarajevo under the banner “Bosnia and Herzegovina for a Free Palestine”, beginning at the Monument to the Murdered Children of Besieged Sarajevo and ending near the National Museum. Demonstrators held Palestinian flags and banners reading “Stop the Genocide” and “Stop Killing Children”. The message was clear: a society that survived siege and genocide believes it has a moral obligation to stand with Gaza.</p><p>The most striking aspect of this display of solidarity is who has joined it. The most sustained and visible support for Gaza has come not from Bosnia’s Islamic religious institutions or mainstream political parties, but from civic-minded, often left-leaning intellectuals, artists, students and grassroots activists.</p><p>In fact, the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina has not organised mass marches or nationwide mobilisations, nor have Bosniak Muslim political parties. Instead, the streets have been filled with ordinary citizens — many secular, many young — driven less by formal religious affiliation than by an ethical reflex shaped by the lived experience of siege, displacement and mass violence.</p><p>Equally revealing has been the absence of groups that explicitly frame their identity around religious solidarity. Salafi communities in Bosnia, who are frequently vocal on questions of ritual observance and doctrinal purity, remained largely outside public mobilisation on Gaza. Their engagement has rarely extended beyond sermons, online statements, or symbolic gestures.</p><p>In Bosnia’s case, solidarity with Gaza emerged not as an expression of organised religiosity, but as a bottom-up, civic response rooted in memory, empathy, and a broadly shared sense of justice.</p><p>So what prompted the tripartite presidency to agree on participation in a mission meant to support Israel when Bosnian citizens overwhelmingly show solidarity with the Palestinians?</p><h2 id=\"dysfunction-and-dependence\">Dysfunction and dependence</h2><p>To understand Bosnian politics, it is important to highlight the source of its dysfunction: the overly complicated governance system based on ethnic identity, which the Dayton Accords established in 1995.</p><p>Bosnia has a tripartite presidency, which rotates every eight months between one Bosniak, one Serb, and one Croat member. Each member is elected by plurality, not majority, from within their ethnic group, which reinforces zero-sum ethnic politics rather than consensus. The Bosnian Parliament also has ethnic quotas.</p><p>Decisions are supposed to be made by consensus, which is absent most of the time, leading to gridlock. As a result, this overly complex system often cannot take decisions as simple as approving the state budget. So how is it that it reached consensus on a peacekeeping deployment in Gaza?</p><p>It is also important to point out that Bosnia has participated in international peacekeeping missions before. Since the mid-2000s, the country has regularly contributed troops, military police, medical personnel and staff officers to NATO-, UN- and European Union-led missions abroad, most notably in Afghanistan, but also in Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, South Sudan and Cyprus.</p><p>These deployments have functioned as symbolic gestures, promoted by influential international organisations based in Sarajevo – the UN, EU, and NATO – to signal Bosnia’s supposed transition from a net consumer to a net provider of security. At the same time, they served as a convenient vehicle for these organisations to showcase an ostensibly successful state-building narrative to their international donors.</p><p>In the case of the Gaza peace mission, the leaders of Bosnia’s ethnic elites may see participation as a way to curry favour with Washington for their own ends. Bosniak leaders still view the US as the ultimate guarantor of Bosnia’s territorial integrity, while Croat elites see US backing as leverage in dealings with the EU. Serb leaders, despite their anti-Western rhetoric, have invested heavily in US lobbying firms to court Trump’s attention and seek the removal of top Serb figures from US sanctions lists.</p><p>This dependence underscores Bosnia’s constrained sovereignty, where foreign policy often signals loyalty abroad rather than a coherent national strategy at home.</p><p>But for many Bosnians, Gaza is not an abstract security problem; it is a moral mirror — one that reflects their own unresolved trauma.</p><p>While public sentiment is driven by empathy and solidarity, leaders across all three camps approach Gaza primarily through the prism of political convenience. The result is a familiar pattern in Bosnian politics: policy reflects narrow elite interests rather than popular will.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They are mainly leaders who are living in exile or members of the Iranian diaspora.</p><p>Groups in other countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, have started to rally on the streets in solidarity with the protesters in Iran.</p><h2 id=\"why-don-t-the-protests-have-clear-leaders\">Why don’t the protests have clear leaders?</h2><p>Iran currently lacks a uniform opposition group which could form a government, Shahram Akbarzadeh, a professor in Middle East and Central Asian politics at Australia’s Deakin University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Opposition groups in Iran and outside are disjointed and have different aims. Some have clear leaders while others do not. No individual inside Iran, however, has emerged as a clear opposition leader in the ongoing protest movement.</p><p>A possible reason for this is that opposition members are fearful of reprisals if they have identifiable leaders.</p><p>Iran’s “Green Movement” in June 2009 was a spontaneous mass demonstration by white collar workers, women’s rights activists and civil society activists against the officially declared victory of <a href=\"/opinions/2013/9/25/rafsanjani-and-khamenei-the-ahmadinejad-years\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> in perhaps the most publicly contested presidential election in the history of the country. The day after these protests began, Ahmadinejad and his supporters staged an official demonstration in support of his declared victory. He served as president until 2013.</p><p>Ahmadinejad had been president since 2005. He was a hardline conservative, controversial for some of his opinions, including repeatedly denying the Holocaust.</p><p>The 2009 presidential election was also contested by former Prime Minister Mir‑Hossein Mousavi, who became a symbolic leader of the Green Movement. Since February 2011, however, he has been held under strict house arrest for rejecting the official election results.</p><p>Another candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist Muslim scholar and former parliament speaker, also took a leading role in challenging the election results and supporting the protests. He was placed under house arrest in 2011.</p><p>In March last year, the Iranian authorities officially lifted Karroubi’s house arrest.</p><p>Neither man is thought to be a focus of the current protests, but as a result of their examples, Iranian protesters inside the country tend not to organise themselves around a single, identifiable leader.</p><p>In line with other protest movements around the world, protesters inside Iran increasingly rely on networked organising. Mobilisation through student groups, social media platforms such as Discord and neighbourhood networks has resulted in the creation of numerous local groups and local leaders rather than just one or two central figureheads.</p><p>This was recently seen in the “Gen Z” youth protests in Nepal, which took place in September, and the youth protests in Bangladesh, which took place in July 2024 and resulted in the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p><p>“[The] Iranian government has actively and effectively suppressed any attempt for organised opposition at home over the past decades and arrested and silenced its leaders,” Maryam Alemzadeh, an associate professor in the history and politics of Iran at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera. “Even nonpolitical NGOs, unions, student groups and anything that could resemble a bottom-up order has been quashed.</p><p>“As a result, neither leadership nor grassroots organisation can be expected, and protests are left contingent on ad hoc individual or collective decisions of the protesters.”</p><h2 id=\"which-are-the-different-groups-among-the-opposition\">Which are the different groups among the opposition?</h2><p>Besides the mass-organised movements going on inside Iran now, there are some other opposition groups based both inside and outside the country.</p><h3 id=\"reza-pahlavi-and-the-monarchists\">Reza Pahlavi and the monarchists</h3><p><a href=\"/features/2026/1/12/who-is-reza-pahlavi-the-exiled-prince-urging-iranians-to-seize\">Pahlavi</a>, 65, is the son of the deposed shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the heir of the former Pahlavi monarchy.</p><p>After Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran’s prime minister who was democratically elected in 1951, nationalised the British-controlled oil industry in Iran, he was overthrown in a 1953 coup backed by the United States and UK to reverse that move and secure Western oil interests. A repressive royal rule was reinstated until 1979 when the last shah fled the country as the Iranian Revolution took hold. He died in Egypt in 1980.</p><p>Living in exile in the US, his son now leads a prominent monarchist movement known as the Iran National Council but claims not to be insisting on a return to a monarchy. Instead, he says he advocates for a secular, democratic system to be decided by a referendum.</p><p>However, Pahlavi is supported by members of the Iranian diaspora and groups that do support the return of a monarchy. He is strongly opposed by other opposition groups, including republicans and leftists, so Iran’s opposition remains fragmented.</p><p>Many people who currently live in Iran do not remember the era of the monarchy. While some Iranians who do view the pre-revolutionary era with nostalgia, many others remember it for its inequality and repression.</p><p>Alemzadeh said Pahlavi emerged as the most prominent opposition leader in the aftermath of the Woman, Life, Freedom protest movement, which began in 2022.</p><p>“He enjoys support within [the] Iranian diaspora, especially the generation that left Iran with the 1979 revolution, like himself, but in parts of the younger generation as well. He does have some appeal in Iran as well, as there were chants in his support on the streets of Iran among other chants in this round of protests, but the extent of it is debated.”</p><p>Pahlavi’s appeal, she added, stems less from any credible plan or leadership of the protests than from years of nostalgic promotion by diaspora media and social media campaigns that have elevated him as the “loudest available alternative” amid widespread frustration and a lack of other visible leaders.</p><p>“Aided by an online campaign on social media, which was also assisted by Israel, according to Haaretz, Reza Pahlavi was then highlighted as the key to return to that ideal past,” Alemzadeh said.</p><p>She added that although Pahlavi is the best‑known opposition figure, there is little evidence he has a realistic plan or organisational base to manage the security apparatus, entrenched corruption, remaining government supporters and basic state functions in a post-Islamic Republic Iran.</p><p>“Calling for Pahlavi’s return is a nostalgic reaction to the economic and diplomatic deadlock created by the Islamic regime. It is more about rejecting the rule of the clergy, than calling for the restoration of the monarchy,” Akbarzadeh from Deakin University told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4233118\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4233118\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4233118\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-11T173239Z_1109333539_RC25ZIACC28L_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-BRITAIN-1768209573.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C520&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pahlavi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4233118\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters in London display images of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran, as they support the nationwide protests in Iran on January 11, 2026 [Isabel Infantes/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"maryam-rajavi-and-the-people-s-mujahideen-organisation\">Maryam Rajavi and the People’s Mujahideen Organisation</h3><p>The Mujahideen was a powerful leftist group that carried out bombing campaigns against the shah’s government and US targets in the 1970s but eventually fell out with other groups.</p><p>It is often known by its Persian name, the Mujahideen-e Khalq Organisation, or by the acronyms MEK or MKO.</p><p>Many Iranians, including sworn enemies of the Islamic Republic, say they cannot forgive the group for siding with Iraq against Iran during the 1980-1988 war.</p><p>The group was the first to publicly reveal in 2002 that Iran had a secret uranium-enrichment programme.</p><p>However, the Mujahideen has shown little sign of any active presence inside Iran for years.</p><p>In exile, first in France and later in Iraq, its leader, Massoud Rajavi, has not been seen for more than 20 years and his wife, Maryam Rajavi, has taken control.

With these additions, Greater Jerusalem under Israeli control will reach 246sq km [95sq miles], 4.5 percent … of the West Bank’s area, aiming to abort any possibility of establishing a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"encirclement-of-the-old-city\">Encirclement of the Old City</h2><p>In parallel, the “Nahalat Shimon” plan in Sheikh Jarrah targets the historic “Holy Basin” area north of the Old City.</p><p>“This falls under the old-new Israeli efforts to expand the settlement ring around the Old City,” Khalilieh said.</p><p>The goal, he argued, is to dismantle geographical continuity between Palestinian neighbourhoods like Silwan, the Mount of Olives, and Sheikh Jarrah, transforming them into “isolated population islands”.</p><p>“Today, the takeover of the Old City has begun through this ring … aiming to empty these areas gradually through intensified demolitions.”</p><h2 id=\"silent-transfer\">‘Silent transfer’</h2><p>Khalilieh warned that Israel is using neutral planning terms like “urban renewal” and “land settlement” to camouflage a policy of forced displacement.</p><p>“Development for Israelis means demolishing Palestinian homes under the guise of ‘building without a permit’,” he said, noting that more than 300 Palestinian homes were demolished in East Jerusalem in 2025 alone.</p><p>He also pointed to the unification of the <a href=\"https://aje.io/bnt94\">“Arnona” property tax</a>, which forces residents of neglected Palestinian neighbourhoods to pay the high rates as those in affluent Israeli areas.</p><p>“This puts them under cumulative pressure to leave Jerusalem … it constitutes a silent forced transfer.”</p><h2 id=\"is-it-too-late\">Is it too late?</h2><p>Khalilieh stressed that legal and diplomatic intervention must happen “before construction begins”, as reversing facts on the ground is politically “nearly impossible”.</p><p>He called for activating provisional measures at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and targeting international companies involved in the projects.</p><p>“The problem, first and last, is a political dilemma, not a legal one,” he concluded. “Early intervention is crucial … to freeze these projects until the political situation can be addressed.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have not done anything yet,” Regragui insisted after the quarterfinal win.</p><p>Captain and current African Player of the Year Achraf Hakimi is fit again after injury, and in Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, scorer of five goals in five games, they have probably the tournament’s outstanding player.</p><p>“He can become the best player in the world if he wants to,” remarked Regragui after the Cameroon game.</p><p>Regragui has angrily <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/morocco-coach-angrily-rejects-afcon-ref-bias-ahead-of-semifinals\">rejected</a> suggestions his team is benefitting from favourable refereeing decisions as the hosts.</p><p>“We’re the team to beat. As the team to beat, people will try to find all sorts of reasons to say Morocco has an advantage,” Regragui said after his team’s win over Cameroon.</p><p>“The only advantage that Morocco has at this Africa Cup is playing in front of 65,000 spectators. The rest is on the field, we speak on the field.”</p><p>Morocco are Africa’s leading power right now and, unlike Nigeria, are gearing up for the FIFA World Cup 2026.</p><p>The Atlas Lions recently won the <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/18/tannane-halfway-line-goal-sends-morocco-on-way-to-fifa-arab-cup-2025-title\">FIFA Arab Cup 2025</a> in Qatar, but their AFCON record down the years has been underwhelming. This is their first semifinal since 2004, when they lost the final to Tunisia.</p><p>Going further back, Morocco beat Nigeria en route to lifting the trophy in 1976 – half a century on, that remains their only continental title.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"can-improved-nigeria-stop-morocco-s-march\">Can ‘improved’ Nigeria stop Morocco’s march?</h2><p>Nigeria returned to Morocco with much to prove after a penalty shootout defeat by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a November playoff in Rabat ended their hopes of World Cup qualification.</p><p>There might be 10 African countries participating in the World Cup, and it is remarkable that Nigeria, despite their footballing pedigree and the largest population on the continent, will not be among them.</p><p>However, their performances over the last three weeks have shown that to be an anomaly.</p><p>Nigeria were runners-up at the last AFCON in 2024. Led by two former African Players of the Year in Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, they are this tournament’s top scorers with 14 goals.</p><p>So what has changed from the failed World Cup qualifying campaign?</p><p>“Nothing,” said coach Eric Chelle, appointed exactly a year ago. “This is the same team. The difference is just that they have improved because they know what I want.”</p><p>Nigeria’s masked Galatasaray striker Osimhen had gone seven AFCON matches without finding the net before scoring against Tunisia in the group stage. He now has four in his last four matches.</p><p><a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/impressive-nigeria-beat-algeria-2-0-to-set-up-afcon-semifinal-with-morocco\">Nigeria</a> are also the tournament’s top scorers overall with 14 goals in total.</p><p>Shocks have been effectively non-existent at this AFCON, but Nigeria’s presence means four of the five top-ranked African teams are in the semis – the exception is Algeria, beaten by the Super Eagles on Saturday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"salah-s-last-shot-at-afcon-glory\">Salah’s last shot at AFCON glory?</h2><p>Even if the hosts power past the Super Eagles, their final challenge will not get any easier.</p><p>The tournament’s other semifinal, also scheduled for Wednesday, in Tangier between Egypt and Senegal, is a repeat of the 2022 final, which the Lions of Teranga won on penalties.</p><p><a href=\"/sports/2026/1/9/senegal-beat-mali-to-book-first-afcon-2025-semifinal-spot\">Senegal</a>, ranked second in Africa and 19th in the world, were seen as the biggest threat to Morocco before the tournament and stand one game away from a third final appearance in four editions.</p><p>They have an experienced side, which includes Mane, who will come up against his old Liverpool teammate, Salah.</p><p>Their presence means the last five players to win the African Player of the Year prize are all in the semifinals.</p><p>Salah, who, like Osimhen, has four goals at the tournament, has never won AFCON, having twice been a losing finalist.</p><p>He came to Morocco having fallen from favour at his club, but seems to have found happiness again with his national team as he looks to fire Egypt to a record-extending eighth title.</p><p>“I have won almost every honour, but this is the one I am waiting for,” said Salah after the <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/salah-seals-egypt-win-against-holders-ivory-coast-to-reach-afcon-2025-semis\">quarterfinal win</a> over the Ivory Coast, before insisting the Pharaohs are now the outsiders.</p><p>“We are coming up against really good teams, most of whose players are based in Europe, which makes it easier for them.</p><p>“We have very good players, but most play in Egypt. We have three players playing abroad, but all of them are in a difficult situation – none of them are playing for their clubs just now,” he added, with a nod to his own problems at Anfield.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
