Soon, American traders had also turned to opium to boost their own exports to China.</p><p>In 1839, Chinese forces attempted to crack down on the inflow of opium, confiscating and destroying it and marking the beginning of the First Opium War. The British and Chinese engaged in naval conflict and the British emerged victorious in 1842. While the US did not militarily engage in the war, American traders were active in China and brought limited amounts of opium from Turkiye and India.</p><p>In 1844, the US and China signed the Treaty of Wanghia, their first treaty together. While this treaty ostensibly outlawed the opium trade, in practice, it opened up five ports for Western-Chinese trade in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai, enabling US traders to expand their sales of opium.</p><p>The Second Opium War took place 20 years later, from 1856 to 1860. French and British forces fought with diplomatic assistance from Russia and protection from American forces. Under pressure, China was forced to sign a treaty legalising opium, one of Britain’s main demands.</p><h3 id=\"1960s-1970s-in-laos-during-the-vietnam-war\">1960s-1970s: In Laos during the Vietnam War</h3><p>Between 1955 and 1975, the US was engaged in armed conflict in Vietnam and parts of neighbouring Laos and Cambodia in a war between the communist North Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South Vietnam, backed by the US.</p><p>During this time, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ran covert operations in Laos, which is northwest of Vietnam, to counter communist forces in Southeast Asia.</p><p>In Laos, CIA officers trained militias from Indigenous tribes such as the Hmong people in the mountainous north, according to a 2003 <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Recollections-Case-Officer-Laos.pdf\">document</a> published by the CIA, to fight against North Vietnamese forces in Laos, as well as against Laotian communists, the Pathet Lao.</p><p>At the time, the Hmong were heavily economically reliant on the cultivation of opium poppies as a cash crop.</p><p>According to historian Alfred W McCoy, who wrote the 1972 book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, the CIA covertly operated an airline called Air America to transport opium from remote mountain areas to be sold in Southeast Asia and international markets, including the US. The proceeds were used to support the militias.</p><p>McCoy presented the findings of his book during a 1972 congressional testimony before a Senate subcommittee. The CIA has never formally admitted direct involvement in the drug operation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149731\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149731\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1354471168-1764839397.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Laotian Civil War (1953Ð75) was fought between the Communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government in which both the political rightists and leftists received heavy external support for a proxy war from the global Cold War superpowers. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Hmong militia during the US’s ‘Secret War’ in Laos, in 1961 [File: History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1980s-during-the-soviet-afghan-war\">1980s: During the Soviet-Afghan War</h2><p>The Soviet army invaded <a href=\"/topics/country/afghanistan.html\">Afghanistan</a> in 1979 to support a communist government that was facing internal threats. Between 1979 and 1989, the Soviet Union fought Afghan rebel fighters, the mujahideen.</p><p>Poppy cultivation thrived in mujahideen‑held provinces such as Helmand in southern Afghanistan and Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan. Historians, including McCoy, allege that CIA-backed mujahideen fighters financed much of their war efforts through opium cultivation and trafficking. Trafficking routes went through Pakistan and Iran, feeding both European and Middle Eastern markets.</p><p>The Soviet-Afghan War resulted in one of the sharpest spikes in global heroin supply in the late 1980s. A UNODC report in 2001 found that in 1999, Afghanistan was producing 79 percent of global illegal opium.</p><p>A CIA report from 1986 also alleges that there was widespread use of drugs among Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and that those soldiers smuggled drugs back to the Soviet Union.</p><p>The CIA has never publicly admitted to backing opium cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149766\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149766\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149766\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-612550268-1764839982.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Afghan Mujahideen fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s.

Pakistan’s tribal belt, especially provinces Balochistan and modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, became transit corridors for heroin exports to the West.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-the-iran-contra-affair\">1980s: The Iran-Contra Affair</h2><p>From the 1950s until the 1980s, the CIA <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/a-timeline-of-cia-operations-in-latin-america\">backed local efforts</a> to clamp down on communist forces in Latin America.</p><p>In Nicaragua, the CIA backed a right-wing group called the Contras, who were fighting the left-wing Cuba-backed Sandinista government during the 1980s. In 1985, then-US President Ronald Reagan heaped praise on the Contras, calling them “the moral equivalent of our founding fathers”.</p><p>However, this all took place against the backdrop of another war overseas that the US took an interest in.</p><p>From 1980 to 1988, Iran and Iraq fought a war, which began with Iraq’s invasion of Iran. In 1985, Iran secretly requested to buy weapons from the US. At this time, an arms embargo prevented the US from openly selling weapons to Iran.</p><p>The Reagan administration nevertheless sold Iran the weapons so that the US could strengthen its position in the Middle East and secure the release of American hostages, mostly diplomats and missionaries, who were being held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>While Reagan had initially publicly denied selling weapons to Iran, he later admitted that the weapons had been sold to secure the hostages’ release.</p><p>Around the same time, the US Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted US involvement in foreign countries and banned US funding for the Contras. To get around this, members of the National Security Council diverted profits from the Iran arms sales to fund the Contras without congressional approval.</p><p>In his 1998 book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion, US investigative journalist Gary Webb traced links between Contra supporters and the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles.</p><p>Webb wrote that a group affiliated with the Contras smuggled cocaine into the US, which was then sold as crack cocaine in Los Angeles – ultimately triggering the epidemic. The funds generated were then used to support the Contras. Webb claimed that the CIA knew about these transactions and backed them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149777\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149777\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-882017752-1764840815.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of Boston Feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boston feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest against the war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986 [Tom Landers/The Boston Globe via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-1980s-during-the-manuel-noriega-era\">1970s-1980s: During the Manuel Noriega era</h2><p>Manuel Noriega was a military dictator who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989.</p><p>Noriega had been a CIA informant and asset since the 1960s.

At the time, Medellin was said to be responsible for more than half of the cocaine smuggled into the US, according to local media reports.</p><p>Noriega’s intelligence cooperation with US agencies continued until he was indicted in 1988 by the US Justice Department on multiple charges, including drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149784\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149784\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149784\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-515355334-1764840990.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C534&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega is shown in this Justice Department mug shot released by the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149784\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega is shown in this Justice Department mug shot [File: Bettmann/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1980s-1990s-in-haiti-during-the-coup-period\">1980s-1990s: In Haiti during the coup period</h2><p>During the late 1980s to mid‑1990s, Haitian politics were mired in turmoil.

Putin’s aide Yury Ushakov had earlier said several documents were being discussed.</p><p>Paraphrasing Putin’s comments to India Today, Tass said the 28-point plan was “still valid and being discussed” and based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/no-deal-at-trump-putin-meeting-key-takeaways-from-alaska-summit\">Alaska</a> in August.</p><p>“They just broke these 28 or 27 points into four packages. And they proposed discussing these four packages with us. But, in effect, they are the same [points],” Putin said, according to Tass.</p><p>Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said Moscow was unlikely to move on its “red lines”. “According to Putin, until Russia’s interests are respected, the country won’t sign any agreements, and will reach its goals on the battlefield,” she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Kyiv, senior correspondent Jonah Hull said there had been “a breakdown based on a clash of red lines that are, at this point, insurmountable”. He described the recent rounds of talks, which have seen the US moving between parties, as a sort of “round Robin of ‘It’s not us, it’s them'”.</p><p>“Here in Ukraine, the government does view this process as a valuable one,” he said. “They think it can lead to results if it’s allowed to run its course now that Ukraine’s interests have been heard and included, and as long as pressure is kept on Russia.”</p><p> </p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"attacks-continue\">Russian attacks continue</h2><p>Russian attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine continued overnight into Thursday.</p><p>A ballistic missile struck Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday night, injuring six people, including a three-year-old girl, according to city administration head Oleksandr Vilkul.</p><p>Vilkul said the attack damaged more than 40 residential buildings, a school and domestic gas pipes in the city, Zelenskyy’s hometown.</p><p>A six-year-old girl died in Kherson, a southern port city, after Russian artillery shelling injured her the previous day.</p><p>Russia also struck Odesa with drones, injuring eight people, while civilian and energy infrastructure was damaged, said the head of the regional military administration, Oleh Kiper.</p><p>On Thursday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of disrupting peace talks with attacks on oil tankers in the Black Sea and on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal in Novorossiysk.</p><p>Russia currently controls 19.2 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, all of Luhansk, more than 80 percent of Donetsk, about 75 percent of Kherson and Zaporizhia, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Ukraine’s army chief said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops continued to hold the northern part of the key city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.</p><p>About 5,000sq km (1,900sq miles) of Donetsk remains under Ukrainian control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"814\">In Gaza, the world has seen the cost of a diplomacy that claims to uphold a rules-based order but applies it selectively. The United States intervened late, and only to defend an occupation the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled illegal. Alongside other Western nations that built multilateral institutions, the US increasingly pursues nationalist agendas that undermine them. The hypocrisy is stark: one set of rules for Ukraine, another for Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"816\" data-end=\"986\">This erosion of credibility marks the structural collapse of unipolar authority, symbolised by the US’s absence from the Group of 20 (G20) in South Africa this past week.</p><p data-start=\"988\" data-end=\"1379\">As thousands gather in Qatar over the coming days for this year’s Doha Forum under the theme “Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress”, the failure to prevent genocide demands a reckoning. The imposed ceasefire in Gaza has delivered neither political resolution nor safety for Palestinians. Meanwhile, the future of Gaza continues to be discussed without Palestinians in the room.</p><p data-start=\"1381\" data-end=\"1843\">This is not an unusual scene. Since the Cold War, international diplomacy has operated on what might be called the master-key model, where one powerful actor unlocks a conflict through political leverage, economic pressure, or conditional aid. Around it grew an entire ecosystem: humanitarian organisations, think tanks, mediators, and consulting firms, often funded by Western states, reinforcing the belief that a call to Washington could solve any crisis.</p><p data-start=\"1845\" data-end=\"2166\">The ceasefire in Gaza shows that the master key can still turn the lock. The US exerted its influence, and the humanitarian community fell in line to deliver dividends on the deal. A Civil-Military Coordination Center has been set up by the US military to coordinate the delivery of aid and reconstruction.</p><p data-start=\"2168\" data-end=\"2602\">States have hailed this flawed agreement as a breakthrough. Yet the fact that this master key was used only after two years of total destruction – despite extensive humanitarian diplomacy, and in a way that entrenches an illegal occupation – exposes the moral bankruptcy of real estate diplomacy, most clearly embodied by the transactional approach taken by the current US administration, which ultimately advances a settler-colonial logic.</p><p data-start=\"2604\" data-end=\"2883\">We are living through what Antonio Gramsci, writing from his imprisonment by fascists in the 1930s, called an interregnum, when “the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born”. In that void, the “morbid symptoms” of resurgent fascism and ethno-nationalism emerge.</p><p data-start=\"2885\" data-end=\"3101\">So what remains when a superpower refuses to turn the lock? A world that is no longer unipolar but multipolar is messy and contested, requiring a new approach for those seeking to influence the outcomes of conflicts.</p><p data-start=\"3103\" data-end=\"3323\">The age of singular leverage is fading, and institutions built for the 20th century cling to outdated maps. As Western power turns inward, those who built their credibility on proximity to it face a crisis of legitimacy.</p><p data-start=\"3325\" data-end=\"3814\">The United Nations has struggled to assert influence in this shifting landscape, constrained by the politics of its funders and the erosion of trust among affected populations. Yet this transition offers the UN a rare opportunity to renew its legitimacy by aligning with emerging powers, embracing regional partnerships, and championing the equitable application of international law. If it adapts, it could serve as a bridge between the old order and the new. If it does not, it dies.</p><p data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"4409\">Amid this transformation, new centres of gravity are emerging in the pursuit of meaningful peace and security. In Doha, a mediation hub has taken shape. Qatar has leveraged its unique political position and diplomatic agility to broker dialogue where traditional power has faltered. Its open channels with actors across divides have made Doha an indispensable node in the global architecture of conflict resolution — even for its critics. South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice and the Hague Group show how legitimacy is shifting — a shift forged in the ruins of a genocide.</p><p>Out of this could emerge a new form of political leverage, created through broader alliances and an insistence on accountability rather than dominance and co-option. As the Doha Forum theme suggests, it is a call to move “Beyond Promises to Progress” by putting “Justice in Action.”</p><p data-start=\"4578\" data-end=\"5047\">However, when nations overwhelmingly voted this month for the UN Security Council resolution endorsing the US plan for Gaza, it demonstrated the fragility of this emerging order. States bowed to American pressure, according to diplomats familiar with the negotiations, proving that economic interests still supersede a resurgent decolonial movement. It was a reminder that multipolarity is not a guarantee of justice; it is only a redistribution of influence.</p><p data-start=\"5049\" data-end=\"5567\">It does not have to be this way. The Global South can be a geopolitical bloc that builds its own negotiating tables and sets its own terms. The growing assertiveness of the BRICS coalition of economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), and the diplomatic independence of some Latin American governments, already demonstrated this possibility. Ignoring this is ignoring the future. At the recent BRICS summit in August 2025, member states reiterated their push for a multipolar order, challenging the longstanding dominance of Western capitals in international diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"5569\" data-end=\"6155\">Diplomacy, whether conducted by states, multilateral institutions, or those who support them, must evolve beyond the logic of the master key. It needs a craft built on ideological honesty and pragmatic engagement. This means confronting asymmetries of modern conflict, rejecting the blanket labelling of entire movements as “terrorist”, and recognising the legitimacy of diverse power structures. Pragmatic engagement requires readiness for multi-door dialogue and engagement with the actors who actually hold power — including regional alliances, armed groups, and civic movements.</p><p data-start=\"6157\" data-end=\"6457\">Those clinging to a single, crude key will be left behind. Palestinians — and others who have suffered under a unipolar order — will not miss them. The future of peacemaking belongs to those who carry many keys and know which door to open, and when. The age of the master key is coming to an end.</p><p data-start=\"6157\" data-end=\"6457\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Palestinian Mohammed Dahman, from Gaza, served nearly 20 years in Israeli jails when he was younger. This powerful observational film follows Mohammed and his daughter, Mai, as they confront the emotional scars left by his years of absence, both in jail and as a political activist. Now living in Norway, Mohammed fears growing old far from Gaza and sets out to retrieve the prison letters he once sent home, hoping they might help repair his strained relationship with Mai. His visit back to Gaza stirs memories of political struggle, friendship and sacrifice, while Mai in Norway grapples with the resentment of a childhood without him. When he finally returns, father and daughter face the painful truths of the past as they read the letters together – moments of love, regret and longing preserved on paper. Their story culminates in a quiet but hopeful attempt at reconciliation, captured in the small, tender moments of family life.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 4 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">4 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

However, following the fall of al-Assad, Israel violated a 1974 agreement and again invaded its neighbour’s territory, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table\">occupying more land along the border</a> as part of a “buffer zone”, including the strategically located Jabal al-Sheikh, a mountain that commands views over northern Israel and southern Syria.</p><p>Talks have been ongoing over a security agreement between Israel and Syria for months, but appear to have made little progress in recent weeks.</p><p>Slovenian UN ambassador Samuel Zbogar told a news conference on Monday, “The visit to Syria and Lebanon is the first official visit of the Security Council to the Middle East in six years, the first visit to Syria ever.”</p><p>Slovenia currently holds the UNSC’s rotating presidency.</p><p>The trip comes “at a crucial time for the region” and for both countries, Zbogar said, noting the new authorities’ efforts towards Syria’s transition as well as a year-old ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, “which we see daily that is being challenged”.</p><p>The visit is important in “expressing support and solidarity with both countries, and learning about the challenges, conveying the messages, also, on the path forward that the council would like to see in both countries”, he added.</p><p>He noted that “there’s still a bit of lack of trust in the UN-Syria relationship, which we try to breach with this visit”.</p><p>Both sides are looking to benefit from this visit, added Baig.</p><p>“What the [Syrian] government wants from the United Nations is support and solidarity, but also they want to talk about the humanitarian aid coming here [to the country] and also reconstruction.”</p><p>The UN, on the other hand, “wants to talk about the [country’s] politics going forward, how this country is going to rebuild itself..and how Ahmed al-Sharaa’s government going forward is going to have an inclusive government, representing all the different factions and ethnicities and different people within Syria.”</p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, “We very much hope that the visit will increase the dialogue between the United Nations and Syria.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Abroad, it fuelled a parallel conflict across Latin America, where US-backed operations deepened cycles of corruption and organised crime.</p><p>Today, overdose deaths driven by fentanyl have reached historic highs and many states have moved to legalise cannabis.</p><p>Now, as the Donald Trump administration appears poised for military action against Venezuela over accusations that the South American nation’s government is driving narcotics trafficking into the US – claims that Washington has not backed with evidence – here’s a look at how the war on drugs started, and its effects in the US and regionally.</p><h3>How did it begin and where does it stand now?</h3><p>Nixon launched the war on drugs at a turbulent political moment in the US. The late 1960s had brought rising heroin use among soldiers returning from Vietnam, growing drug use among youth, and years of protest and growing antiwar sentiment.</p><p>Nixon’s administration laid the groundwork for a punitive system, including new federal agencies, tougher penalties and a rhetoric that framed drug use as a threat to national stability.</p><p>The political logic behind the move was later revealed by John Ehrlichman, a Nixon aide, who in 2016 told a reporter that the administration saw two main “enemies” – the antiwar left and Black Americans. Since the government could not criminalise dissent or race, it instead associated “hippies” with marijuana and Black communities with heroin, and then heavily criminalised both.</p><p>The aim, he said, was to disrupt and discredit those communities by raiding homes, arresting leaders and vilifying them on the news.</p><p>“Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did,” he said.</p><p>The campaign intensified dramatically in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 toughened sentences for marijuana possession.</p><p>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 introduced minimum sentences, but also put in place penalties that ultimately led to major racial disparities in imprisonment rates. The law punished those found with 5gm of crack cocaine with a minimum of five years behind bars. Those found with 500gm of the much more expensive powdered cocaine also faced the same minimum sentence.</p><p>After the passage of the law, the rate of imprisonment of Black Americans jumped fivefold – from 50 in every 100,000, to 250 in 100,000.</p><p>Through the 1990s and 2000s, successive administrations upheld these approaches. Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill expanded federal funding for prisons, led to more aggressive policing and introduced a controversial “three-strikes” approach: a mandatory life sentence for a third violent felony conviction.</p><p>Not much changed under the Bush and Obama administrations.</p><p data-start=\"27\" data-end=\"247\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">It was not until the 2010s that the conversation around drug use started to change, especially as cannabis legalisation expanded, and the opioid crisis – driven by prescription painkillers – showed that punishment couldn’t curb addiction.</p><p data-start=\"27\" data-end=\"247\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Now, Trump, while maintaining many of the domestic policies that were introduced over the past half-century, has also turned his attention to America’s extended neighbourhood. In recent weeks, Trump authorised US military strikes on dozens of boats in the Caribbean near Venezuelan waters, framing the escalation as a renewed crackdown on “narco-trafficking”, even as critics say the move is a pretext to enforce regime change and oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"27\" data-end=\"247\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The US has not presented any public evidence so far to back its claims that the boats its military has bombed were carrying narcotics or that they were headed to its territory.</p><h3>Mass imprisonment and arrests</h3><p>From the mid-1970s onwards, drug criminalisation became a major driver of mass imprisonment in the US.</p><p>At its peak, police made 1.6 million drug arrests per year, mainly for possession. These arrests helped drive the US prison population from about 300,000 in the early 1970s to more than two million four decades later, according to federal data.</p><p>Black communities were hit hardest. Despite drug use being prevalent among various racial groups, Black Americans have long been a lot more likely to be arrested. According to The Sentencing Project, Black people account for more than one in four drug arrests in the US, though they constitute less than 15 percent of the national population.</p><p>As of 2010, they were 3.7 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession.</p><p>According to research from Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act and the sentencing disparity it introduced between those punished for possession of crack and powder cocaine played a major role in this racial imbalance in punishment rates.</p><p>Since crack was cheaper and more accessible in poorer, predominantly Black neighbourhoods, many more Black users were jailed than wealthier, white users of powder cocaine.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the larger arguments behind focusing on drugs – that this would also bring down overall crime rates – fell flat. Homicide rates in the US actually rose after the passage of Reagan’s 1984 crime law, and continued to go up until 1991.</p><p>At the same time, the US continued to fail in treating addiction as a public health issue. As enforcement ramped up, investment in treatment and mental healthcare fell behind. Instead of reducing use, the environment helped drive people into other forms of consumption.</p><p>That emphasis on penalising possession as the way to curb narcotics-related crimes hasn’t changed. In 2020, police made more than 1.1 million drug-related arrests, mostly for possession. The Prison Policy Initiative estimates that roughly 360,000 people are currently imprisoned on drug charges nationwide, with hundreds of thousands more on probation or parole for drug-related offences.</p><p>It hasn’t helped. Today, the US faces its deadliest drug crisis ever, with more than 100,000 overdose deaths each year, largely driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Overdose is now the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18–44.</p><h3>How the ‘war on drugs’ spilled into Latin America</h3><p>The war on drugs did not stay limited to the US and its borders. In the 1980s, Washington funded and trained militaries and police forces across Latin America to fight drug trafficking at its source.</p><p>In Colombia, the US invested at least $10bn from 2000 under what was known as Plan Colombia, according to the Latin America Working Group, much of it directed to security forces and the fumigation of coca crops.</p><p>According to Colombian human rights organisations and the country’s Truth Commission, while the state succeeded in weakening some armed groups, coca cultivation eventually returned to record levels, but civilians paid a high price. Between 1985 and 2018, an estimated 450,000 people were killed in the conflict.</p><p>In Mexico, a government offensive launched in 2006, supported by US intelligence and equipment, caused a wave of cartel fragmentation and turf wars. Since then, more than 460,000 people have been killed, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, and tens of thousands more have disappeared.</p><p>Cartels diversified into extortion, fuel theft and human smuggling, while corruption spread among police forces as well as local governments.</p><p>These crackdowns shifted trafficking routes elsewhere, mainly through the Central American nations of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p><p>Today, the US continues to carry out military operations targeting alleged traffickers. More than 83 people have been killed in the 21 known military strikes the US has conducted on alleged drug smuggling vessels since September 2 in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I said, ‘No, the house is shaking.’ Not long after, boulders came crashing down,” she recalled.</p><p>“My younger sibling was staying over. When the landslide happened, I kicked him to wake him up.

From the hilltop, they watched in horror as another landslide completely destroyed their home.</p><p>For a week now, the family has taken refuge at the church alongside hundreds of other displaced victims. The cyclone-triggered floods and landslides have killed at least 770 people, according to government data, with 463 people still missing.</p><p>“Praise God, we were all saved. Our belongings can be replaced, what matters is that the children and everyone else survived,” she said. The trauma, however, lingers. “Whenever I hear a sound, like a door opening or closing, I get scared. Any loud noise shocks me. On our first day at the church, I heard the noise of a helicopter. I screamed; ‘We’re going to die!’ I nearly fainted because I thought it was another landslide.”</p><p>Sri hopes for government assistance with relocation. “We cannot return there. We don’t want to live there any more. We are too traumatised,” she explained.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Threads and Facebook ahead of the country’s world-first youth social media ban.</p><p>“While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multilayered process,” a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

<a href=\"/podcasts/2024/11/18/the-take-why-is-australia-trying-to-ban-social-media-for-children\">block underage users</a> by December 10, when the new law comes into force.</p><p>Companies face fines of 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32m) if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to comply.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of adolescents are likely to be affected by the ban, with Instagram alone reporting about 350,000 Australian users aged 13 to 15.</p><p>Some popular apps and websites, such as Roblox, Pinterest and WhatsApp, are exempt, but the list remains under review.</p><p>Livestreaming service Twitch was added to the list less than two weeks ago.</p><p>Meta said it was committed to complying with Australian law, but it called for app stores to be held accountable for age verification instead.</p><p>“The government should require app stores to verify age and obtain parental approval whenever teens under 16 download apps, eliminating the need for teens to verify their age multiple times across different apps,” the Meta spokesperson said.</p><p>“Social media platforms could then use this verified age information to ensure teens are in age-appropriate experiences.”</p><p>YouTube has also attacked the social media ban.</p><p>The video-streaming giant said this week the new law would make young Australians “less safe” because those below 16 could still visit the website without an account, but would lose YouTube safety filters.</p><p>But Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells described its argument as “weird”.</p><p>“If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe and there’s content not appropriate for age-restricted users on their website, that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,” said Wells.</p><p>Wells added that some Australian teens had killed themselves as algorithms “latched on” – targeting them with content that drained their self-esteem.</p><p>“This specific law will not fix every harm occurring on the internet, but it will make it easier for kids to chase a better version of themselves,” she said.</p><p>The Sydney-based internet rights group Digital Freedom Project said it had challenged the laws in Australia’s High Court last week, calling them an “unfair” assault on freedom of speech.</p><p>Platforms are expected to devise their own means to stop rebellious teenagers from trying to skirt the law, by using fake IDs, for instance, but “no solution is likely to be 100 percent effective”, the internet safety watchdog has said.</p><p>There is keen interest in whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work as regulators around the globe wrestle with the potential dangers of social media.</p><p>Malaysia indicated it was <a

Zelenskyy is eager to ensure his country maintains territory and sovereignty as Russia seeks to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russia-says-it-captured-pokrovsk-a-key-logistics-hub-in-eastern-ukraine\">annex</a> large chunks of the east.</p><p>“What we want … is that China can convince and influence Russia to move toward a ceasefire as quickly as possible,” a French diplomatic official told The Associated Press news agency, adding that Paris expected Beijing to “refrain from providing Russia with any means whatsoever to continue the war.”</p><p>Xi, for his part, responded to Macron’s overtures with calls to “make the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France more stable”, with an oblique comment that China was willing to work with France “to exclude any interference”.</p><p>It was unclear what he was referring to, but Al Jazeera’s Yu said that self-governing Taiwan, which China sees as its territory, would be at the forefront of Beijing’s agenda. “Recently, it’s been in a diplomatic spat with Japan, and it wants France to reaffirm its commitment to the One China policy,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trade formed a major part of discussions, with the European Union seeking more investments to help diminish its massive deficit, which has ballooned by nearly 60 percent since 2019, and China looking for diplomatic wins amid US tariffs.</p><p>“Our two countries have a role to play in laying out, with other partners, the foundations for rebalanced economic governance,” said Macron, who was accompanied by top executives from French companies Airbus, BNP Paribas and Alstom.</p><p>He called for China to work with G7 countries to create fairer and stronger rules, rather than a system based on “survival of the fittest”.</p><p>The two leaders signed 12 cooperation agreements following their talks, covering population ageing, bilateral investment, nuclear energy and panda conservation.</p><p>Xi on Friday will accompany Macron to southwestern China’s Sichuan province, where two giant pandas loaned to France were recently returned.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump himself was previously deplatformed from X, formerly known as Twitter, following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He was reinstated after tech billionaire and free speech absolutist Elon Musk bought the platform in 2022.</p><p>One of his first moves as president was to sign an executive order banning “federal censorship” of free speech. In May, the US State Department also threatened to bar foreign officials from entering the US who had worked to suppress free speech, including by pressuring US tech companies to regulate social media content.</p><p>Much of Trump’s ire has focused on Europe, which has stronger content regulations and stronger laws on hate speech than the US. It is unclear how the Trump Administration will approach US allies like Australia, which this month banned social media for children under 16.</p></div></div></body></html>"
