            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The Israelis certainly owe Bret Stephens a favour.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, The New York Times opinion columnist took to the pages of the United States newspaper of record to promote his latest deranged argument, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/opinion/no-israel-is-not-committing-genocide-in-gaza.html\">headlined</a>: “No, Israel Is Not Committing Genocide in Gaza”.</p>\n<p>Never mind that numerous global institutions, ranging from various United Nations bodies to Amnesty International, have determined that Israel is committing just that. These are organisations that hardly throw the G-word around lightly, but Stephens knows better. And he will tell us why.</p>\n<p>In the very first paragraph of his Times intervention – which should perhaps come accompanied by a trigger warning for readers prone to aneurysms – Stephens demands defiantly: “If the Israeli government’s intentions and actions are truly genocidal – if it is so malevolent that it is committed to the annihilation of Gazans – why hasn’t it been more methodical and vastly more deadly?”</p>\n<p>It would seem, of course, that the Israeli military’s near-comprehensive conversion of much of the Gaza Strip into rubble – via the bombardment of homes, hospitals, schools, and everything else that can be bombed – would be rather “methodical”. As for the perceived insufficient deadliness of Israel’s ongoing “actions”, Stephens cites the official Palestinian death count of “nearly 60,000” in less than two years, and wonders why there are “not, say, hundreds of thousands of deaths”.</p>\n<p>He goes on to proclaim that “the first question the anti-Israel genocide chorus needs to answer is: Why isn’t the death count higher?”</p>\n<p>Among the many questions that Stephens himself needs to answer, meanwhile, is why he thinks slaughtering 60,000 people is no big deal. As of November 2024, Israel had killed <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2024/11/21/an-a-to-z-of-the-children-killed-by-israel-in-gaza\">at least 17,400 children</a> in Gaza – but even this is apparently not “malevolent” enough. Furthermore, according to a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says\">study</a> published in the Lancet medical journal more than one year ago, the true death toll in Gaza was already potentially set to exceed 186,000. How’s that for “hundreds of thousands”?</p>\n<p>In lieu of waiting for an answer from the “anti-Israel genocide chorus”, Stephens presents his own, which is that “Israel is manifestly not committing genocide.” Citing the UN genocide convention’s definition of the term as the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”, Stephens proceeds to announce that “I am aware of no evidence of an Israeli plan to deliberately target and kill Gazan civilians.”</p>\n<p>Objectively speaking, this is the equivalent in terms of ludicrousness of claiming that there is no evidence of a plan by the operators of a chicken slaughterhouse to deliberately end the lives of the poultry therein. You don’t kill 17,400 children in 13 months by accident; nor do you repeatedly bomb hospitals and ambulances if you aren’t, you know, deliberately aiming to kill civilians.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about bombs. <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/7/22/is-israel-implementing-a-strategy-of-genocide-by-starvation-in-gaza\">Forced starvation</a> is genocide, too. And on that note, another question Stephens might answer is how intentionally depriving a population of two million people of the food and water that is necessary for human survival does not constitute an “intent to destroy” that group. Yesterday alone, Gaza health officials <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/at-least-15-starve-to-death-in-24-hours-in-gaza-as-israel-continues-attacks\">reported</a> that at least 15 Palestinians had starved to death, including four children.</p>\n<p>Since the end of May, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">more than 1,000 Palestinians</a> have also been killed while trying to procure food from the so-called <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/2/in-gaza-aid-kills\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF). This diabolical outfit, backed by Israel and the US, not only concentrates large numbers of starving Palestinians in a single location for easier mowing down by the Israeli army, but also furthers Israel’s US-backed vision of forcibly expelling the surviving Palestinian population.</p>\n<p>While Stephens does deign to mention the “chaotic food distribution system” in Gaza, he insists that “bungled humanitarian schemes or trigger-happy soldiers or strikes that hit the wrong target or [Israeli] politicians reaching for vengeful sound bites do not come close to adding up to a genocide.”</p>\n<p>And yet in his war on the use of the G-word in the Gaza context, Stephens refuses to acknowledge that Israel itself has been a genocidal endeavour from the get-go. Zionists were well aware of the need to dispense with the majority of the Indigenous population of Palestine even before the formal creation of the state of Israel on Palestinian land in 1948, a process that entailed mass killing and the destruction of hundreds of villages. Some three-quarters of a million people were made refugees.</p>\n<p>Since then, Israel has continued on what is fundamentally genocidal footing, working to disappear the Palestinians both physically and conceptually – as exemplified in the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir’s famous <a href=\"/features/2019/3/18/the-mixed-legacy-of-golda-meir-israels-first-female-pm\">assertion</a> that the Palestinians “did not exist”. Indeed, Israel’s existence as a Jewish settler-colonial state is predicated on the very “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”.</p>\n<p>Anyway, forget history and reality. Stephens warns us that, if the word genocide “is to retain its status as a uniquely horrific crime, then the term can’t be promiscuously applied to any military situation we don’t like”.</p>\n<p>Speaking of promiscuity, the Israeli military has long been in bed with <a href=\"/opinions/2024/2/17/thomas-friedman-dehumanisation-par-excellence-amid-a-genocide\">The New York Times</a> and a host of other US corporate media outlets, which do their best to sanitise Israeli atrocities as self-defence. But as Israel now continues to carry out a uniquely horrific crime in Gaza with the firm backing of the global superpower, Stephens’s genocidal journalism is also uniquely horrific.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Seijiro Takeshita, dean at the University of Shizuoka’s Graduate School of Management, Informatics and Innovation, told Al Jazeera that people should look beyond the numbers in assessing whether the trade deal is good for Japan.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s election, voters frustrated with price increases exceeding the pace of wage hikes, especially younger people who have long felt ignored by the government’s focus on senior voters, rapidly turned to emerging conservative and right-wing populist parties, like the Democratic Party for the People and the “Japanese First” Sanseito far-right group which surged in Sunday’s vote.</p>\n<p>Ishiba’s potential departure less than a year after taking office would trigger a succession battle within the ruling LDP as it contends with these challenges from new political parties, particularly on the right, that are chipping away at its support.</p>\n<p>Resentment has also lingered over an LDP funding scandal.</p>\n<p>“I really hope things will get better in Japan, but the population is declining, and I think living in Japan will get tougher and tougher,” Naomi Omura, an 80-year-old from Hiroshima, told the AFP news agency.</p>\n<p>“It is disappointing that Japan cannot act more strongly” towards the US, but “I think it was good that they agreed on a lower tariff”, she said.</p>\n<p>None of the opposition parties has shown interest in forming a full-fledged alliance with the governing coalition, but they have said they are open to cooperating on policy.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Four years later, he named his company after that dream.</p>\n<p>“When I first came to Tanzania at 28, no one imagined why I would head south,” Ginah, who is lightheartedly called the “Mayor of Egyptians in Dar-es-Salaam”, told Al Jazeera, saying that in the minds of many of his friends and family back home, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are tainted by stereotypes of famine, poverty and disease.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p>But when Ginah arrived, what he found were opportunities – and a chance to build something new.</p>\n<p>“In 2021, I established my company, Dream [Trading],” he said, in recognition of his “dream” to be a success. He set it up with savings of $3,000, tapping into a growing market importing and exporting aluminium household goods. As the years progressed, he expanded into the steel business.</p>\n<p>But beyond work, the 36-year-old is also somewhat of a benevolent godfather figure for other North African migrants making the journey southward.</p>\n<p>Ginah has a standard daily routine. Every morning, his driver, Hamed, drops him off at the household goods warehouses attached to Dream Trading. A while later, he drives him to City Mall, the most popular shopping centre in Dar es Salam’s Kariakoo neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Ginah is a regular at the Somali cafe there, where he sits until about noon, meeting other Egyptians and Tanzanians, often over a breakfast of mandazi – deep-fried dough fritters dusted with powdered sugar – or a chipsi mayai, a popular street food omelette with French fries, tomato sauce and vegetables.</p>\n<p>Typically, Egyptians who move to Tanzania already have a relative or friend living there. For those who don’t, Ginah helps them find a place to stay, sometimes offering them a job at Dream and helping cover their rent if they’re an employee. He also introduces them to the work system in Tanzania, and gives them a lay of the land about cities where they can potentially work.</p>\n<p>“However, the most important thing I provide,” said Ginah, “is a trusted, guaranteed translator.” In urban centres in Tanzania, people speak English. But many village residents only speak Swahili. This could lead to misunderstandings and expose newcomers to “fraud or scams”, Ginah said, so he lends a helping hand.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851757\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851757\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-4-1753249837-e1753252133318.jpeg?w=590&amp;resize=590%2C838&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egyptians in Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ahmed Ginah, right, and two Egyptians recently arrived in Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But Ginah is determined to help only those who want to help themselves.</p>\n<p>“I help those who come to work, not those who lie on their laurels and delegate the work to the translator or others,” he said. “In such cases, I advise the person that this country has a lot to offer, but it doesn’t give to the lazy or dependent.”</p>\n<p>Ginah has gained a lot in eight years. Today, his company distributes products throughout Africa, and he has helped dozens of young men from his home village relocate and establish themselves in Tanzania, where an estimated 70,000 Arabs live – including 1,200 Egyptians, according to figures provided by Egypt’s ambassador to the country, Sherif Ismail, in 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-south-migration\">South-south migration</h2>\n<p>While Europe fortifies its borders against North African migrants, ambitious young Egyptians in a struggling economy are looking for alternatives to emigrating to the West, according to Ayman Zohry, a demographer and expert on migration studies at the American University in Cairo.</p>\n<p>This south-bound migration has accelerated significantly in recent years.</p>\n<p>Official statistics show the number of Egyptians in non-Arab African countries increased from 46,000 in 2017 to 54,000 by 2021.</p>\n<p>This trend stands in stark contrast to the perilous journeys many Egyptians still make across the Mediterranean. In 2023, Egyptians represented more than 7 percent of all arrivals in Italy along the Central Mediterranean route, making them the fifth most common nationality, according to a report by the Mixed Migration Centre.</p>\n<p>The European Union recently responded with a new 7.4 billion euro ($8.7bn) agreement with Egypt, partly aimed at boosting border controls to reduce irregular migration to Europe.</p>\n<p>Zohry explained that Egypt’s youth migration trends are undergoing a notable transformation.</p>\n<p>“While traditional destinations were the Gulf and Europe, there is a new trend towards the south, specifically some African countries,” Zohry told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“Economic migration” sees young people seeking investment opportunities in emerging and promising markets. “This trend has grown in tandem with the expansion of the Egyptian government’s diplomatic and commercial relations with several African countries.”</p>\n<p>However, Zohry said, migration to Africa is often circular or temporary. “This means that the migrant returns to Egypt after a short period, or moves between several countries according to available opportunities.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851894\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851894\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2013-07-12T000000Z_813075216_GM1E97D004201_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-ECONOMY-1753254714.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C476&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania [File: Andrew Emmanuel/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The back-and-forth flow is evident every Friday night in Dar-es-Salaam, as an aeroplane takes off from Julius Nyerere airport, heading to Cairo.</p>\n<p>During high seasons like Eid al-Adha or Eid al-Fitr, whole families fill the departure gates, as Egyptians take their earnings home to visit family, contribute to building a new home, prepare a family member for marriage, or help their parents fulfil a dream of performing the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-to-egyptian-skills\">‘Open to Egyptian skills’</h2>\n<p>Across the African continent, diaspora communities of Arabs and North Africans are growing.</p>\n<p>South Africa accounts for the highest percentage of Egyptian residents in Africa, accounting for 85 percent, followed by Nigeria, Kenya and Senegal.</p>\n<p>Ginah recounts a story from the late 1990s which has since become an urban legend among youth seeking greener pastures in Africa.</p>\n<p>“A young man went to South Africa on vacation to visit a friend. Bizarrely, he was arrested in Cape Town for a visa irregularity,” said Ginah. “When he was released, he was broke. All he had were some aluminium utensils, so he sold them to make enough money to buy a ticket home.”</p>\n<p>That’s when the word got out, he says, and people discovered the huge demand for Egyptian aluminium household goods. Young people realised they could make money – and that’s how the home appliance and home goods trade between Egypt and other African countries picked up. Since then, Egyptian business interests across the continent have diversified to include manufacturing, agricultural processing, and mining.</p>\n<p>Although North Africans have long travelled south, the trend surged following the 2011 mass uprisings in Egypt and the ensuing political, economic and social change, Ginah says.</p>\n<p>“There was a new wave of emigration within Africa – both [to] South Africa and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa – as the Gulf and Libya were greatly affected by the political turmoil.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851767\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851767\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2017-08-14T000000Z_1779850285_RC1BF3CDACC0_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-EGYPT-1753250634.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egypt Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi walks past a guard of honour at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar-es-Salaam [File: Emmanuel Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Locally, migrants have also found a more friendly working environment, many say.</p>\n<p>The government of Tanzania has made strides to support entrepreneurship and foreign investment. According to Lloyds Bank country profile, foreign investors can benefit from many fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.</p>\n<p>“Tanzania has natural resources and significant investment opportunities,” said Makame Iddi Makame, the commissioner general and chief of staff at the Tanzanian embassy in Cairo.</p>\n<p>He said the country established the Tanzania Investment Centre to manage investment affairs. This includes reducing customs duties to 5 percent in priority sectors and 0 percent in leading sectors; providing tax exemption on mining, agricultural, and industrial inputs; facilitating the issuance of residence, work and business permits, and the repatriation of capital gains abroad; and deferring taxes and VAT for loss-making projects for up to five years.</p>\n<p>The country’s political stability also provides a high degree of investment security, as there is low inflation (4.2 percent) and stable exchange rates, he added.</p>\n<p>“Given the limited opportunities within Egypt, some African countries may appear less competitive but are more open to Egyptian skills in sectors like construction, agriculture, education, and information technology,” according to migration expert Zohry.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the potential opportunities and generally more welcoming atmosphere, migration to African countries is still limited, compared with the Gulf and Europe, he added, due to a stigmatised mental image many North Africans have about the rest of the continent.</p>\n<p>However, there are signs the continent may become a gradual alternative for some youth seeking opportunities beyond traditional borders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-opportunities-shared-friendships\">Business opportunities, shared friendships</h2>\n<p>Some 550km (340 miles) southeast of Dar-es-Salaam is Mayan village.</p>\n<p>There, Mohamed el-Shafie, 34, another Egyptian, built two cashew-processing factories in the Mtwara region in 2018, tapping into a strategic crop that accounts for 10-15 percent of Tanzania’s foreign exchange earnings.</p>\n<p>“Cashew sales are built purely on trust,” el-Shafei told Al Jazeera. “The cashew growing and harvesting operation is meticulous and requires sensitive handling by farm workers to produce a pure cashew nut. This is followed by the ‘processing’ stage to prepare it for export in good condition.”</p>\n<p>Tanzania is one of Africa’s leading producers and exporters of cashew nuts, ranking among the top three on the continent and eighth globally.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851751\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-3-1753249819.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers at Mohamad El-Shafei’s cashew processing factory, Mayan Village, Mtwara region, Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>El-Shafei’s company has customers across the Arab world and Turkiye, and employs some 400 Egyptian, Chinese and Tanzanian workers, besides the seasonal labourers hired during the cashew harvest season in October.</p>\n<p>His foray into the cashew industry was accidental, said el-Shafei, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Cairo University, before moving to Beijing to continue his education.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I had a lot of Vietnamese friends who worked in the cashew industry. That was when I learned that Tanzania had a promising business opportunity and that Chinese equipment specialised in cashew crop processing was a gap that I could fill,” he said.</p>\n<p>With a little help from his friends, he connected with cashew farmers in Tanzania in late 2017, and with a small capital investment of  200,000 Egyptian pounds (about $11,000 back then), el-Shafei set up shop and imported two cashew processing machines from China to start the business. In 2023-2024, Elshafei Investment Limited had made 13 export shipments with a total value of approximately $719,700.</p>\n<p>El-Shafei decided to relocate his small family to Dar-es-Salaam so his young children would not be far from him. Today, they all live amid the Arab and Egyptian community, as well as Tanzanians of Yemeni, Omani, and Iranian origin who moved there during the Arab rule before the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution.</p>\n<p>Egyptians in Tanzania are not isolated from the local population, el-Shafei says.</p>\n<p>“We share celebrations and holidays such as the July 7 Saba Saba Day, which marks the founding of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954, a significant step towards independence and nation-building. We also celebrate Swahili Language Day and Eid al-Adha through communal meals held in cashew farm villages,” he says.</p>\n<p>For Ginah, living in Dar-es-Salaam with his wife and children, Egyptians are part of the fabric of their new community.</p>\n<p>“We maintain good relationships with Tanzanians, and we share friendships,” he said, including meeting at work, mosques and social clubs.</p>\n<p>But amid the successes, there are also difficult moments in living far from home, he said.</p>\n<p>“The pain of alienation hits hardest when someone dies. We [Egyptian immigrants] know each other well, whether in East or West African countries, so it’s very difficult. We immediately band together to make arrangements for the body to be repatriated, and we support the family financially and emotionally, whether they remain in Tanzania or return home to Egypt.”</p>\n<p>But when there is family by your side, “the feeling of alienation disappears,” Ginah said. And thanks to technology, “we can see family and friends on a daily basis on mobile phone calls.”</p>\n<p>Ginah feels Tanzania is the country where he was destined to make his living.</p>\n<p>“It has certainly become a second home for me, where my children are growing up,” he said. “When will I return to my homeland, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Egab</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

I am drowning in hunger, trembling in exhaustion, and resisting the fainting that follows me every moment … Gaza is dying.

If we fail to act now, we risk a future where there may be no one left to tell our stories. Our inaction will be recorded in history as a monumental failure to protect our fellow journalists and a betrayal of the principles that every journalist strives to uphold,” he added.</p>\n<p>Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed five Al Jazeera journalists – Samer Abudaqa, Hamza Dahdouh, Ismail al-Ghoul, Ahmed al-Louh, and Hossam Shabat – and many of the family members of Al Jazeera and other journalists.

A man suspected of shooting the motorist fled the scene on foot, according to police, who were still looking for the attacker on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We understand that this brazen act has shaken the community and but for the good grace of God, this could have been a mass casualty incident,” Hochman said.</p>\n<p>Among those injured, 23 people were taken to hospitals, said Ronnie Villanueva, interim fire chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles police chief Jim McDonnell said, “It’s truly a miracle that no one was killed that day.”</p>\n<p>Ramirez has a criminal history that includes a battery and gang-related charge in 2014, an aggravated battery conviction for a 2019 attack on a Black man at a Whole Foods grocery store in Laguna Beach, California, and a domestic violence charge in 2021, records show.</p>\n<p>Ramirez “has proved to be violent to strangers and family alike and clearly has a lack of concern for the safety of others”, Orange County prosecutors said in a court filing for the 2019 attack.</p>\n<p>A 2024 drink-driving case and 2022 domestic violence charge were pending at the time of the nightclub crash, according to records.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

International media has been banned from entering this territory for nearly two years. We refuse to watch them die.”</p>\n<p>The association highlighted the cases of several journalists, including a 30-year-old photographer, identified as Bashar, who recently posted on social media that his “body is thin” and he had lost the strength to work.</p>\n<p>“Since AFP was founded in August 1944, we have lost journalists in conflicts, we have had injured and imprisoned colleagues among us, but none of us can recall ever seeing a colleague die of hunger,” the association said.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Al Jazeera Media Network released a statement calling for “immediate action” by international organisations to bring an end to a crisis that has not spared “journalists who are the bearers of truth”.</p>\n<p>“We owe it to the courageous journalists in Gaza to amplify their voices and put an end to the unbearable suffering they are enduring due to forced starvation and targeted killings by Israeli occupation forces,” Mostefa Souag, director general of Al Jazeera Media Network, said in the statement.</p>\n<p>UK charity Oxfam on Tuesday also warned that its staff in Gaza were among those facing starvation.</p>\n<p>“At Oxfam, we are not just witnessing this crisis, we are living it,” Bushra Khalidi, policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory and Gaza, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“My colleague, she told me on Saturday that she went to work without even water, with eating a single falafel just to keep going, and she still showed up to work,” Khalidi said.</p>\n<p>The warnings came as Gaza health officials on Tuesday reported that at least 15 Palestinians, including four children, had starved to death over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number of malnutrition deaths since the start of Israel’s war to 101.</p>\n<p>Israel blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza in March, but has since May allowed a limited amount of supplies through the controversial Israel and United States-backed aid agency GHF.</p>\n<p>Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians seeking food aid since the launch of the GHF, which has been boycotted by the United Nations and leading aid agencies, most of them near the group’s distribution points, according to the UN Human Rights Office.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Five companies based in China were also included on the EU’s sanctions list.</p>\n<p>China’s Ministry of Commerce said that the sanctions on Chinese banks and companies “seriously harmed” trade and economic ties with the EU and threatened to respond with its own measures against Europe.</p>\n<p>William Yang, a senior analyst for Northeast Asia at the Crisis Group, a Brussels-based nonpartisan think tank, said these issues will cast a shadow over the EU-China summit on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“Beijing considers its relationship with Russia as a core interest amid ongoing competition with the US, and it keeps denying the EU’s criticism that it is an enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With these fundamental contradictions, prospects of any significant breakthrough at the upcoming summit are unlikely.”</p>\n<p><strong>A close but bumpy trade relationship</strong></p>\n<p>Another recent source of tension has been the EU-China economic relationship.</p>\n<p>China is the EU’s third-largest trading partner for goods and services, but EU officials are concerned about their ballooning trade deficit with China, which doubled in value between 2015 and 2024, to reach 305.8 billion euros ($359bn) last year, according to EU trade data.</p>\n<p>The EU and member states have long accused China of engaging in overproduction and “dumping” its cheap state-subsidised exports on the European market, but the issue has heightened recently.</p>\n<p>“The view on the trade and balance in Europe is slightly different from the United States… where it’s basically about who’s going to be number one. This is a dimension that is not present in Europe,” Rudyak said.</p>\n<p>“Europe is really concerned about its core industries, including the automotive. There is a huge concern about Chinese EV overcapacity being dumped on the EU market at prices where European companies cannot compete, and subsidised Chinese overcapacity crowding out European backbone industries,” she continued.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>European automakers have also suffered from Beijing’s recent decision to curb its exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential components in many auto parts and electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>Beijing, for its part, has opened its own investigations into European “dumping”, targeting key products like dairy, brandy and pork.</p>\n<p>Beijing has other frustrations with Europe, even as it tries to reset relations, according to Wang Yi-wei, the director of the EU Research Centre at Renmin University in the Chinese capital.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list for Beijing is the EU’s often conflicting approach to its relationship with the US and China, Wang said.</p>\n<p>“China has at times engaged in wishful thinking, expecting Europe to resist US influence. In reality, however, the EU seeks to balance both resisting American dominance and cooperating with the US, including supporting its efforts to contain China – for example, justifying tariff disputes as addressing ‘Chinese challenges’, rather than questioning US unilateralism,” Wang said in remarks shared with Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>China wants the EU to stop portraying their relationship as one of “competitive cooperation”, and instead see it through the paradigm of “cooperative competition”, he noted.</p>\n<p>With expectations for a breakthrough low, Marta Mucznik, a senior EU analyst at the Crisis Group, said observers hope that the summit will at least open up channels of communication between officials from both sides.</p>\n<p>“The EU doesn’t expect breakthroughs from this summit but sees it as a chance to keep communication channels open with Chinese leaders while it works to carve out its geopolitical role and reduce critical dependencies,” she said.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

During that period, they would also begin negotiations on a permanent end to the war.</p>\n<p>While there has been some minor progress, officials say that Israel and Hamas remain divided on the extent to which Israeli troops would withdraw after any ceasefire takes place.</p>\n<p>Qatar has meanwhile called on the US and the international community to put more pressure on Israel.</p>\n<p>Foreign Ministry official Majed al-Ansari told a conference that “the Israeli government does not view Palestinians as human beings” and that Israel’s reckless behaviour, not only in Gaza, but also with its attacks on Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran, has endangered security in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful [for ceasefire talks], but the parameters remain. If there is no change in the Israeli directive not to have a deal and sabotage any talks, if there is no serious pressure from the international community, particularly the United States, the parameters of the talks will not change,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But we are doing right now is trying to push using the momentum was created by another mediation that we were doing, which is the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to make sure that momentum helps us reach a deal between both sides, and hopefully get us to an end to this terrible chapter in the history of our region,” he added.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
