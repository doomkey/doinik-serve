They must be reversed without delay.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Israel’s parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning UNRWA from operating in Israel and prohibiting Israeli officials from having contact with the agency. It then amended the law last month to ban electricity or water to UNRWA facilities.</p><p>Israeli authorities also seized UNRWA’s occupied East Jerusalem offices last month. The UN considers East Jerusalem occupied by Israel. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be part of the country.</p><p>Guterres said that UNRWA is “an integral part of the United Nations”, and highlighted that “Israel remains under an obligation to accord UNRWA and its personnel the privileges and immunities specified in the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN”.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/ethics/assets/pdfs/Convention%20of%20Privileges-Immunities%20of%20the%20UN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">convention</a> states that “the premises of the United Nations shall be inviolable”.</p><p>Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, dismissed Guterres’s letter to Netanyahu.</p><p>“We are not fazed by the Secretary-General’s threats,” Danon said in a post on X on Tuesday.</p><p>“Instead of dealing with the undeniable involvement of UNRWA personnel in terrorism, the Secretary-General chooses to threaten Israel. This is not defending international law, this is defending an organization marred by terrorism,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Israel has long sought the dissolution of UNRWA, which was created by the UN General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. It has since provided aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p><p>Israel has alleged that a dozen of the agency’s employees were involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel, in which 1,139 people were killed, and about 240 were taken into Gaza as captives.</p><p>In response to the attack, Israel launched a devastating genocidal war against the Palestinian people of Gaza, killing more than 71,400, according to Gaza’s health authorities.</p><p>The UN has said that nine UNRWA staff who may have been involved in the Hamas-led attack on Israel have been fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon, killed in September by Israel, was also found to have had a UNRWA job.</p><p>The UN has also promised to investigate all accusations made against UNRWA, and has repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided.</p><p>According to a January 5 UN <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-203-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed 382 UNRWA employees in the enclave, which is the highest number of UN casualties since the world body was founded in 1945. Some have been killed in Israel’s deliberate, repeated attacks on UNRWA hospitals and schools, which shelter more than one million displaced Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>Top UN officials and the UN Security Council have described UNRWA as the backbone of the aid response in Gaza, where Israel’s war has unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.</p><p>In October 2025, the ICJ reiterated Israel’s obligation to ensure full respect for the privileges and immunities accorded to the UN, including UNRWA and its personnel, and said Israel should ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met.</p><p>The ICJ opinion was requested by the 193-member UN General Assembly.</p><p>Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, but they are not binding, and the court has no enforcement power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

For instance, World Bank data from 2022 suggested the overall trade volume between China and Iran was worth $37bn.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">China imported 80 percent of Iran’s oil last year, providing much-needed revenue as other major oil buyers, such as India, drastically cut back their imports after US sanctions were imposed during Trump’s first term in office.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said China has been Iran’s top trading partner since 2016. The trade has provided an “economic lifeline to Iran”, she said.</p><p>“China does not just buy oil. It also purchases other things, such as plastics, iron ore and chemicals. It’s also a major buyer of Iran’s methanol. There are reports that China was considering even increasing its purchase of Iranian oil in the light of the turbulence now in Venezuela,” she said.</p><p>The new tariff, the Al Jazeera correspondent said, “is really going to hurt Chinese manufacturers” because it will apply on top of the 35 percent tariff that Chinese goods already face in the US.</p><p>The potential new tariff comes months after the US and China announced a trade truce, bringing down China’s tariff from more than 100 to 35 percent following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump in October on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p>The Al Jazeera correspondent said the new tariff threat “not only could jeopardise the current stability that we have between Beijing and Washington, it will also jeopardise Trump’s planned trip to Beijing in April this year”.</p><p>The Chinese embassy in Washington condemned Trump’s policy, warning that Beijing would take “all necessary measures” to defend its interests and rejecting what it called “illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”.</p><p>“China’s stance against the arbitrary use of tariffs has been consistent and clear. No one wins in tariff or trade wars, and coercion and pressure are not a solution,” an embassy spokesperson said on X.</p><p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said, “There are no winners in a trade war.”</p><p>“China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Mao told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>Stressing that China wants peace in the Middle East, Mao said Beijing supports Iran to “maintain national stability” and “oppose[s] interfering in the country’s internal affairs and the use, or threat of use, of force in international affairs”.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>According to the UN Comtrade data from 2024, Turkiye was Iran’s second largest trading partner. The trade between the two countries was worth about $5.7bn.</p><p>Turkiye faces a baseline tariff from the US of 15 percent. Since June, the US has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminium from most of its trading partners, including Turkiye, raising them from 25 to 50 percent.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Pakistan is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was about $1.2bn in 2024.</p><p>Pakistani exports to the US face a 19 percent tariff at the moment.</p><h3>India</h3><p>India is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was just over $1.05bn in 2024.</p><p>India faces 50 percent US duties on its steel and aluminium. A range of other Indian exports also faces a <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/27/trumps-india-tariffs-take-effect-which-sector-will-be-hit-whats-exempt\">50 percent</a> tariff from the US.</p><p>Last week, media reports said the Trump administration is planning to slap 500 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-impacted-iran-s-exports\">How have sanctions impacted Iran’s exports?</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The US has imposed sanctions to cut off funding for Tehran’s nuclear ‌programme. Washington accuses Iran of planning to make a nuclear bomb. But Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only and has allowed inspections by the global nuclear watchdog.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But after the US bombed a nuclear plant during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, Tehran imposed restrictions on the nuclear inspections. Talks to break the logjam have stalled as Tehran has accused the US of imposing conditions.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Fuel is Iran’s biggest export item by value while major imports include intermediate goods, vegetables, machinery and equipment.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran exported products to 147 trading partners in 2022, ⁠according to the most recent data from the World Bank.</p><p>Most of the sanctions on Iran were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal under US President Barack Obama, but three years later, Trump withdrew the US from the deal, which had put limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>He also imposed additional sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium and copper) and senior Iranian officials as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The reimposition of US sanctions since 2018 has squeezed oil exports and access to global finance. Iran’s oil exports fell by about 60 to 80 percent, stripping the government of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.</p><p>The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita fell from more than $8,000 in 2012 to just over $6,000 by 2017 and a little above $5,000 in 2024, according to World Bank data.</p><p>Iran was exporting about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (bpd) in 2011. Those exports fell sharply after 2018 to an all-time low of just over 400,000bpd in 2020. Exports have gradually risen to about 1.5 million bpd in 2025 but still remain below their pre‑2018 levels.</p><p>Foreign trade has brought billions of dollars to Iran’s economy.</p><p>The country’s exports were worth about $22.9bn in 2024, according to UN Comtrade data, about 5 percent of the country’s total GDP in 2024 of about $475.3bn, according to World Bank data.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Iran is living through one of the most dangerous moments in its post-revolutionary history. Nationwide protests have become sustained rather than episodic. As a new wave of unrest has spread across the country, violence has intensified. The true death toll cannot be verified yet.</p><p>These events have revived a familiar question: Is Iran heading towards another 1979?</p><p>The temptation to rely on this analogy is understandable. Images of mass mobilisation and rapidly recurring protests evoke memories of the final months of the shah’s rule. Yet the comparison is ultimately misleading.</p><p>The success of the 1979 revolution cannot be explained solely by mass mobilisation. Instead, it was the convergence of coordinated opposition under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and, more decisively, the ruling elites’ inability to effectively repress dissent that ensured its triumph.</p><p>Mohammad Reza Shah had cancer, was heavily medicated and was visibly indecisive. His leadership faltered during crises. He left the country twice amid political upheaval, first in 1953 after being challenged by Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and again in January 1979 as protests spread nationwide.</p><p>Equally important, the shah’s repressive apparatus was fragmented and socially heterogeneous. Apart from SAVAK, the shah’s central intelligence organisation, the police and gendarmerie were tasked with maintaining social order while the Iranian army focused on territorial defence rather than political repression.</p><p>These institutions lacked systematic ideological vetting and drew personnel from diverse social and ideological backgrounds. When the shah left the country, some segments of the police stopped their repressive tactics and cooperated with protesters to maintain public order while senior military commanders hesitated, prioritised self-preservation and ultimately abandoned the monarchy.</p><p>The situation today is fundamentally different. Unlike the shah, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s leadership is not marked by hesitation or indecision during crises.</p><p>Since assuming the position of supreme leader in 1989, Khamenei has overseen a profound transformation of the Islamic Republic into what I describe as a theocratic security state that relies more on repression rather than societal consent. As the supreme leader, he presides over a highly institutionalised, cohesive, ideologically committed and deeply invested coercive apparatus. This structural reality, rather than popular sentiment alone, defines the limits of revolutionary change in Iran today.</p><p>The Islamic Republic’s coercive power is not concentrated in a single institution. Instead, it is distributed across overlapping organisations with redundant chains of command. These forces are concentrated within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij, the police, the intelligence services and the social networks attached to them.</p><p>Iran’s coercive institutions are dominated by the regime’s hardcore supporters. Their loyalty is not merely transactional. It is ideological, institutional and generational. Ideological vetting and patronage ensure that their loyalty is not only enforced but actively cultivated.</p><p>Their social mobility, economic security and sense of identity are tied to the survival of the regime and Khamenei’s leadership. For them, regime collapse is not a political transition; it is an existential threat. In moments of crisis, these loyalists act preemptively to prevent the diffusion of protest and frame unrest as foreign-backed sedition, lowering internal barriers to violence.</p><p>Consequently, even protests that are larger and more widespread geographically than those in 1979 would not fundamentally challenge the regime. Instead, they would lead to stricter repression. This highlights a key lesson: Protests by themselves do not cause revolutions.</p><p>Revolutions occur when mass unrest intersects with elite paralysis or defection. That happened in 1979, but it has not happened now.</p><p>What could alter this equilibrium is not protest alone but a direct shock to the regime’s leadership structure. External intervention, particularly by the United States, would likely aim to disrupt elite coordination by targeting senior political and security figures with strikes.</p><p>Such an approach would only generate a genuine regime crisis if it removed Khamenei himself. Power in the Islamic Republic has been heavily centralised within the office of the supreme leader and his inner circle. His sudden absence could trigger elite confrontation over succession and weaken cohesion at the top.</p><p>But intervention could also reinforce loyalist unity. If Khamenei survived, core supporters within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij and the intelligence services would almost certainly close ranks, as they have done during previous external confrontations. Under those conditions, elite defection would remain unlikely.</p><p>Even in the event of regime collapse, Iran would not face the institutional vacuum seen in some post-intervention states. The country’s modern bureaucracy, which has maintained continuity since the early 20th century, would likely continue functioning in the short term. Administrative breakdown would be constrained by state capacity, social organisation and national identity.</p><p>Some warn that the fall of the Islamic Republic would inevitably lead to a prolonged insurgency. That risk cannot be dismissed. However, unlike the cases of Iraq or Afghanistan, in Iran, there would not be external state actors willing and able to finance, organise and sustain armed radical movements. Iranian society has also shown deep resistance to religious extremism and political radicalism. It is possible that instability following a regime collapse could be contained.</p><p>The real danger, then, is not that Iran is on the verge of repeating 1979 but that persistent reliance on that analogy blinds policymakers to how the Islamic Republic functions today. Misreading the nature of power in Iran does not increase the chances of peaceful change. It increases the likelihood that Iranians themselves will bear the cost of repression, escalation and prolonged uncertainty.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In the eyes of the all-powerful Perez, missing out on silverware and that, too, against Barca was too big a mistake to let slip.</p><p>“Losing to Barcelona in a big final remains, it seems, a capital offence,” Hunter said.</p><p>Add to this a patchy run, by Real Madrid’s standards, in La Liga, including a 5-2 thrashing in the Madrid derby, draws against three lower-ranked teams, and a home loss to Celta Vigo.</p><p>Trouble had been brewing for Alonso over the past few months, with a UEFA Champions League defeat at Liverpool setting off a run of only two victories in eight games.</p><p>This slump affected Madrid’s standing on top of the La Liga table, turning their five-point lead over Barcelona into a four-point deficit.</p><p>Real Madrid’s results did improve more recently, but performances did not convince the management. The team beat Atletico Madrid in the Super Cup semifinal despite being outplayed, only to lose in the final.</p><p>“When Real Madrid dropped points against Rayo Vallecano, Elche and Girona, and then lost at home to Celta and Manchester City, there was a massive manhunt mounted by the club and by the media to find someone to blame,” Hunter explained.</p><p>“The coach, correctly or not, was found guilty.”</p><p>In addition to the results, the fact that Alonso very publicly fell out with star forward Vinicius Junior didn’t help his case.</p><p>All of these factors combined to seal the fate of the football manager.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235759\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235759\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235759\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-11T193355Z_1309911149_UP1EM1B1ICIFB_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-BAR-RMA-1768310892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - Spanish Super Cup - Final - FC Barcelona v Real Madrid - King Abdullah Sports City Stadium, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - January 11, 2026 Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso gives instructions to the players during a break in play REUTERS/Vincent West\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4235759\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Xabi Alonso was in charge when Real Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup to Barcelona [Vincent West/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-did-alonso-perform-as-real-madrid-manager\">How did Alonso perform as Real Madrid manager?</h2><p>The former midfielder was welcomed amid fanfare at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in May 2025 after signing a contract to stay until 2028.</p><p>Regarded as a modern strategist, he came with an impressive pedigree, having steered German football giants Bayer Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga victory, a German Cup triumph, and a UEFA Europa League final appearance.</p><p>Alosno’s first real test was the FIFA Club World Cup, where Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinal in July.  Despite Alonso’s insistence that he would not implement his coaching style until the beginning of the new (2025-26) La Liga season, it was a clear sign of the vast difference between the club he had previously coached and the Spanish giants.</p><p>During the summer, Alonso’s signing targets never materialised, with Martin Zubimendi choosing Arsenal over Real Madrid.</p><p>When the La Liga season began, Alonso started off well with a series of victories, including a 2-1 Clasico victory over Barcelona in October. But soon, a rot started to set in and resulted in defeats to Celta Vigo and Manchester City.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-alonso-vs-vinicius-junior-saga\">What was the Alonso vs Vinicius Junior saga?</h2><p>The row began during the El Clasico win when Vinicius Junior stormed off the pitch after being substituted by the manager in the 71st minute. The striker issued an apology later, but it was not directed towards Alonso.</p><p>Spain-based football expert Hunter believes the coach was not backed up by the club’s management in the aftermath of the row as they saw the Brazilian as a prized possession.</p><p>Club president Perez, in particular, has been keen to retain Vinicius on the club’s books.</p><p>“Damage was done to Alonso’s public reputation and club credibility during the Vinicius Junior saga as the player erupted in petulant anger while showing complete disrespect for his manager,” Hunter said.</p><p>“He [Vinicius Junior ] said he wanted to leave the club. Perez wanted Vinicius Junior to renew his contract. It is now clear that this did irreparable damage to Perez’s view of the coach.”</p><p>Hence, Alonso became the 10th Real Madrid manager to be sacked during Perez’s reign and that, too, without completing a full year in charge.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235412\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235412\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235412\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20251026__823C9WF__v1__MidRes__FblEspLigaRealMadridBarcelona-1768301698.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid's Brazilian forward #07 Vinicius Junior (R) walks past Real Madrid's Spanish coach Xabi Alonso as he is substituted during the Spanish league football match between Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid on October 26 , 2025.

Coaching Real Madrid has been an honour and a responsibility,” Alonso wrote on Instagram on Tuesday.</p><p>“I am grateful to the club, the players and, above all, the fans … I leave with respect, gratitude and ​pride in having done my best.”</p><h2 id=\"who-is-the-new-real-madrid-coach-alvaro-arbeloa\">Who is the new Real Madrid coach, Alvaro Arbeloa?</h2><p>Alonso has been replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa, a former Real Madrid right-back who made 238 appearances across seven years with ‌the club.</p><p>Arbeloa has been managing the club’s B team, Real Madrid Castilla, since June 2025 and coaching the youth academy since 2020.</p><p>His lack of coaching experience at the highest level has been a talking point in Madrid.</p><p>Football journalist Lorenzo Calonge, writing in Spanish newspaper El Pais, noted on Tuesday that Arbeloa had been a probable successor to Alonso for some time.</p><p>“Since Xabi Alonso began teetering on the brink a month ago, Arbeloa’s name has been the leading candidate to take over the reins at Real Madrid, should [Alonso] be dismissed,” he said.</p><p>“His coaching career is short [five and a half seasons], and he has always been within the Real Madrid training complex. He has never managed a senior or professional team, nor has he worked outside of Valdebebas [training ground].”</p><p>However, what Arbeloa lacks in terms of experience as a professional manager, he makes up for as a player. The 42-year-old started his top-flight career with Real Madrid before spending two seasons with Liverpool between 2007 and 2009.</p><p>Arbeloa returned to Los Blancos and was at the club during one of the most successful periods in their history – between 2009 and 2016 – and won two Champions League trophies.</p><p>The reliable backline player was also in the Spanish squad that won the 2010 World Cup and two European Championships, making 56 international appearances.</p><p>Football expert Hunter believes Arbeloa’s temperament may not go down well with some of the highly strung stars at the Bernabeu.</p><p>“The trouble with Arbeloa, is that he is blunt to the point of resembling a carpenter’s hammer. He’s unforgiving, unrelenting and completely unafraid of incurring anybody else’s displeasure or disapproval.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235410\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235410\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235410\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-13T103919Z_894667166_UP1EM1D0TLGW2_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-ALB-RMA-PREVIEW-1768301693.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - Copa del Rey - Round of 16 - Real Madrid Training - Ciudad Real Madrid, Madrid, Spain - January 13, 2026 Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa during training REUTERS/Susana Vera\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4235410\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alvaro Arbeloa has taken over as Real Madrid’s head coach [File: Susana Vera/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
