minorities, as government forces continue to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">consolidate control of the country</a> after a rapid offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the north of the country.</p><p class=\"selectionShareable\">Interior Minister Anas Khattab issued the decision on Wednesday, mandating that the decree applies to all Kurds residing in Syria and explicitly includes those listed as stateless, the Anadolu news agency reported, citing the Syrian television station Alikhbariah.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">had declared</a> the recognition of Kurdish as one of the country’s national languages and the restoration of citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians, as he announced a ceasefire between Syrian and Kurdish forces.</p><p>The rapid advance of Syrian forces forced the SDF to withdraw from more cities, including Raqqa and Deir Az Zor, allowing the government in Damascus to unite the country after a nearly 14-year-long ruinous civil war.</p><p>The development has drawn praise from United States President Donald Trump, who told al-Sharaa that he was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trump-praises-syrian-president-al-sharaa-after-offensive-against-sdf\">“very happy”</a> about the Syrian army offensive despite the previous US backing of the SDF.</p><p>Still, there have been reports of <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">Kurdish civilians facing a shortage of food</a> and displacement as a standoff between Syrian forces and the SDF continues in the country’s northern region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the Anadolu report, the authorities in charge of rolling out al-Sharaa’s order have been asked to draft instructions and guidelines for the decree’s implementation at once.</p><p>Under al-Sharaa’s decree, the state has also been instructed to safeguard the culture and language of Syrian Kurds, as well as the teaching of the Kurdish language in public and private schools in Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>The decree has also designated March 21 as the date of the Newroz festival, a nationwide celebration welcoming spring that is widely observed, not just in Syria.</p><p>On Wednesday, al-Sharaa met <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/28/putin-congratulates-al-sharaa-on-his-efforts-to-unify-syrian-territory\">Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> in Moscow to discuss the future of Syria and the presence of Russian troops in the country.</p><p>At the meeting, Putin praised his Syrian counterpart’s ongoing efforts to stabilise his country.</p><p>Since al-Sharaa’s forces toppled Russian ally Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Moscow has been working to build relations with him and ensure a continued military foothold in the country to bolster its influence in the Middle East.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It takes up to three trips to a third country to renew it, submit it and receive the documents to get the passport they hope to abandon soon.</p><p>And if the two-year deadline is not met, there have been cases when the migration service strips people of their Ukrainian citizenship, Tarasenko said.</p><p>She said she had won two cases when courts deemed the decisions illegal, and several similar cases were pending.</p><p>In late 2024, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, voted to change the migration law, allowing Russian nationals to wait for the war’s end plus one more month to start the termination of their red passports, she said.</p><p>By that time, Taras was tired of trains to Moldova and endless bickering inside the Russian embassy’s sprawling, white building.</p><p>He was told that a “declarative rejection” of his Russian citizenship could suffice, but the migration services rejected his “declaration”.</p><p>He sued them, and a court ruled that he could finally get the blue passport.</p><p>The Poltava migration service disagreed, and Taras sued again. This time, the court ruled that the officials in charge of issuing his passport should be fined.</p><p>“And as soon as it became money out of their pocket, they were like, ‘Good, come get the passport,’” Taras said.</p><p>He did – last August.</p><p>He cannot be drafted because of severe, progressing myopia coupled with astigmatism, while many other men with Russian passports prefer to hold on to their residence permits and obtain their Ukrainian passports after the war.</p><p>Others are so desperate that they resort to symbolic vandalism.</p><p>In early January, Andriy Kramar, an advertising executive in Kyiv, burned his wife Valery’s Russian passport on a gas stove in the kitchen of their apartment in Hostomel, a suburb that was briefly seized by Russia in 2022.</p><p>They live with their newborn daughter, Oleksandra, amid days-long blackouts caused by Russian shelling and with no running water.</p><p>“That alone could drive you crazy,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kramar posted the video of the burning passport on Facebook, tagging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s administration and adding: “Give my wife a normal passport!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Equity BCDC Bank did not reply, but in a rare statement published in July last year, they informed customers that “branches in Goma and Bukavu have been temporarily closed for several months due to the security situation.”</p><h2 id=\"elusive-peace\">‘Elusive’ peace</h2><p>Although economically, there is much to complain about following the closure of the banks and Goma International Airport, the population remains divided over the capture of Goma.</p><p>M23 leaders say they have brought peace and basic services to the city, including a stable supply of water and electricity – and many residents agree.</p><p>“Since the AFC has been here, we have seen an improvement in the overall security of the population because today, at least, we can sleep peacefully. There are no more targeted killings of motorcyclists and money changers. Peace reigns here in Goma,” says Gentil Mulume, a resident.</p><p>According to M23, there were about 50,000 armed men in the city of Goma before they seized it, and it is this over-militarisation that they say was the root cause of instability in North Kivu.</p><p>Mulume also said he noted the good faith of the AFC-M23 authorities in resolving the social difficulties of the people of Goma.</p><p>“These days, water flows in the city 24 hours a day, there is no longer a water shortage and no untimely power cuts. We are seeing work being done on the road infrastructure.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271543\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271543\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271543\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26027246858866-1769610751.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271543\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman sells bananas on the shores of Lake Kivu in Goma, a year after M23 took control of the city [Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Still, other residents do not agree.</p><p>“Did they bring electricity to Goma? Did they bring water? Did they find Goma without roads?” asked Dieudonne Muweza, an architect, who believes that the M23-AFC leaders should prove themselves.</p><p>“I think the M23 leaders should show us the difference between their mode of governance and that of Kinshasa,” he observed, saying nothing has changed. He hopes for the total withdrawal of the M23-AFC from all areas under their control.</p><p>Muweza has been between jobs since M23 took over the city and wants all ongoing peace initiatives to be concluded to enable the Congolese people to enjoy an “endless peace” that seems “elusive” right now.</p><p>A year since M23’s rapid advance, peace deals mediated by the United States and Qatar have been signed by the rebels and the DRC’s government, while regional efforts also continue. The rebels recently withdrew from the city of Uvira, on the border between the DRC and Burundi, allowing the “symbolic” return of authorities installed by Kinshasa.</p><p>But for Congolese across the east of the country, the future remains uncertain.</p><p>“They [M23] have done well on security, but we are very hungry,” said David Linda, a resident of Goma. “Peace is good. People are sleeping well. The guns are silent. But we don’t have food.”</p><p>A year after her life and bank account were thrown into disarray, Zawadi, the pharmacy owner – like other businesspeople in Goma – is still finding workarounds to make a living. Most of her customers pay her using internet or mobile banking, depositing into her bank account electronically. After that, she still crosses the border into Rwanda to withdraw foreign currency and change it to US dollars and then back into Congolese francs – losing a percentage with every transaction.</p><p>She finds it a difficult cost to bear, especially in a time of simmering conflict and uncertainty, where every expense has to be carefully weighed. But until the banks reopen, this is her only choice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it has become central to the voting climate as the most visible guarantor of public order, with the police still weakened in morale and capacity after the upheaval of 2024, and with the country still reckoning with a “security apparatus” that watchdogs and official inquiries say was used to shape political outcomes under Hasina.</p><p>For nearly a year and a half now, soldiers have policed the streets of Bangladesh, operating under an order that grants them magisterial powers in support of law and order.

But the military chose not to, he said, in part because it had learned from the fallout of past experiments with its direct political control.</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and professor at Dhaka University, said the military was aware that a takeover would have also jeopardised key interests, including Bangladesh’s United Nations peacekeeping deployments, which carry both financial benefits and reputational weight for the armed forces. Bangladesh has for decades been one of the biggest suppliers to UN peacekeeping missions, and receives between $100m and $500m a year in payouts and equipment reimbursements for these services.</p><p>But Shahan argues that the military remains “an important political actor”. Today, he said, its influence is “less about overt intervention than the institutional weight it carries through the security and intelligence apparatus”.</p><p>He also pointed to what he called the army’s “corporate” footprint. That footprint spans involvement in major state infrastructure projects, the military’s own business conglomerate, and the presence of serving and retired officers across commercial and state bodies.</p><p>Shahan said the last Hasina government “gave them a share of the pie”, leaving “a kind of culture of corruption … ingrained”. He suggested that this could translate into informal pressure on whoever governs next to do the same, and anxieties inside the force over whether “the facilities and privileges” it has accumulated will shrink.</p><p>On the election itself, Shahan too said that the possibility of the army trying to gain overt control was “very low” unless there is such a major law and order breakdown that there is public demand for the army to step in as the “only source of stability”,</p><p>Others who track the military closely agreed. Rajib Hossain, a former army officer and author of the best-selling book Commando, said he “strongly believes” the army will avoid partisan involvement for its own sake. “The army will play a neutral role during this election,” he said. “What we’ve observed on the ground over the past year and a half, there is no record of the army acting in a partisan way.”</p><p>But, he added, pressure on the institution has been intense since 2024. “Internally, there’s an understanding that if the army fails to act neutrally, it could lose even the public credibility it still has,” he said.</p><p>Mustafa Kamal Rusho, a retired brigadier general at the Osmani Centre for Peace and Security Studies, also told Al Jazeera that the military does not have “any clear intent” to influence politics, though “it still remains a critical power base”.</p><p>That leverage was clearest during the 2024 uprising, Rusho said, when Bangladesh’s political crisis reached a point that many Bangladeshis and international watchdogs viewed the military’s posture as decisive. “If the military did not take the stand that it took, then there would have been more bloodshed,” he said.</p><p>With protests <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2024/8/5/bangladesh-protests-live-army-chief-to-address-nation-amid-new-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">escalating</a>, the military refused to fully enforce Hasina’s curfew orders and decided troops would not fire on civilians. It enabled Hasina to flee to India on an air force plane, and the army chief then announced an interim government would be formed.</p><p>In an Al Jazeera <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txhtxb0ZjVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentary</a> on the uprising last year, Waker-uz-Zaman, who is related to Hasina and was appointed less than two months before her collapse, also stressed that his forces would not turn their guns on civilians. “We don’t shoot at civilians. It’s not in our culture … So we did not intervene,” he said.</p><p>In the same interview, he added: “We believe that the military should not engage in politics … It’s not our cup of tea.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273206\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273206\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-12-16T170242Z_329957784_RC2CDL3DOEQ0_RTRMADP_3_REUTERS-ARCHIVE-1769664979.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C517&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh meeting British PM Thatcher at Downing St. London.

Rahman was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/world/bangladesh-leader-is-shot-and-killed-in-a-coup-attempt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assassinated</a> in 1981 in a failed coup attempt by another group of military officers. The BNP remains a key contender in the February 12 vote, now led by Rahman’s son, Tarique Rahman, who has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/bangladesh-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman-returns-after-17-years-in-exile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returned to front-line politics</a> after a long exile.</p><p>In 1982, then army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power and ruled for much of the 1980s. Writer and political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/cx208wg3n1jo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> Ershad’s takeover as coming only months after he publicly argued that “the army should be brought in to help run the country”.</p><p>Eventually, a pro-democracy movement led by Zia’s wife, Khaleda Zia, and Hasina, also Mujibur Rahman’s daughter, forced him from office. The BNP won a landmark election, and in 1991, Khaleda became the country’s first female prime minister.</p><p>Since then, Rusho said, the military’s influence “became more indirect”, though Bangladesh still saw an abortive May 1996 showdown when the then army chief, Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim, defied presidential orders, and troops loyal to him moved towards Dhaka. Nasim was arrested and removed from office.</p><p>A decade later, in 2007, the military in effect “fully backed” a caretaker government that was formed to replace Khaleda’s second administration, which had ruled between 2001 and 2006. That caretaker government was installed in January 2007 after a breakdown in the election process and escalating political violence. The International Crisis Group <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/rpt/asia-pacific/bangladesh/151-restoring-democracy-bangladesh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> the caretaker administration as “headed by technocrats but controlled by the military”, while then-army chief Moeen U Ahmed argued the political climate “was deteriorating very rapidly” and that the military’s intervention had “quickly ended” street violence.</p><p>It was only after 2009, when Hasina came back to power – her Awami League had first ruled between 1996 and 2001 – that the military became “subordinate to the civilian regime”, Rusho said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24203441938562-1769665076.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladeshi military force soldiers on armored vehicles patrol the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh, Saturday, July 20, 2024.

The interview, which critics described as something unprecedented for a serving army chief, placed the military close to the country’s central political debate.</p><p>Hossain, the former army officer and author, criticised the public nature of the intervention. “If he [Zaman] had discussed this after sitting with all the stakeholders … the interim [administration], political parties, protest leaders … and then gone to the media, that would be acceptable,” he said. “But here, he declared it unilaterally and blindsided the government from his position of power. He had no authority to do that.”</p><p>“You may say this is an extraordinary, transitional time and the military has a role to play,” Hossain added. “But then, why do we have an administration at all?”</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, said Zaman “came very close” to crossing the line and explained it as a product of military institutional culture after August 5. “Military organisations … like to follow standing operating procedures, order, stability,” he said. But August 5, he added, was “a political rupture” that forced the army and the nation into uncertainty: about the interim government’s longevity, legitimacy and how it would deal with the military.</p><p>Those anxieties, Shahan said, likely pushed Zaman to speak. In principle, he said, it is reasonable for the army chief to say elections are needed for stability. But “when he set a specific timeline – within 18 months – that is beyond his role”, Shahan said. “It then appears as if he is dictating.”</p><p>Shahan added that the problem becomes sharper when that kind of specificity appears to respond to a party demand; he was referring to a time when only the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was repeatedly pushing for a vote timetable.</p><p>Eight months later, in May 2025, Zaman again weighed in, telling a high-level military gathering, according to local media reports, that his position had not changed and that the next national vote should be held by December 2025. After that, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special adviser to Yunus, wrote on Facebook that “the army can’t meddle in politics” and argued that the military chief had failed to maintain “jurisdictional correctness” by prescribing an election deadline.</p><p>Around the same period, rumours emerged suggesting that <a href=\"/features/2025/5/24/why-is-bangladeshs-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-considering-resigning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yunus had considered resigning </a>amid political discord.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273212\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273212\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273212\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24226468280254-1769665174.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Military personnel stand in front of a portrait of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on July 30, 2024, during a national day of mourning to remember the victims of recent deadly clashes.

Human Rights Watch has described enforced disappearances as a “hallmark” of Hasina’s rule since 2009.</p><p>When the United States sanctioned the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in 2021 over allegations of extrajudicial killings, the US Department of the Treasury <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>, “These incidents target opposition party members, journalists, and human rights activists.” Critics argue that security institutions became central to governance, and questions about how that machinery was used are now part of the post-Hasina political settlement.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, said the Hasina-era legacy still echoes inside the top brass. “If you look at the leadership, the general, five lieutenant generals, and some major generals and brigadier generals, a lot of them were part of Hasina’s apparatus,” he said, “aside from a handful of professional officers”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://coied.portal.gov.bd/pages/publications/final-report-69662bc77746b8be8ee26287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> by Bangladesh’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances says disappearances were used as a “tool for political repression” and that the practice “reached alarming levels during key political flashpoints”, including in the run-up to elections in 2014, 2018 and 2024. The commission said it verified 1,569 cases of enforced disappearance.</p><p>In cases where political affiliation could be confirmed, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> and its student wing accounted for about 75 percent of victims, while the BNP and its affiliated groups accounted for about 22 percent. Among those “still missing or dead”, the BNP and its allies accounted for about 68 percent, while the Jamaat and its affiliates accounted for about 22 percent, the report said.</p><p>The commission also noted that the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), the military-run intelligence agency, had been “accused of manipulating domestic politics and interfering in the 2014 parliamentary elections”, and argued that perceived alignment with the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">Awami League</a> compromised its neutrality.</p><p>Several senior military officers, including 15 in service, are now facing trial in a civilian tribunal on charges of enforced disappearances, murders and custodial tortures.</p><p>The proceedings have become a delicate issue in civil-military relations, as cases against serving officers in civilian courts are rare in Bangladesh’s history.</p><p>Former army chief Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan wrote on Facebook that local media had reported disagreements over the “trial process” for officers accused of crimes against humanity and that those disagreements had created what he described as a “chasm” between the interim government and the army’s top leadership.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, however, said he disagreed. “These trials are not defaming the army,” Hossain said. “Rather, they are a kind of redemption for the institution to recover from the stigma created by the crimes of some self-serving officers.”</p><p>He argued that accountability could motivate younger officers and reduce the risk of the military being politically exploited again. Rusho, the retired brigadier general, also argued that politicisation under Hasina was driven less by formal doctrine than by executive control over careers.</p><p>“Promotions, important postings, placements … they were influenced considerably by the executive branch,” he said. “When you influence postings, some people’s loyalty often gets diverted to political masters, [and] it affects … professionalism and capability.”</p><p>Kean of the International Crisis Group said the real test for Bangladesh now would be whether it can stop the security state from being reabsorbed into partisan politics.</p><p>“The military is going to remain a powerful institution in Bangladesh, with a level of influence in domestic politics,” he said. “One hopes that the lesson of the past 18 months is that the military is better to support civilian administrations rather than be in power directly – that it can be a stabilising force, and one that is ultimately committed to democracy and civilian leadership.”</p><p>But, he added, the onus to do that isn’t only on the generals. Civilian politicians, too, needed to resist the temptation to misuse the military. That alone, he suggested, would help Bangladesh keep the army in the barracks and politicians accountable to the people, not to men in khakis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two parties had exchanged cross-border attacks since October 8, 2023, the day after a Hamas-led operation into southern Israel launched the Israel-Palestine war.</p><p>In September 2024, Israel unilaterally intensified attacks on Lebanon. In October, Israeli troops invaded south Lebanon and engaged Hezbollah in battles. By the time the ceasefire was agreed, Israel had killed nearly 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians.</p><p>Hezbollah had also been badly weakened as a military and political force in Lebanon, suffering the <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">assassination</a> of its charismatic, longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>Under the agreement, both sides were to cease their attacks, Hezbollah would withdraw to north of the Litani River, and Israel would pull its troops out of Lebanon.

Human Rights Watch said Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/israel-strikes-across-south-eastern-lebanon-in-latest-truce-violation\">systematically targeted reconstruction equipment</a> across southern Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Without the US support, however, analysts said they don’t see Israel being open to negotiations.

January 29:</p><h2 id=\"fighting\">Fighting</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The death toll from a Russian attack on a passenger train in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region on Tuesday rose to six, after the remains of several bodies were recovered from the wreckage, the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office said on the Telegram messaging app.</li>\n<li>At least six people were injured in a Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, the head of the regional military administration, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces attacked several locations across Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing a 46-year-old man and injuring at least two other people, the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Hanzha, said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>One person was killed in a Ukrainian attack on the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka in Russia’s Belgorod region, the regional emergencies task force reported, according to the country’s TASS state news agency.</li>\n<li>A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person in the city of Enerhodar, in a Russian-occupied area of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, Russia’s locally appointed official Yevhen Balitsky said, according to TASS.</li>\n<li>Fedorov has ruled out installing anti-drone netting as a mode of defence, saying that “there are more effective ways to combat Russian attacks”, Ukraine’s Ukrinform news agency reported.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"military-aid\">Military aid</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that France will deliver more “French aircraft, missiles for air defence systems, and aerial bombs” to Ukraine this year, following a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"regional-security\">Regional security</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at an event in Paris that a 2035 target for rearming Europe “would be too late”.</li>\n<li>“I think rearming ourselves now is the most important thing,” Frederiksen said. “Because when you look at intelligence, nuclear weapons, and so on, we depend on the US,” she added.</li>\n</ul><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Switzerland plans to inject an additional 31 billion Swiss francs ($40.4bn) into military spending starting from 2028 by increasing sales taxes for a decade.</li>\n<li>“The world has become more volatile and insecure, and the international order based on international law is under strain,” the Swiss government said, noting that other European countries have also been increasing their defence spending.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"politics-and-diplomacy\">Politics and diplomacy</h2><ul>\n<li>Vladislav Maslennikov, a top European Affairs official at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told TASS that restoring relations with the European Union will only be possible if European countries “cease their sanctions policy”, stop “pump[ing] weapons into the Kyiv regime, and sabotag[ing] the peace process around Ukraine.”</li>\n</ul><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>President Macron said at an event in Paris that European countries must focus on asserting their “sovereignty, on our contribution to Arctic security, on the fight against foreign interference and disinformation, and on the fight against global warming”.</li>\n<li>“France will continue to defend these principles in accordance with the United Nations Charter,” said Macron, who has <a

class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that negotiations over Ukraine’s Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas region that is now 90 percent occupied by Russian forces, are “still a bridge we have to cross” in talks between Russia and Ukraine.</li>\n<li>“It’s still a gap, but at least we’ve been able to narrow down the issue set to one central one, and it will probably be a very difficult one,” Rubio said.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"energy\">Energy</h2><ul>\n<li>Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that 639 apartment buildings in Kyiv remain without heat, with temperatures forecast to drop to -23 degrees Celsius (-9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) overnight this
