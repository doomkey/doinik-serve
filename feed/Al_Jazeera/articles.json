In one instance — Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting — the president’s eyelids appeared to droop, and he slouched forward, as if nodding off.</p><p>But in his Wall Street Journal interview, Trump blamed the media for creating false rumours. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink,” he said of the alleged sleeping incidents.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged to the newspaper that he had asked White House staff to slim down his schedule to focus on more important meetings, though he emphasised the decision had nothing to do with his alertness or stamina.</p><p>“I’ve never been a big sleeper,” Trump said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-02T184316Z_717141069_RC2H8IAHK1PY_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1767297319.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump closes his eyes while attending a cabinet meeting\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump attends a cabinet meeting at the White House on December 2, 2025 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"high-dose-of-aspirin\">High dose of aspirin</h2><p>One of the big revelations from the Journal’s interview was the high volume of aspirin Trump admitted to taking.</p><p>“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.”</p><p>Daily aspirin therapy is sometimes recommended to prevent a heart attack or stroke, particularly in older people.</p><p>But while the typical dosage starts at approximately 75mg, according to the Mayo Clinic, Trump told the Journal he consumes about 325mg per day — on the higher end of the spectrum.</p><p>“They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” Trump said of his doctors. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years.”</p><p>Trump credited the high aspirin regimen for causing easy bruising on his hands, another source of persistent public scrutiny. He explained that he turns to makeup to conceal when he has been “whacked again by someone”.</p><p>“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,” he said, citing a past incident when Attorney General Pam Bondi accidentally cut his hand with her ring.</p><p>Trump, an avid golfer, also confirmed to the Journal that he does not share the enthusiasm for exercise and fitness that cabinet members like Robert F Kennedy Jr or Pete Hegseth share.</p><p>“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump said. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”</p><p>Nevertheless, last August, Trump announced he would be relaunching the Presidential Fitness Test — a nationwide physical fitness test for grade-school students — in public schools. The test had been phased out in 2013 in favour of more inclusive fitness standards.</p><p>Members of Trump’s administration have also been criticised for fatphobic comments, particularly those directed at top military leaders with decorated service.</p><p>At a meeting in Quantico, Virginia, in October, Hegseth told hundreds of military leaders that “it’s tiring to look out at combat formations” and “see fat troops”, or enter the Pentagon and “see fat generals and admirals in the halls”.</p><p>Presidential fitness has been an increasingly pressing concern in the US political sphere, particularly since the tumult of the 2024 presidential election, which saw Biden drop his re-election bid less than four months before the vote due to questions about his age.</p><p>In a particularly disastrous June 2024 presidential debate, the then-81-year-old Biden appeared to struggle to complete his thoughts.</p><p>Trump, who has faced similar criticisms, blasted Biden as “Sleepy Joe” on the campaign trail and continues to invoke his Democratic rival’s competency as a contrast to his own.</p><p>Questions about ageing presidents, though, have long been a concern as older candidates take office.</p><p>Republican Ronald Reagan famously faced rumours about his competency, particularly as he ran for a second term in the 1980s. He was 77 years old when he left office, and by 1994, he announced he had Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>But Trump has consistently denied feeling the ravages of age, and in Thursday’s interview, he once again took the opportunity to credit his genes for his success: “I have very good genetics.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Three-quarters of those displaced from el-Fasher had already been displaced previously during the war.</p><p>The IOM also reports that more than 50,000 people were displaced from Sudan between October 25 and December 17.

Mohamud, who <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-strange-unexpected-somali-president\">told</a> Al Jazeera that Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: The resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden coast, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel.</p><p>Reports began circulating earlier this year that Somaliland was interested in assisting Israel’s widely condemned aim of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/somaliland-recognition-for-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-not-worth-it\">ethnically cleansing Palestinians</a>, as officials in Hargeisa pushed for recognition.</p><p>Somaliland’s foreign minister said no talks had taken place on the issue but stopped short of rejecting the possibility, unlike other countries rumoured to be of interest to Israel.</p><p>Only the final condition has been publicly acknowledged.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Somaliland would join the Accords, telling United States media outlet Newsmax he wanted to “support a democratic, moderate country, a Muslim country, that wants to join the Abraham Accords”.</p><p>Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent state last week, ending more than three decades of failed bids by the breakaway region of Somalia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cover-for-israeli-objectives\">‘A cover for Israeli objectives’</h2><p>Somaliland’s President Abdurrahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, is planning an official visit to Israel in the coming weeks, according to Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster.</p><p>Sources told Kan on Wednesday evening that the visit could take place as early as the second week of January, during which Abdullahi would formally join the Abraham Accords.</p><p>Netanyahu initially invited Cirro during a video call announcing the mutual recognition.</p><p>Somalia’s president warned that Israel’s recognition “was not merely a diplomatic gesture but a cover for specific, high-stakes Israeli strategic objectives”.</p><p>He claimed Israel would “export its problem in Gaza” to the Horn of Africa and described the move as opening “a box of evils in the world”.</p><p>Israel’s motives for suddenly recognising Somaliland remain unclear, though analysts point to the region’s strategic position at the gateway to the Red Sea, opposite Yemen’s Houthis, who imposed a naval blockade on Israeli-linked shipping before the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and fired rockets at Israel.</p><p>According to a November report by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base” for intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and “a platform for direct operations” against them.</p><p>The Houthis <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/any-israeli-presence-in-somaliland-will-be-a-target-houthi-leader\">said</a>

war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"condemnation-and-concerns\">Condemnation and concerns</h2><p>Somaliland’s foreign minister appeared to downplay regional concerns on Wednesday, telling Israel’s i24NEWS that while some countries “feel Israel establishing a relationship will cause their downfall”, such fears were unfounded.</p><p>The recognition has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/somalis-rally-against-israels-world-first-recognition-of-somaliland\">triggered</a> widespread anger across Somalia, with tens of thousands taking to the streets on December 30 in Mogadishu, Baidoa, Dhusamareb, Las Anod and other cities, waving Somali flags and demanding unity.</p><p>More than 50 countries <a

integrity should be respected.</p><p>Despite the backlash, Somaliland’s president expressed confidence on New Year’s Eve that “many more nations will soon formally recognise the Republic of Somaliland.”</p><p>The region declared independence from Somalia in 1991 during a civil war but has never secured international recognition, despite maintaining its own government, currency and
