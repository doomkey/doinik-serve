Most were interrogated on site and let go, but at least eight people were arrested and taken to Israeli military jails.</p><p class=\"s3\">At least nine Palestinians were detained in other military raids in Qalqilya, Jenin and Nablus. The Wafa news agency quoted local sources as saying on Saturday that two children and a woman were among five arrested at dawn in Qalqilya.</p><p class=\"s3\">Violent <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/israeli-army-settlers-struck-2350-times-in-west-bank-last-month-report\">raids by Israeli soldiers and attacks by armed settlers</a> have escalated since October 2023, with 47 army incursions taking place on average every day across the occupied West Bank in November.</p><p class=\"s3\">The mayor of Tammun told Al Jazeera that while the town in the Tubas governorate was subject to dozens of raids in the past couple of years, the ones this week were the worst in terms of scale, destruction and violence.</p><p class=\"s3\">He said that more than 1.5km (one mile) of roads have been torn up, water networks destroyed, private property vandalised and people severely beaten, repeating the pattern of other major Israeli military attacks across the occupied West Bank.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s3\">In the Jenin refugee camp, where Israeli soldiers have been advancing in a major offensive launched in January, Israeli bulldozers are making way for the demolition of at least 23 more Palestinian homes.</p><p class=\"s3\">This comes several days after they issued notices claiming that the demolitions were necessary to ensure “freedom of movement” for the Israeli forces within the camp – even though the area remains largely empty as most families have been displaced.</p><p class=\"s3\">The condemned buildings were home to 340 Palestinians. Only 47 of them, mostly women, were allowed to retrieve their belongings on Thursday.</p><p class=\"s3\">A member of the Jenin Refugee Camp Services Committee told Al Jazeera that residents were given two hours to collect possessions, and some could not even recognise their homes due to the level of destruction after the Israeli assault.</p><p>The armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad said on Friday its fighters carried out a series of attacks on Israeli soldiers during raids in Jenin and Tubas.</p><p>The group said its fighters in Tubas targeted an Israeli foot patrol with an antipersonnel explosive device in the Wadi al-Tayaseer area. Fighters detonated explosives against Israeli military vehicles in the al-Ziyoud and al-Bir areas of the town of Silat al-Harithiya in Jenin, it added.</p><p class=\"s3\">Since October 2023, Israeli soldiers have killed at least 1,086 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, including 223 children. At least 251 were killed in 2025.</p><p class=\"s3\">At least 10,662 Palestinians have also been wounded since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, with more than 20,500 rounded up. As of the beginning of November, there were 9,204 Palestinians in Israeli jails, 3,368 of whom are <a href=\"/news/2025/1/26/why-are-there-so-many-palestinian-children-in-israeli-prisons\">detained without charges</a>.</p><p class=\"s3\">Palestinian <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/palestinian-deaths-in-israeli-jails-surge-amid-gaza-war-report\">deaths have also surged</a> in the custody of both the Israeli army and the Israel Prison Service, with at least 94 deaths documented since October 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

After the 1975 invasion by Indonesia, he joined the resistance and would remain in the jungle to fight the Indonesians for almost a quarter of a century as a leader in FALINTIL (the Armed Forces for the National Liberation of East Timor).</p><p>Isolated from any outside assistance in the mountainous and jungle interior, and faced with the firepower of the US-backed Indonesian army, Ximenes said it was a struggle just to keep resisting.</p><p>“We had to find our own weapons to continue fighting, even to get food,” he said, recounting how FALINTIL fighters relied on the weapons taken from Indonesian soldiers killed in battle.</p><p>“If you have 10 or 20 guns, you’ve got to figure out how to use the guns to capture more guns,” he said, describing how fighters in his platoon would run to pick up not only weapons but “boots, food, ammunition and clothing” from slain Indonesian soldiers.</p><p>“As he shoots, he kills his target. There’s another soldier behind him without guns. He is the one that, as soon as he shoots, starts running to get the equipment,” he said.</p><p>“All this action would take only two or three minutes. Every shot, every bullet, is one kill. And by the three minutes, there will be a ceasefire, and we will collect what we need to collect and disappear,” he said.</p><p>“Metal Skin”, as he was then known due to his ability to survive many encounters with Indonesian forces, would not see his family for 24 years. He told Al Jazeera how the 1980s were a particularly difficult decade, when there was no international media attention and East Timor had no contact with the outside world.</p><p>He and his fighters, alone in the jungle, would receive just one letter a year from the political leadership of FRETILIN (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor), the political party of which FALINTIL was its armed wing.</p><p>It was during the 1980s that much of East Timor’s civilian population was forcibly displaced and starved; an <a href=\"https://cja.org/where-we-work/archives/timor-leste-east-timor/\">estimated 200,000 people died</a>, almost a third of the population, in what is widely considered a genocide.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4118848\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4118848\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4118848\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1999-08-07T120000Z_476293077_RP1DRIKYGWAA_RTRMADP_3_TIMOR-1763621899.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C498&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Falintil (Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor) soldiers drill at their guerrilla base in the Viqueque district in East Timor August 7.

Rather than instil fear, the outrages inspired many in FALINTIL to continue resisting, including the civilian villagers on whom the resistance relied for food, supplies and information about Indonesian troop movements.</p><p>“More villagers were willing to help us because of the atrocities against women,” he said. Despite the killing and torture, there were “more Timorese villagers that would like to support us and protect us, feed us and pass on information”.</p><p>After more than two decades of occupation and armed resistance, political advocacy by supporters abroad, and under pressure from the international community, the Indonesian government eventually agreed to hold a referendum to determine the first steps towards East Timor’s independence.</p><p>Then in 1999, a national vote was administered by the United Nations, and despite large-scale violence and intimidation from both the Indonesian army and collaborating local armed groups, 78.5 percent of East Timor’s voters cast their ballot in favour of independence.</p><p>By 2002, the long and bloody road to nationhood was complete.</p><p>While East Timor had finally achieved independence, the repercussions of Indonesia’s occupation remain deeply embedded in society.</p><h2 id=\"repercussions-kristina-siti-s-story\">Repercussions – Kristina Siti’s story</h2><p>Kristina Siti was no ordinary child growing up in Lospalos.</p><p>She was teased mercilessly by other children and shunned by adults because of her origins.</p><p>“They considered me an illegitimate child, an Indonesian child, a child without a father.

Last year, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison in the US after being extradited from Honduras on charges of drug trafficking.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Hernandez has been “treated very harshly and unfairly”. He cited “many people that I greatly respect”.</p><p>Trump also again threw his support behind Asfura, who is facing four opponents in the scandal-plagued race. No clear frontrunner has yet emerged.</p><p>He added that a loss for Asfura would lead to a rupture in US support for the country of about 11 million, echoing a similar threat he made in support of Javier Milei before Argentina’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">presidential election</a> in October.</p><p>“If he doesn’t win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Following Trump’s announcement that he would pardon Hernandez, Asfura told the news service AFP that he does not have any connections with the disgraced former president.</p><p>“I have no ties (with Hernandez),” Asfura told AFP in a phone call. “He was president of the Republic, the party is not responsible for his personal actions.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US president and several right-wing figures have previously accused Rixi Moncada, the candidate for outgoing President Xiomara Castro’s left-leaning LIBRE party, as well as Salvador Nasralla, of the centre-right Liberal Party, of being in the pocket of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Both candidates have rejected the claims, which come as Trump has increased pressure against Maduro. That has included surging US military assets to the region and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-says-us-will-soon-stop-venezuelan-drug-trafficking-by-land\">floating</a> possible land operations.</p><h2 id=\"drug-trafficking-conviction\">Drug trafficking conviction</h2><p>Despite Trump’s statements, the decision to pardon Hernandez sits uncomfortably with his administration’s pledges to target drug cartels and narcotic smuggling into the US.</p><p>That has included designating several cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” and launching strikes on alleged drug smugglers in international waters. Rights groups have said the attacks are tantamount to extrajudicial killings and likely violate both domestic and international law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During his trial, prosecutors accused Hernandez of working with powerful cartels to smuggle more than 400 tonnes of cocaine en route to the US.

Trump himself has used the device, particularly during his first term.</p><p>But Trump has had an acrimonious relationship with his Democratic predecessors, including Biden and former President Barack Obama.</p><p>He has trolled Biden in particular for his age and his use of the autopen while in office. After setting up a “presidential walk of fame” near the White House Rose Garden earlier this year, Trump replaced Biden’s portrait with a picture of the mechanical device.</p><p>He recently showed off the picture to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit this month.</p><p>Biden and Trump faced each other twice in presidential elections: once in 2020, when Trump lost, and once in 2024, when Biden dropped out of the race. Trump ultimately won the latter.</p><p>He has also consistently denied his defeat in the 2020 election, falsely claiming widespread voter fraud.</p><p>Trump has made other misleading and unfounded statements about Biden, including that White House staffers took advantage of the Democrat’s declining age to sign policy documents without his knowledge.</p><p>There is, however, no definitive proof that the autopen was used under Biden without his consent. Biden himself denied the allegation in a June statement.</p><p>“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency,” he wrote. “I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Trump revisited that allegation in Friday’s message on his platform Truth Social.</p><p>“The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him,” the Republican leader wrote.</p><h2 id=\"legal-arguments-undercut-trump-s-claim\">Legal arguments undercut Trump’s claim</h2><p>Friday’s announcement is the latest effort by Trump to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/trump-claims-california-election-was-rigged-is-he-correct\">frame</a> the actions of his political rivals as illegitimate.</p><p>In March, for instance, Trump posted a Truth Social message attempting to invalidate the pardons Biden issued before his departure from the White House.</p><p>Biden had controversially awarded “preemptive” pardons to politicians who served on a House select committee investigating Trump for his actions on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the US Capitol.</p><p>“The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, and OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” Trump wrote in March, reiterating familiar claims.</p><p>“Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!”</p><p>Legal experts largely dismissed the president’s post at the time as unconstitutional, as US law does not require presidential pardons to be signed in any given way — or even that they be written down.</p><p>A 2005 memo from the US Office of Legal Counsel also explains, “The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.”</p><p>It adds that using an autopen to “affix the President’s signature” to legislation — or “directing a subordinate” to do so — is considered acceptable.</p><h2 id=\"aging-while-president\">Aging while president</h2><p>Still, Biden did face significant public concern about whether <a href=\"/economy/2024/7/22/for-biden-the-economy-was-a-vulnerability-before-age-became-key-concern\">his age</a> had hindered his ability to carry out his duties, particularly in the final years of his four-year term.</p><p>A disastrous performance in the June 2024 presidential debate heightened those concerns, as Biden appeared stiff and struggled to maintain his train of thought.</p><p>Members of the Democratic Party afterwards pressured Biden to <a href=\"/news/2024/7/21/biden-pulls-out-of-us-presidential-race\">drop out</a> of the 2024 presidential race, a step he eventually took in July of that year.</p><p>Some critics have speculated whether Biden’s age diminished his ability to dedicate time and attention to areas such as foreign policy, giving senior staff members greater influence over policymaking.</p><p>This year, Biden revealed he has advanced prostate cancer, and he is currently undergoing radiation therapy.</p><p>Should Trump complete his second term, he will also be 82 years old, a few months older than Biden was at the end of his presidential term. Concerns about age and mental health have also dogged Trump’s time in the White House.</p><p>Just this week, The New York Times ran an article titled, “Shorter Days, Signs of Fatigue: Trump Faces Realities of Aging in Office”. It detailed instances where Trump appeared to fall asleep during public appearances and described how Trump has limited his public appearances during his second term.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115616545250020843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responded</a> on social media by calling the female reporter on the story “ugly” and posting that he had “aced” his physical and cognitive exams.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United Airlines said it was not affected.</p><p>The world’s largest A320 operator, American, in a statement said about 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft require the software replacement, and it expects the majority of those fixes to be “complete today and tomorrow”, with about two hours required for each plane.</p><p>Other airlines, including Germany’s Lufthansa, India’s IndiGo, and the United Kingdom-based easyJet, said they would temporarily take their planes out of service for the repairs.</p><p>Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 percent of its fleet, or about 100 jets, causing significant disruption over the next 10 days and prompting the airline to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.</p><p>Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, said it had been forced to cancel 65 flights on Saturday due to the recall. In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the country’s aviation regulator, ordered airlines to halt all Airbus A320 flights until they complete the required modifications.</p><p>Air India said its engineers were working “around-the-clock” to complete the software update and “hardware realignment” and that no cancellations had resulted and there was no “major impact on schedule integrity across our network”.</p><p></p><p>An Airbus spokesperson estimated that the repairs would affect approximately 6,000 jets in total, spanning several variants, confirming an earlier report by the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The temporary groundings for repairs for some airlines could be much longer, since more than 1,000 of the affected jets may also have to have hardware changed, the sources said.</p><p>The abrupt recall sent ripples around the world. In northern Europe, a Finnair flight was delayed almost an hour as pilots established which software version they had, a passenger said.</p><p>In Paris, Air France-KLM said it was cancelling 38 flights – 5 percent of the airline’s daily total. Mexico’s Volaris said it would be hit by delays or cancellations for up to 72 hours.</p><h2 id=\"largest-mass-recall\">Largest mass recall</h2><p>There are about 11,300 A320-family aircraft in operation, including 6,440 of the core A320 model, which first flew in 1987.</p><p>The setback appears to be among the largest mass recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.</p><p>The bulletin, seen by Reuters, traced the problem to a flight system called ELAC (elevator and aileron computer), which sends commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at the rear. These, in turn, control the aircraft’s pitch or nose angle.</p><p>The computer’s manufacturer, France’s Thales, said in response to a Reuters query that the computer complies with Airbus specifications, and the functionality in question is supported by software that is not under Thales’s responsibility.</p><p>Launched in 1984, the A320 was the first mainstream plane to introduce fly-by-wire computer controls.</p><p>It competes with the Boeing 737 MAX, which suffered a lengthy worldwide grounding after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, blamed on poorly designed flight control software.</p><p>Demand for the two main brands of workhorse jets has surged in recent years as economic growth led by Asia has brought tens of millions of new travellers into the skies.</p><p>Originally designed to serve hubs, the single-aisle models were later widely adopted by low-cost carriers. The connections they provide now represent a significant slice of the economy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ordered to turn back towards the building they had come out of by Israeli forces, they crawled back. They were then shot and killed at point-blank range.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Caught on camera, the incident on Thursday has elicited international outrage, and the promise of an investigation from the Israeli military. But for Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right Israeli Minister of National Security, the Israeli forces “acted exactly as expected of them – terrorists must die”.</p><p>That is because Israel has long had a policy of ‘shoot to kill’ when it comes to Palestinians, even when unarmed. And while the capture of the Jenin killings on camera has made the case particularly stand out, it follows a longstanding pattern of behaviour.</p><p>“The mindset that led to this has existed for a long time,” Tirza Leibowitz, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel, said. “It’s the product of years of separation, subjugation and occupation. Over the years, Israeli society has just gotten used to it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"history-of-violence\">History of violence</h2><p>Leibowitz pointed to the January 2024 killing of six-year-old <a href=\"/news/2024/6/23/israeli-tank-fired-at-hind-rajab-family-car-from-metres-away-investigation\">Hind Rajab</a> in Gaza, whose final hours were spent pleading for help over the phone with aid workers, as she sat in a car with family members who had already been killed by an Israeli attack. Rajab, along with the Palestinian ambulance team sent to rescue her, was later found dead.</p><p>Another incident from Gaza, echoing the killings in Jenin, in that it was caught on camera, was the <a href=\"/news/2024/3/28/israeli-soldiers-shoot-dead-two-unarmed-palestinian-men-in-gaza-video\">March 2024 killing of two unarmed men</a>, even after one of them repeatedly attempted to signal his surrender.</p><p>In 2018, there was the infamous case of <a href=\"/news/2018/12/11/israeli-killing-of-young-palestinian-unlawful-video-shows\">Mohammed Habali</a>, a mentally challenged man who was shot in the back of the head and killed while walking away from Israeli soldiers in Tulkarem. And in 2020, <a href=\"/features/2021/5/30/how-a-palestinian-man-with-autism-was-killed-by-israeli-police\">Eyad al-Halaq</a>, a Palestinian with autism, was headed to his special needs school when he was shot and killed by Israeli police in occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>The practice has also been deadly for Israelis. In December 2023, <a href=\"/news/2023/12/16/israeli-hostages-mistakenly-killed-in-gaza-were-had-a-white-flag-official\">three Israeli captives</a> had escaped in Gaza. As they attempted to surrender – with one of them holding a white flag – they were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers.</p><p>Israel often announces investigations into such incidents, but in the majority of cases – particularly when involving Palestinians – the shooters are allowed to go free. The killings are often justified as a necessary response to people deemed to be threats.</p><p>After years of such incidents, and little repercussion, critics say that it is not surprising to see the killings continue.</p><p>“It takes place with impunity,” said Leibowitz. “National courts sidestep it, saying it’s a security matter so they can’t intervene. That creates an onus on the international community to put checks on [Israel’s] impunity.”</p><p>“The only difference between those [previous incidents] and this most recent incident is that this time it was caught on camera,” Leibowitz said. “Israeli rights groups, such as Yesh Din and B’Tselem, had been documenting and following up on incidents like these for over a decade with little or no response from the media or public.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-one-cares\">‘No one cares’</h2><p>The killing of Abdullah and Asasa in Jenin is unlikely to cause a scandal in Israel. Accusations of torture, rape and the deliberate imposition of famine have previously dogged Israel throughout its genocidal war on Gaza, with little pushback from the Israeli public.</p><p>“No one cares. No one’s willing to comment,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament, said.</p><p>“Two weeks ago, on the same days that the UN was considering cases of torture against Israel, I tried introducing a private members bill criminalising torture,” she said. “I was attacked viciously by a government minister who said I was trying to tie the hands of the state of Israel in dealing with ‘terrorists’.”</p><p>“Essentially, he was saying that Israel uses torture and needs to keep doing so,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"torture\">Torture</h2><p>Accusations of the wholesale disregard for Palestinian life extend further than just the executions in Jenin.</p><p>A report to the UN committee, compiled by a number of Israeli rights groups, included evidence of Palestinians receiving medical treatment while shackled and blindfolded. Other instances detailed Palestinians being deliberately starved and being forced to wear nappies rather than be allowed access to toilets.</p><p>All the charges were denied by Israel.</p><p>According to the rights group Yesh Din, between 2018 and 2022 the Israeli army received 862 complaints about alleged offences by soldiers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. This is in addition to land appropriation, displacement and attacks by settler groups.</p><p>Investigators opened 258 criminal probes – about 30 percent – but only 13 led to indictments, involving 29 soldiers.</p><p>Just one case concerned a Palestinian killing. That means roughly 1.5 percent of complaints resulted in prosecution, and those complaints covered only part of the incidents Palestinians reported.</p><p>For fatal cases, the rate was even lower: one indictment out of 219 deaths brought to the army’s attention, or about 0.4 percent.</p><p>Over the period since, Israel has killed almost 70,000 people in Gaza, as well as having displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.</p><p>Writing on Friday, the UN’s Committee on Torture noted its alarm about reports indicating a “de facto State policy of organized and widespread torture and ill-treatment [of Palestinians] during the reporting period, which had gravely intensified since 7 October 2023”.</p><p>Most Israelis can go months or even years seeing Palestinians only through television coverage designed to stir fear and resentment, pointed out Shai Parnes, director of public outreach at the rights group B’Tselem. He described a process of apartheid and dehumanisation that accelerated after the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, before being weaponised by the government after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</p><p>“A country can’t carry out a genocide without a large part of its society either supportive of that genocide or indifferent to it. And it’s true that parts of Israeli society are genocidal, you can see it in the comments on the video of the soldiers in Jenin,” Parnes said.</p><p>“Israel has never paid any penalty for this,” he said. “These crimes can only happen with impunity. Lawmakers and decision makers need to be held to account. That’s not there. Anyone who harms a Palestinian, if it’s a soldier or a settler, does so with impunity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
