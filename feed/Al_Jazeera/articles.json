prompting France to condemn what it described as a “ridiculous provocation” by Moscow.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">The incident took place in the Oresund strait between Sweden and

carrier Charles de Gaulle, one of the Swedish Armed Forces’ vessels observed a drone taking off from a Russian signals intelligence ship,” the Swedish military said in a statement on Friday.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The Swedish Armed Forces can now confirm that a Russian drone has carried out an unauthorised flight,” it added.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Sweden’s Defence Minister Pal Jonson said “technical data” confirmed the origins of the drone as being the Russian vessel “Zhigulevsk”, noting also that the incident “constitutes a breach of Sweden’s access regulations and a violation of Swedish airspace”.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The Swedish Armed Forces responded firmly and professionally with countermeasures that disrupted the drone,” Jonson said.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">According to the AFP news agency, a Swedish navy vessel, HMS Rapp, used technical equipment to disable the drone about 13km (eight miles) from the French carrier.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Swedish forces took action when the Russian drone was deemed to be flying without authorisation.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Sweden said the Russian ship failed to comply with regulations governing transit through Swedish waters and HMS Rapp later escorted the vessel out of Swedish maritime territory into the Baltic Sea.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">The French carrier and its escort ships had docked in Malmo on Wednesday for a visit by the vessel to the Swedish port before taking part in NATO exercises.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Speaking on board the Charles de Gaulle on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that if Russian involvement was confirmed, “the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation”.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The drone was neutralised away from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and in no way was the security of the aircraft carrier and its group threatened,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said an investigation had been launched and suggested the timing was unlikely to be accidental.</p><p data-start=\"2296\" data-end=\"2499\">“It is a Russian way of acting that we recognise from other places,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2296\" data-end=\"2499\">Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegation, calling it “quite an absurd statement”.</p><p data-start=\"2501\" data-end=\"2598\">The Baltic Sea region has become an area of mounting tension between Russia and NATO countries.</p><p data-start=\"2501\" data-end=\"2598\">Several members of the NATO alliance – bordering and near to Russia – have reported a surge in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/21/poland-detains-suspected-saboteurs-amid-fears-of-russian-hybrid\">drone sightings</a> which have caused disruptions in recent months, with some

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On May 13, 1990, in Zagreb, two of Yugoslavia’s biggest football teams, Red Star Belgrade and the home team, Dinamo Zagreb, were set to play in the Maksimir Stadium of the Croatian capital. Among the excited Red Star fans riding on the train to Zagreb that day was a young law student named Aleksandar Vucic.</p><p>On the streets, fights began breaking out between rival fans. Cafe tables were flipped over, windows smashed. But the real ruckus erupted at the stadium, where Red Star fanatics, led by Serbian gangster Zeljko Raznatovic, aka Arkan, broke through the barrier holding them back and rushed at the Dinamo supporters, with punches and chairs thrown by both sides.</p><p>“They threw everything they had at us [until] there were no more chairs to hurl at each other,” Vucic <a href=\"https://vreme.com/mozaik/slucaj-maksimir-dvadeset-godina-posle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recounted</a> in a magazine interview 20 years later.</p><p>Dinamo supporters then stampeded the pitch, where their team jumped into the fray, assaulting police officers, and the game was officially called off before it began.</p><p>Over the next hour, authorities tried to restore order, playing soothing music over the loudspeakers to try to calm the mob. Two fire engines were dispatched to hose the fans, who pelted the trucks with stones.</p><p>Trading insults and fisticuffs are hardly unusual in football hooliganism, but the riots laid bare the ethnic fault lines that would soon lead to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.</p><p>“It was already a conflict between Serbs and Croats, not Red Star and Dinamo fans,” Vucic explained in the same interview. “Football is always just a reflection of what is happening in society.”</p><p>Maksimir exemplified the toxic nationalism and football hooliganism that have shadowed Vucic’s rise to dominate Serbian politics for more than a decade as prime minister from 2014 to 2017, and since then, as president.</p><p>As war raged through the former Yugoslavia, Vucic began his political career with a far-right group calling for a “Greater Serbia”. In 1995, merely days after Bosnian Serb forces perpetrated a genocide against Bosniaks, Vucic threatened to kill hundreds if outside powers intervened.</p><p>Two decades later, after founding a new, more centrist party, Vucic paid his respects to the Srebrenica victims and called the killings a “monstrous crime”. However, he has never recognised the crimes as a genocide and <a href=\"/news/2024/5/23/un-approves-resolution-to-commemorate-1995-srebrenica-genocide\">opposed the 2024 United Nations vote</a> establishing an annual remembrance day. Meanwhile, he has led negotiations for Serbia to join the European Union and strengthened ties with China and Russia. Since taking the presidency in 2017, he has consolidated power and curbed democratic freedoms.</p><p>Throughout, allegations of criminality have plagued his presidency – from football thugs to graft reaching the halls of power – as anticorruption <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/thousands-rally-in-serbia-as-students-continue-fight-against-corruption\">protests</a> continue into their second year.</p><p>Amid the antigovernment protests, what motivates his grip on power, and how does he see the world today?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335471\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335471\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2001-05-09T000000Z_143911293_RP2DRIKNCZAA_RTRMADP_3_SPORT-SOCCER-1771950980.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C581&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Red Star soccer fans fight each other during Yugoslav Cup final match against Partizan in Belgrade May 9, 2001.

The family left after Vucic’s grandfather, a prosperous merchant, was murdered by collaborators in 1941. He’d offended them by serving a keg of rakija (a strong Balkan brandy) to passersby outside his shop in solidarity with anti-German demonstrations in Belgrade.</p><p>The Ustase sought a Greater Croatia, attempting to achieve this by throwing Serbs, Jews and Roma into death camps. A violent Serb movement, the Chetniks, organised in response, but their own ambitions of a Greater Serbia led them to massacre Bosniaks and Croats, and eventually, to collaborate with the Nazis.</p><p>But it was Josip Broz Tito’s communist, multiethnic Partisans who ultimately prevailed against the Nazi occupation.</p><p>Tito went on to lead post-war Yugoslavia, refusing to be drawn into either camp during the Cold War. Yugoslavs were much freer and enjoyed a decent standard of living compared with their neighbours behind the Iron Curtain, and could easily travel abroad, including a young Vucic, who spent a year learning English in the British seaside town of Brighton in the late 1980s. It was, nevertheless, a dictatorship, where nationalism and religion were suppressed.</p><p>After the death of Tito – who was of Croat-Slovene descent – in 1980, his vision of a multiethnic Yugoslavia began crumbling. The Yugoslav army, as well as the central government in Belgrade, became increasingly dominated by Serbs led by strongman and eventual president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>It was around this time that Vucic, then in his late teens, got drawn into the football hooligan scene through his favourite team, Red Star, whose fans had a reputation as hardcore Serbian nationalists.</p><p>Vucic <a href=\"https://vreme.com/en/vreme/aleksandar-vucic-sam-o-sebi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">often</a> brings up this past. Once, he boasted of having been in 50 fights. “Even when I was beaten up around the stadium or in the stands, I never reported it to the police. I behaved like a slobbery [rascal] who still held onto his honour,” he told a Serbian tabloid.</p><p>According to a New York Times article about Vucic’s alleged underworld ties, after one particularly heated game in 1988, the future president and his friends went “hunting” for Albanians on the streets of Belgrade and got into a fight.</p><p>“I don’t like him now, but he was brave, brave in the fight,” said a self-professed hooligan who fought alongside Vucic that day.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3830179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3830179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3830179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP95071102157-1752154254.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Srebrenica live page\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3830179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Branizlav Saric, 47, helps his friend Mustafa Cemalovic, 40, who has just been hit by shrapnel from a mortar shell that exploded less than 90 metres (295 feet) from the UN’s main headquarters in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on July 11, 1995, during the city’s nearly four-year siege [Enric F Marti/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"kill-one-serb-and-we-will-kill-100-muslims\">‘Kill one Serb and we will kill 100 Muslims’</h2><p>The Yugoslav wars began in 1991, when Slovenia, followed by Croatia, and then Bosnia, declared independence. Common criminals became warlords as paramilitaries, such as <a href=\"/news/2014/12/9/arkans-balkan-tigers-escape-accountability\">Arkan’s Tigers</a>, backed by Milosevic’s government in Belgrade, committed atrocities against Bosniaks and Croats.</p><p>“Reports suggest that figures like Arkan recruited supporters directly from [football stadium] stands [into paramilitaries],” explained Sasa Dorđevic, a Serbia expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.</p><p>Bosnia – with its multiethnic population of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats – suffered the most.</p><p>From 1992 to 1995, the capital Sarajevo was besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, the longest siege in modern history, as they tried, but never succeeded, to take the city. Civilians ran for cover through the main boulevard of the city, nicknamed <a href=\"/features/2020/5/3/a-camera-doesnt-lie-documenting-besieged-sarajevo\">Sniper Alley</a>, dodging bullets fired from nearby hillsides.</p><p>Vucic, then a law student in Belgrade, felt isolated on campus due to the political landscape – then split between Milosevic’s government and the opposition. In 1992, he volunteered with Bosnian Serb forces for 40 days behind the front lines. What he did exactly remains a matter of contention. Jovana Polic, a Serbian journalist who directed two documentaries about Vucic, said he worked at the Bosnian Serb propaganda television station Kanal S in Pale.</p><p>“He claims to have interviewed [Bosnian Serb leader] Radovan Karadzic, and even managed to play a quick game of chess with [General] Ratko Mladic,” Polic said, emphasising that both men were later convicted of war crimes.</p><p>As commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Mladic orchestrated the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica genocide.</p><p>After returning from Bosnia, Vucic, then 23, found a political home with the far-right Serbian Radical Party.</p><p>A spiritual successor to the Chetniks, the Radicals’ chief platform was a “Greater Serbia” encompassing most of the former Yugoslavia.</p><p>A video from 1995 shows Vucic visiting Serb positions in the wooded valley around Sarajevo alongside the Radicals’ leader Vojislav Seselj, often described as Vucic’s “political father,” who <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2011/05/04/seselj-s-most-memorable-quotes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">once said</a> he’d scoop out Croats’ eyeballs with a rusty spoon.</p><p>In the clip, Vucic is seen carrying a long, thin object, speculated to be a rifle, which he has denied, claiming to have never fired a gun.</p><p>Vucic’s rise through the party was meteoric. In 1993, he was elected to parliament as the country’s youngest MP, and less than two years later, became the party’s general secretary.</p><p>Then, in July 1995, the worst atrocity in Europe since the second world war took place in <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/10/what-happened-in-the-srebrenica-genocide\">Srebrenica</a> in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb forces rounded up and systematically murdered more than <a href=\"/the-srebrenica-genocide-as-it-happened-30-years-ago/\">8,000 Bosniak men and boys</a>.</p><p>Just days later, speaking before Serbia’s parliament, Vucic warned against the interference of outside powers. “If you kill one Serb, we will kill a hundred Muslims,” he said.</p><p>Nevertheless, in late 1995, following NATO bombardment against Bosnian Serb forces, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia agreed to end the conflict by signing the <a href=\"/news/2020/11/20/dayton-25-years\">Dayton Accords</a>.</p><p>In 1997, Serbia held elections, and the Radicals, to the extreme right of Milosevic and his followers, joined his governing coalition.

But Kosovo, as the site of the 1389 battle between Serbs and Ottoman forces, holds immense <a href=\"/opinions/2019/8/26/why-kosovo-keeps-extending-blind-support-to-israel\">symbolic, patriotic value</a> in Serb national memory. In early 1998, clashes broke out between Albanian guerrillas and the Yugoslav army (now consisting of only Serbia and Montenegro).</p><p>At about this time, Vucic’s pragmatic, or perhaps opportunistic, approach became apparent. Despite publicly disparaging Milosevic in the past, Vucic accepted the post of minister of information in his government. He was 28.</p><p>Amid mounting opposition, Milosevic’s regime grew increasingly repressive, and Vucic oversaw what were, at the time, the tightest media restrictions in Europe.</p><p>Newspapers were held responsible for their interviewees’ words and could be heavily fined for printing what the government deemed untrue, effectively banning any suggestion that Serbian soldiers could have committed atrocities. Vucic took a very strict line, personally signing a letter to the <a href=\"https://www.danas.rs/dijalog/licni-stavovi/kako-je-vucic-zabranio-list-danas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newspaper, Danas,</a> warning it’d be shut down if they didn’t cease its critical, “defeatist” tone over the Kosovo war.</p><p>“Dismissals, intimidation and arrests of journalists became everyday occurrences; some independent media outlets were shut down or taken over by the state,” explained Polic.</p><p>“Mandatory censorship was also introduced. Editors would … submit the next day’s editions to the censors for approval.”</p><p>Vucic publicly defended this position, accusing the noncompliant media of working to bring about “the destruction of Serbia as an independent and free state and … the destruction of the entire Serbian people” at the behest of the United States.</p><p>After soldiers <a href=\"/features/2019/1/16/memories-still-fresh-villagers-remember-1999-racak-massacre\">massacred</a> 45 Albanian villagers in the village of Racak, NATO, fearing another Bosnia-style genocide, deployed its warplanes in March 1999.

The windows shook, but the players were unharmed. Vucic was one move away from winning, but Seselj took advantage of the impact to flip over the game board, denying victory to his protege.</p><p>In a news release, Vucic decried the “evil, terrible, subversive, cowardly attack by the NATO army on Serbia and Yugoslavia”.</p><p>“Serbia will defend itself against the aggressor and will defeat the enemy.”</p><p>But after two months of bombings, Milosevic capitulated, and Yugoslav troops withdrew from Kosovo, replaced by international peacekeepers.</p><p>For his services in silencing dissent, Vucic was awarded an apartment in Belgrade, but his new job wouldn’t last.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335281\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335281\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335281\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2000-10-23T000000Z_884645440_RP2DRHZTPSAB_RTRMADP_3_YUGOSLAVIA-GOVERNMENT-1771948350.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic (R) of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radicals is held by the Secretary General of the Serbia's ruling Socialist Party, Zoran Andjelkovic, as he argues with the parliament speaker Dragan Tomic, in Belgrade October 23, 2000.

Enraged, the opposition called for a nationwide strike.</p><p>The student-led Otpor (“Resistance”) movement protested in the streets, and even football hooligans had had enough, chanting, “Kill yourself, Slobodan!” at matches.</p><p>On October 5, a mob of protesters smashed a bulldozer through the front doors of RTS, the state-run broadcaster, before tearing the offices apart. Milosevic resigned that night.</p><p>While some celebrated the fall of Milosevic, Vucic remembered it as a very dark day.</p><p>By his own account, he was walking outside with his son when they were attacked by men high on drugs.</p><p>“I knocked them both out,” he stated in a 2003 interview.</p><p>“I went back to the house, and I knew, of course, that Serbia was going to enter years of decline and destruction.”</p><p>But the former editor of Pravda, a Serbian tabloid, once close to Vucic, claimed the future president spent that day quietly sitting at home, waiting to see what would happen next. Observers see the anecdote as bolstering a tough image.</p><p>Vucic’s party was out. The new democratically elected Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic tried to face up to Serbia’s role in the Yugoslav wars, speedily extraditing war criminals, including Milosevic.</p><p>Organised crime had flourished in the 1990s, when the government worked closely with smugglers to bypass wartime sanctions and prop up the economy. Djindjic, who tried to clean up the country from the Milosevic-era crime, was assassinated in 2003 by a gang of ex-Arkan’s Tigers (Arkan himself had already been shot dead in an underworld feud before he could face justice).</p><p>Djindjic’s centre-left Democratic Party governed Serbia for just under a decade. In this new, pro-Western Serbia, Vucic and the Radicals were back in the opposition. His “political father,” Seselj, had already been indicted in The Hague in 2003 for inciting ethnic cleansing.</p><p>During the manhunt for Hague fugitive Mladic in 2007, Vucic brought a sign to parliament reading “safe house for Ratko Mladic,” and stuck posters saying “Ratko Mladic Boulevard” along the Belgrade boulevard named after Djindjic. Vucic claimed he was “prosecuted only because he was defending his country”.</p><p>The following year, he led rallies against Radovan Karadzic’s arrest.</p><p>But by now, Vucic was realising that ultranationalism was no longer so popular, and his next steps would prove politically savvy. In September 2008, he defected from the Radicals to cofound the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), a more moderate party with aspirations of joining the EU. Observers argue he was guided by both ambition and pragmatism.</p><p>“He changed his clothes, removed Seselj from his lapel, put on a European suit and stepped into a new political chapter,” Polic explained.</p><p>He moderated his stance and highlighted how EU membership – the country formally applied in 2009 – was in the best interest of Serbia’s struggling post-war economy.</p><p>“He realised that with that radical position, you cannot get a majority in Serbia,” said Florian Bieber, professor of Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, Austria.</p><p>“So in that sense, he moderated his position for pragmatic reasons, because it’s more important for him to come to power than to promote that particular agenda.”</p><p>But it is unclear how far his beliefs have evolved. Vucic visited Srebrenica in 2015 and acknowledged that terrible crimes took place. “[It] is a move away from where he was ideologically 20 years ago or so,” Bieber said.</p><p>He, however, has repeatedly denied that it was a genocide.</p><p>Meanwhile, as Seselj raged at Vucic’s SNS from his prison cell, calling them traitors, Vucic rose in the polls.</p><p>By appealing to moderate, Eurocentric voters while keeping their nationalist base, the SNS became the dominant party in Serbia, winning key plebiscites in 2012 and 2014.</p><p>Vucic became prime minister after the 2014 elections, and in 2017, he <a href=\"/news/2017/5/31/former-pm-aleksandar-vucic-sworn-in-as-president\">won the presidency</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335435\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335435\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250902__736W476__v1__HighRes__ChinaPoliticsDiplomacy-1771950841.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) walks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic for a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on September 2, 2025.

Officials describe the president as a workaholic who only sleeps for three hours a night and routinely calls them at six o’clock in the morning.</p><p>“He’s incredibly intelligent, and everybody knows this about him … he’s very, very hardworking,” said Anthony Godfrey, the former US ambassador to Serbia from 2019 to 2022, who developed a close working relationship with Vucic.</p><p>A lot of the economic improvements came as a result of investment from China, which has poured billions of dollars into Serbian infrastructure through its Belt and Road Initiative. Vucic has visited China at least seven times, more than any other European leader.</p><p>“Vucic calls his relationship with China ‘the friendship made of steel’,” Godfrey told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Godfrey described Vucic, who he says is “six-foot-seven, easy,” as towering over everyone else in the room and making a “serious impression,” as well as being a skilled diplomat.</p><p>“He’s very respectful and humble when he meets with visitors. He’s a good host when people come to visit, and he genuinely wants to see what benefit a relationship can provide for Serbia.”</p><p>The president and the ambassador connected over their shared interests.</p><p>“One of his hobbies, or actually a passion I would say, is the study of wine. He’s an oenophile, and he’s got a collection of very fine wines … Serbia now produces good wine, and a lot of that is his passion coming through.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the ambassador added, Vucic has openly provided armaments to Ukraine, staving off criticism from the West over undemocratic practices. At the same time, he has refused to sanction Russia, asserting that “85 percent of Serbians will always side with Russia, whatever happens.”</p><p>Russophilia is common in Serbia, dating back to the 19th century when Russia, a fellow Slavic Orthodox nation, supported Serbia’s independence from the Ottoman Empire. More recently, the two countries share a suspicion of NATO and the West.</p><p>“He’s been trying to balance these competing global powers, which, of course, requires some level of skill considering the kind of global competition,” Bieber said.</p><p>But he also pointed to Vucic’s strategy of dodging EU demands that could threaten his hold on power. For instance, late last year, the EU expressed concern that a proposed judicial overhaul may undermine the rule of law and corruption investigations, at a time when prosecutors were probing high-ranking officials’ dealings with organised crime.</p><p>“When a country is a candidate for EU membership, as Serbia is, we expect it to behave in a European manner,” said EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos. “This is a serious step backwards.”</p><p>“It was said that Vucic must not sign, that Brussels ordered him not to. Someone ordering me? Anyone who thinks that is possible is not normal. I will listen to everyone, but I make the decisions,” the president fired back as he signed the proposal into law this year.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4091271\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4091271\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4091271\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-04T140657Z_2072381531_RC2QPHALEYLX_RTRMADP_3_EU-ENLARGEMENT-SERBIA-1762512440.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and European Council President Antonio Costa\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4091271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vucic is welcomed by European Council President Antonio Costa in Brussels, Belgium, on November 4, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Vucic has to maintain a delicate balance at home, too. While he may have once held together a big tent of Europhiles and nationalists, according to Godfrey, the president has come to rely on the latter, including Serbs living in Kosovo or Bosnia who are eligible to vote in Serbian elections.</p><p>“They are going to vote for Vucic, provided he still sings the right nationalist song,” Godfrey explained.</p><p>“So as long as he keeps saying ‘NATO bad, Kosovo is Serbia,’ things like that, the people on the right will continue to vote for him.</p><p>“But it’s pushing him to become even more extremist the more dependent he is on these votes.”</p><p>This doesn’t mean Vucic is a serious nationalist so much as an opportunist, according to Polic.</p><p>“When he is speaking to the West, he is a reformist who strives for peace. When he is speaking to his voters, he is a warrior, defending every inch of the land,” she said. “In reality, Kosovo is his political currency with which he pays for his survival on the throne.”</p><p>Vucic has <a href=\"/news/2023/1/24/serbia-under-western-pressure-to-reach-deal-on-kosovo-vucic-says\">not recognised</a> Kosovo’s 2008 declared independence, which Godfrey said would be extremely politically “costly”.</p><p>But some believe Vucic’s nationalist fervour is still very real.</p><p>Milos Injac, a local government representative for the Green-Left Front in Belgrade, considers figures like Seselj as useful stand-ins for Vucic’s real beliefs, which he says haven’t changed since the 1990s. Since his release from a Dutch prison in 2014, Seselj has become a public supporter of Vucic.</p><p>“I think he’s exactly the same as he was, but for the sake of looking normal and not having Europe breathing down his neck, he has his own goons that will say what he doesn’t want to say,” Injac said.</p><p>Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped public disillusionment with Vucic, culminating in mass anticorruption protests since 2024 that threaten his grip on power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3628080\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3628080\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628080\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-02T075223Z_2125263587_RC2PDDAG650Z_RTRMADP_3_SERBIA-PROTESTS-SOUND-1744027934.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters in Serbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3628080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A placard with a photo of Vucic is held as students and antigovernment demonstrators take part in a protest in Belgrade on March 15, 2025.

The majority of newspapers and TV stations are controlled by his allies, but independent media still exists in Serbia. Still, non-state-aligned journalists are threatened, harassed and occasionally assaulted, while oppositionists are smeared.</p><p>“If [the opposition] are talked about, they’re slandered,” said Bieber. “They’re called scum, foreign traitors, collaborators with external powers.”</p><p>“[Vucic] does not use the media — he owns them,” added Polic.</p><p>“He orders ‘exclusives’, makes targets out of people, with a standard dose of state paranoia. Criticism of him or the regime is translated into this machinery as treason, and any suspicion as hatred towards Serbia.”</p><p>After the broadcast of her documentary about Vucic, “The Ruler”, on Serbian television, for example, Vucic’s lawyers presented Polic with a lawsuit in 2023. There was an outcry, and Vucic announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing the lawsuit, which he claimed was filed behind his back.</p><p>The ongoing protest movement is demanding early elections before Vucic is officially due to step down in 2027.

Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime,” he said on Saturday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump made a number of other claims and predictions without any concrete evidence, as Iran promised a “crushing” retaliation of its own. Iran is preparing to “take revenge” on Israel and deliver “strong response”, State TV reported.</p><ul>\n<li>“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.”</li>\n<li>“We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region’s ‘terrorist’ proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world.”</li>\n<li>“We will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It is a very simple message.”</li>\n<li>“They will never have a nuclear weapon. This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces.”</li>\n</ul><p>Iran has repeatedly said it would never build a nuclear weapon and that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence, nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said sources told him that “US involvement in this attack is aimed at “decapitating the Iranian regime”.</p><p>“They say that from what they can understand, the attacks were concentrated on areas where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be sheltering, so the intention was to try and take out the head of the regime and then see what would happen afterwards,” he added.</p><p>One of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, The Associated Press reported. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.</p><p>“There are countries that have been cautioning the US against this attack and wanted to know what the plan for the day after would be, simply because you can’t guarantee that by removing the supreme leader you would necessarily form a pro-US government,” Fisher said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel have <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/28/live-israel-launches-attacks-on-iran-multiple-explosions-heard-in-tehran\">launched an attack on Iran</a>, with explosions heard and seen across Tehran.</p><p>Several missiles have struck University Street and the Jomhouri area in Tehran, Fars news agency reported. Smoke was seen rising in the city, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent on the ground.</p><p>Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported that explosions also occurred in Tehran’s northern Seyyed Khandan area. Other Iranian media reported attacks nationwide, including in the western Ilam province.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said the joint attacks are aimed at “eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime”.</p><p>“Short time ago, US military began major combat operation in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime,” he said.</p><p>An Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran ⁠is preparing ⁠for retaliation that is set ⁠to be ⁠”crushing”. Iran is preparing to “take revenge” on Israel and deliver “strong response”, State TV reported.</p><p>Explosions rocked northern Israel as the country worked to intercept incoming Iranian missiles shortly after it launched the attack on Iran. The blasts echoed just after the Israeli military said it would be using its air defence systems to bring down the Iranian fire. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.</p><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks on Iran aimed to remove an “existential threat”. Netanyahu projected that “joint action” by Israel and the US “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands” and praised Trump for his “historic leadership”.</p><p>A US official told Al Jazeera earlier that the attacks were carried out as a joint military operation between Israel and the US, which has assembled a vast fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region to try to pressure Iran into a deal over its nuclear programme. A US official told Reuters that attacks were being carried out by air and sea.</p><p>One of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reported The Associated Press. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Maziar Motamedi, reporting from Tehran, said cellphone communications have been disrupted in several areas of the capital. “No calls are possible at present,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sirens-in-israel\">Sirens in Israel</h2><p>As sirens sounded and a state of emergency was declared in Israel, the Israeli military said it had issued a “proactive alert to prepare the public for the possibility of missiles being launched toward the state of Israel”.</p><p>The Israel Airports Authority announced its airspace had been closed to all civilian flights and urged the public not to come to the airport.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ⁠US embassy in Qatar ⁠implemented shelter-in-place for ⁠all personnel, recommending that all of ‌its citizens do the same until further notice. Iraq’s Ministry of Transport said ⁠it had closed its national airspace.</p><p>According to an Israeli defence official quoted by Reuters, the attacks had been planned for months and the ⁠launch date ⁠decided ⁠weeks ago, even as the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iran-says-us-must-drop-excessive-demands-in-nuclear-negotiations\">US and Iran carried out negotiations</a>.</p><p>Mehran Kamrava, director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies and professor at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Israel “appears to have launched an attack designed to derail the negotiations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4345034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4345034\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4345034\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-IRAN-ATTACKS-BY-ISRAEL-FEB28-2026-1772267240.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - IRAN ATTACKS BY ISRAEL - FEB28 2026-1772267240\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4345034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

That payment was a sign things are improving in Aden – the salaries are funded by Saudi Arabia as a way of backing the Yemeni government, which has recently arrived to take control of Aden after the defeat of secessionist forces.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But problems and instability are never far away in Yemen.</p><p>Just as soon as the children, Amjad, 10, and Mona, 7, began trying on their outfits, the sound of gunfire erupted. Shoppers froze. Amjad and Mona clutched their father, asking to leave.</p><p>About 3km (2 miles) away, security forces had opened fire on protesters who attempted to breach the gates of al-Maashiq Palace, where members of the Yemeni government have been based since they <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/new-yemen-government-formed-with-shaya-mohsin-al-zindani-as-prime-minister\">arrived</a> from Riyadh a week ago.</p><p>The gunfire shattered the family’s moment of joy.</p><p>“It ruins your joy when you see a person bleed and robs you of peace when you hear prolonged gunfire,” Abu Amjad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>After years of operating from exile, Yemen’s Saudi-backed, UN-recognised cabinet is spending Ramadan in Aden, a move that has coincided with improvements in basic services and a renewed sense of relief. Yet that relief was overshadowed by the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/one-killed-11-injured-in-yemen-after-security-forces-disperse-stc-storming\">deadly confrontation</a> between security forces and antigovernment protesters, in which at least one person was killed.</p><p>“That was the first clash after the return of the government to Aden. Our concern is that it may not be the last,” said Abu Amjad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"government-wins\">Government wins</h2><p>Yemen’s new Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/new-yemen-government-formed-with-shaya-mohsin-al-zindani-as-prime-minister\">Shaya al-Zindani</a> has said that stabilising Aden and other areas under government control was among the new government’s main priorities.</p><p>The Yemeni government is currently in its strongest position for years. An advance by the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) at the end of last year in eastern Yemen ultimately was a step too far for the United Arab Emirates-backed group.</p><p>Saudi Arabia considered the STC advance the crossing of a red line, and lent its full military backing to the Yemeni government, allowing it to take territory it had not controlled for years.</p><p>Now, the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia are focused on attempting to improve conditions in the southern and eastern areas of Yemen under government control, to attract more public support. That would in turn weaken support for both the STC and the Houthi rebels, who have controlled northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, since the country’s war began in 2014.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"lit-city-and-busy-markets\">Lit city and busy markets</h2><p>Abdulrahman Mansour, a bus driver and resident of Khormaksar in Aden, said Ramadan this year feels different.</p><p>“When I see the lights on and the markets busy on Ramadan nights in Aden, it feels like a different city. The improvement is undeniable,” Mansour, 42, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He noted that one distinct difference this Ramadan is the stable provision of electricity. “This reminds me of the pre-war time. We used to take that service for granted,” said Mansour.</p><p>“When the city is dark at night, it appears gloomy, and families prefer to stay home. The movement of people brings life to the city and helps small businesses keep afloat, especially in Ramadan,” Mansour added.</p><p>Yemeni Electricity Minister Adnan al-Kaf said last week that efforts to improve electricity services in Aden and other provinces continue, noting that Saudi support had contributed to improved service over the past two months.</p><p>Wafiq Saleh, a Yemeni economic researcher, said the improvement in the living standards of citizens in Aden and <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/20/is-southern-yemens-next-phase-being-decided-on-the-ground\">southern Yemen</a>, in general, was obvious, particularly after Saudi Arabia’s payment of public sector salaries and the supply of basic services such as water and electricity.</p><p>Saleh told Al Jazeera, “The recent Saudi financial support has been very generous, and it can help the government during this period by enabling it to work on reactivating dormant resources, resuming oil exports, combating corruption, and improving the efficiency of revenue collection with transparency and good governance.”</p><p>But Saleh emphasised that the progress achieved so far is not the result of economic reforms by the Yemeni government, but rather because of Saudi support.</p><p>Therefore, according to the economist, the improvement in the living situation and the currency’s value may not be sustainable, even if it is a positive indicator and may be the first step towards promised economic reforms in the country.</p><p>“There must be a comprehensive vision for developing revenue collection so that the government can implement sustainable economic reforms,” Saleh said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"search-for-cooking-gas\">Search for cooking gas</h2><p>While the distribution of electricity has improved in Aden, other essential services remain strained. Cooking gas shortages remain a major concern. The search for it remains a daily struggle for families in the port city, and the crisis has intensified in Ramadan.</p><p>Lines of vehicles queue at stations, while residents wait with cylinders for a few litres (quarts) of gas.</p><p>“Going from one station to another in search of cooking gas while fasting is exhausting,” said Fawaz Ahmed, a 42-year resident of Khormaksar district.</p><p>Fawaz describes the shortage of cooking gas as a cause of hunger in the city. “If I stay in [my home] village, I would resort to firewood. But in the city, that option is not available, and if we find firewood in the market, it is expensive.”</p><p>Gas distributors say the quantity of cooking gas supplied to them is not adequate, citing this as the root cause of the crisis. Supplies are transported from Marib province in northern Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tensions-to-continue\">Tensions to continue</h2><p>The cooking gas shortage is a sign that it will not be plain sailing for the Yemeni government in Aden.</p><p>And opponents will likely seize on any ongoing problems to foment more unrest.</p><p>Majed al-Daari, editor-in-chief of the independent Yemeni news site Maraqiboun Press, described the situation in Aden as “very worrying”.</p><p>“What happened to the demonstrators at the start of Ramadan underscores the fragility of the political and security situation. Tensions are set to continue,” al-Daari said.</p><p>“The STC will continue mobilising its supporters against the government. This is its last card that it will use to restore lost political interests,” al-Daari added.</p><p>The STC said in a statement last week that raids and arbitrary arrests had targeted people who had participated in the recent protests. These attacks, the statement emphasised, would only increase the determination of the southerner secessionists.</p><p>For Abu Amjad,  demonstrations in Aden give space to chaos, which he resents.</p><p>“At least, Ramadan should pass without protests. Political actors should spare us this month so we can fast and share some joy with our children,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

our reach … if we just allow diplomacy the space it needs to get there,” Al Busaidi said in an interview with CBS News in Washington, DC, after Oman brokered the third round of indirect talks between the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/us-iran-talks-conclude-claims-progress-few-details\">US and Iran in Geneva on Thursday.</a></p><p>“If the ultimate objective is to ensure forever that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb, I think we have cracked that problem through these negotiations by agreeing [on] a very important breakthrough that has never been achieved any time before,” Al Busaidi said.</p><p>“The single most important achievement, I believe, is the agreement that Iran will never ever have nuclear material that will create a bomb,” he said.</p><p>“Now we are talking about zero stockpiling, and that is very, very important because if you cannot stockpile material that is enriched, then there is no way that you can actually create a bomb,” he added.</p><p>There would also be “full and comprehensive verification by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]”, he said, referring to the UN’s nuclear watchdog.</p><p>Oman’s top diplomat also said Iran would degrade its current stockpiles of nuclear material to “the lowest level possible” so that it is “converted into fuel, and that fuel will be irreversible”.</p><p>“This is something completely new. It really makes the enrichment argument less relevant, because now we are talking about zero stockpiling,” Al Busaidi said.</p><p>Regarding recent US demands regarding Iran’s missile programme, Al Busaidi said: “I believe Iran is open to discuss everything”.</p><p></p><p>Asked if he thought enough ground was covered in the most recent talks in Geneva to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/marco-rubio-plans-israel-trip-as-trump-says-hes-not-happy-with-iran-talk\">hold off a US attack on Iran</a>, the minister said, “I hope so.”</p><p>“We have really advanced substantially, and I think, obviously, there remains various details to be ironed out, and this is why we need a little bit more time to really try and accomplish the ultimate goal of having a comprehensive package of the deal,” he said.</p><p>“But the big picture is that a deal is in our hands,” he added.</p><p>The foreign minister’s comment followed after he <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/omans-foreign-minister-meets-with-uss-vance-as-middle-east-tensions-rise\">met earlier on Friday with US Vice President JD Vance</a> and as US President Donald Trump continued to sabre-rattle while at the same time declaring he favoured a diplomatic solution with Tehran.</p><p>Trump said on Friday that he was not happy with the recent talks that concluded in Geneva.</p><p>“We’re not exactly happy with the way they’re negotiating,” Trump told reporters in Washington, adding that Iran “should make a deal”.</p><p>“They’d be smart if they made a deal,” he said.</p><p>Trump later said that he would prefer it if the US did not have to use military force, “but sometimes you have to do it”.</p><p>The US and Iranian sides are expected to meet again on Monday in Vienna, Austria, for more indirect negotiations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Defendants like former CNN anchor <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/journalist-don-lemon-arrested-in-connection-to-minnesota-ice-protest\">Don Lemon</a> and reporter Georgia Fort say they attended in their capacity as journalists.</p><p>Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have publicly questioned whether their prosecution is an attempt to curtail freedom of the press.</p><p>The superseding indictment, filed on Thursday, levies two counts against the 39 defendants, accusing them of conspiracy against the right of religious freedom and efforts to injure, intimidate or interfere with the exercise of religious freedom.</p><p>“While inside the Church, defendants collectively oppressed, threatened and intimidated the Church’s congregants and pastors by physically occupying the main aisle and rows of chairs near the front of the church,” the indictment reads</p><p>It also describes the protesters as “engaging in menacing and threatening behavior” by “chanting and yelling loudly” and obstructing exits.</p><p>A magistrate judge on January 22 initially rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to charge nine attendees who were at the protest.</p><p>But the department sought a grand jury indictment instead, which was filed on January 29 and made public the next day.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-reaction-to-trump-s-immigration-surge\">A reaction to Trump’s immigration surge</h2><p>The protest, dubbed “Operation Pullup”, was conceived as a response to the violent immigration crackdown that had unfolded in Minnesota.</p><p>Many of the enforcement efforts centred on the metropolitan area that includes the Twin Cities: St Paul and Minneapolis.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/ice-ilhan-omar-and-somalis-unpacking-trumps-obsession-with-minnesota\">had repeatedly blamed</a> the area’s large Somali American population for a welfare fraud scandal involving government funds for programmes like Medicaid and school lunches.</p><p>In December, the Trump administration surged federal immigration agents to the region, nicknaming the effort Operation Metro Surge. At its height, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/us-border-security-chief-withdrawing-700-immigration-agents-from-minnesota\">as many as 3,000 agents</a> were in the Minneapolis-St Paul area.</p><p>But the effort was plagued by reports of excessive violence towards detainees and protesters alike. Videos circulated of officers breaking the car windows of legal observers, pepper-spraying protesters and beating people.</p><p>Officers also engaged in the practice of entering homes forcibly without a judicial warrant, which advocates described as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Cases of unlawful arrests were also reported.</p><p>But a turning point came on January 7, when an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was caught on camera shooting into the vehicle of 37-year-old mother <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/who-is-renee-nicole-good-the-woman-killed-in-the-ice-minneapolis-shooting\">Renee Good</a>. She died, and her killing triggered nationwide protests.</p><p>Operation Pullup took place at Cities Church in St Paul less than two weeks later.</p><p>It was intended as a demonstration against the church’s pastor, David Easterwood, who serves as a local official for ICE.</p><p>Several protesters have indicated that they are prepared to fight the government’s charges over the incident, citing their First Amendment rights to free speech.</p><p>Some also said that they intended to remain vigilant towards government immigration operations, even after Trump administration officials announced Operation Metro Surge <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/12/us-border-chief-says-ending-ice-deportation-surge-in-minnesota\">was winding down</a> in mid-February.</p><p>“This is not the time to be Minnesota Nice,” one protester, civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, wrote on social media last week. “It’s time for truth, justice, and freedom to prevail.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump’s directive came during a weeks-long feud between the Pentagon and the San Francisco-based startup over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.</p><p>Spokespeople for Anthropic, which has a $200m contract with the Pentagon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Trump’s decision stopped short of threats issued by the Pentagon, including that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic’s compliance.</p><p>The Pentagon had also said it considered making Anthropic a supply-chain risk, a designation that previously targeted businesses tied to foreign adversaries.</p><p>Trump’s comments came just over an hour before the Pentagon’s deadline for Anthropic to allow unrestricted military use of its AI technology or face consequences – and nearly 24 hours after CEO Dario Amodei said his company <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-ai-pentagon-hegseth-dario-amodei-9b28dda41bdb52b6a378fa9fc80b8fda\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\">“cannot in good conscience accede”</a> to the Defense Department’s demands.</p><p>Calling the company “left-wing nut jobs”, the president said Anthropic made a mistake trying to strong-arm the Pentagon. Trump wrote on Truth Social that most agencies must immediately stop using Anthropic’s AI, but gave the Pentagon a six-month period to phase out the technology that is already embedded in military platforms.</p><p>“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump wrote.</p><p>At issue in the defence contract was a clash over AI’s role in national security. Anthropic had said it sought narrow assurances from the Pentagon that Claude won’t be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons. But after months of private talks exploded into public debate, it said in a Thursday statement that new contract language “framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will”.</p><p>Trump threatened further action if Anthropic did not cooperate with the phaseout. Trump warned he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow” if Anthropic did not help in the phaseout period.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threatening-move\">‘Threatening’ move</h2><p>The setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.</p><p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customised models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p><p>Its product, Claude, is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p><p>US Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticised the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p><p>“The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.”</p><p>The conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet’s Google protested the Pentagon’s use of the company’s AI to analyse drone footage, straining relations between Silicon Valley and Washington. A rapprochement ensued, with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jostling for defence business, and still more CEOs pledging cooperation last year with the Trump administration.</p><p>The dispute stunned AI developers in Silicon Valley, where a growing number of workers from Anthropic’s top rivals, OpenAI and Google, voiced support for Amodei’s stand in open letters and other forums.</p><p>“The Pentagon is negotiating with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” says the open letter from some OpenAI and Google employees. “They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in.”</p><p>And in a surprise move from one of Amodei’s fiercest rivals, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday sided with Anthropic and, in a CNBC interview, questioned the Pentagon’s “threatening” move, suggesting that OpenAI and most of the AI field share the same red lines. Amodei once worked for OpenAI before he and other OpenAI leaders quit to form Anthropic in 2021.</p><p>“For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety,” Altman told CNBC.</p></div></div></body></html>"
