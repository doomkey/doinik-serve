The men are dressed in black, wearing tactical vests with patches bearing the emblem of a bogatyr – a mythic warrior of Slavic folklore – riding on horseback.</p>\n<p>They inform the traders, who they believe to be foreigners, that they are trading without a permit, and the black-clad men help load their goods into a van to be confiscated by the authorities.</p>\n<p>But these men-in-black have no official position in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>A video of this operation was uploaded online on Monday morning by the Russian Community, or Russkaya Obshchina (RO), who boasted of shutting down an “oriental bazaar”.</p>\n<p>Since the invasion of Ukraine, the RO has become the largest and most influential ultranationalist organisation in Russia, with 1.2 million subscribers to its official YouTube page and more than 660,000 readers on its main Telegram channel, as well as its own app, and enjoys support from powerful allies within the clergy and security services.</p>\n<p>“This is a classic movement of Russian ethnic nationalists,” says Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Centre, which monitors hate movements in Russia.</p>\n<p>“There used to be [the slogan] ‘Russia for Russians’, but now that is considered too radical. But in essence, this is what it is about,” he says.</p>\n<p>RO also claims to stand for conservative moral and religious values, and steadfastly supports the Kremlin, including in its invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>“These points define their entire ideology… There have always been nationalists, but the fact that the largest and most prominent Russian nationalist organisation is fully loyal to the government – this is an unusual situation.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857893\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857893\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857893\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2022189386-1753521317.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Novosibirsk\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An aerial view of Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia with the Church of the Archangel Michael [Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"folk-singing-and-a-stream-of-anti-immigrant-messages\">Folk singing and a stream of anti-immigrant messages</h2>\n<p>RO was founded five years ago by Omsk politician Andrey Tkachuk, anti-abortion rights activist Yevgeny Chesnokov and Andrey Afanasyev, a host on the TV channel Spas, which is owned by the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>\n<p>One member told the BBC last year that the idea was to create solidarity among Russians themselves, as other, tightly-knit ethnic communities in Russia already look out for each other, for example, Chechens or Armenians.</p>\n<p>As such, many of the Community’s activities are benign: Helping each other out with flat tyres, or organising festivities on Orthodox holidays such as Maslenitsa (Butter Week), with folk singing and dance performances in the run-up to Easter.</p>\n<p>But an examination of RO’s various Telegram groups reveals a narrow focus on ethnic Russian interests, to the exclusion of Russia’s other non-Slavic groups – although there are a handful of minority members – and a stream of anti-immigrant content.</p>\n<p>“The blacks will devour everything in their path if the Slavs do not unite to somehow defend their borders and values,” a young female follower of the Community’s Saratov branch, who can’t be named for fear of repercussions, told Al Jazeera, using a derogatory slur.</p>\n<p>The group’s other activities include vigilantism, often with the open or tacit support of the authorities, observers say.</p>\n<p>According to Verkhovsky, there are a number of tactics to target immigrants and other minorities. One is filing official complaints and making denunciations to authorities against what it deems immoral, such as homosexuality or abortion or “Russophobic behaviour”. Neither of the former are technically illegal in Russia, but there are laws against “propaganda” related to LGBTQ and “childfree” themes.</p>\n<p>Another tactic is raids, such as the one on watermelon sellers in Novosibirsk. “In the case of migrants, these are places where migrants live or work,” Verkhovsky explains.</p>\n<p>Members of the Russian Community or similar vigilante groups, for example, the smaller group Northern Man, typically appear where immigrants are working and find some sort of “violation” – in the case of the Novosibirsk watermelon stall, unlicensed trading. They then detain the alleged violators and hand them over to the police.</p>\n<p>“In principle, more or less any citizen can complain to the Russian Community and say he’s been offended by some ‘bad’ people,” says Verkhovsky.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, these ‘bad’ people are not Russian, and the person complaining is Russian. And then the Russian Community will go to protect him.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the group accompanies police on joint operations as “volunteers”, though this is rarer. Verkhovsky noted that attitudes towards RO by different police departments vary, and, while some seem to welcome the group, in other cases, officers have brought charges against Community members – only for prosecutors to drop them.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857909\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857909\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857909\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2594443521-1753522191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russian Community\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857909\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The flag of the Russian Community (RO) features at a street festival in the city of Borovsk, Russia, on August 24, 2024 [Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"standing-up-to-a-crime-wave\">Standing up to a ‘crime wave’?</h2>\n<p>The vigilantes claim they are standing up to an “immigrant crime wave”.</p>\n<p>There is crime among foreigners in Russia: For instance, Georgians make up more than half of the “thieves-in-law”, an elite fraternity in the criminal underworld. Brawls and beatings involving gangs of young immigrant men often make headlines.</p>\n<p>However, these well-publicised incidents and individuals contribute only a small part of the overall crime statistics in Russia. According to Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, foreigners committed just 2 percent of all reported crime nationwide last year, while comprising roughly 4 percent of the population.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Valentina Chupik, a lawyer who offers free legal help to migrants, told Al Jazeera that a substantial portion of these offences are related to improper paperwork, rather than victimising Russians.</p>\n<p>“These crimes [missing paperwork] are the inevitable consequence of the organisation of illegal migration, which are committed by homeowners who rent apartments to migrants, but do not fulfil the obligation established by law to register them there,” she says.</p>\n<p>As well as immigrants, RO campaigns against alleged immorality and “fifth-columnists” in Russian society. As a human rights advocate, Chupik is considered to be one of these fifth-columnists and has become used to receiving threats and obscenities, including from RO supporters.</p>\n<p>“They threaten me regularly,” she says.</p>\n<p>“My employees are also threatened, as well as volunteers. They sometimes have posts in their Telegram groups mentioning me. After that, they write to me and call me.”</p>\n<p>Messages seen by Al Jazeera tell Chupik, “there’s a special spot for you in hell” and to “wait for the bottle”, alluding to sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera contacted multiple representatives of RO for comment, but did not receive any response.</p>\n<p>Since a <a href=\"/news/2024/3/23/moscow-concert-hall-attack-why-is-isil-targeting\">deadly attack</a> on a Moscow music venue last year by ISIS-affiliated gunmen, there has been an <a href=\"/features/2024/4/9/after-deadly-attack-russias-central-asian-workers-report-rising-racism\">upswing</a> in xenophobia. The police have ramped up arrests and other restrictions on immigrants, especially those from Central Asia. Verkhovsky says it is hard to tell to what extent the public is actively hostile towards immigrants, but polling indicates concerns about immigration have sharply escalated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-the-war-gain-acceptance\">Support the war; gain acceptance</h2>\n<p>In the 2000s, Russia suffered a <a href=\"/features/2015/9/23/behind-russias-ultra-nationalist-crackdown\">scourge</a> of far-right-wing violence, peaking in 2008 when skinhead gangs carried out 110 racist murders nationwide. In one particularly grisly episode, a Tajik and a Dagestani were shot dead and beheaded on camera in a woodland near Moscow. In 2022, two men were finally convicted of the double homicide after a third suspect, already imprisoned, incriminated them in his suicide note.</p>\n<p>For a time, available outlets for xenophobic sentiment dried up somewhat.</p>\n<p>“In the 2010s, the authorities greatly suppressed this movement and almost all these organisations either stopped their activities or were simply eradicated,” Verkhovsky explained.</p>\n<p>“And people who wanted to share these ideas and wanted to take part were either afraid or just did not know where to go at all.”</p>\n<p>Some far-right activists moved to Ukraine, where they found <a href=\"/news/2022/2/16/the-russians-going-against-putin-in-ukraine\">common cause</a> with like-minded locals.</p>\n<p>But RO is a new phenomenon. It prefers to work alongside the authorities, largely forsaking the thuggery of old. And its brand of nationalism aligns with the Kremlin, supporting the invasion of Ukraine and actively fundraising for soldiers and their families. In interviews, founder Andrey Tkachuk has even denied the existence of Ukraine’s national identity.</p>\n<p>“The state’s tolerance towards any groups that support the [war] has grown very much,” says Verkhovsky. “In general, the authorities don’t like any grassroots initiatives, but here they’ve quite notably tolerated it. This is possible only during a wartime situation.”</p>\n<p>While the Russian Community stays relatively within the confines of the law – acting as more of an unofficial auxiliary to law enforcement than the skinheads of the past, who eagerly filmed their brazen assaults – Verkhovsky points out “many of the activists are, shall we say, inclined towards violence, and the leadership can’t always hold them back.”</p>\n<p>In May, for instance, activists armed with pepper spray and a Taser allegedly burst into an apartment near St Petersburg where two men and a woman were drinking and taking illicit drugs. A fire broke out in the scuffle, and one of the men, of Armenian origin, died in the blaze, while the woman suffered serious injuries after jumping from a seventh-storey window.</p>\n<p>“Let him burn,” the activists reportedly told witnesses, accusing the man of being a “pusher”.</p>\n<p>And last week, a mass brawl erupted between dozens of RO members and Chechen and Ingush workers on a building site northeast of Moscow, after an Ingush security guard reportedly evicted a drunk man from the premises.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the group revealed it had been branded an “undesirable organisation” by local authorities in the Chelyabinsk region of west-central Russia on the grounds of “extremism”.</p>\n<p>But RO has friends in high places: according to reports in Russian media, Alexander Bastrykin, the chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee, has intervened on members’ behalf several times, including filing charges against police officers who arrested them on various charges. And, in June, sources within the security services told reporters from the independent Russian news site, Meduza, that they use RO as a tool for managing “interethnic conflicts”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blessed-by-a-vicar\">Blessed by a vicar</h2>\n<p>Another difference from the old, racist gangs is the influence of the Orthodox Church. The group has campaigned against mosques, requires its members to profess Orthodoxy, and has been blessed by a vicar on behalf of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, himself.</p>\n<p>“Primarily the Russian Community, but also other organisations of the same type, have a very good relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church,” says Verkhovsky.</p>\n<p>“And I mean not just individual priests who sympathise with them, but at the level of high-ranking officials. This is quite unusual. How far it will go, it’s hard to say, but it’s very noticeable.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The outbreak affected more than 250 individuals and caused more than 100 deaths.</p>\n<p>There have been subsequent, almost annual outbreaks in Bangladesh since 2001, with human infection traced to the consumption of date palm sap contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats.</p>\n<p>In 2014, NiV infections in the Philippines were associated with the slaughter of horses and consumption of infected horse meat.</p>\n<p>India has reported two outbreaks in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. In 2018, South India reported its first NiV outbreak in Kerala, when 19 confirmed cases led to 17 deaths. Since then, Kerala has reported NiV spillovers almost every year.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857838\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857838\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2023-05-17T110436Z_1967267049_RC2IPP90I1IP_RTRMADP_3_GLOBAL-PANDEMICS-BATS-SPILLOVER-1753519023.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nipah virus\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857838\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nashid Amin, whose wife Razia Sultana is a Nipah virus survivor, shows the date palm tree from which they drank sap before getting sick in Faridpur, Bangladesh, on September 14, 2021 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-has-happened-in-kerala\">What has happened in Kerala?</h2>\n<p>Although Kerala has recorded 10 instances of NiV spillover since 2018, only two of them turned into outbreaks with instances of human-to-human spread.</p>\n<p>“We are now reporting single cases of Nipah infections rather than a cluster or outbreak like in 2018,” Thekkumkara Surendran Anish, nodal officer at the Kerala One Health Centre for Nipah Research and Resilience, said.</p>\n<p>The last six NiV infections in the state have been single-case spillovers with no human-to-human transmission. The recent uptick in recorded cases is down to the strengthened surveillance system in the state, according to Anish.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of people die in India every year due to AES or ARDS, [where] we don’t know the cause. NiV, in fact, is not a common cause for respiratory and encephalitis syndromes,” he said. “But in Kerala, because the entire health system is prioritising Nipah, we are detecting more Nipah infections.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is concerning that all four NiV infections in 2025 were reported in a small timeframe within a small area, Anish added. “Four independent spillover events within a couple of months in a 50km radius suggest a very high presence of infected bats and the virus in the area.</p>\n<p>“What it tells us is that in certain geospatial locations in Kerala, there is a high likelihood of Nipah spillovers, primarily because the bats in those localities seem to be highly infectious for a short period during the year.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-causing-the-spread-of-the-nipah-virus-in-kerala\">What is causing the spread of the Nipah virus in Kerala?</h2>\n<p>Unlike in Bangladesh, where there was a dedicated channel for the virus to spill over to humans (contaminated date palm sap), there is no obvious source in Kerala – or, at least, the “spillover mechanism” so far remains unclear.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know the exact spillover mechanism, but it seems to be highly sporadic in Kerala. For example, you unknowingly come in contact with an infected bat or its droppings,” Anish said.</p>\n<p>The commonly accepted cause is spillover from the human consumption of fruits contaminated by bat saliva or urine. However, virological examination of bat-bitten fruits has yielded negative results so far.</p>\n<p>A new paper by the Indian Council of Medical Research suggests the virus may be airborne.</p>\n<p>“Disease-causing microbes have different routes of transmission to reach and infect human hosts,” Thekkekara Jacob John, one of the authors of the paper, and an emeritus professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said. “One of them is airborne transmission, like in Tuberculosis, whereby microbes float in the air for longer distances and are inhaled far away from the source.”</p>\n<p>The authors of the paper believe their hypothesis “accommodates the rare but recurrent spillovers of NiV in Kerala”, where there are no mechanical vectors for the virus, such as in Bangladesh or Malaysia.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857842\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857842\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857842\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2023-05-16T122322Z_1715867687_RC2CPP95S5V9_RTRMADP_3_GLOBAL-PANDEMICS-BATS-SPILLOVER-1753519129.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nipah virus\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Field lab assistants measure the head of a bat with slide callipers at a field laboratory, as they research the Nipah virus in the Shuvarampur area of Faridpur, Bangladesh, on September 14, 2021 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-authorities-doing-to-contain-the-nipah-virus-in-kerala\">What are the authorities doing to contain the Nipah virus in Kerala?</h2>\n<p>So far, Kerala has been successful in containing the spread of the virus using trace-and-test procedures. Across 10 “spillover events”, the case count stands at just 37 infected individuals.</p>\n<p>The key to this is a strong surveillance system, said Anish. “When a Nipah case is established, all primary contacts of the patient are immediately traced and monitored under house quarantine. If they test positive for the virus, we immediately start antiviral treatment,” he said.</p>\n<p>The prophylactic treatment of “primary contacts” with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs has helped reduce mortality. “In our experience, if we can treat Nipah early, it can definitely be cured,” Anish said.</p>\n<p>“Syndromic surveillance is another crucial aspect, whereby, in hospitals across the state, any patient presenting with AES or ARDS is tested for Nipah,” Anish said.</p>\n<p>Kerala has been steadily improving its health system. The state now has four labs capable of conducting RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests for detecting active NiV infections.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to political commitment,” Anish said. “The state ensures that efforts of the entire health system remain focused on Nipah outbreaks.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-treatment-for-nipah-virus-is-there-a-vaccine-in-development\">What is the treatment for Nipah virus? Is there a vaccine in development?</h2>\n<p>The WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for its Research and Development Blueprint – a global strategy and preparedness plan for epidemics.</p>\n<p>The University of Oxford’s NiV vaccine, which began in-human trials in January, was granted support from the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June.</p>\n<p>However, there are no drugs yet available that specifically target NiV infection.</p>\n<p>Since there are no approved treatment protocols for NiV, and due to the high risk of mortality, doctors have used broad-spectrum antivirals. Ribavirin is the antiviral of choice, as it has been found to be effective against NiV infections in humans on several occasions.</p>\n<p>During a 2023 outbreak in Kerala, early application of the antiviral Remdesivir resulted in an improved case fatality rate. Monoclonal antibodies (copies of antibodies, created in a laboratory) have also been used to prevent severe disease manifestations in high-risk individuals.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-we-avoid-zoonotic-viruses-like-the-nipah-virus\">How can we avoid zoonotic viruses like the Nipah virus?</h2>\n<p>According to Anish, NiV is a model case study for a “one health” approach to combating high-threat pathogens. The one health approach recognises the fact that human health is interlinked with the health of animals and the environment.</p>\n<p>“[One health] is a combination of three things – human health, animal health and environment health,” Anish said. “You have to tackle all these things to reduce the chances of zoonotic spillovers such as Nipah.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 60 percent of emerging human pathogens are zoonoses, transmitted from animals to humans. Ecological disruption and the spread of human populations into wildlife habitats are primary causes for the emergence of these zoonotic viruses.</p>\n<p>Climate change is another growing concern, with rising temperatures attributed to influencing infections, viral load and human-animal interactions.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

As firefighters struggled to reach the blaze and television cameras rolled, five women trapped in a beauty salon on the 15th floor had to make an impossible decision: remain in the burning building, or leap.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One by one, they jumped, aiming for the roof of a neighbouring six-storey building. Four of the women died.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the time, a 46-year-old engineer and fellow New Orleanian had been toying with an idea that might have saved them. The tragedy spurred John T Scurlock into action.</p>\n<p>He wanted to engineer an inflatable cushion that could provide a safe landing for people plunging from great heights. But to do it, he needed the help of his sons.</p>\n<p>First, he got them to push 45kg (100-pound) rolled-up pieces of vinyl off the top of his office building and onto the cushion he had designed below. The vinyl was attached to an accelerometer, which helped John calculate the weight the cushion could absorb at different speeds.</p>\n<p>Once he was confident it was safe, it was time for the next step: having his sons jump off the roof.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“We were like 10, 12, 14 years old, and we were jumping off a building into a big airbag. It was a lot of fun,” recalls Jeff Scurlock, now 66.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2203597\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2203597\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2203597\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Photo_202-1684184226.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C498&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"John T Scurlock and his wife Francis\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2203597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John T Scurlock and his wife Francis [Courtesy of Space Walk Inflatables]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"space-pillow\" dir=\"ltr\">‘Space pillow’</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The following year, John <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US3851730A/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">patented</a> the safety air cushion, the huge, inflatable pad still used today by fire brigades from New York to Tokyo to rescue people from fires and deaths by suicide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it was not his first invention. In fact, his life-saving inflatable was drawn from his earlier invention: the ubiquitous fair attraction known by many different names – the bouncy castle, moon bounce, bounce house or space walk, depending on where you are bouncing.</p>\n<p>In the Scurlock home, it was known as the “space pillow”.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A year after John filed a patent for the core of what would become the space pillow, he started working at a NASA facility in New Orleans. It was 1961, and NASA had opened its doors three years earlier in response to the Soviets pulling ahead in the space race with the launch of the world’s first satellite, Sputnik 1.</p>\n<p>The US space agency was abuzz with projects exploring the possibility of spaceflight, and by 1960, it had developed an interest in designing a crewed, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/podcasts/small-steps-giant-leaps/small-steps-giant-leaps-episode-128-engineering-inflatable-structures-for-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflatable space station</a>, thought by many to be a necessary first step in reaching the moon.</p>\n<p>Large, rigid space stations would require multiple rocket trips to bring up the parts, but plastic inflatables were considered light, strong and easy to transport. An inflatable space station could be launched into space with a single booster and unfurl once in orbit. (A meteorite-resistant <a href=\"/news/2016/5/9/inflatable-tent-set-to-transform-manned-space-flight\">inflatable space module</a> was sent up to the International Space Station in 2016, and NASA engineers are hoping to build a semi-permanent moon habitat out of inflatables.)</p>\n<p>John found himself in the middle of this innovation, which continued even in his spare time, when he would sketch designs for and stitch his proto-space pillow, using a commercial sewing machine he set up in a pit in the ground of his garage so he could haul the heavy vinyl material towards him as he stitched.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When he assembled an early, homemade space pillow for his young sons to play with in the backyard, it soon became a massive hit with the local children.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“We were very popular kids then, because we had one permanently in our backyard,” says Jeff. “The whole neighbourhood would come and jump on it.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jeff says it was his mother, Francis, who recognised how much children loved the inflatable and got the idea to market it. Eventually, John left his job to concentrate full-time on the “space pillow”.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2071494\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2071494\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2071494\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Space-Walk-Gen1-Bounce-House-.jpg?w=462&amp;resize=462%2C308&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A photo of children playing on a moon bounce or space pillow.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2071494\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of John T Scurlock’s early prototypes of the ‘space pillow’ [Courtesy of Space Walk Inflatables]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"inflatable-solutions\" dir=\"ltr\">Inflatable solutions</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1968, they started selling the invention to fairs around the country. But the safety risks were serious. “It was a nightmare, safety-wise,” says John’s grandson, Mials, 35. “It had no support, no netting, no way to keep you on it.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a carnival worker broke his neck and died, the company was “sued out of existence”, Mials says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No longer a small backyard venture, the design needed protective features.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">John set to work designing improvements: the space pillow grew columns, cushioning walls, netting around the sides and a roof, making it far safer. In 1972, the last year man walked on the moon, the family launched a new company, called Space Walk Inflatables, to manufacture and rent inflatables in the Louisiana city of Kenner.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, the global bounce house market is worth $4bn, driven by the popularity of rentals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But as his invention ballooned in popularity, John also turned his attention to solving problems with heavy-duty inflatables.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inflatable engineering is deceptively complex and requires answering mathematical questions to turn a 2D fabric into a 3D shape, says Dr Benjamin Gorissen, a professor of inflatable mechanics at KE Leuven in Belgium.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">John loved numbers, recalls Mials, and was “a guy who could do the math”. He filed patents on several structures, including one intended for underwater pipe welding for offshore oil platforms, which resembles a <a href=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/80/6b/08/12fa1faf79dcbc/US3837171.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">human heart</a> with someone working inside.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Whatever news article would happen, he’d be in his office, sketching out a solution,” says Mials.</p>\n<p>Jeff recalls his father reading about sunken submarines in the newspaper, and then working on an invention that could help to resurface them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Up until John’s death in 2008, “he never really stopped working”, says Jeff. His last creation in his 80s was a giant inflatable palm tree, a kind of air sculpture meant to provide shade over a 2.8 square metre (30sq ft) area.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">John did not set out to build a business empire, Jeff and Mials, who now run the business, note. Though bouncy castles remain the core of their business, the Scurlocks continue to produce safety air cushions, which have a more complex structure. Their most heavy-duty product is certified for 20 storeys, or <a href=\"https://jumptosafety.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">200 feet</a> (60m).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since it was invented, the safety air cushion has saved thousands of lives around the world, but it all began with an early, devoted pioneer urging his children to jump off the roof.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of ‘Ordinary items, extraordinary stories’, a series about the surprising stories behind well-known items. </em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Trump Turnberry has two golf championship courses – the Ailsa (four times host to the Open Championship) and King Robert the Bruce.</p>\n<p>Turnberry, a tiny place of about 200 people, may have seemed like a good spot to escape wider troubles, as well. Trump still can’t shake off <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/why-is-maga-angry-with-trump-pam-bondi-over-epstein-files\">speculation</a>, including from many in his MAGA fan base, about his <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Wall Street Journal claimed Trump had sent Epstein a birthday note featuring a naked woman and text which read: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”</p>\n<p>It reported that a book given to Epstein in 2003 included letters from both Trump and Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>On Friday, a Scottish reporter shouted at Trump: “Are you in Scotland to escape legal problems?” He didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>Some people also turned up to protest against his visit to Scotland on Friday. One protester in Turnberry was holding a sign that read: “Scotland hated Trump before it was fashionable.” Other protest signs were less polite.</p>\n<p>Stephen Flynn, a Scottish National Party MP who is notably bald, said he wouldn’t meet Trump since he would be busy “washing his hair”.</p>\n<p>Dominic Hinde, an author and journalist based in Glasgow, said: “Scotland doesn’t need to kowtow to the White House in the way that the Westminster bubble does. We can afford to be rude in a way that Keir Starmer can’t. He played on his Scottish roots and expected to be welcomed like a king every time. His reception has only got worse and worse. We don’t want much to do with his kind of politics.”</p>\n<p>Because of this fuss and an <a href=\"/news/2024/9/16/trump-assassination-attempt-who-is-suspect-ryan-routh\">assassination attempt</a> during his election campaign last year, Turnberry became temporary home to 5,000 police officers, army trucks and road checkpoints on Friday.

He wanted them halted, calling them “monstrosities” that would only hurt tourism. He failed to stop the wind farms, but he remains against both wind and solar power.</p>\n<p>During previous talks, Trump has asked Starmer to ditch wind and ramp up oil production. He claims offshore wind turbines are “driving the whales crazy”. But around half of all Scotland’s electricity comes from wind.</p>\n<p>Trump’s golf course in Aberdeenshire has also proved controversial. Conservation groups say the course has destroyed nearby dunes. The course has also struggled to make a profit or employ as many people as had been hoped.</p>\n<p>The Stop Trump Scotland protest group made its opposition to him clear on Friday.

A good result would be a tariff-free trade deal, but that would be difficult to achieve in normal circumstances, let alone now.”</p>\n<p>Trump has claimed that the UK gets a better deal than other large economies, saying at the Group of Seven (G7) summit in June: “The UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them. That’s their ultimate protection.”</p>\n<p>On Friday Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “It’s in Britain’s national interest to have strong relations with the US administration and as a result of both that long-term special relationship, but also more importantly, the work that our Prime Minister Keir Starmer has done in building that relationship with President Trump has meant that we were the first country in the world to secure a trade deal.”</p>\n<p>However, Kathleen Brooks, research director at UK investment group XTB, said: “While the UK was ‘blessed’ with an early trade deal, it has not helped the UK’s economic predicament, as yet.</p>\n<p>“The fact Trump has come to Scotland as the EU continues to wait for confirmation about its tariff rates with the US is interesting. Trump also has golf courses in Ireland, so his choice to visit Scotland could be seen as a rebuttal to the EU. It could also deflect some of the furore over the Epstein scandal.”</p>\n<p>Some Trump acolytes have been critical of the UK in general, saying it lacks freedom of speech and that London has “no-go” zones. Starmer is thought unlikely to bring such matters up while he negotiates on trade.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-might-come-up\">What else might come up?</h2>\n<p>Trump is also due to meet Scottish First Minister John Swinney, who has made positive noises, saying: “Scotland shares a strong friendship with the United States that goes back centuries. The partnership remains steadfast through economic, cultural and ancestral links – including, of course, with the president himself.”</p>\n<p>He has also pledged to raise issues beyond trade, such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Trump will be back in the UK before too long, following this visit. A state visit with First Lady Melania is planned for September 17, when the president will be expected to meet King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The rescued bed is used by one of her sons after getting new slats and a new lease on life.</p>\n<p>“These are the most important pieces of furniture in the house,” she said, gently running her hand over one of the damaged surfaces.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847473\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847473\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0603_131038002-1753003803.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fatima Kandeel holds a bag of recovered items from her previous home, destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Hay El Selom, southern Beirut, including a stuffed SpongeBob toy which belonged to her son Hassan [João Sousa/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fatima Kandeel stands in front of a salvaged wardrobe, holding a bag of items her sons salvaged from the rubble of their home in Hay el-Selom, which Israel destroyed.

I was so happy we got them back.”</p>\n<p>Hassan and Hussein found more in the rubble of their home: a stuffed toy that Hassan used to play with and a few of the books from their mother’s library.</p>\n<p>As she spoke, Fatima held the stuffed toy in her hands, smiling and looking at it. Hussein was quietly observing his mother as she shared her thoughts.</p>\n<p>“He used to sleep with it beside him every night,” Fatima recalled. “I couldn’t save much from their childhood after my divorce, but I kept this, and now it survived the war too.”</p>\n<p>In her bedroom, a small table holds a stack of books about history, religion and culture – a fragment of what she once owned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scars-visible-and-invisible\">Scars, visible and invisible</h2>\n<p>From the living room balcony, the scars of war are visible. The top floors of a neighbouring building have been destroyed, the lower floors still standing – a daily reminder of what was lost.</p>\n<p>Yet Fatima holds Dahiyeh dear and is determined to stay.</p>\n<p>“I love the people here,” she said. “Everyone is kind. … Dahiyeh is home.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hussein agreed that he feels most at home in Dahiyeh with its strong sense of community and friends and neighbours all around.</p>\n<p>During the war, he struggled emotionally, constantly stressed and getting into fights. He has seen two therapists but hasn’t felt much improvement.</p>\n<p>Unlike his mother, Hussein is open to the idea of leaving Dahiyeh, but he pointed out practicalities – rents and the overall cost of living outside Dahiyeh are much higher if they could find a place to rent.</p>\n<p>And, he said, they could face sectarian discrimination if they relocate.</p>\n<p>The family had to leave Dahiyeh briefly during Israel’s war on Lebanon and sought shelter in the nearby coastal Beirut suburb of Jnah. Fatima still carries a painful memory from that time.</p>\n<p>A Jnah grocery store owner snidely remarked: “Look at those trashy Shia people,” as he looked at newly arrived families dressed in the slippers and pyjamas they fled in.</p>\n<p>The comment left a scar, and she refuses to leave Dahiyeh again.</p>\n<p>“If war comes again, what do you teach the next generation?” she asked. “That it’s OK to give up your home?

Its history has been shaped by the 1975-1990 Lebanese Civil War and Israeli assaults, including the devastating 2006 war.</p>\n<p>It’s a cycle, Iman said – another war, another wave of fear and displacement. During Israel’s most recent war on Lebanon, the family fled multiple times.</p>\n<p>They first went to Kayfoun village in the Mount Lebanon governorate in late September, but tensions there were high, and a local man spread rumours of imminent Israeli strikes, trying to scare displaced families away.</p>\n<p>They left Kayfoun after a week and fled to Tripoli in the north, where life was quieter and the presence of nearby relatives offered some comfort, but mistrust lingered.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Iman was often judged by her hijab, which marked her as “resistance-aligned” to people who blamed Hezbollah for Israel’s attacks on Lebanon.</p>\n<p>“We all became introverts,” Hassan recalled. “We stayed home most of the time, but we had relatives nearby and met some good friends. We’d sit together, play cards. It helped.”</p>\n<p>In early October, they followed friends to Iraq’s capital, Baghdad, where they were welcomed warmly – more warmly, they said, than in parts of Lebanon.</p>\n<p>After the ceasefire, they returned. “There’s no place better than our country,” Iman insisted, but Dahiyeh does not feel safe to her any more despite her deep ties to the neighbourhood, so she is searching for a new home – anywhere that’s safer.</p>\n<p>“If it were just me, I’d stay,” she said. “But I have kids. I have to protect them.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"they-don-t-rent-to-shia-families\">‘They don’t rent to Shia families’</h2>\n<p>Iman’s son Hassan recalls the first time Israel bombed near their apartment – on April 1 in breach of the November ceasefire.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted out,” he said. “I don’t care where we go. Just somewhere that isn’t a target.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847593\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847593\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0604_161735002-1-1753006743.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iman Kandeel and some members of her family gather in their living room in Hadath, Beirut, a home they are contemplating leaving if the war between Israel and Lebanon escalates again [João Sousa/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iman Kandeel in her living room.

It is close to Dahiyeh but not part of it, making it relatively safer. And it would be closer to Iman’s sister Mariam, who lives there.</p>\n<p>But Iman said: “In Hazmieh, most of them don’t rent to Shia families, or they would double the price.”</p>\n<p>Despite the mounting fear, the family does not want to leave Lebanon, and Hassan has turned down a job offer abroad. They’re exhausted, they said, but not ready to abandon their country.</p>\n<p>Even in the midst of war, Hassan said, his parents did not want to leave Dahiyeh. He had to work on convincing them to go first to Kayfoun, then eventually Iraq.</p>\n<p>It was the same after the ceasefire with long discussions about whether to leave, and it was his mother’s fear for her children that made her eventually agree.</p>\n<p>But more than a month after they spoke to Al Jazeera in early June, they’re still searching for a place that will take them and that they can afford.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

With 2024 the hottest year on record and 2025 not far behind, air conditioning is no longer a luxury for many – it’s a lifeline.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera breaks down how air conditioners work, traces the history of cooling, and offers practical tips on protecting your AC and reducing energy costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-air-conditioning-work\">How does air conditioning work?</h2>\n<p>Air conditioners cool indoor spaces by moving heat from inside your home to the outside using a chemical fluid called a refrigerant. The process starts when the indoor unit draws in warm air from the room and passes it over evaporator coils filled with cold, low-pressure liquid refrigerant. As the air moves across the coils, the refrigerant absorbs the heat and evaporates into a gas, cooling the air in the process. A fan then blows the cooled air back into the room.</p>\n<p>The now-warm refrigerant travels to the outdoor unit, where a compressor increases its pressure and temperature. In the condenser coils, the refrigerant releases heat to the outside air, turning back into a liquid. The cycle then repeats.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852493\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-How-does-an-Air-conditioner-work-june8-2025-copy-4-1753275607.png?quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-How does an Air conditioner work-june8-2025 copy 4-1753275607\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-long-have-air-conditioners-been-around\">How long have air conditioners been around?</h2>\n<p>In 1820, British scientist Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and evaporating ammonia could chill air. It was an early breakthrough that laid the foundation for modern refrigeration and cooling systems.</p>\n<p>In the 1830s, American physician John Gorrie took a practical approach to the idea. He built a machine in Florida which created ice and used it to cool hospital rooms, aiming to treat patients suffering from tropical diseases.</p>\n<p>The modern era of air conditioning began in 1902, when Willis Carrier, an American engineer, designed a system to control humidity and temperature at a New York printing press. Though intended to remove humidity, which causes paper to expand and contract and can change ink colours, Carrier’s invention is considered the first true air conditioner.</p>\n<p>By 1914, the first residential air conditioner was installed in a Minneapolis mansion. It was huge – roughly the size of an entire room – and far from affordable for the average household.</p>\n<p>In 1931, engineers HH Schultz and JQ Sherman developed the first window-mounted unit, making cooling more accessible for individual rooms. This innovation paved the way for household adoption in urban areas.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852502\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852502\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852502\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-515176272-1753275835.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C594&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"GettyImages-515176272-1753275835\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr Willis H Carrier holds a thermometer inside an igloo display that demonstrates air conditioning at the New York World’s Fair.

After World War II, economic growth, mass production and suburban housing booms brought AC into homes and offices. During this time, Freon (a chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC) replaced toxic refrigerants like ammonia and propane, making systems safer, more compact and easier to install.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852513\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock-1753276285.png?w=748&amp;resize=748%2C935&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The 1963 General Electric Porta-cart air conditioner [Everett Collection/Shutterstock]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 1963 General Electric Porta-cart air conditioner [Everett Collection/Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852498\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852498\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852498\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-3229435-1753275798.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C599&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An air conditioner is mounted in the window of an offic\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852498\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An air conditioner is mounted in the window of an office, circa 1955 [Lambert/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The mini-split system was first developed in Japan in the late 1950s as a more efficient alternative to bulky window units and centralised HVAC systems. Its key innovation was a ductless design, which delivers air directly from an outdoor compressor to an indoor air handler – minimising energy loss typically caused by ductwork.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852500\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852500\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852500\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-81615627-1753275814.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C531&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"GettyImages-81615627-1753275814\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852500\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sign outside a US restaurant points to the use of air conditioning – as well as ‘White Rest Rooms’, in a clear indication of racial segregation – circa 1960 [Joan Sydlow/FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] (Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By the 1970s and 1980s, mini-splits were being used across Asia and parts of Europe, and later expanded into North America. Their flexible installation and energy efficiency made them ideal for older buildings where retrofitting ducts was costly or impractical, as well as for homeowners seeking precise, room-by-room climate control. This is also when inverter technology, which adjusts the speed of the compressor to help save energy, was developed.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, rising energy costs and growing environmental concerns led governments to adopt energy efficiency standards for cooling systems. In response, manufacturers introduced more efficient compressors, thermostats and system designs to reduce electricity consumption. During this period, the United States’ Clean Air Act was amended to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Their replacement, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), like R-134a, gained popularity. But while HFCs don’t harm the ozone layer, they are potent greenhouse gases which contribute significantly to global warming.</p>\n<p>The 2000s brought a new wave of innovation, with air conditioners beginning to integrate digital controls, motion sensors and smart thermostats. Wi-Fi connectivity allowed users to adjust temperature settings remotely, while automation made systems more adaptive and efficient.</p>\n<p>By the 2010s, concerns over global warming and the environmental effects of refrigerants triggered a transition away from hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Newer refrigerants like R-32 and R-290 (propane), already being used in parts of Asia and Europe, marked a shift towards low-emission, climate-friendly cooling.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852491\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852491\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852491\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-History-of-air-conditioning-june8-2025-copy-6-1753275600.png?quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-History of air conditioning-june8-2025 copy 6-1753275600\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-choose-the-right-air-conditioner\">How to choose the right air conditioner</h2>\n<p>Choosing the best-sized air conditioner is essential for keeping your home comfortable and your energy bills under control.

That’s about 7 percent of total global electricity use, which was roughly 29,000 TWh. When looking specifically at buildings, cooling accounts for nearly 20 percent of electricity consumption.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852488\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852488\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852488\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-Global-electricity-use-for-air-conditioning0D-june8-2025-copy-3-1753275593.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-Global electricity use for air conditioning-june8-2025 copy 3-1753275593\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852488\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This enormous energy demand comes with a climate cost.

In contrast, ownership remained low in heat-exposed but lower-income nations such as India and South Africa, where access is limited despite intensifying heatwaves.</p>\n<p>Countries with both hot climates and higher incomes – like Saudi Arabia, where 63 percent of households have an AC unit, and South Korea (86 percent) – have widespread adoption. Meanwhile, AC ownership in emerging economies such as Indonesia (20 percent) and India (13 percent) is expanding rapidly as cooling shifts from a luxury to a basic need.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-build-a-homemade-air-cooler\">How to build a homemade air cooler</h2>\n<p>If you don’t own an air conditioner or are trying to save on energy costs, here are some steps you can follow to build your DIY cooler out of a styrofoam cooler, ice and a fan.</p>\n<p>While this won’t help with humidity, it can provide temporary relief during the hottest time of the day.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3052894\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3052894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3052894\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/INTERACTIVE_staying-cool_JUN26_2024-copy-2-1721199193.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE_staying cool_JUN26_2024 copy 2-1721199193\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3052894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, disputed that characterisation.</p>\n<p>“There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in,” Cheung <a href=\"https://x.com/StevenCheung/status/1841242913302327506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media. “They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.”</p>\n<p>The back-and-forth escalated when 60 Minutes aired two different cuts from its interview with Harris.</p>\n<p>One version, which aired on a sister programme, Face The Nation, featured more of Harris’s answer about her stance towards Israel. The other version, which aired on the 60 Minutes broadcast, was shorter.</p>\n<p>Trump called the different edits evidence of deceptive reporting tactics and filed a lawsuit against Paramount, CBS’s parent company.</p>\n<p>“CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” his court filing alleged.</p>\n<p>“That is false,” 60 Minutes responded in a statement on its website.</p>\n<p>“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”</p>\n<p>While many media experts expected Paramount to prevail on the merits of the case, the company instead sought to negotiate an end to the matter. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $16m to Trump to go towards his future presidential library.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, another top CBS show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, revealed it had been cancelled, allegedly for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>But the timing and unexpected nature of the cancellation drew speculation that it might have been an attempt to appease Trump and streamline the merger, given the fact that Colbert frequently lambasted the Republican president on his show.</p>\n<p>Trump himself <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”</p>\n<p>The Late Show was consistently the top-rated late-night comedy show, and it had won a Peabody Award and multiple Emmy nods.</p>\n<p>Days later, on July 22, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114897600777919524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> for more comedians to be ousted, writing, “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”</p>\n<p>That same day, he confirmed he received the $16m for his 60 Minutes settlement, adding that he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114898229237459086\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected</a> to be receive an additional $20m in free advertising and programming from the “new owners”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-park-tv-show-takes-aim\">South Park TV show takes aim</h2>\n<p>Within weeks of both the 60 Minutes lawsuit settlement and the cancellation of The Late Show, the FCC gave its blessing to the merger between Paramount and Skydance.</p>\n<p>Under the merger, Skydance founder David Ellison, the son of Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, is slated to helm operations.</p>\n<p>Upon the merger’s approval, Trump’s appointee to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, released a <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1948503402213671247/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> echoing some of the president’s criticisms of major news outlets.</p>\n<p>He also hinted that the merger would result in changes to CBS’s news output.</p>\n<p>“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcasting network.”</p>\n<p>“In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”</p>\n<p>To ensure compliance with that commitment, Carr said an ombudsman would be appointed to the media giant for a period of at least two years.</p>\n<p>Carr added that the merger between Skydance and Paramount would also bar the new mega-company from implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, which are designed to create an equal playing field for people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion or ability.</p>\n<p>But the merger did not put an end to the scrutiny of Trump on Paramount platforms.</p>\n<p>Hours after the FCC granted its approval, the TV channel Comedy Central aired an episode of the animated series South Park that mocked President Trump and satirised its parent company’s $16m settlement.</p>\n<p>In one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI34iAvKyVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scene</a>, an animated Jesus attempts to warn the show’s characters about Trump.</p>\n<p>“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” the animated Jesus says. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?”</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has since blasted the show as irrelevant.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

No HIV medications or condoms are being destroyed,” a State Department spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p>\n<p>Reproductive health advocates decried the US decision on Friday, saying that Washington is incinerating “life-saving contraceptives” rather than handing them to aid groups to distribute them in poorer countries.</p>\n<p>Several advocacy groups – including International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Sensoa and Countdown 2030 Europe – released a statement calling the US move a “cruel and ideologically driven”.</p>\n<p>“Despite multiple offers from international humanitarian organisations, governments and global health actors to purchase or redistribute these supplies, the US government has refused all alternatives,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>“Instead, they are choosing waste and extremist ideology over care, <a href=\"/features/2025/7/25/is-trump-using-africa-as-a-dumping-ground-for-criminals\">human rights</a>, safety and health.”</p>\n<p>The groups said they offered to transport, repack, store and distribute the supplies at “no cost to the US government”, but their proposal was turned down.</p>\n<p>The Reuters news agency had reported that the supplies, set to be destroyed in France, are worth $10m.</p>\n<p>The State Department spokesperson said the destruction of the commodities, purchased under the administration of former President Joe Biden, will cost $167,000.</p>\n<p>The US statement added that the administration of President Donald Trump managed to cancel previously placed orders worth $34.1m.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Trump has upended US humanitarian aid programmes, all <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/usaid-food-for-nearly-30000-hungry-kids-to-be-destroyed-official\">but dismantling</a> the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and cutting assistance to countries and groups across the world.</p>\n<p>Since running for office the first time in 2015, Trump has presented himself as a staunch opponent of abortion. During his first term, the Republican president appointed three conservative justices to the US Supreme Court, <a href=\"/news/2022/6/24/roe-v-wade-us-supreme-court-overturns-landmark-abortion-ruling\">who helped overturn</a> the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.</p>\n<p>The decision to destroy reproductive health supplies, instead of donating or even selling them, has drawn the ire of critics across the world.</p>\n<p>Micah Grzywnowicz, regional director of IPPF European Network, said the move shows “complete lack of basic empathy”.</p>\n<p>“It’s the height of hypocrisy for a government to preach efficiency and cutting waste, only to turn around and recklessly destroy life-saving supplies when the need has never been greater. This isn’t just inefficient — it’s unconscionable,” Grzywnowicz said in a statement..</p>\n<p>“This action seriously undermines global public health efforts and limits access to essential care, particularly for communities already facing significant barriers.”</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu said she was “horrified” by the Trump administration’s move.</p>\n<p>“The Trump admin is burning $10M in taxpayer-funded birth control despite years left before expiration &amp; the UN ready to deliver it to women in need,” Chu said in a social media post.</p>\n<p>“This is cruel, disgraceful, and a needless waste of your taxpayer dollars.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
