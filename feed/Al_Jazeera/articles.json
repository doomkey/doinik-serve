These attacks often cause serious burns, as well as flesh and shrapnel wounds.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“There is often severe tissue tearing … and many [of the injured] end up with amputated limbs,” said Dr Naeem.</p><p>Other Palestinians sustain fractures and broken bones, typically by being trampled in the mad rush to flee Israeli gunfire or obtain a bag of food aid.</p><p>Dr Hassan al-Shaer, who works in al-Shifa Hospital, also says many of the injuries are serious.</p><p>“Many of the [injured] victims that come to us also have life-threatening wounds, and they are taken to the operating room immediately,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-excuse-does-israel-give-for-these-killings\">What excuse does Israel give for these killings?</h2><p>Israel officially denies firing at Palestinians and frequently claims that its troops only fire “warning shots” outside GHF distribution hubs to prevent overcrowding.</p><p>The Israeli army also says “chaos” at the sites poses an “immediate threat” to army soldiers.</p><p>Yet, according to a news report published by the Israeli daily Haaretz on June 27, Israeli troops pose the real threat.</p><p>Many soldiers who served in Gaza admitted that they were “ordered to shoot” directly at Palestinian aid seekers by their superiors.</p><p>“Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day. They’re treated like a hostile force – no crowd-control measures, no tear gas – just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars,” one soldier told Haaretz.</p><p>“It’s a killing field,” he added.</p><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Katz both deny the allegations and claim that they amount to “blood libel” against Israel, meaning they equate it to a false and anti-Semitic accusation that Jewish people murder Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals.</p><h2 id=\"does-medical-evidence-on-the-ground-support-israel-s-official-narrative\">Does medical evidence on the ground support Israel’s official narrative?</h2><p>No, accounts from doctors in Gaza hospitals and clinics do not support Israel’s claim.</p><p>Dr Shaer, from al-Shifa, noted that many of the injured people started coming into the hospital when the GHF began aid distribution in late May.</p><p>Injuries are often compounded with illnesses and weak immune systems, effects brought on by starvation in Gaza.</p><p>Hakeem Yahiya Mansour, a 30-year-old Palestinian emergency medic in Gaza, added “death always happens” at GHF sites.</p><p>“Most of the calls we get are from the surroundings [of the distribution zones],” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-the-ghf-sites-look-like\">What do the GHF sites look like?</h2><p>Footage of the sites shows thousands of starving Palestinians crowded onto a strip of land roughly the size of a football field, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF.</p><p>Aid seekers are surrounded by guard towers and are often forced to fight for food parcels that are tossed to hungry crowds at poorly arranged and chaotic distribution points.</p><p>Tanks are often stationed nearby, and aid seekers can hear the terrifying buzzing of drones above them.</p><p>According to satellite imagery obtained by Al Jazeera’s verification unit, Sanad, Palestinians have little space to manoeuvre or receive aid.</p><p>Despite the dangers, Palestinians face an impossible choice: die from gunfire or starvation. Many chose to accept the risk and go for aid in the hope of obtaining food for their families and small children.</p><p>Mohanad Shaaban said he did not eat for three days, pushing him to head to the GHF site on July 30. He remembers seeing two tanks at the site – one on the right and a second on the left.</p><p>“The [Israelis] then opened fire on us,” he recalled solemnly.</p><p>“Please tell the world to end this famine,” Shaaban said.</p><h2 id=\"how-is-the-world-responding\">How is the world responding?</h2><p>Harrowing scenes and images of Palestinians dying of hunger and being killed at GHF aid sites have compelled some of Israel’s allies to issue stern condemnations and ultimatums.</p><p>France, Germany and the United Kingdom recently issued a statement urging Israel to scale up life-saving aid.</p><p>What’s more, France has taken the symbolic step of recognising a Palestinian state, which the UK also threatened to do, unless Israel ends the “appalling situation” in Gaza and commits to the “two-state” solution. Canada has also said it will recognise a Palestinian state in September.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The pilot programme sets out that for every person returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, Starmer said at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2482\">Philp also reiterated his party’s proposal to immediately detain and deport new arrivals, warning that continued legal challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could force a Conservative government to consider withdrawing from it, a threat they have often made in and around the Brexit years when the party was in government.</p><p data-start=\"2484\" data-end=\"2720\">Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday.

He said IEEPA authorises tariffs because it allows a president to “regulate” imports in a crisis.</p><p>The states and businesses challenging the tariffs argued they are not permissible under IEEPA and the US Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, authority over tariffs and other taxes.</p><p>Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the businesses, said the government’s argument that the word “regulate” includes the power to tax would be a vast expansion of presidential power.</p><p>Tariffs are starting to build into a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/fact-check-could-trumps-trade-tariffs-pay-off-the-us-deficit\">significant revenue source</a> for the federal government as customs duties in June quadrupled to about $27bn, a record, and through June have topped $100bn for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. That income could be crucial to offset lost revenue from extended tax cuts in a Trump-supported bill that passed and became law this month.</p><p>“Tariffs are making America GREAT &amp; RICH Again,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America’s big case today.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But economists said the duties threaten to raise prices for US consumers and reduce corporate profits. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff threats have roiled financial markets and disrupted US companies’ ability to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Dan Rayfield, the attorney general of Oregon, one of the states challenging the levies, said the tariffs are a “regressive tax” that is making household items more expensive.</p><p>Since Trump began imposing his wave of tariffs, companies ranging from <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/30/automakers-suspend-financial-guidance-amid-tariff-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carmaker Stellantis</a> to <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/24/american-airlines-restores-forecast-amid-economic-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Airlines, temporarily suspended</a> financial guidance for investors, which has since started again but has been revised down. Companies across multiple industries, including Procter and Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods brand, announced this week that it would need to raise prices on a quarter of its goods.</p><p>The president has made tariffs a central instrument of his foreign policy, wielding them aggressively in his second term as leverage in trade negotiations and to push back against what he has called unfair practices.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-outside-trade\">Pressure outside trade</h2><p>Trump has said the April tariffs, which he placed on most countries, are a response to persistent US trade imbalances and declining US manufacturing power. However, in recent weeks, he’s used them to increase pressure on nontrade issues.</p><p>He hit Brazil with 50 percent tariffs over the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a key Trump ally who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt after he lost the 2022 presidential election.</p><p>Trump also threatened Canada over its move to recognise a Palestinian state, saying a trade deal will now be “very hard”.</p><p>He said tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were appropriate because those countries were not doing enough to stop fentanyl from crossing US  borders. The countries have denied that claim.</p><p>On May 28, a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade sided with the Democratic states and small businesses that are challenging Trump.</p><p>It said IEEPA, a law intended to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies, did not authorise tariffs related to longstanding trade deficits. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to remain in place while it considers the administration’s appeal. The timing of the court’s decision is uncertain, and the losing side will likely appeal quickly to the US Supreme Court.</p><p>The case will have no impact on tariffs levied under more traditional legal authorities, such as duties on steel and aluminium. The president recently announced trade deals that set tariff rates on goods from the European Union and Japan after smaller trade agreements with Britain, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p><p>Trump’s Department of Justice has argued that limiting the president’s tariff authority could undermine ongoing trade negotiations while other Trump officials have said negotiations have continued with little change after the initial setback in court. Trump has set a deadline of Friday for higher tariffs on countries that don’t negotiate new trade deals.</p><p>There are at least seven other lawsuits challenging Trump’s invocation of IEEPA, including cases brought by other small businesses and California.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Bondi, who took office in 2011, was also buoyed by the endorsement of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p><p>As attorney general, Bondi led crusades against so-called “pill mills”, clinics that loosely prescribe pain medications, while leading some Republican pet causes, including a multi-state effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>She also led efforts to uphold Florida’s ban on same sex marriage, before its nationwide legalisation by Supreme Court order in 2015, as well as the ability for same sex couples to adopt.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During that period, Bondi sought to establish herself as a champion against sex trafficking and child sex abuse, launching the state’s council on human trafficking and an investigation into past abuse by Catholic priests.</p><p>As Florida’s top cop, she also had her first brush with Epstein, with critics accusing her of remaining willfully silent on a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein and his co-conspirators had struck with her predecessor.</p><p>They have said Bondi could have intervened as victims launched lawsuits challenging the deal, which saw Epstein plead guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution but serve only months in prison.</p><p>“But Bondi kept her distance from the state’s most prominent sex-trafficking case, even as Epstein’s victims pleaded with the courts to invalidate provisions of his non-prosecution agreement and filed lawsuits alleging he abused them when he was on work release from jail,” wrote Mary Ellen Klas, a Bloomberg opinion writer and former Miami Herald Bureau Chief.</p><p>“Her inaction helped to perpetuate what victims describe as a government cover-up that, along with Epstein’s death, has robbed those victims of their chance to get answers and hold their abusers to account,” she wrote.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3866407\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3866407\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3866407\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP280664461412-1753905099.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, right, speaks as Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov.

At question was whether Bondi had solicited contributions from Trump in 2013, as her office was weighing joining a lawsuit against Trump University.</p><p>Her office denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation was later dropped.</p><p>Despite those early contacts, Bondi was not an early adherent to Trump’s presidential ambitions or his nascent “Make America Great Again” movement.</p><p>Instead, she initially supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary. When Jeb dropped out of the race, she threw her lot in with Trump. From there, things accelerated quickly.</p><p>While still Florida’s attorney general, Bondi served on Trump’s first White House transition team. She left her post in Florida in 2019 and soon joined the Ballard Lobbyist group, representing the interests of Amazon, General Motors, and Uber, among others.</p><p>From there, she joined the White House legal team, defending the president during his first <a href=\"/news/2019/12/4/trump-committed-impeachable-crimes-over-ukraine-legal-scholars\">impeachment trial</a> in the US Senate, in which Trump was accused of conditioning weapons to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on then political opponent Biden.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After Trump’s election loss, Bondi was among those spearheading unfounded claims that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. She helped coordinate former New York City Mayor <a href=\"/news/2021/6/24/giulianis-law-licence-suspended-over-trump-election-falsehoods\">Rudy Giuliani’</a>s infamous news conference at the Four Seasons Landscaping in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she flatly and falsely claimed that Trump had “won Pennsylvania”.</p><p>She went on to chair the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a pro-Trump think tank that oversaw “a series of concerning lawsuits in recent years, particularly in the voting rights and elections arena”, as <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pam-bondis-recent-history-troubling-doj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> by the Brennan Center for Justice.

The besieged enclave has been under the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/7/27/what-has-israels-denial-of-food-done-to-gazas-people\">complete mercy of Israel</a>, which has curtailed access to everything from flour to cooking gas.</p><p>But since March 2, the humanitarian and essential items allowed in have plummeted to a frightening low.

He turned two several months ago, and I couldn’t even give him a proper meal,” she says.</p><p>Her 10-year-old, Firas, she adds, shows visible signs of severe malnutrition that she recognises with painful clarity.</p><p>Before the war, her home buzzed with life around mealtimes. “We used to eat three or four times a day,” she recalls.</p><p>“Lunch was a time to gather. Winter evenings were filled with the aroma of lentil soup. We spent spring afternoons preparing stuffed vine leaves with such care.</p><p>“Now we … sleep hungry.”</p><p>“There’s no flour, no bread, nothing to fill our stomachs,” she says, holding Hassan as his small body trembles.</p><p>“We haven’t had a bite of bread in over two weeks. A kilo of flour costs 150 shekels [$40], and we can’t afford that.”</p><p>Hassan was six months old when the bombing began. Now, at two years old, he bears little resemblance to a healthy child his age.</p><p>The United Nations has repeatedly warned that Israel’s siege and restrictions on humanitarian aid are creating man-made famine conditions.</p><p>According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, only a <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-july-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fraction</a> of the 600 truckloads of food and supplies required in Gaza daily, under normal circumstances, are coming through. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system has placed northern Gaza in Phase 5: catastrophe/famine.</p><p>Amid a lack of security, the trickle of humanitarian aid allowed to enter Gaza is subject to gangs and looting, preventing people in need from accessing scarce supplies.</p><p>Furthermore, hundreds of desperate aid seekers have been shot dead by Israeli soldiers while trying to get humanitarian aid provided by the United States- and Israeli-backed GHF since May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"abundance-as-a-distant-memory\">Abundance as a distant memory</h2><p>Hala Mohammed, 32, cradles three-year-old Qusai in a relative’s overcrowded shelter in Remal, a neighbourhood of Gaza City, as she describes how she has to watch him cry in hunger every morning, his little voice breaking.</p><p>“There’s no flour, no sugar, no milk,” she says, her arms wrapped protectively around the child, who has known only war for most of his life.</p><p>“We bake lentils like dough and cook plain pasta just to fill our stomachs. But hunger is stronger.”</p><p>This is devastating for someone who grew up in Gaza’s rich culture of hospitality and generosity and had a comfortable life in the Tuffah neighbourhood.</p><p>Before displacement forced her and her husband to flee west with Qusai, every milestone called for nice meals – New Year’s feasts, Mother’s Day gatherings, birthday parties for her husband, her mother-in-law and Qusai.</p><p>“Many of our memories were created around shared meals. Now meals [have become the] memory,” she says.</p><p>“My son asks for food and I just hold him,” she continues, her voice cracking. “The famine spreads like cancer – slowly, silently and mercilessly. Children are wasting away before our eyes. And we can do nothing.”</p><p><em><strong>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\">Egab</a>.</strong></em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/death-toll-in-israels-war-on-gaza-surpasses-60000\">60,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed in Israel’s military campaign, with more at risk of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/more-than-70-aid-seekers-killed-as-starvation-worsens-in-gaza\">dying from hunger</a> as a result of its blockade of the territory.</p><p>Meanwhile, since the war started on October 7, 2023, illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have increased, as has violence against Palestinians there. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in attacks, some by settlers, others by members of the Israeli armed forces.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Israel faces several international legal challenges as the result of those actions. In November 2024, for instance, the International Criminal Court <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next\">issued arrest warrants</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, based on accusations of war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>Other countries, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/brazil-to-join-south-africas-icj-genocide-case-against-israel\">including South Africa</a>, have brought cases before the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.</p><p>The US, however, has been an unwavering ally of Israel throughout its war in Gaza and has supplied the Israeli government with billions of dollars in military aid.</p><p>It also has opposed efforts in international court to bring Israel to account for human rights abuses, arguing that neither the US nor Israel are subject to the courts’ jurisdictions.</p><p>But Palestine is a nonmember observer state at the UN, which governs the International Court of Justice. And it is also a member of the Rome Statute, the founding document of the International Criminal Court.</p><p>The State Department’s order on Thursday comes as several Western countries, among them <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/macron-says-france-will-recognise-palestinian-state-in-september\">France</a>, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/starmer-says-uk-will-soon-recognise-palestine-unless-israel-halts-gaza-war\">the United Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/canada-will-recognise-palestinian-state-at-un-general-assembly-carney\">Canada</a>, pledge to recognise Palestine’s statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly in September.</p><p>Trump, however, has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/us-israel-condemn-frances-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state\">dismissed</a> such efforts as inconsequential. He has also warned that recognition of Palestinian statehood would serve as a “reward” to Hamas, a group that has fought the Palestinian Authority for power.</p><p>The US has issued a series of sanctions in recent months seemingly poised to weaken individuals and entities that have been critical of Israel.</p><p>In June, for instance, it <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-administration-sanctions-international-criminal-court-judges\">sanctioned judges</a> on the International Criminal Court who were involved in the decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. And earlier this month, it also <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/us-sanctions-un-expert-albanese-over-israel-criticism\">sanctioned a special rapporteur</a> at the UN, Francesca Albanese, whose job is to monitor the human rights situation of Palestinians.</p><p>At the time, the US accused Albanese of waging a “campaign of political and economic warfare against the United States and Israel”.</p><p>In response, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Turk, called for an end to the “attacks and threats” faced by international observers.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett explained that the United States is now “collectively targeting, with visa restrictions, members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and also the Palestinian authority”.</p><p>But she said Trump’s unconditional support for Israel may run contrary to emerging trends in his Republican Party.</p><p>“This is a position that, for the president at least, is increasingly at odds with members of his own Republican Party — namely the so-called MAGA wing or Make America Great Again wing — that have started, in the last week or so, to use the word genocide to describe Israel’s starvation tactics,” Halkett said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They included career government employees involved in the prosecution of rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>During his Senate hearing, however, Bove categorically denied that he has acted as Trump’s “henchman”.</p><p>Still, Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the two Republicans to oppose the confirmation, said the evidence presented in the chamber portrayed Bove as “somebody who has counseled other attorneys that you should ignore the law, you should reject the law”.</p><p>“I don’t think that that individual should be placed in a lifetime seat on the bench,” Murkowski added.</p><p>Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, in an interview with MSNBC after Bove’s confirmation, gave a more blunt assessment: “This is a genuinely bad guy.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-approach\">A new approach?</h2><p>In his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump already helped to transform the US judiciary, appointing a total of 226 federal judges.</p><p>They include 54 appellate judges and three justices to serve on the nine-member Supreme Court.</p><p>Those appointments, largely based on chance vacancies, are almost always pulled from a pool of candidates approved by conservative groups like the Federalist Society.</p><p>That organisation has sought to <a href=\"/opinions/2022/6/29/the-federalist-society-architects-of-the-american-dystopia\">reshape</a> the country’s legal landscape with a rightward bent.</p><p>The Federalist Society says it advocates for “individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law”, and it has helped lay the groundwork for major conservative victories, including the overturning of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that had protected the nationwide right to abortion access.</p><p>But early this year, Trump signalled a break from the group, lashing out at its former leader, Leonard Leo, whom he called a “sleaze bag” and a “bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America”.</p><p>Trump argued that Leo had given him “bad advice”, leading him to appoint a Federalist Society-approved judge during his first term. That judge was among a panel that ruled against the president’s signature tariff policy in May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the Federalist Society has been conspicuously mum on Bove’s nomination, legal experts from both conservative and left-leaning circles have questioned whether his commitment to Trump would outweigh his commitment to jurisprudence.</p><p>Nunziata, from the Society of the Rule of Law, wrote that Trump’s past judicial appointees generally exhibited “judicial excellence and a commitment to the rule of law”.</p><p>“Many of them have proven their mettle in contentious litigation involving the president or his policies,” he explained.</p><p>But he proceeded to describe Bove’s conduct as “unthinkable” for a federal judge.</p><p>“The Bove nomination represents a stark and apparently intentional break from this successful model and should raise concerns across the ideological spectrum,” he wrote.</p><p>The progressive Alliance for Justice expressed a similar sentiment, writing that Bove’s “allegiance lies not with civil rights or the rule of law but with Trump and his authoritarian agenda to expand executive power far beyond the limits set by the Constitution”.</p><p>“Emil Bove’s record makes clear he is unfit for a lifetime seat on the federal bench.”</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Trump’s attacks on the federal judiciary – aimed at judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike – have been unprecedented in their own right.</p><p>Judges have openly speculated that the Trump administration may be found in contempt for ignoring court orders. And Trump himself has openly criticised judges as “deranged” or “lunatic” for opposing his policies.</p><p>But it remains unclear if Trump’s caustic approach to the judiciary will manifest in more controversial appointments like Bove.</p><p>Some analysts <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/25/federalist-society-judges-trump-bove-senate-00421065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted</a> that Trump has generally nominated judges from the more traditional conservative pipeline. It remains to be seen if Bove will be the exception or the start of a new trend.</p><p>Just this week, the Trump administration signalled it may continue to take an aggressive stance in its approach to the judiciary.</p><p>For example, the Justice Department filed a complaint on Monday that seeks to censure US District Court Judge James Boasberg, who attempted to block Trump-ordered deportation flights in March.</p><p>The complaint accused Boasberg of making inappropriate comments about the president’s administration, but critics see it as an effort to discredit a judge who has issued high-profile rulings against Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On the day of Bove’s appointment, Trump also took aim at a Senate custom that gives the minority party – in this case, the Democrats – an opportunity to block some lower-level federal judicial and prosecutorial nominations.</p><p>Under the so-called “blue slip” tradition, lawmakers are given the ability to veto the confirmation of federal district judges or federal prosecutors who will serve in their state. The practice, more akin to a gentleman’s agreement than an official policy, has long been seen as one of the last vestiges of bipartisanship in the US legislature.</p><p>While the custom does not apply to higher federal judges, including appellate or Supreme Court justices, its removal would make it easier for Trump to more fully assert his influence over all levels of the federal judiciary.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114938820270436889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Truth Social</a>, Trump called upon Republican senators to end the tradition, which he called “ancient and probably Unconstitutional”, as well as a “hoax”.</p><p>With the “blue slip”, he added, Democrats “have an ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates”.</p><p>Republican leaders in the Senate, however, have voiced reluctance to ending the tradition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, over the years, Congress has passed multiple laws ceding some of that power to the president.</p><p>Trump has justified his most far-reaching assertions of tariff power by citing the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows tariffs on all imports during an “unusual and extraordinary threat … to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States”.</p><p>Small businesses challenging that position in the case VOS Selections v Trump make two key arguments. They contend that the law doesn’t explicitly allow the president to impose tariffs. And they argue that neither of two Trump tariffs – the levies against Mexico, Canada and China to counter a declared fentanyl crisis and those against a broad swath of trading partners to address US trade deficits – rise to the level of an “unusual and extraordinary” emergency.</p><p>On Thursday, one day before Trump’s deadline for a batch of new tariffs to take effect, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case. The Trump administration lost the first round in May at the Court of International Trade. (That decision did not affect other Trump tariffs, such as those on steel, aluminium and cars or proposed tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Trump imposed these using other legal authorities.)</p><p>The appeals court will be the last stop before expected consideration by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Here’s a primer on how this case could affect Trump’s tariff policies:</p><h2 id=\"does-the-international-emergency-economic-powers-act-allow-tariffs\">Does the International Emergency Economic Powers Act allow tariffs?</h2><p>Whether the law permits the imposition of tariffs may be hard for the administration to prove.</p><p>The law “authorises the president to take various actions but with no mention of ‘tariffs’, ‘duties’,  ‘levies’, ‘taxes’, ‘imposts’ or any similar wording”, said Meredith Kolsky Lewis, a University at Buffalo law professor. “No president has sought to impose tariffs pursuant to the law” before Trump</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The administration’s strongest argument may be that although the law “doesn’t specifically authorise tariff measures, it doesn’t bar them either”, said David A Gantz, a Rice University fellow in trade and international economics. “Some have questioned whether Congress intended to cede basic Commerce Clause powers so completely to the president, but the statute does not appear to ever have been seriously challenged in Congress with repeal.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"does-the-present-situation-constitute-an-emergency\">Does the present situation constitute an emergency?</h2><p>The second issue might be more challenging for Trump: Are trade deficits a security threat?</p><p>In asserting the authority to impose tariffs, Trump said “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”</p><p>Babson College economist Kent Jones was sceptical. “Those with knowledge of trade economics scoff at the notion that a trade deficit is a national emergency,” he said. “The US has run trade deficits consistently for the last four decades without signs of an economic emergency that can be systematically linked to the deficits.”</p><p>The tariffs are being applied to dozens of countries that ship more goods to the US than they import, which “suggests a lack of an ‘unusual’ threat”, Lewis said. “In other words, this is commonplace.”</p><p>Using fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits as examples of emergencies breaks new ground, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who specialises in trade.</p><p>Although the law “does not delineate what a national emergency is, the precedent from previous administrations is not to invoke a national emergency based on day-to-day trade flows”, Burkhart said.</p><h2 id=\"an-even-more-aggressive-argument-in-the-case-of-brazil\">An even more aggressive argument in the case of Brazil</h2><p>Trump’s threat of 50 percent levies on <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/23/trumps-hefty-tariff-on-brazil-expected-to-push-the-country-towards-china\">Brazil</a> may be on thinner legal ground, legal experts said.</p><p>On July 9, Trump wrote a letter to Brazil’s president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, explaining that the new tariffs would be “due in part” to Brazil’s prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, as well as its treatment of US social media companies. The letter also cited a “very unfair trade relationship” with Brazil.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/Trump_Brazil_letter_7925.png?w=770&amp;ssl=1\"></p><p>[Screengrab from Truth Social]</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump declared an emergency based in part on the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/us-sanctions-brazils-supreme-court-judge-overseeing-case-against-bolsonaro\">Bolsonaro</a> prosecution, triggering a 40 percent tariff, effective after a week.</p><p>Experts said Trump’s justifications ring hollow legally under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Brazil policy isn’t at issue in the case being argued on Thursday, but it has already resulted in at least one lawsuit.</p><p>Experts said they doubted that citing the Bolsonaro case as an emergency would survive judicial scrutiny. Bolsonaro sought unsuccessfully to hang on to power after Lula <a href=\"/news/2022/10/30/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-narrowly-defeats-jair-bolsonaro\">defeated</a> him in the 2022 election, which prompted years of <a href=\"/news/2025/5/19/former-president-bolsonaros-coup-trial-opens-in-brazil\">investigations</a> and charges that could land him in prison.</p><p>“I and many others would agree that the Bolsonaro trial – even if [it were] questionable, and it isn’t – would not come close to meeting” the standard under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Gantz said.</p><p>Trump’s letter undercuts another key fact in the US-Brazil <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/10/whats-behind-trumps-50-percent-tariff-for-brazil-despite-trade-surplus\">trade</a> relationship: The US had a $6.8bn trade surplus with Brazil in 2024 and surpluses in earlier years as well.</p><p>Certain US sectors, such as social media and electronic payment networks, may have plausible gripes with Brazil over trade policy. Even so, Gantz said, “all of these grievances together seem to me insufficient for action under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Most legal experts we talked to said the appeals court would have ample reason to follow the Court of International Trade’s lead in striking down Trump’s authority. “I am quite confident that the law doesn’t give a limitless grant of authority to the president simply by saying some magic words,” said Julian Arato, a University of Michigan law professor.</p><p>But that result is no certainty – and ultimately, the US Supreme Court will have the final say. The conservative-majority court should be a friendlier venue for the administration.</p><p>If the appeals court doesn’t reverse the Court of International Trade’s ruling, “the Supreme Court will, in my opinion, likely do so,” Gantz said.</p><p>And even if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump, he could still impose tariffs under other laws.</p><p>He could use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows tariffs when the president determines that a foreign country “burdens or restricts United States commerce” through violations of trade agreements. This authority has been invoked dozens of times by various presidents.</p><p>Or he could use Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which lets the president impose tariffs if national security is threatened. Trump and former President Joe Biden used this as the basis for steel and aluminium tariffs imposed since 2018.</p><p>These more traditional mechanisms have been more battle-tested in court than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Gantz said, providing “a more persuasive legal basis for the tariffs”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
