The ambition is continental,” Venezuela’s UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, told a meeting of the 15-member UNSC on Tuesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“The US government has expressed this in its National Security Strategy, which states that <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/trump-warns-maduro-not-to-play-tough-as-china-russia-back-venezuela\">the future of the continent</a> belongs to them,” Moncada said.</p><p>“We want to alert the world that Venezuela is <a href=\"/video/quotable/2025/12/22/venezuelas-reserves-have-strategic-advantages-for-the-us\">only the first target</a> of a larger plan. The US government wants us to be divided so it can conquer us piece by piece,” he said.</p><p>Venezuela, earlier this month, requested that the UNSC meet to address the “ongoing US aggression”, which began in September when the White House launched air strikes against vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The White House claimed, without providing any evidence, that the vessels were trafficking drugs to the US.</p><p>At least 105 people have been killed so far in the attacks by US forces, which legal experts and Latin American leaders have branded “extrajudicial killings”, but which Washington claims are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to US shores.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>At the UNSC meeting, Moncada also accused the administration of US President Donald Trump of violating both international and US domestic law, since the White House has been acting without the approval of the US Congress, whose authority is required to formally declare war on another country.</p><p>Moncada said that Trump’s imposition last week of a naval blockade on all Venezuelan oil tankers sanctioned by the US was a “military act aimed at laying siege to the Venezuelan nation”.</p><p>“Today, the masks have come off,” Moncada said. “It is not drugs, it is not security, it is not freedom. It is oil, it is mines and it is land.”</p><h2 id=\"us-envoy-denounces-maduro-and-his-illegitimate-regime\">US envoy denounces ‘Maduro and his illegitimate regime’</h2><p>US forces have seized at least two Venezuelan oil tankers and confiscated at least 4 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, according to Moncada, in a move he described as “a robbery carried out by military force”.</p><p>The US has defended its naval blockade of Venezuela as a “law enforcement” action to be carried out by the US coastguard, which has the authority to board ships under US sanctions. A naval blockade, by contrast, would be considered an act of war under international law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, told the UNSC that Latin American drug cartels remain the “single most serious threat” and that Trump would continue to use the full power of the US to eradicate them. Waltz also said that Venezuelan oil is a critical component in funding the cartels in Venezuela.</p><p>“The reality of the situation is that sanctioned oil tankers operate as the primary economic lifeline for Maduro and his illegitimate regime,” he said.</p><p>The White House earlier this year designated several international drug cartels, including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, as terrorist organisations. Washington also added the “Cartel de los Soles,” which it claims is headed by Maduro, to the list in November.</p><p>The Venezuelan leader has denied the US allegations and accused the Trump administration of using the drug trafficking claims as a cover to carry out “regime change” in his country.</p><p>Russia’s ambassador to the UN separately warned that US “intervention” in Venezuela could “become a template for future acts of force against Latin American states”.</p><p>China’s ambassador told the UNSC that the US actions “seriously infringe” on the “sovereignty, security and legitimate rights” of Venezuela.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, a rate that has remained unchanged since July 2009.</p><p>About one in six American adults holds student loan debt, which totals about $1.6 trillion. As of April, more than 5 million borrowers had not made a payment in at least a year, according to the Education Department.</p><p>The garnishments are planned as economic pressure mounts for many Americans amid rising prices and a cooling labour market. According to consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, more than 1.1 million people lost their jobs in 2025 as job growth slowed. Federal data also showed mixed employment trends in recent months with job losses reported in October followed by modest gains in November.</p><p>In the months of October and November, the unemployment rate <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/16/us-unemployment-hits-highest-level-since-2021-as-labour-market-cools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased to 4.6 percent,</a> the highest since 2021, according to the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>“Families are being forced to choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table. The Trump administration’s decision to begin garnishing wages takes even that meagre choice away from student loan borrowers who are living on the brink,” Julie Margetta Morgan, former deputy undersecretary at the Education Department under former President Joe Biden, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Instead of solving the affordability crisis that’s leaving Americans unable to pay their student loans, the president is further punishing families and forcing them to forgo the very basics.”</p><p>In addition to wages, the federal government has the authority to garnish income from tax refunds, Social Security benefits and certain disability payments.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The GNU statement said that all state institutions would fly flags at half-mast, while official ceremonies and celebrations would be suspended.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inquiry-under-way\">Inquiry under way</h2><p>Turkiye’s Minister of Interior Ali Yerlikaya said on X that al-Haddad’s plane took off from Ankara’s Esenboga airport at 8:10pm local time (17:10 GMT) en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost about 40 minutes later.</p><p>He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district.</p><p>Yerlikaya added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana before all communication ceased.</p><p>Burhanettin Duran, the head of the Turkish presidential communications office, said the plane notified air traffic control of an electrical fault and requested an emergency landing. The aircraft was redirected back to Esenboga, where preparations for its landing began.</p><p>The plane, however, disappeared from the radar while descending for the emergency landing, Duran said.</p><p>Security camera footage aired on local television stations showed the night sky over Haymana suddenly lit up by what appeared to be an explosion.</p><p>Turkish Minister of Justice Yilmaz Tunc said that the Ankara chief prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into the incident.</p><p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, a Turkish official said that “initial reports from the investigation rule out any sabotage to the Libyan Army Chief plane crash”.</p><p>The initial cause is technical failure, the official added.</p><p>According to the GNU, Libya will send a team to Ankara to work with Turkish authorities on investigating the crash.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"huge-loss\">‘Huge loss’</h2><p>Walid Ellafi, the GNU’s state minister of political affairs and communication, told the broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready.</p><p>He said the jet that crashed was a leased Maltese aircraft and that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Al Jazeera’s Malik Traina, reporting from Tripoli, described al-Haddad’s death as a “huge loss” to the Libyan military and said there has been an “outpouring of grief” from across the country, including from the rival administration in eastern Benghazi.</p><p>Eastern Libya commander Khalifa Haftar issued a statement expressing his “deep sorrow over this tragic loss”, while the House of Representatives in Benghazi offered their condolences to the families of al-Haddad and his delegation.</p><p>Al-Haddad was “well respected across western Libya and across the country”, said Traina. He was a career soldier who supported the rebels during the 2011 uprising against Gaddafi and was highly regarded for his refusal to align with powerful militias that have fragmented the country’s security landscape since the civil war, said Traina.</p><p>“Here, in Western Libya, it’s extremely fractured. We have powerful armed groups that control vast areas of land. They have a huge influence on the government. But Mohammed al-Haddad refused to bow down to the pressure of these armed groups. He was always talking about reconciliation,” the Al Jazeera correspondent said.</p><p>“He was trying to bring the country together. People rallied behind him. They had hope; trust that perhaps, possibly, that through Mohammed al-Haddad, they could broker a deal with eastern Libya and come up with some sort of agreement that will unify this divided country,” he added.</p><p>Al-Haddad had been the army’s chief of general staff since August 2020, and was appointed by then-Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.</p><p>Turkiye’s ‌Ministry of National Defence had announced the Libyan chief of staff’s visit ‌to Ankara earlier this week, saying ⁠he had met his Turkish counterpart, Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, Turkish Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler, and other Turkish military commanders.</p><p>The crash occurred a day ‌after Turkiye’s parliament passed a decision to extend the mandate ⁠of Turkish soldiers’ deployment in Libya by two more years.</p><p class=\"p1\">Ankara has close ties with the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, which it provides with economic and military support.</p><p>In 2020, it sent military personnel there to train and support the government, and later reached a maritime demarcation ‌accord.</p><p>In 2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy exploration.</p><p>Turkiye has recently switched course under its “One Libya” policy and ramped up contacts with Libya’s eastern faction as well.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to <a href=\"/features/2025/6/26/israels-media-amplifies-war-rhetoric-ignores-gazas-suffering\">analysts</a> inside Israel, the selective broadcasting of Palestinian suffering during Israel’s war on Gaza has helped sustain the carnage and reinforced a sense of grievance that allows for Israel’s continued assaults on Gaza as well as regional countries, such as Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.</p><p>Despite what observers characterise as a media environment firmly rigged in its favour, the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which contains ministers convicted of “terrorism” offences and others who have repeatedly called for the illegal annexation of the occupied West Bank, is looking nevertheless to bypass legal checks on its control of the media and bring more of Israel’s information feed under its control.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Because the government believes it is too critical.</p><p>Israeli politicians have long complained about how the war in Gaza has been covered in both the international and domestic media.</p><p>But the government added a new accusation in November, partly blaming the media for the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>“If there hadn’t been a media entirely mobilised to encourage refusal [to volunteer to reserve duty] and reckless opposition to the judicial reform, there wouldn’t have been such a rift in the nation that led the enemy to seize the opportunity,” Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said as he introduced a bill to increase government control of the news environment, referring to attempts by the Israeli government to <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/israels-parliament-passes-law-to-expand-coontrol-over-judge-appointments\">reduce the independence of the judiciary</a><span>.</span></p><figure id=\"attachment_2880252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2880252\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2880252\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP23191634215187-1714906834.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, speaks to Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi at the Knesset, Israel's parliament\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2880252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, speaks to Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi in the Knesset in West Jerusalem [File: Maya Alleruzzo/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the ‘Al Jazeera Law’, there are three items of legislation under way: a plan to privatise Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, the move to abolish Army Radio, and an initiative to bring the media regulator under government control.</p><p>Both Army Radio and Kan, the other state-funded outlet with editorial independence, have carried numerous reports critical of the government.</p><p>This week, Kan aired an interview with Netanyahu’s former spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who told the broadcaster that the prime minister had instructed him to develop a strategy to help <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/netanyahu-finally-announces-october-7-inquiry-why-are-israelis-furious\">evade responsibility</a> for the October 7 attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, justifying the move to shut down Army Radio, said on Monday that the outlet had become a platform to attack the Israeli military and its soldiers.</p><p>Israel is also potentially changing the way it regulates its media. In November, the Israeli parliament pressed ahead with a bill that would abolish existing media regulators and replace them with a new authority appointed by the government, potentially allowing for even greater state interference.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3872363\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3872363\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3872363\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-06-05T152912Z_1505392990_RC2358AH1Y5M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-POLITICS-1754322142.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara listens on as she attends a cabinet meeting at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem on June 5, 2024.

It was first enacted as emergency legislation in <a href=\"/news/2024/5/5/netanyahu-government-votes-to-close-al-jazeera-channel-in-israel\">May 2024</a> when Israel used it to ban Al Jazeera from its territory, and it was then used in the same month to halt the activity of The Associated Press after the government <a href=\"/news/2024/5/21/israeli-officials-seize-ap-equipment-citing-alleged-media-law-violation\">accused</a> the United States-based news agency of sharing footage with Al Jazeera.</p><p>Under the new law, the communications minister – with the prime minister’s sign-off and the backing of a ministerial committee – may halt a foreign broadcaster’s transmissions if the prime minister accepts a professional assessment that the outlet poses a security threat. The minister can also shut the broadcaster’s offices, confiscate equipment used to produce its content and block access to its website.</p><h2 id=\"have-the-moves-been-criticised\">Have the moves been criticised?</h2><p>The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the United Kingdom’s National Union of Journalists have criticised Israel’s decision to legislate against foreign media platforms it deems a security threat.</p><p>In a statement, IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said: “Israel is openly waging a battle against media outlets, both local and foreign, that criticise the government’s narrative: that is typical behavior of authoritarian regimes. We are deeply concerned about the Israeli parliament passing this controversial bill, as it would be a serious blow to free speech and media freedom, and a direct attack on the public’s right to know.”</p><p>The attempt to shutter Army Radio has also been heavily criticised with Israeli Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara declaring the move unlawful and accusing Netanyahu’s coalition of making public broadcasting “weakened, threatened and institutionally silenced and its future shrouded in mist”.</p><p>Baharav-Miara has also criticised the move to place media regulation under government control, saying the bill “endangers the very principle of press freedom”.</p><p>Not very.</p><p>The Israeli media have overwhelmingly been a consistent cheerleader of the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza, where more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel, and in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The suffering of Palestinians is rarely shown, and when it is, it is often justified.</p><p>Even as Israel has killed <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/here-are-the-names-of-the-journalists-israel-killed-in-gaza\">more than 270 journalists and media workers</a> in Gaza, the Israeli media have provided cover for the actions of its government and military.</p><p>That means Israelis often don’t recogise the hypocrisy of their government’s statements.</p><p>An example came in June after Iran struck an evacuated hospital during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. The Israeli government called the incident a war crime, and the Israeli media reflected that outrage.</p><p>But the attack came after Israel had been accused by a variety of organisations, including the United Nations, of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system with medical workers targeted for arrest and frequently tortured despite their protection under international law.</p><p>“The Israeli media … sees its job as not to educate – it’s to shape and mould a public that is ready to support war and aggression,” journalist Orly Noy <a href=\"/features/2025/6/26/israels-media-amplifies-war-rhetoric-ignores-gazas-suffering\">told</a> Al Jazeera from West Jerusalem in the wake of the strike on the Israeli medical centre. “It genuinely sees itself as having a special role in this.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The White House did not immediately respond to a request by the Reuters news agency for comment on the email.</p><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a statement on Tuesday saying some documents included “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump and had been submitted to the FBI after the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost, but it did not provide further details.</p><p>“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the DOJ said in a social media post.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration had fought against the release of the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/21/epstein-files-whose-names-and-photos-are-in-the-latest-document-drop\">Epstein-related documents</a> and has been accused of subverting the law passed in November when a tranche of documents released last week included <a href=\"/news/2025/12/21/slap-in-the-face-epstein-victims-slam-release-of-heavily-redacted-files\">heavy redactions</a>. The latest release includes about 8,000 files, which include video and audio recordings and 30,000 pages of documents.</p><p>Many names and details in the recent release are redacted. Some of the redactions appear to obscure the names of prosecutors and government officials, going beyond an exemption in the Epstein files law that allows for limited redactions to protect details about Epstein’s victims.</p><p>“On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case,” the document said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On one flight, the only three passengers were Trump, Epstein and a 20-year-old woman whose name is redacted.</p><p>Some videos were said to show the inside of a federal detention centre where Epstein died in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide, but speculation around the circumstances of his death has continued to swirl.</p><p>Trump has played down the significance of the Epstein files, stating on Monday that they were being used by his political rivals to “deflect against tremendous success” by his administration.</p><p>A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll suggested 52 percent of people in the US disapprove of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, while 23 percent approve. About 70 percent said they believed the government is hiding details about Epstein’s relationships with powerful associates who may have participated in sex trafficking of teenage girls.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans have continued to push for the release of further materials. Trump’s right-wing base has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-blasts-maga-focus-on-jeffrey-epstein-after-memo-causes-uproar\">been divided</a> over his handling of Epstein-related documents, which members of his administration had promised to release before entering the White House.</p><p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie accused Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday of “working fervently to redact, omit and delete Epstein files she is legally required to release under our bill”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Israeli media reported that US officials were displeased with Katz’s initial comments and demanded clarification.</p><p>Nahal units are military formations that combine civilian service with army enlistment and have historically played a role in the creation of Israeli communities.</p><p>Katz was speaking at a ceremony in the occupied West Bank marking the approval of 1,200 housing units in the illegal Israeli settlement of Beit El.</p><p>Addressing settlement expansion in the West Bank, Katz said: “Netanyahu’s government is a settlements government … it strives for action.

Far-right and ultranationalist members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition have repeatedly said they intend to reoccupy Gaza and expand illegal settlements in the West Bank.</p><p>Under international law, all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal. The transfer of an occupying power’s civilian population into occupied territory is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p><p>Meanwhile, violence by Israeli forces and settlers has continued across the West Bank, while killings continue in Gaza despite the ceasefire.

Since the start of Israel’s war on October 7, 2023, the ministry said, 70,942 Palestinians have been killed and 171,195 wounded.</p></div></div></body></html>"
