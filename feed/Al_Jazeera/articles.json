With Thursday’s order, it would be fast-tracked down to Schedule III, in a class with ketamine and anabolic steroids.</p><p>Trump said the change “is not the legalisation” of marijuana, and he added that it “in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug”.</p><p>The change, however, will make it easier to conduct research on marijuana, as studies on Schedule III drugs require far less approval than for Schedule I substances.</p><p>Speaking earlier in the week, Trump told reporters the change was popular “because it leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify, so we are looking at that very strongly”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The change is in line with several states that have moved to legalise marijuana for both medical and recreational use.

Leavitt credited the sitting president with overseeing the facility’s “reconstruction” and bolstering its finances and “reputation”.</p><p>It is unclear, however, whether the name change would move forward without congressional approval.</p><p>Opened in 1971 in Washington, DC, the arts centre is home to the Washington National Opera and the National Symphony Orchestra. It includes seven stages and hosts touring shows as well as local performances.</p><p>Ground was broken on the structure in 1964, a year after Kennedy, the 35th president of the US, was assassinated during a public appearance in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>While the idea for a national arts centre predated Kennedy, the Democratic leader was credited with supporting the fundraising efforts that helped transform the project into a reality.</p><p>On January 23, 1964, Kennedy’s successor Lyndon B Johnson signed into law an act of Congress naming the arts centre after the slain leader. Previously, the arts complex was slated to be called the “National Cultural Center”.</p><p>The Kennedy Center, the congressional act proclaimed, would serve as a “living memorial” to the late president. The act noted that Kennedy had been “particularly devoted to the advancement of the performing arts”.</p><p>“It is only fitting and proper that a suitable monument be dedicated to the memory of this great leader,” the act read, adding that no other memorial would be erected in Kennedy’s honour in Washington, DC.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160087\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160087\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160087\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afp_6936d48284f4-1765201026.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 07: U.S. President Donald Trump attends the 48th annual Kennedy Center Honors at the Kennedy Center on December 07, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Since taking office in January, he has also teased plans to raise a triumphal arch in the capital, similar in style to Paris’s Arc de Triomphe.</p><p>Just this month, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/1996368099160080884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that a congressionally established think tank, the US Institute for Peace, had been renamed after Trump to honour “the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history”.</p><p>The Trump administration had forcibly taken control of the institute in March, and leadership over the think tank remains the subject of an ongoing lawsuit. A federal judge in May, however, called the nonprofit’s seizure “unlawful”.</p><p>Trump has long had his eye on the Kennedy Center in particular, and changes to the art centre arrived quickly after the Republican president took office in January.</p><p>Just a week into Trump’s second term, the president of the Kennedy Center, Deborah Rutter, stepped down amid rumours of a pressure campaign.</p><p>By early February, Trump had announced a purge of the Kennedy Center’s board members, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113964959500715895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claiming</a> on social media that they stood against his “Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”.</p><p>“At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN,” he said, offering a twist on his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.</p><p>He added that he would take the helm as the centre’s chairman, overseeing programming.</p><p>“Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” Trump wrote. “The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”</p><p>The leadership shakeup was greeted by protests and cancellations, with touring productions of hit shows like the musical Hamilton and Fellow Travelers dropping out of the Kennedy Center’s lineup.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4183097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4183097\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25297585935508-1766090891.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Worker paints gold columns white at the Kennedy Center\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Worker Odden Shaw paints over a gold-colored column inside the Hall of Nations at the Kennedy Center on October 24 [Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"renaming-the-kennedy-center\">Renaming the Kennedy Center</h2><p>Still, in the months since, Trump has repeatedly referred to the arts institution as the “Trump-Kennedy Center”, signalling his desire to have his name etched on its marble facade.</p><p>He also selected the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award given for lifetime achievement in US arts and culture.</p><p>While announcing the honorees in August, Trump gave a winking allusion to his petition to change the Kennedy Center’s name.</p><p>“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115015798555807745\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>He also played up the changes he had made to the art centre’s structure, including by painting its formerly gold columns white.</p><p>“Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” Trump wrote. “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!”</p><p>Certain Republicans took up Trump’s call to rebaptise the art centre. Representative <a href=\"https://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Simpson</a> of Idaho, for instance, introduced a bill that would name the complex’s opera house after First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Congressman Bob Onder of Missouri, meanwhile, put forward another piece of legislation to wipe Kennedy’s name away entirely, calling the art complex instead the “Donald J Trump Center for Performing Arts”.</p><p>But those kinds of proposals have met significant pushback, including from the surviving Kennedy family.</p><p>On Thursday, in the wake of Leavitt’s announcement, President Kennedy’s niece Maria Shriver expressed shock that the art centre might be renamed.</p><p>“Some things leave you speechless, and enraged, and in a state of disbelief. At times such as that, it’s better to be quiet. For how long, I can’t say,” she <a href=\"http://x.com/mariashriver/status/2001737390306791682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>When similar proposals had been floated in the past, Shriver <a href=\"https://x.com/mariashriver/status/1949954611793842186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> the idea “insane” and said, “It makes my blood boil.”</p><p>Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy’s grandson and a Democratic candidate for Congress in the 2026 midterms, appeared to question whether the White House’s announcement was even legitimate.</p><p>“Microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/2001728352030232609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Democrats likewise voiced outrage at the proposed name change, with some questioning if it was even legal, given the congressional act that gives the structure its name.</p><p>Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, for instance, called the initiative “deeply troubling”.</p><p>“Renaming the Kennedy Center to include a sitting or former president’s name, particularly one who is still a partisan political figure, undermines the purpose of the institution,” Cohen said in a <a href=\"https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cohen-urges-president-trump-reject-inappropriate-renaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“The Kennedy Center should remain what it was always meant to be: a living memorial to President Kennedy and a cultural home for all Americans, not a vehicle for personal or political branding.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

As such, they should be managed in a hospital setting, particularly in the event that complications arise.”</p><p>Pressure has been piling for weeks on Lammy, who has refused to meet with the lawyers to address their concerns over the activists’ welfare.</p><p>Teuta Hoxha, who is on the 40th day of her strike, suffers from low blood pressure, headaches, chest tightness and shortness of breath.</p><p>Her 17-year-old sister, Rahma, said Teuta feels “weak” and nauseous, and is preparing to die.</p><p>“Lammy needs to urgently meet with the lawyers, to save my sister’s life,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"this-is-a-very-deadly-period\">‘This is a very deadly period’</h2><p>When they are hospitalised, the prisoners are unable to call their loved ones, as they do from jail.</p><p>Hoxha said her sister recently discharged herself from hospital against medical advice in order to tell her family about her condition. Ella Mousdale, a relative of Zuhrah’s, said she had done the same.</p><p>Zuhrah, 20, has suffered with chest pains, exhaustion, and a consistently high pulse of 100bpm “despite doing next to no physical activity”, her lawyers said. She has told loved ones that she regularly collapses in prison.</p><p>“She’s very slow. She’s hunched over. Physically, she’s just had body pains all over and just is extremely weak, so she can’t hug me back any more,” Mousdale told Al Jazeera after visiting her on Sunday.</p><p>“It’s difficult for her to stay awake. It’s difficult for her to talk for long periods of time.”</p><p>Zuhrah stopped communicating with the family on Wednesday, so they assumed she had been transferred to hospital, with Mousdale saying they no longer knew if she was alive.</p><p>“This is a very deadly period,” she said.</p><p>Protesters, including medics, gathered outside of HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, where Zuhrah is detained on charges relating to the incident in Bristol.</p><p>The left-wing MP Zarah Sultana joined the demonstration on Wednesday, demanding that prison officials transfer Zuhrah to hospital. An ambulance arrived several hours later, footage shared on social media showed, but it was unclear if Zuhrah had been hospitalised.</p><p>Sultana confirmed in a post on X on Thursday night that Zuhrah was “safe and is continuing her hunger strike”.</p><p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told Al Jazeera that a member of prison staff had been injured in scuffles between protesters and the police, but they were unable to confirm the circumstances or gravity of their injury.</p><p>The spokesperson described the protest as “completely unacceptable”, citing security risks, adding that the Prison Service has assured ministers “that all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in accordance with the relevant policy, and with appropriate medical assessment and support – consistent with prisoner rights”.</p><p>A spokesperson of Sodexo, the company that manages HMP Bronzefield, said, prisoners refusing food receive “regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, as well as being offered mental health support”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmed, who has refused food for 39 days, is “losing half a kilogram [one pound] every day”, his sister Shahmina Alam said, adding that his ketone levels are “steeply rising” again. He now weighs 61.5kg  (135.5 pounds), having entered prison at 74kg (163 pounds).</p><p>“I call upon Lammy to please have this meeting,” she said. “[Ahmed’s] heart is slowing down … What are [they] waiting for, for it to stop?”</p><p>More than 20,000 people have signed a petition by the campaign group Avaaz calling on the justice secretary to intervene, while more than 50 MPs have joined Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing independent politician, in urging Lammy meet the hunger strikers’ lawyers.</p><p>John McDonnell, Labour MP, told Al Jazeera, “There’s a real anxiety now about what the hell is going on. Why aren’t we intervening as a government? Why aren’t we sorting this out? There’s an increasing worry that we’re in a situation now which is highly risky.”</p><p>So far, Lammy has not responded to the request for a meeting “for reasons he has not explained and which are not clear to us”, said Daniel Lemberger Cooper, the solicitor for the hunger strikers, as he described their attempts to engage with the government as an effort to prevent the prisoners’ deaths rather than discuss criminal proceedings.</p><p>Some will have spent more than two years in prison before their trial takes place.</p><p>The former Guantanamo detainee Mansroor Adayfi, who was held in the notorious camp for more than 14 years without charge, joined the hunger strike in solidarity on Wednesday.</p><p>“Hunger strikes are not a protest of choice – they are a last resort. The British government wants these men and women to disappear quietly,” said Adayfi.</p><p>“This hunger strike is not about food, it’s about dignity and justice. It’s about remand being used as punishment. A system that believes that silence will protect it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has proposed a suite of new rules that seek to bar hospitals across the United States from performing gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth below 18 years of age.</p><p>On Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that one of the proposed rules would block hospitals and clinics from accessing its programmes if they chose to continue providing gender-affirming care.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>A second rule would prohibit federal Medicaid funds from going to gender-affirming procedures.</p><p>Both Medicare and Medicaid are forms of government-provided health insurance, offered to vulnerable groups. Medicaid primarily serves low-income households, while Medicare offers coverage to older Americans and people with disabilities.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-acts-bar-hospitals-performing-sex-rejecting-procedures-children\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, the Trump administration noted that the vast majority of healthcare providers work with Medicare and Medicaid to provide health coverage for their patients. The proposed rule would therefore amount to a de facto ban on gender-affirming care.</p><p>“Nearly all US hospitals participate in Medicare and Medicaid,” the CMS statement reads.</p><p>“This action is designed to ensure that the US government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”</p><p>In addition to the two proposed rules, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr signed a declaration on Thursday rejecting gender-affirming care as detrimental to youth.</p><p>Under his orders, the Food and Drug Administration also issued notices to 12 manufacturers of chest binders — which flatten the upper torso, where breasts are — warning that marketing to transgender youth would be considered illegal under the current administration.</p><h2 id=\"diverging-from-medical-consensus\">Diverging from medical consensus</h2><p>The string of pronouncements marked the Trump administration’s latest broadside against transgender healthcare, despite repeated warnings from top medical associations that prohibiting such treatment could have devastating, lifelong consequences.</p><p>But in a news conference on Thursday, Kennedy, who has no formal medical training, lashed out against some of the country’s leading medical groups, accusing them of violating their professional duties.</p><p>“The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics peddled the lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,” Kennedy said.</p><p>“They betrayed their Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. So-called gender-affirming care has inflicted lasting physical and psychological damage on vulnerable young people. This is not medicine. It is malpractice.”</p><p>CMS Director Mehmet Oz likewise accused healthcare practitioners of abusing patients’ trust by prescribing gender-affirming treatments. He suggested the motivation was not the patients’ health but rather profit.</p><p>“ The doctor can’t look them in the eyes and treat them like a child that’s confused and lost and needs help. They become an opportunity. They become eventually a victim,” Oz said.</p><p>“ Reasonable evidence-based objections that a child’s confusion might resolve over time have been ignored, even though it makes common sense.”</p><p>The Trump administration has taken a hardline against the transgender community, denying such an identity even exists.</p><p>Instead, upon taking office on January 20, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> announcing that the federal government would recognise only the concept of biological sex, not gender identity, and that people would be categorised as either male or female, according to their birth certificates.</p><p>The executive order also rejected transgender identity as a “false” concept.</p><h2 id=\"problem-that-does-not-actually-exist\">‘Problem that does not actually exist’</h2><p>Eight days later, on January 28, Trump followed that executive order with a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second one</a> that called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to end practices it described as “the chemical and surgical mutilation of children”.</p><p>That order was cited as the basis for Thursday’s proposed rule and declarations to limit gender-affirming care.</p><p>But there is a wide consensus in the healthcare community that gender-affirming care can improve the health of transgender youth, including by lowering incidents of suicide, anxiety, self-harm and depression.</p><p>Gender-affirming care can take a range of forms, from surgery to puberty blockers, a treatment considered safe and reversible for children seeking to delay the onset of puberty.</p><p>Such treatments are recommended only after in-depth consultation with a trusted healthcare professional, and surgery is incredibly rare among transgender youth.</p><p>One 2024 study from Harvard University found that, for every 100,000 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17, an average of 2.1 teenagers sought gender-affirming surgery, according to medical insurance claims from 2019.</p><p>That average dropped to 0.1 for teens between 13 and 14 years of age, and no cases were reported under the age of 12.</p><p>One of the study’s authors, Dannie Dai, said in a news release that the results suggested that “legislation blocking gender-affirming care among TGD [transgender and gender-diverse] youth is not about protecting children, but is rooted in bias and stigma”.</p><p>Dai added that such government actions seek “to address a perceived problem that does not actually exist”.</p><p>Shortly after Thursday’s announcements, groups like the Human Rights Campaign called on the public to voice their concern about the Trump administration’s proposed new rules.</p><p>“These rules now face a 60-day ‘comment period,’ where YOU can weigh in,” the Human Rights Campaign wrote on its social media.</p><p>“A large number of comments can slow it down, force changes, or lay the groundwork for future litigation. YOUR comments are where that starts.”</p><h2 id=\"congressional-actions-under-way\">Congressional actions under way</h2><p>Already, 27 states prohibit gender-affirming care for minors, including major population centres like Texas, Ohio and Florida.</p><p>As a result, the Human Rights Campaign estimates that, out of the 300,000 transgender youth in the US, nearly 40 percent live in a state where they cannot access the healthcare they may need.</p><p>Those state actions have been supported by actions on the federal level. In June, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority voted in a six-to-three decision to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p>Just this week, on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2001325085848719846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bill</a> that would criminalise providing gender-affirming care for patients aged below 18. A total of 216 representatives, including several Democrats, voted in favour of sending the bill to the Senate, where it faces uncertain odds.</p><p>Another House bill, designed to cut off Medicaid benefits for transgender youth seeking gender-affirming care, is slated to be voted upon on Thursday.</p><p>While proponents fear youths may make healthcare decisions they come to regret later in life, advocates emphasise that some gender-affirming treatments, including puberty blockers, are reversible and that they can protect teenagers from physical and emotional harm.</p><p>Standing on the steps of Congress, Representative Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of the House, said she believes there is a gap in the public’s understanding of gender-affirming treatments.</p><p>“I get that it’s hard to understand this care and understand the need for it,” McBride told reporters. “But one of the things that gets so lost in this conversation is that the transgender adults of today were kids once. I was a kid once.”</p><p>“My biggest regret in life,” she continued, “is that I never had a childhood without that pain.”</p><p>McBride voted against the legislation and denounced the “hate” she felt motivated it. “Politicians should never insert themselves into the personal health care decisions of patients, parents, and their providers — and that includes trans Americans,” she later <a href=\"https://x.com/Rep_McBride/status/2001427693070430595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Kennedy, meanwhile, told reporters that he anticipates lawsuits will challenge the Trump administration’s proposed changes.</p><p>“I think that’s going to happen. The number of lawsuits with my name on it right now is almost beyond counting,” he said.</p><p>He added that the Trump administration was confident it would win any lawsuits. “It’s a disgrace to the medical establishment that they let this go on for so long.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It nevertheless pledged to carry out its mandate, despite US pressure.</p><p>“When judicial actors are threatened for applying the law, it is the international legal order itself that is placed at risk,” it said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The sanctions come in part as a protest against the ICC’s decision in November 2024 to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>The court also issued arrest warrants for several Hamas leaders, who were subsequently killed in Israeli operations.</p><p>The Trump administration has also pressured the court to officially end an investigation into US forces’ conduct during its two decade deployment in Afghanistan.</p><p>The US and Israel are not members of the ICC, and the Trump administration argues the court has exceeded its jurisdiction by investigating US and Israeli citizens.</p><p>“We will not tolerate ICC abuses of power that violate the sovereignty of the United States and Israel and wrongly subject US and Israeli persons to the ICC’s jurisdiction,” Rubio said on Thursday.</p><p>But the court has maintained it can investigate abuses committed by the two countries within the borders of its signatories, including the occupied Palestinian territories.</p><p>In a post on the social media platform X, Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director for the human rights nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), said Rubio is “coddling Israeli war criminals”.</p><p>She added that the court should “not wait to prosecute him for interfering with justice”.</p><p>The foreign minister of The Netherlands, where the ICC is located, also condemned the move.</p><p>“International courts and tribunals must be able to freely carry out their mandates,” David van Weel said in a post on X. “We will continue to work with partners to this end. We support the court and its staff.”</p><p>Israeli officials have repeatedly cheered the Trump administration’s sanctions. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 171,152 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed 1,139 people.</p><p>The US also announced sanctions on Thursday against 29 vessels and management companies it said were linked to Iran.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The meetings are ostensibly to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah last year, despite the fact that Israel has violated the agreement on a regular basis.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Since October 8, 2023, Israel has killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon after its war with the Lebanese group began. A ceasefire was agreed on November 27, 2024, but since then, Israel has killed more than 300 people, including at least 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. The talks come as Israel continues to attack Lebanon on a <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">near-daily basis</a> and threatens to <a href=\"/features/2025/11/27/beirut-attacks-leaves-lebanon-worried-and-waiting-for-another-israeli-war\">expand</a> its war on the country.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-is-meeting\">Who is meeting?</h2><p>A special committee of representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon, and the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is based in Naqoura.</p><p>The committee is chaired by a US general and was originally composed of military officials. But due to Israeli pressure, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun appointed Simon Karam, a Lebanese diplomat, to participate earlier this month.</p><p>Israel reportedly wants the inclusion of civilians to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as plans for potential economic cooperation.</p><p>Israel also appointed a civilian representative from its National Security Council, Uri Resnick, and the meeting was also attended by US Special Representative for Lebanon Morgan Ortagus.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-goal\">What is the goal?</h2><p>The committee’s plan of action is to monitor the ceasefire agreed last year.</p><p>The terms of the ceasefire were left relatively undefined, but it was widely assumed that attacks from both sides would cease, the Lebanese army would disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and that Israel would withdraw its troops from its northern neighbour.</p><p>Officials say Lebanon has largely met its side of the bargain. Speaking at a conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri said the army’s task of disarming Hezbollah below the Litani River, which runs across southern Lebanon, was nearly completed, apart from the places where Israel still occupies Lebanese land.</p><p>However, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">violated</a> the ceasefire repeatedly and continues to occupy five locations in southern Lebanon.</p><p>“The main task of the mechanism is to oversee and verify and do everything possible to respect the agreement,” Mitri said.</p><p>Lebanon has been “strictly observing” the ceasefire agreement since day one, but that is not the case for Israel, he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-outcome-of-the-last-meeting\">What was the outcome of the last meeting?</h2><p>The members of the so-called mechanism met in Naqoura, south Lebanon, on December 3. The meeting was reportedly positive.</p><p>The inclusion of civilians “reflects the Mechanism’s commitment to facilitating political and military discussions with the aim of achieving security, stability, and a durable peace for all communities affected by the conflict”, the US embassy said in a statement about the meeting</p><p>The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement that emphasised potential future economic agreement between his country and Lebanon. However, analysts believe that is a far-fetched proposition considering Israel is still occupying territory in southern Lebanon, and more than 88,000 Lebanese are still displaced from their homes in the region.</p><p>Despite the alleged positivity of the meeting, Israel <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/another-devastating-israeli-strike-on-lebanon-captured-on-video\">attacked</a> Lebanon the very next day.</p><h2 id=\"is-normalisation-on-the-agenda\">Is normalisation on the agenda?</h2><p>From the Lebanese side, no. Normalising relations with Israel after a war that killed thousands, including many civilians, would anger a large segment of the population.</p><p>But there has been US and Israeli pressure to find a peace agreement and to move towards normalisation.</p><p>The mechanism meeting is also a place for other bilateral discussions between Israel and Lebanon, which do not have direct relations.</p><p>On the Lebanese side, border delineation is a priority. On the Israeli side, a <a href=\"/features/2025/9/1/will-us-backed-economic-zone-incentivise-lebanon-to-disarm-hezbollah\">US-backed economic zone</a> is high on the agenda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-if-israel-is-unhappy-with-the-talks-will-it-launch-a-war\">So if Israel is unhappy with the talks, will it launch a war?</h2><p>That is still unclear.</p><p>Israel has claimed Hezbollah is rearming, though analysts say the group is not an <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">existential threat</a> to Israel. The group, long the political and military hegemon in Lebanon, was badly weakened during last year’s war with Israel. Much of its senior military leadership was assassinated, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>With Hezbollah weakened, some analysts believe Israel’s decision will be based on internal Israeli politics and dependent on international pressure on Israel.</p><p>Officials from the US, Saudi Arabia, and France met the head of the Lebanese army in Paris on Thursday in an effort to coordinate positions and possibly avoid an Israeli intensification in Lebanon. They also agreed to document the Lebanese military’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-hezbollah-in-all-of-this\">Where is Hezbollah in all of this?</h2><p>Publicly, it has refused the Lebanese government’s plans for full disarmament.</p><p>The group says Israel’s behaviour – continuing to attack and occupy Lebanese territory – justifies its position.</p><p>But how it will respond should the ceasefire move forward is yet to be seen. In the proposed second phase, the Lebanese army would start to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure between the Litani and Awali Rivers – the area between Sidon in the south, and Beirut, roughly in the middle of Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has been militarily and politically weakened since last year’s war. But while analysts and diplomats have told Al Jazeera that they do not believe the group is strong enough to pose a threat to Israel, it could still cause problems domestically if it feels that it is being cornered.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This included the personal details of people from Somalia, Portugal, Sweden, the United States and Switzerland.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent questions to the Somali government and alerted them about the system flaw, but did not receive a response.</p><p>“The government’s push to deploy the e-visa system despite being clearly unprepared for potential risks, then redeploying it after a serious data breach, is a clear example of how disregard for people’s concerns and rights when introducing digital infrastructures can erode public trust and create avoidable vulnerabilities,” Andere said.</p><p>“It’s also alarming that the Somalian authorities have not issued any formal notice about this [November] serious data breach.”</p><p>“In such situations, Somalia’s data protection law mandates data controllers to notify the data protection authority, and in high-risk contexts such as in this incident, to also notify the individuals affected,” Andere added.</p><p>“Extra protections should apply in this case because it involves people of different nationalities and therefore multiple legal jurisdictions.”</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot reveal technical details about the breach because the vulnerability has not yet been fixed, so publishing it could provide hackers with enough information to replicate the leak.</p><p>Any sensitive information Al Jazeera obtained as part of this investigation has been destroyed to ensure the privacy of those affected.</p><h2 id=\"previous-breach\">Previous breach</h2><p>Last month, the US and United Kingdom governments sent out a warning about a data breach that leaked the information of more than 35,000 people who had applied for an e-visa to Somalia.</p><p>“Leaked data from the breach included visa applicants’ names, photos, dates and places of birth, email addresses, marital status, and home addresses,” the US Embassy in Somalia said at the time.</p><p>In response to that data breach, Somalia’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency (ICA) changed its e-visa website to a new domain in an attempt to increase security.</p><p>The immigration agency said on November 16 that it was treating the issue with “special importance” and announced it had launched an investigation into the issue.</p><p>Earlier that week, Somalia’s Defence Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi had praised the e-visa system, claiming it had successfully prevented ISIL (ISIS) fighters from entering the country, as a months-long battle continued in the northern regions against a local affiliate of the group.</p><p>Access Now’s Andere highlighted that governments often rush to implement e-visa systems, which frequently leads to insecure situations.</p><p>She added that it is hard for people to protect themselves against these types of data breaches.</p><p>“Data protection and cybersecurity considerations are often the first to be disregarded,” she said. “It is difficult to shift the burden to people because the data they gave is required for a particular process.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
