Some of her family were killed, while others were abducted into neighbouring Eritrea, she says. She has not heard from them since.</p><p>Though she made it out alive, her life was turned upside-down when she was forced to flee to Mekelle for safety.</p><p>Years later, Gedion sees similar patterns as people leave Tigray – most headed to the neighbouring Afar region – once again looking for the safety that has become elusive at home.</p><p>“Recurring conflict and civil war have made us zombies rather than citizens,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent weeks, enmity between Ethiopia and Eritrea has escalated amid separate accusations by both sides.</p><p>Speaking to Ethiopia’s parliament in early February, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed addressed his landlocked country’s <a href=\"https://www.fanamc.com/english/ethiopia-and-the-red-sea-are-naturally-inseparable-pm-abiy-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">access to the sea</a>, saying “the Red Sea and Ethiopia cannot remain separated forever”. This has led to accusations by Eritrea that Addis Ababa is seeking to invade its country and trying to reclaim the Red Sea Assab seaport, which it lost in 1993 with the independence of Eritrea.</p><p>Ethiopia, meanwhile, has accused Eritrean troops of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/ethiopia-demands-eritrea-immediately-withdraw-troops-from-its-territory\">occupying its territory</a> along parts of their shared border, and called for the immediate withdrawal of soldiers from the towns of Sheraro and Gulomakada, among others. Addis Ababa also accuses Eritrea of arming rebels in the vast Horn of Africa country.</p><p>Observers say the heightening tensions point to an impending war between the two countries – one that could once again involve Tigray.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320073\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320073\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PHOTO-2026-02-17-17-08-09-1771345518.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4320073\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Saba Gedion, 21, sells coffee on a street in Tigray [Zantana Gebru/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"unhealed-scars-of-war\">Unhealed scars of war</h2><p>In Tigray’s capital, a once-booming city of tourism and business, most streets are quiet.</p><p>The young people who previously frequented cafes are now often seen applying for visas and speaking with smugglers in the hope of leaving Tigray.</p><p>Helen Gessese, 36, lives in a makeshift IDP camp on the outskirts of Mekelle. She worries about what will become of the already struggling region should another conflict erupt.</p><p>Gessese is an ethnic Irob, a persecuted Catholic minority group from the border town of Dewhan in the northeastern part of Tigray.</p><p>During the Tigray war, several of her family members were kidnapped, she said, as Eritrean troops expanded their hold of the area.</p><p>As the war intensified, she fled to Mekelle, about 150km away, looking for safety. Her elderly parents were too frail to join her on foot, so she was forced to leave them behind. Like Gedion, she has not heard from them or the rest of her family since 2022.</p><p>“My life has been held back, not knowing if my elderly parents are still alive,” she told Al Jazeera, the stress of the last few years making her seem much older than she is.</p><p>In Mekelle, it is not uncommon to meet people who are anguished or frustrated – some by the renewed tensions, and many by the trauma of the previous conflict.</p><p>More than 80 percent of <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/11/2/two-years-on-tigray-war-survivors-hope-time-will-heal-the-scars-of-war\">hospitals</a> were left in ruins in Tigray during the war, according to humanitarian organisations, while <a href=\"/features/2024/10/22/how-tigray-war-rape-victims-turned-to-rwandan-genocide-survivors-to-heal\">sexual violence</a> that defined the two-year conflict is still a recurring issue. Hundreds of thousands of young people are still out of school, foreign investment that created jobs in the past has in large part evaporated, and the economy remains crippled after years of war.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly four years later, the federal government’s decision to withhold foreign funds meant for the region is deepening a <a href=\"/features/2026/1/23/hunger-death-devastation-no-respite-in-tigray-a-year-after-us-aid-cuts\">humanitarian crisis</a>. The bulk of the public service in the region, for instance, has not been paid for months.</p><p>The Ethiopia-Eritrea relationship has also deteriorated in recent years.</p><p>The longstanding foes had waged war against each other between 1998 and 2000, but in 2018, they signed a peace deal. They then became allies during the 2020-2022 civil war in Tigray against common enemy, the TPLF.</p><p>But the relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been in sharp decline since the signing of the 2022 accord that ended the Tigray war – an agreement that Asmara was not party to.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321609\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321609\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321609\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_69955e3f98750-1771396671.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - A destroyed tank is seen by the side of the road south of Humera, in an area of western Tigray, annexed by the Amhara region during the ongoing conflict, in Ethiopia, May 1, 2021.

The accusation was a first from the prime minister, following repeated denials by his government about reported mass killings, looting and the destruction of factories by Eritrean troops during the Tigray conflict.</p><p>Eritrea’s government rejected Abiy’s claims about atrocities, with Gebremeskel calling them <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-eritrea-tigray-war-108f32cdd0c24ed009bb623b597b7c96\">“cheap and despicable lies”</a>, noting that Abiy’s government had until recently been “showering praises and state medals” on Eritrean army officers.</p><p>As the tensions escalate, many observers say war between the two is now inevitable and have called for dialogue and the de-escalation of the situation.</p><p>“The situation remains highly volatile and we fear that it will deteriorate, worsening the region’s already precarious human rights and humanitarian situation,” the United Nations Human Rights spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said this month.</p><p>Kjetil Tronvoll, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Oslo New University College, told Al Jazeera a new war would have “wide-reaching implications for the region” – regardless of the outcome.</p><p>He believes the looming conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea could take the shape of a new civil war, positioning Addis Ababa against Tigray’s leadership yet again.</p><p>From Ethiopia’s side, he argues the objective would be regime change in both Asmara and Mekelle, noting that “regime change in Eritrea may lead to Ethiopia gaining control of Assab”. For Asmara and Mekelle, the aim would also be regime change in Addis Ababa, he suggests.</p><p>“If it erupts, it will be devastating for Tigray,” Tronvoll said. “The outcome of such a war will likely fundamentally alter the political landscape of Ethiopia and the Horn [of Africa],” he warned, pointing out that regional states could also be pulled into a proxy war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320067\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320067\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4ad31a25-5e0b-432b-a005-913e4d7923ac-1771345507.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C590&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People in Tigray are afraid renewed tensions may bring another war [Zantana Gebru/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fears-for-the-future\">Fears for the future</h2><p>For many in Tigray, memories of massacres committed during the 2020-2022 war are still fresh.</p><p>Axum, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the central zone of the Tigray region, is known for its tall obelisk relics of an ancient kingdom. But for 24 hours in November 2020, the city was the site of killings carried out by the Eritrean army. “Many hundreds of civilians” were killed, rights group Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/3730/2021/en/\">said</a>.</p><p>While the killings were denied by both the Eritrean and Ethiopian governments for many years, this month Abiy acknowledged they had taken place.</p><p>However, despite speaking of “mass killings” in Axum, he has been silent about the fact that the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies worked together openly as allies during that war.</p><p>Marta Keberom, a resident in her forties who hails from Axum, says very few people in her hometown have not been touched by violence in the last five years.</p><p>“The killings that happened during the war wasn’t just a conflict, it had the hallmark of a genocide where whole families were murdered without a cause,” she said of the killings that targeted Tigrayans.</p><p>“To relive that,” Keberom said, speaking at an IDP centre in Mekelle, would be “something I can’t begin to comprehend.”</p><p>Waiting for customers at her coffee stand in the city, Gedion is also afraid of what might come next.</p><p>She once aspired to be an engineer, but since being uprooted from her village, she now dreams of a future far away from Ethiopia.</p><p>She has already contacted a smuggler to help her leave, she says, through Libya and on towards the Mediterranean Sea – despite the extreme risks of such a journey.</p><p>“I would rather take a chance than die a slow, certain death with little future prospects,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel’s genocidal war has killed at least 72,061 people and wounded 171,715 since October 2023, according to the Ministry of Health. It has also shattered infrastructure and displaced the majority of the population. Financial hardship dominated conversations in markets this week.</p><p>“There is no cash among the people. There is no work. It is indeed Ramadan, but Ramadan requires money,” said Gaza City resident Waleed Zaqzouq, calling on merchants to recognise people’s economic struggles.</p><p>“Before the war, people lived a dignified life,” he added. “The situation has completely changed in the war, meaning people have been devastated and worn down.”</p><p>Harsh winter conditions have intensified suffering, with extreme cold killing children, and torrential rains flooding displacement camps and collapsing damaged buildings.</p><p>“There is much that has changed from this Ramadan to Ramadan before the war,” reflected Raed Koheel from Gaza City. “In the past, the atmosphere was more delightful. The streets were lit up with decorations. All streets had decorations. Our children were happy.”</p><p>Nevertheless, amid the overwhelming destruction, some Palestinians endeavour to maintain Ramadan traditions. In Khan Younis, calligrapher Hani Dahman painted “Welcome, Ramadan” in Arabic among the ruins as children looked on.</p><p>“We are here in Khan Younis camp, trying to bring happiness to the hearts of children, women, men and entire families,” Dahman said. “We are … sending a message to the world that we are people who seek life.”</p><p>Decorative Ramadan lights now hang among the debris. Mohammed Taniri, witnessing these efforts, observed: “When they provide such beautiful, simple decorations, it brings joy to the children. Despite all the hardships, they are trying to create a beautiful atmosphere.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Introduced in 2013 by the Manmohan Singh government led by the Congress party that preceded Modi, the trusts, unlike bonds, require the donors to disclose their identities and the amount of money being given.</p><p>But that relative transparency is not dissuading companies from major mega-donations to parties directly positioned to benefit them through policies and contracts, an analysis of recent political funding by Al Jazeera reveals.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321666\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321666\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321666\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-03-13T144252Z_1829078988_RC2UK6AH7OTP_RTRMADP_3_TATA-INDIA-SEMICONDUCTOR-1771398858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C589&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ashwini Vaishnav, Union Minster of Railways, Communications and Electronics &amp; Information Technology and N.

The main opposition Congress party got about $36m (8 percent), while other parties received the remaining amount.</p><p>This data is sourced from disclosures made during the first full year after the Supreme Court ban on bonds.</p><p>Two major corporations stood out, due to their significant financial scale and policy influence:  The Tata Group, founded in 1868 by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, is a global conglomerate with more than 30 companies spanning steel, IT, automobiles, aviation, and more. Its aggregate revenue for FY 2024-25  exceeded <a href=\"https://www.tata.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$180bn</a>. The Murugappa Group, founded in 1900 by A M Murugappa Chettiar as a money-lending business in Burma (now Myanmar), is a prominent Indian conglomerate with 29 businesses in engineering, agriculture, financial services and beyond. Its turnover stood at <a href=\"https://www.murugappa.com/media/yvnkccsm/press-release-wendt-india-q4-fy-2024-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$8.53bn</a> in 2024-25.</p><p>Documents submitted to the Election Commission of India in 2024-2025 show that the Progressive Electoral Trust, backed by 15 companies belonging to the Tata Group conglomerate, distributed approximately $110.2m to 10 political parties in the run-up to the 2024 general election.</p><p>The BJP received about $91.3m – again roughly 83 percent of the total fund – while the Congress got $9.31m, with smaller sums going to several regional parties. Tata made its contribution on <a href=\"https://www.eci.gov.in/eci-backend/public/pdf/report/November/1762861609.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">April 2, 2024</a>, while Murugappa did so on <a href=\"https://www.eci.gov.in/eci-backend/public/pdf/report/July/1753355372.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">March 26, 2024</a>.</p><p>India’s general elections began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, 2024.</p><p>The timing and scale of these donations are significant, say experts. Tata’s donations came within weeks of the government approving two semiconductor projects worth more than $15.2bn announced by the Tata Group in Gujarat and Assam – both BJP-ruled states.</p><p>The Modi government also provided additional support of about $5.3bn under India’s plans to promote semiconductor development.</p><p>Meanwhile, in February 2024, the Indian government approved a semiconductor assembly and testing facility proposed by CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, a Murugappa Group company. The project, to be set up in Sanand, Gujarat, with an investment of approximately <a href=\"https://www.murugappa.com/media/usflpl3a/press-release-cg-semi-unveils-one-of-india-s-first-end-to-end-osat-facilities-in-sanand-gujarat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$870m</a>, also received central and state government incentives.</p><p>In the same financial year, disclosures showed that yet another trust called Triumph Electoral Trust received $15.06m from Tube Investments of India Ltd, another Murugappa Group company. The entire money went to the BJP, with no contribution by Triumph to other parties.The scale of these donations surprised observers as the Murugappa Group had been a modest political donor over the previous decade.</p><p>“Electoral trusts may be legal, but they normalise a system where money determines access, policy, and electoral success,” Parayil Sreerag, a political strategist, told Al Jazeera. Sreerag argued that such a mechanism “favours the ruling party, marginalises smaller movements, and erodes democratic competition and public trust”.</p><p>To be sure, corporate funding in India has a long history.</p><p>The Birla group of companies was a major financier of Mahatma Gandhi in the years leading up to independence in 1947. Since then, other companies and parties have continued the practice.</p><p>“Business houses have traditionally supported ruling political parties,” G Gopa Kumar, former vice chancellor of the Central University of Kerala and a political strategist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>India’s legal framework governing corporate donations to political parties has evolved alongside political shifts. The <a href=\"https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/12807/1/the_companies_act%2C_1956_no._1_of_1956_date_01.01.1956.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Companies Act, 1956</a>, first regulated such contributions, barring government companies and young firms, while mandating disclosure of donations. <a href=\"https://rsdebate.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/500270/1/PD_68_17051969_16_p3570_p3631_13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Corporate funding was later banned in 1969 under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi</a>. The ban was lifted in <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/financing-elections-india-scrutiny-corporate-donation-49750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1985</a>.</p><p>A major overhaul came in <a href=\"https://www.adrindia.org/sites/default/files/CBDT_rules_for_Electoral_Trust.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013</a> with the introduction of Electoral Trusts and the Companies Act, 2013. The new law capped corporate donations at 7.5 percent of average net profits, required board approval, and mandated disclosure, marking a significant attempt at regulation and transparency.</p><p>But while the Modi-era electoral bonds between 2018 and 2024 drew the bulk of the criticism over electoral finance from transparency activists, the return to electoral trusts has coincided with what is, in effect, an increase in corporate funding for parties. Between 2018 and 2024, the electoral bonds led to an average of under $350m in total donations per year.</p><p>Trusts – to which corporates turned after the bonds were scrapped – donated more than $450m by contrast, in 2024-25.</p><p>“Left unchecked, it [soaring corporate funding] risks creating a duopoly between political power and corporate capital,” Sreerag said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Tata Group, the Murugappa Group and the Election Commission of India for their responses to concerns over links between donations and influence, but it has not yet received any response.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321676\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321676\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24071317812573-1771399004.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Activists of Communist Party of India (Marxist) protest in Hyderabad, India, against the State Bank of India seeking more time to disclose details of “electoral bonds” to the Election Commission of India, Monday, March 11, 2024.

In several cases, firms accused of tax evasion or other financial crimes donated after raids by India’s enforcement and investigating agencies, raising concerns of coercive political pressure: 26 entities under investigation bought bonds worth $624.7m, including $223.3m after raids by investigating agencies.</p><p>Bond purchases peaked around election cycles. That timing – around elections and after raids – was “significant”, Poola told Al Jazeera. “That sequencing is analytically difficult to dismiss as coincidence.” While the data cannot establish legal intent, Poola stressed that the pattern points to an “institutionalised quid pro quo ecosystem enabled by opacity”.</p><p>Yet critics say transparency alone does not resolve the link between public policy and political funding – as the data since the ban on electoral bonds shows.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321688\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321688\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-09-at-11.36.12-PM-1-1771399178.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C439&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"S Mini during her campaign in 2024 April\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321688\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">S Mini, a candidate from the SUCI party, during her campaign for India’s national elections in April 2024.

But that is not happening. Abhilash MR, a Supreme Court lawyer, said large corporate donations raise serious concerns, particularly under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees political equality and administrative fairness.</p><p>He said there is mounting evidence of generous government incentives followed by large corporate donations.“When policy decisions appear calibrated to facilitate corporate funding, the very idea of a welfare state is undermined,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that proving corruption in courts remains extremely difficult.</p><p>“Temporal proximity between policy benefits and donations rarely meets the evidentiary threshold needed to trigger an independent judicial inquiry,” he said. “In such situations, accountability shifts from courtrooms to the public domain.”</p><p>Mini S, a politician from the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) party, had hoped for that shift among voters when she contested the 2024 national elections from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the southern Kerala state.</p><p>She couldn’t fund air-conditioned vehicles, so her campaign during India’s notorious summer moved through neighbourhoods on hired motorbikes and autorickshaws. She hoped to unseat Shashi Tharoor, a former UN diplomat and politician from the opposition Congress party, who had been representing Thiruvananthapuram in parliament since 2009. When the votes were counted, Mini secured just 1,109 votes, while Tharoor won by a landslide. She also forfeited her $275 security deposit.</p><p>But for Mini, the outcome was less a personal defeat than an indictment of how Indian elections are fought. Her entire campaign ran on $5,500, she said, an amount much lower than the $105,000 limit set by the Election Commission of India on expenditure by a parliamentary candidate.</p><p>“India likes to call itself the world’s largest democracy, but it’s not,” Mini told Al Jazeera. “When corporate money openly funds mainstream parties – through electoral bonds and trusts, often in clear quid pro quo arrangements – and the Election Commission stays silent, what kind of democracy is this?”</p><p>In such a scenario, Mini said, government policies “serve corporate interests, not the constitution”.</p><p>“Ordinary people are sidelined, and the marginalised are pushed further into the margins. With money of this scale in elections, anyone without corporate backing, like us, is effectively locked out of politics,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’ll fight at 145lb (66kg) for five five-minute rounds.</p><p>Despite their lengthy absences, Rousey and Carano remain two of the most iconic fighters in MMA history for their trailblazing careers. Carano led their once-outlawed sport into the mainstream of broadcast television, while Rousey secured the enthusiastic acceptance of women’s MMA by Dana White and the UFC.</p><p>Rousey (12-2) rose to become arguably the biggest athlete in all of MMA after winning an Olympic medal in judo in 2008. Her armbar finishes and cage charisma single-handedly prompted White to begin the promotion of women’s MMA, with Rousey at the centre of his plans.</p><p>Rousey won the UFC’s first-ever women’s bout in 2013 to claim the bantamweight title belt, and she still holds the promotion’s record with six title defences.</p><p>After ending 11 of her first 12 fights in the first round, her career abruptly stalled when she lost back-to-back bouts to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes, prompting her to move on to acting, professional wrestling and motherhood.</p><p>“Been waiting so long to announce this: Me and Gina Carano are gonna throw down in the biggest super fight in women’s combat sport history!” Rousey said. “This is for all MMA fans past, present and future.”</p><p></p><p>Carano (7-1) fought in the first Nevada-sanctioned MMA bout between women in 2006, and she won a series of fights that made her a network television draw in the sport’s early days. She was stopped by Cris “Cyborg” Justino in her most recent fight in August 2009, and she moved on to an acting career despite repeated rumours of a return to the cage.</p><p>“Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for, and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,” Carano said.</p><p>“She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen. This is an honour. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win, and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome. This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community.”</p><p>Carano, who turns 44 in April, landed several prominent film roles and became a cast member of Disney’s “The Mandalorian” before her contract failed to be renewed in 2021, after she expressed controversial right-wing views in a series of social media posts.</p><p>Carano settled a lawsuit last year against Lucasfilm and The Walt Disney Company over her claim that she was fired for the posts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321643\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321643\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321643\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26048615229932-1771397945.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE - Gina Carano attends the Disney Plus launch event promoting, \"The Mandalorian,\" on Oct. 19, 2019, at the London West Hollywood hotel in West Hollywood, Calif.

Over the two years of its genocide in Gaza, Israel has set itself on course to become, in the words of some of its own lawmakers, a “pariah state”. Its prime minister and former defence minister are wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court, while global revulsion over its actions in Gaza has pushed the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/campaign-to-boycott-israel-looks-to-future-after-gaza-ceasefire\">boycott</a> of Israeli goods to the forefront of consumers’ minds.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Four countries – Spain, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Ireland – are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/spain-ireland-boycott-eurovision-song-contest-over-israels-inclusion\">refusing</a> to take part in the popular song competition Eurovision in protest at Israel’s presence. A global campaign is also under way to suspend Israel from both European UEFA and international FIFA football competitions, while South Africa’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/14/south-africa-says-icj-genocide-case-will-continue-despite-gaza-ceasefire\">case</a> accusing Israel of genocide in the International Court of Justice is ongoing.</p><p>But in Israel, this international isolation – and the killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians – is not significantly changing opinions on how the country should behave. In fact, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still has a strong chance of winning elections set to be held this year, and much of the opposition towards him comes from his domestic policies, rather than disagreement over how he has treated Palestinians, which many remain indifferent to.</p><p>“Most people don’t even know we’ve largely annexed the West Bank,” said Orly Noy, the editor of the Hebrew-language news site Local Call. “It just isn’t reported that way.”</p><p>“They may be aware that some of the rules of governance have changed, but they probably won’t know that it’s been de facto annexed until there’s an international response that affects them, such as Eurovision,” she said, noting that the withdrawal of the four nations in objection to Israel’s genocide has been framed in Israel as being motivated primarily by anti-Semitism.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"disinterest\">Disinterest</h2><p>For many Israelis, Palestinians barely exist, observers <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/dehumanisation-how-israel-is-able-to-commit-its-genocide-in-gaza\">have said</a>, with the extreme settler violence perpetrated upon them going largely <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/mapping-forced-displacements-and-settler-attacks-by-israel-in-the-west-bank\">unreported</a> or cast as somehow deserved.</p><p>“The media never really reports opposition to anything Israel does,” Noy continued. “It simply dismisses it as anti-Semitic, and presents the world as being made up of those that are either for us, or against us.”</p><p>“Why would they [Israelis] ever reflect on any of their government’s actions?” she asked rhetorically. “They have the answers already: anti-Semitism, victimhood and defiance.”</p><p>Little of the carnage that Israel has inflicted on Gaza has made its way to Israeli television – overwhelmingly the most popular way of receiving news – over the course of the war. On the contrary, Israeli news channels covering the conflict have focused on the number of “terrorists” killed, or framed concern over the nature of the war entirely through the prism of the 250 or so captives taken by Hamas and other groups in 2023.</p><p>In print, criticism of the government or its war has largely been left to smaller outlets on the left.</p><p>In such a landscape, where Israel’s actions go largely unreported, criticism of its government’s conduct is easily cast by lawmakers as anti-Semitic in origin, with just the accusation serving as a second “Iron Dome” – a reference to Israel’s anti-missile defence system – in deflecting criticism of the state, said Neve Gordon, an Israeli professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London.</p><p>“Israel always has to be the victim, and that victimhood justifies any level of violence in its defence,” Gordon said.</p><p>“I visited Israel around 10 times during the first year and a half of the war,”  he said, describing the period of war when Israel had killed tens of thousands of men, women and children in Gaza and starved thousands more.</p><p>“All you heard about was the hostages. You never heard about what was happening in Gaza,” he said, “It’s a repetition of trauma that erases everything else, including compassion.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"siege-mentality\">Siege mentality</h2><p>According to Netanyahu – speaking at a conference in January – the anti-Semitism that Israel faces runs deeper than mere racism.</p><p>Rather, the battle against anti-Semitism is the battle over the future of civilization, Netanyahu said.</p><p>“Racism has existed throughout history. That’s not what anti-Semitism is,” he told attendees. “Anti-Semitism began as a creed 2,500 years ago, 500 years before the birth of Christianity, with an ideological attack against the Jews that kept on metamorphosing over centuries.”</p><p>Decades of similar statements from a variety of politicians have left their mark, said Daniel Bar-Tal, professor of social-political psychology at Tel Aviv University, noting that an entire nation is now “indoctrinated” into a world view that positions its own history as the overwhelming counterweight to whatever actions it chooses to undertake or criticism of it.</p><p>“Many Israeli Jews have a kind of siege mentality,” Bar-Tal said, describing how criticism of Israel was met by a form of “moral silencing” weaponised and propagated by the government. “They imagine that the rest of the world just wants Israel to disappear.”</p><p>“They think, you Europeans didn’t say anything about us during World War II,” he added. “You did nothing to stop the Holocaust, and now you want to attack the one place where Jews feel safe?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are the most precious things I have.”</p><p>“Every day they are safe is a day worth gratitude and joy,” she says with pride mixed with fear, referring to the terror that has accompanied her throughout the war at the thought of losing them.</p><p>Like other Palestinians in Gaza, what distinguishes this Ramadan is the relative calm that has come with the current ceasefire, compared with the previous two years, when Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, was at its peak.</p><p>“The situation is not completely calm,” Maisoon explains. Everyone knows the war hasn’t truly stopped; shelling still happens from time to time. But compared to the height of the war, things are less intense.”</p><p>Maisoon participates in camp administration activities, helping prepare bread and arrange dates and water for distribution, minutes before the call to prayer on the first day of Ramadan.</p><p>“This is the third Ramadan we’ve spent in displacement. We lost our homes, our families, and many loved ones.”</p><p>“But here in the camp, we have neighbours and friends who share the same pain and suffering, and we all want to support one another socially.”</p><p>Maisoon lost her home in southeastern Gaza at the beginning of the war and was forced to flee with her husband, Hassouna, and their children, moving between camps before eventually settling in Bureij under what she describes as “very bad conditions”.</p><p>“We are trying to create life and joy out of nothing. Ramadan and Eid come and go, but our situation remains the same,” she says after a brief pause.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321297\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321297\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A3278-copy-1771385940.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A husband and wife with their son in a decorated tent\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maisoon al-Barbarawi, her husband Hassouna, and their son, Hasan, as they prepare for Ramadan in Gaza [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"wounded-from-within\">‘Wounded from within’</h2><p>Maisoon’s words fluctuate between optimism and fear, but she insists that Ramadan is “a blessing”, despite everything around her.</p><p>On the first day of Ramadan, she had not yet decided what she would cook for her family, as her limited means would only allow for a modest meal.</p><p>But she had already prepared her prayers and wishes before breaking her fast.</p><p>“I will pray that the war never returns. That is my daily prayer: that things calm down completely and that the army withdraw from our land,” she says, pointing to bullet holes in her tent caused by gunfire from an Israeli quadcopter drone days earlier.</p><p>Fear of the war’s return during Ramadan is not unique to Maisoon, but is shared by many across the Gaza Strip, who worry about a renewed escalation, similar to last year when fighting resumed on March 19, 2025, coinciding with the second week of Ramadan.</p><p>That renewed war was accompanied by the closure of crossings and a ban on food aid entering the enclave, triggering a severe food crisis and humanitarian famine that lasted until last September.</p><p>“People these days keep talking about stocking up. They tell us: store flour, store food… the war is coming back,” Maisoun says anxiously.</p><p>“Last Ramadan was famine and war at the same time. I spent all my money during the previous famine.”</p><p>“My little son used to pray for death because he craved food.

She received a food parcel from a relief organisation on the first day of Ramadan.</p><p>Opening the package with a broad smile, she celebrates its contents while her grandchildren gather around her.</p><p>“This is fava beans, halva, dates, tahini, oil, lentils, beans, spreadable cheese, mortadella, mashallah, an excellent parcel,” Hanan tells her daughter standing nearby.</p><p>“This will be perfect for tomorrow’s suhoor,” she says, referring to the predawn meal before Muslims begin fasting for the day.</p><p>Hanan, 55, is a mother of eight who fled to Deir el-Balah a year ago from Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, one of the hardest-hit places by Israel during the war.</p><p>She tells Al Jazeera that she will have to depend on whatever aid arrives to sustain her during Ramadan, due to her difficult economic situation.</p><p>“Today, thank God, we received assistance. This will ease my worry about what we will break our fast with,” says Hanan, who shares a tent with 15 family members, including children and grandchildren.</p><p>Smiling, she admits she secretly set aside a small amount of money to prepare a tray of potatoes with minced meat and rice for the first iftar.</p><p>“I saved a small amount to buy a kilo of meat tomorrow. Fasting requires protein,” she says in a low voice, noting that preparing a meal now depends entirely on what is available that same day, as storage conditions are nearly nonexistent.</p><p>“As you can see, there is no electricity, no infrastructure, no refrigerators to store vegetables or meat if we buy them.”</p><p>“We purchase what we need day by day so the food does not spoil.”</p><p>Yet the other side of Ramadan for Hanan is measured not by preparation but by those absent from the table.</p><p>Tears fill her eyes as she mentions her two sons in their late twenties who were killed in a strike last year, one leaving behind a daughter not yet two years old.</p><p>“This is the first Ramadan after the martyrdom of my sons Abdullah and Mohammed,” she says through tears.</p><p>“You feel the emptiness.

We’ve been cooking over open fire for two years. The wind blows out the flame, and my son tries to shield it with plastic.”</p><p>She relies on firewood due to prolonged shortages of cooking gas.</p><p>“I managed to fill an eight-kilo gas cylinder two months ago and refused to use it until Ramadan,” she says, pulling out the hidden cylinder.</p><p>“Gas is like treasure for us. I planned to save it for suhoor or something quick. It would be difficult to light a fire at dawn.”</p><p>“In the end, everything passes. What matters is that we remain together in health and safety, and that we do not live through famine or war again,” she adds, her voice shifting to prayers for peace.</p><p>The memory of famine further deepens her anxiety.</p><p>She repeats the word “difficult” as she recalls the months when prices soared and food disappeared after last Ramadan.</p><p>She describes grinding lentils to replace flour and mixing them with pasta or rice to feed as many family members as possible.</p><p>To make the bread stretch, she cut it into smaller portions.</p><p>“I make it smaller, so it’s enough for everyone.”</p><p>And yet, her final wish, repeated like a prayer, echoes what many in Gaza seek this Ramadan: nothing more than “goodness and peace”, and a return home from displacement.</p><p>“May this Ramadan be one of goodness and peace for everyone… and may we return to our homes and our land.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But of course, the president reserves the ability to say when he thinks that diplomacy has reached its natural end,” Vance said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"stumbling-blocks\">Stumbling blocks</h2><p>Iran has for years sought relief from sweeping sanctions imposed by the US, including a Washington-imposed ban on other countries buying its oil.</p><p>Tehran has said it wants the ongoing talks to focus on its uranium enrichment programme, insisting that any deal must deliver tangible economic benefit to Iran while maintaining its sovereignty and national security.</p><p>Washington has demanded that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, and has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues, such as Tehran’s missile stockpile.</p><p>Iran has said it will not accept zero uranium ‌enrichment and that its missile capabilities are off the table.</p><p>The talks come amid high tensions in the Gulf, with the US deploying two aircraft carriers to the region. The first – the USS Abraham Lincoln, with nearly 80 aircraft – was positioned about 700km (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.</p><p>Its location puts at least a dozen US F‑35s and F‑18 fighter jets within striking distance.

The move would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.</p><p>Tehran has also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">threatened to strike</a> US military bases in the region in the event of an attack.</p><p>A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed last year when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb three nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"degraded\">‘Degraded’</h2><p>Ali Vaez, the Crisis Group’s Iran project director, told Al Jazeera he believed there is a lot of space for agreement on the nuclear front, “simply because Iran’s nuclear programme has been degraded on the ground, and so, some of the cost of the compromise has already sunk in”.</p><p>“It should be easier for the Iranians to accept zero enrichment for a period of time, because they have not spun a single centrifuge since the 12-day war back in June,” he said.</p><p>“But when it gets to non-nuclear questions, like regional activities or their missile programme, I think, at best, the Iranians will be willing to do superficial concessions, not the kind of grand bargain capitulation that the US expect,” he said.</p><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, meanwhile, reiterated in an interview published on Tuesday that Tehran was “absolutely not seeking nuclear weapons”.</p><p>“If anyone wants to verify this, we are open to such verification to take place,” he said.</p><p>“However, we do not accept that we should be prevented from using nuclear science and knowledge to address our illnesses and to advance our industry and agriculture,” he added.</p><p>Iran has joined the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which guarantees countries the right to pursue civilian nuclear power in return for requiring them to forgo atomic ‌weapons ‌and cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p>Israel, which has not signed the treaty, neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons, under a decades-old ambiguity policy designed to deter surrounding enemies. Scholars believe it does.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has to be there year after year, until this project is done.”</p><p>At stake is the fate of the Northeast Corridor project, a central part of the Gateway Program, an interstate initiative to expand and renovate the aging tunnels that the link metropolitan hubs between New York and New Jersey.</p><p>The federal government had pledged billions in support for the project, considered to be vital for transportation and safety reasons.</p><p>But on October 1, one day into a historically long government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would suspend $18bn in funding for the project that had already been granted.</p><p>The move was designed to pressure Democrats — and Democrat-aligned jurisdictions — to comply with Republican demands to end the shutdown.</p><p>But Trump hinted at the time that some of the programming cuts could be permanent. The shutdown ended after 43 days in November, and still, the funding for the New York City tunnel project remained frozen.</p><p>Democrats decried the freeze an act of political revenge. “It should concern every American that the Trump Administration is willing to harm working families and our nation’s economy to punish Democrats,” Representative Jerry Nadler of New York <a href=\"https://nadler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397413\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in response to the funding suspension.</p><p>But Trump has continued to withhold the funds. On February 3, the states of New York and New Jersey announced they were suing the Trump administration to release the funds.</p><p>“After four months of covering costs with limited operating funds, the states warn that construction will be forced to completely shut down as soon as February 6 unless federal funding resumes,” attorneys general Letitia James of New York and Jennifer Davenport of New Jersey said in a <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-trump-administration-freezing-gateway-programs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> at the time.</p><p>Three days later, as the states hit that February 6 deadline, a US district judge ordered the funds to be released, citing the potential for irreparable harm to the project.</p><p>The ruling required more than $200m in reimbursement funds to be paid out to the states.</p><p>Over the last week, the federal government responded by releasing $30m, in addition to the $77m announced on Tuesday. But officials said it was still not enough.</p><p>At Tuesday’s news conference, union leader Gary LaBarbera emphasised that new construction was a necessity.</p><p>“Let me tell you: The existing tunnels, the trans-Hudson tunnels, are over a hundred years old. Their structural integrity has failed,” he said.</p><p>He added that the issue of maintaining safe transportation should be nonpartisan</p><p>“This isn’t a Republican tunnel or a Democratic tunnel, right? This should not be a political tug of war,” he said.</p><p>Governor Hochul, meanwhile, used part of her speech to address the president. “ Let’s stop the chaos. Let’s stop the insanity. Let them work, Mr President,” she said, in a gesture to the workers around her.</p><p>But this week, on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump doubled down on his opposition to the project.</p><p>“I am opposed to the future boondoggle known as ‘Gateway,’ in New York/New Jersey, because it will cost many BILLIONS OF DOLLARS more than projected or anticipated,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086782319939311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“It is a disaster! Gateway will likewise be financially catastrophic for the region, unless hard work and proper planning is done, NOW, to avoid insurmountable future cost overruns.”</p><p>He also denounced reports that he would un-freeze the funding in exchange for renaming New York’s Penn Station after him, as well as Washington’s Dulles airport.</p><p>“IT IS JUST MORE FAKE NEWS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116081535267965046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, adding that such a proposal was “brought up by certain politicians and construction union heads”, not him.</p><p>Still, his White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to confirm the reports last week during a news briefing.</p><p>“Why not?” she told a reporter. “It was something the president floated in his conversation with [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer.”</p><p>On Tuesday, reports emerged that the Trump Organization had filed trademark claims for any airports bearing the president’s name.</p><p>Republicans in Florida’s legislature have already sought to rename the international airport in Palm Beach for Trump, citing his nearby golf courses and residence at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Even the January 30 publication has been criticised as incomplete, with reports indicating that there could be more than 6 million files in the government’s possession.</p><p>The newly released documents have revealed new details about Epstein’s relationships with influential figures, but few have faced accountability.</p><p>Critics have argued that Epstein himself faced scant legal consequences for the sex crimes he perpetuated. He reached a plea deal in Florida in 2008, wherein he pleaded guilty to soliciting a child for prostitution and sex trafficking, but he only served 13 months in custody.</p><p>He was in jail in 2019, facing federal charges, when he died by suicide in his cell.</p><p>Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been sentenced to more than 20 years for her role in the sex trafficking scheme.</p><p>In Tuesday’s statement, the experts on the UN panel slammed the heavy redactions in the Epstein files that appear to shield the identities of powerful figures.</p><p>“The reluctance to fully disclose information or broaden investigations, has left many survivors feeling retraumatized and subjected to what they describe as ‘institutional gaslighting’,” the UN experts said.</p><p>Their criticism echoes similar accusations in the US. Lawmakers there have argued that the administration of President Donald Trump, a former friend of Epstein, has defied the November law by redacting documents beyond the guidelines set out by Congress.</p><p>The experts also noted that there appeared to be “botched redactions that exposed sensitive victim information”. They added that more must be done to ensure justice for the survivors.</p><p>“Any suggestion that it is time to move on from the ‘Epstein files’ is unacceptable.

It added that the show “decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options”.</p><p>Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn’t want you to see”.</p><p>“I think Donald Trump is worried we’re about to flip Texas,” Talarico told Colbert during their interview. “This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”</p><p>Crockett, meanwhile, suggested that Colbert could have avoided an issue with the FCC by having her on the show, as he has in the past. Both she and Talarico have also appeared on The View.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Paramount Skydance, Carr or the White House.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"another-troubling-example\">‘Another troubling example’</h2><p>Until January, talk shows were deemed to have qualified for the equal opportunities exemption as genuine news interviews, ever since the FCC Media Bureau granted an exemption to the interview portion of Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show in 2006.</p><p>Networks have relied on the ruling as a precedent for recent interviews with political candidates.</p><p>FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, criticised CBS’s decision not to air the interview, calling it censorship.</p><p>She said the FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes, and that CBS has free speech rights to air the interview.</p><p>“This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech,” Gomez said. “It is no secret that Paramount, CBS’s parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.”</p><p>Paramount Skydance is <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/17/warner-bros-rejects-latest-paramount-bid-but-open-to-best-and-final-offer\">seeking to buy</a> Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the White House last year, CBS has been accused of seeking to appease the president by <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointing Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no television experience, to lead the storied broadcast network, as well as naming a former Trump appointee to oversee and address allegations of bias.</p><p>It also settled a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with his rival in the 2024 presidential race, Kamala Harris, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to benefit the Democratic Party before the election.</p><p>The FCC’s Carr, meanwhile, has faced bipartisan criticism after he pressured broadcasters to take ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air in September, warning they could face fines or loss of licences.</p><p>Two major broadcasters said they would pull Kimmel off the air, and Disney briefly suspended Kimmel before restoring the show.</p><p>In December, Democratic US Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin told Carr, “You used your position within the federal government to take Jimmy Kimmel off the air in a clear attempt to chill free speech.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
