But once in office, he fell out with Pakistan’s powerful military and was toppled in 2022 through a vote in parliament. His arrest in May 2023 on several charges spurred widespread protests against the military, leading to a <a href=\"/news/2024/12/26/pakistan-military-court-sentences-60-more-civilians-over-pro-khan-protests\">crackdown</a> on the party.</p><p>In a message attributed to Khan on his party’s X account on Monday, he urged supporters to “come out and hold peaceful protests until a true democracy is restored in the country”.</p><p>Khan’s party posted a video on its X account on Tuesday, showing a former PTI candidate, Rehana Dar, being carried into a police van by personnel with riot gear.</p><p>“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said.</p><p></p><p>Social media videos also showed at least two other people being detained in Lahore.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The PTI’s Multan chapter alleged that its Lahore rally was “attacked by police”, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Tuesday.</p><p>“Rallies are being held today on the orders of the PTI founder,” PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan said in a statement, adding they would continue until Khan’s release.</p><p>The rallies were held despite the government’s order barring “illegal” gatherings and large assemblies, Pakistan’s Geo TV reported.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: A convoy of hundreds of vehicles from Peshawar has set off towards Swabi.</em></p><p>In a statement on Monday, police said security was beefed up in major cities nationwide.</p><p>At a news conference on Monday, Khan’s party was accused of always creating “chaos” by Uzma Bukhari, a spokesperson of the provincial government.</p><p>“No political party can be barred from politics in Pakistan, but a terrorist organisation disguised as a political party is not allowed to disrupt Pakistan’s peace,” Bukhari said.</p><p>PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said the party has pledged to demonstrate peacefully and was not seeking confrontation, Geo TV reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khan says the charges against him – ranging from terrorism to disclosure of official secrets – are politically motivated. He was convicted in January in a <a href=\"/news/2025/1/17/pakistans-ex-pm-imran-khan-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case\">corruption case</a>, while being acquitted of other charges or receiving suspended sentences.</p><p>Before the protest call, hundreds of Khan’s party members, including several parliamentarians, were convicted late last month on charges related to the 2023 protests against his arrest.</p><p>Khan’s party emerged as the single biggest in the 2024 election, and it says rigging robbed it of more seats.

In a Monday social media post, however, he said he “will be <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/trump-says-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil\">substantially raising</a> the Tariff paid by India to the USA” because of India’s imports of Russian crude.</p><p>In late July, the EU also slapped sanctions on Nayara, one of India’s two big private oil refiners, which is Russian-majority owned. The bloc also banned the import of refined oil made from Russian crude, again hurting Indian refiners.</p><p>Until Monday night, India’s response had been muted. That has now changed. Two hours after Trump’s latest announcement, New Delhi issued a statement accusing the US and EU of double standards and of, in fact, quietly encouraging India to buy Russian crude earlier.</p><p>As India’s relations with the West – otherwise warm and growing until recently – now fray over its purchase of Russian energy, how true are New Delhi’s claims that the West is as guilty of enabling the Kremlin’s war machine as those it blames?</p><h2 id=\"what-did-india-say-on-monday\">What did India say on Monday?</h2><p>After hesitating for days to publicly take on Washington and Brussels directly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government issued a terse statement on August 4, calling the targeting of India “unjustified and unreasonable”.</p><p>“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, in words that suggest New Delhi is in no mood to back down.</p><p>But Jaiswal also directly pushed back against suggestions from the US and EU that India – in buying large volumes of Russian crude – had acted in a way that broke with the West’s own behaviour.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” Jaiswal said, referring to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>“The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets’ stability,” he added.</p><p>He said India’s decision to import Russian oil was “meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer”.</p><p>“However, it is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” he added.</p><p>The EU, he said, had traded more with Russia in goods in 2024 than India had. “European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5 million tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.21 million tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, “continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry, fertilisers as well as chemicals,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>India’s response is not surprising, said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has been involved with multiple Indian trade negotiations.</p><p>“The aggressiveness that the Trump administration has shown – there had to be some reaction from India,” he told Al Jazeera. “For a sovereign country to hear this kind of a threat from another country is unacceptable.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873391\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-Russias-biggest-trade-partners-August-5-2025-1754385613.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who are Russia’s biggest trade partners - August 5, 2025-1754385613\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-are-the-us-eu-sanctions-and-tariffs-against-india\">How significant are the US, EU sanctions and tariffs against India?</h2><p>India’s pushback reflects just how much is at stake for its economy.</p><p>The US is India’s largest export destination: Americans bought $87bn worth of Indian goods in 2024. By contrast, India imported $41bn worth of US goods last year, leading to a large $46bn trade deficit for the US.</p><p>Trump’s earlier threat of 25 percent tariffs on Indian goods was already threatening to dramatically disrupt that trade. His announcement of even higher tariffs could bleed India’s export revenue further.</p><p>Brussels’ decision to bar the import of refined petroleum sourced from Russian crude could also batter the profits of Indian refineries. According to market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global, Indian exports of petroleum products to Europe have jumped from $5.9bn in 2019 to $20.5bn, largely because of India’s ability to buy subsidised Russian oil, refine it, and then sell it to the West.</p><p>But stopping the purchase of Russian oil would come with its costs: After the US and Europe imposed tough sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, Russia offered discounted crude to India. The EU also introduced price caps on Russian oil shipped by European tankers. As a result, India saved billions of dollars, with Russia becoming its biggest source of imported crude.</p><p>For India, say experts, it isn’t just the economic calculations that make the recent threats and sanctions problematic. The West is “just changing goalposts”, Anil Trigunayat, a retired Indian diplomat, told Al Jazeera. “So, India is just showing them the mirror with facts and figures now.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873394\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-buys-Russian-crude-oil-August-5-2025-1754385618.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who buys Russian crude oil - August 5, 2025-1754385618\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"did-the-us-and-eu-encourage-india-to-buy-russian-oil-until-now\">Did the US and EU encourage India to buy Russian oil until now?</h2><p>Trump, in his latest post targeting India, claimed that “they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.”</p><p>India is arguing that the same accusations levelled against it hold true against the US and EU – and that they actually acquiesced to New Delhi buying Russian oil when the West no longer wanted to.</p><p>“They (India) bought Russian oil because we wanted someone to buy Russian oil at a price cap – that was not a violation or anything, that was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity, we did not want the price of oil to go up,” Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India under former President Joe Biden, said at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations in May 2024. “They fulfilled that.”</p><p></p><p>The logic was simple: If no one had bought Russian oil, that would have shrunk the total available oil supply with the same global demand, driving up costs. As Garcetti pointed out, Indian purchases of Russian crude helped avoid that – while allowing the West to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>Until July, the EU, too, had not imposed any restrictions on the import of petroleum products sourced from Russian crude.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873389\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-EU-imports-of-Russian-LNG-are-on-the-rise-August-5-2025-1754385608.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-EU imports of Russian LNG are on the rise - August 5, 2025-1754385608\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"is-the-west-trading-more-with-russia-than-india-is\">Is the West trading more with Russia than India is?</h2><p>That’s the other major claim from India.</p><p>And the facts suggest that New Delhi is right. According to the EU, its total trade with Russia was worth 67.5 billion euros ($77.9 bn) in 2024. India’s total trade with Russia in 2024-25 was <a href=\"https://indianembassy-moscow.gov.in/overview.php#:~:text=Bilateral%20trade%20between%20India%20and,amounting%20to%20USD%2063.84%20billion.\">worth $68.7bn</a>.</p><p>To be sure, Europe’s trade with Russia has fallen sharply, from 257.5 billion euros in 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, while India’s trade with Russia has surged from about $10bn before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>But data shows that the bloc continues to buy Russian gas. Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the grouping has paid Moscow $105.6bn for gas imports – an amount equivalent to 75 percent of Russia’s 2024 military budget – according to the Finnish think-tank, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which has been tracking Russian energy trade through the war.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/presentation-russian-lng-exports-to-the-eu-implications-for-the-us-lng-market/\">EU imports of Russian LNG</a> rose 9 percent compared with the year before.</p><p>Mineral fuels make up almost two-thirds of EU imports from Russia, followed by food, raw materials, machinery and transport equipment, according to the bloc.</p><p>And the US does indeed still import a range of chemicals from Russia, as Jaiswal claimed. Total Russia-US trade in 2024 stood at <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/russia-and-eurasia/russia\">$5.2bn</a>, according to the US Trade Representative’s office – though the numbers are down significantly from 2021, when their trade in goods stood at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html#2023\">$36bn</a>.</p><p>Given this backdrop, the Indian foreign ministry was “absolutely right to call out the US and EU”, Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera. “They are still importing from Russia. They’re allowed to do it, we are not. That’s ridiculous.”</p><h2 id=\"is-this-all-a-trade-negotiating-tactic\">Is this all a trade negotiating tactic?</h2><p>Some Indian experts believe that the threats and tariffs from Trump are bargaining measures aimed at securing a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/who-has-a-deal-who-doesnt-the-state-of-play-on-eve-of-trumps-tariffs\">trade deal with India</a> that is favourable to the US.</p><p>The two countries have been locked in negotiations over a trade agreement to minimise Trump’s tariffs but have yet to agree on a pact, even though India has cut tariffs on several US imports.</p><p>A key sticking point is agriculture, where India has long imposed high tariffs to protect its farm sector, which represents about half of the country’s population.</p><p>“The way the Trump administration has been demanding that India open its market to US agri-business – that’s a no-go for India,” Dhar said. “Our small farmers will face a serious adverse situation; so it’s economically and politically completely unacceptable to India.”</p><p>Ghosh echoed those sentiments.</p><p>“There’s no question of giving in on agriculture,” she said. “In India, you cannot give in and allow US heavily subsidised multinational conglomerates to invade our markets, when a majority of our population still depends on agriculture for a livelihood.”</p><p>But in recent weeks, Trump has also tried to ramp up pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine, and choking Moscow’s oil exports would make it harder for Russian President Vladimir Putin to sustain his economy.</p><p>On Monday, Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-ukraine-war-through-oil\">Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller accused India of “financing this (Russia’s) war</a>“.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Medvedev, who serves as deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Trump wrote on his Truth Social network on August 1.</p><p>“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump wrote, without specifying the regions or the submarines’ class.</p><p>Medvedev, who, despite his title, has no power to order nuclear strikes, retorted with a gloating remark.</p><p>“If some words of Russia’s former president cause such a nervous response from the oh-so-scary US president, it means that Russia is right about everything and will keep going its own way,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram.</p><p>“Let [Trump] remember his favourite movies about the Walking Dead [zombie apocalypse series] and about how dangerous can be the ‘dead hand’ that doesn’t exist naturally,” Medvedev wrote.</p><p>The online feud began in mid-July, when Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin, Medvedev’s boss and mentor for three decades, 50 days to make a peace deal with Ukraine.</p><p>Medvedev called the ultimatum “theatrical” and said that “Russia didn’t care”.</p><h2 id=\"uclear-weapons-are-not-moscow-s-monopoly\">‘Nuclear weapons are not Moscow’s monopoly’</h2><p>According to a former Russian diplomat, while Trump’s warnings send a signal to the Kremlin, the “noise” around the submarines has no military significance.</p><p>“What matters far more is that Trump’s words served as a reminder – nuclear weapons are not Moscow’s monopoly,” Boris Bondarev, who focused on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, told Al Jazeera.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Medvedev’s comments reflect Putin’s views – and Trump’s response could return both down to the earth of realpolitik, he added.</p><p>“Had such an approach been part of a general strategy to make Putin’s view on the world and his own place in it more adequate, it would have been the beginning of a real end of the war” in Ukraine, said Bondarev, who quit his foreign ministry job to protest against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“But it seems to me that Donald just uttered [his threat] and doesn’t mean anything serious,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"a-pawn-in-the-us-china-game\">A pawn in the US-China game</h2><p>To a Ukrainian military analyst, the Trump-Medvedev feud is part of Moscow’s and Washington’s bigger political games.</p><p>“Putin uses Medvedev as a tool to express statements related to nuclear weapons, he doesn’t want to discredit his own good peacekeeper’s name,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said ironically.</p><p>In Moscow’s “media spectacle” with Washington, Medvedev plays the “bad cop”, Romanenko told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s order to reposition the subs is a step to score a diplomatic victory ahead of his summit with China’s Xi Jinping.</p><p>The summit may take place on September 3, when Beijing will lavishly celebrate the 80th anniversary of Japan’s surrender that ended World War II.</p><p>Putin has already been invited to oversee a military parade in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, but Trump is still mulling his response.</p><p>The online feud may be presented to Xi as a victory of sorts, Romanenko said – along with Moscow’s possible agreement to an air and sea ceasefire.</p><p>The agreement will be forced by the heavy damage Ukrainian drones inflicted on Russia’s military depots, transport infrastructure and oil refineries, Romanenko said.</p><h2 id=\"playing-the-fool\">‘Playing the fool’</h2><p>Trump may not realise that some Russians see Medvedev as a political

alcoholism.</p><p>He was elected Russia’s president in 2008, after Putin had completed two consecutive presidential terms and could not run for a third time.</p><p>The move and the ensuing propaganda campaign to promote Medvedev’s candidacy were nicknamed a “castling” after the chess term.</p><p>It immediately spawned political jokes that ridiculed the real power dynamic between Medvedev and Putin.</p><p>In one of them, Putin arrives at a restaurant with Medvedev and orders a steak. The waiter asks, “And what about the vegetable?” referring to the choice of a side dish. After a long look at Medvedev, Putin answers, “The vegetable will have steak, too.”</p><p>However, Medvedev cultivated a personal and political image that contrasted with Putin’s.</p><p>He started using social networks, met with the rock bands U2 and Deep Purple, and began cautious reforms that made analysts talk about a political thaw and a reset of Russia’s ties with the West.</p><p>However, Medvedev’s failed perestroika ended with giant rallies against Putin’s 2012 return to the presidency and massive vote rigging.</p><p>The resulting tightening of political screws ended with Putin’s turn to belligerent nationalism and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Five years later, another wave of popular protests throughout Russia followed the release of a documentary about Medvedev’s luxurious, Monaco-sized palatial complex.</p><p>The documentary was made by the late opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2024/2/16/hold-alexei-navalny-timeline-from-poisoning-to-prison\">Alexey Navalny</a>‘s team and got tens of millions of views on YouTube.</p><p>At the time, as Medvedev served as prime minister, his approval ratings kept waning.</p><p>In 2022, Putin unceremoniously sacked him – and gave him the Security Council job, a sinecure for demoted allies.</p><p>The fall from Putin’s grace prompted Medvedev’s transformation into an online troll who <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/russias-medvedev-issues-warning-as-moscow-says-not-bound-by-missile-treaty\">posts</a> threats to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and sabre-rattles Moscow’s nuclear might. Many posts appeared online long after midnight.</p><h2 id=\"degraded\">‘Degraded’</h2><p>There are three viewpoints on why Medvedev changed his tune to become the Kremlin’s attack dog, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University.</p><p>One is that after not being allowed to run for president for the second time in 2012, Medvedev started drinking and “degraded to the current state”, Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The second one is that by “playing fool”, he repeats what Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had done to survive under his ruthless predecessor Joseph Stalin to survive and compete for the Kremlin throne after his boss’s death, Mitrokhin said.</p><p>And the third explanation Mitrokhin agrees with is that Medvedev “as a character, has always been very vile and warlike”.</p><p>But his aggression was only limited to what Putin allowed him to do – such as nominally order Russia’s 2008 war with ex-Soviet Georgia or be in charge of supplying weaponry to pro-Moscow rebels in southeastern Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>Mitrokhin described him as “a very aggressive small man with plenty of psychological complexes – a Napoleon’s syndrome – who has a chance to reveal his ‘inner self’. And he does – with his master’s approval”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Texas Republicans, at President Donald Trump’s urging, are preparing to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/us-democrats-block-vote-on-trump-backed-texas-redistricting-map\">redraw</a> the state’s congressional map in a way that could flip up to five seats to the GOP in 2026. Trump hopes to boost Republicans’ chances of maintaining a narrow House majority amid the headwinds of the midterm election.</p><p>The manoeuvre in Texas would be legal and not unprecedented for the state, which also undertook a Republican-driven redistricting in 2003. But Democrats have called the move a partisan power grab and an affront to the traditional practice of drawing new congressional districts every 10 years, after a new Census.</p><p>But the debate over Texas’s electoral map has also prompted broader questions over the fairness of the way in which voting districts are outlined. And the one state bigger than Texas – California – has caught the attention of Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>“The gerrymander in California is outrageous,” Vance posted July 30 on X. “Of their 52 congressional districts, 9 of them are Republican. That means 17 percent of their delegation is Republican when Republicans regularly win 40 percent of the vote in that state. How can this possibly be allowed?”</p><p>So, does California have an unfair map, as Vance said?</p><p>By the numbers, California is not a dramatic outlier when it comes to the difference between its congressional and presidential vote. However, because this difference is multiplied by a large number of districts – since California is the United States’ most populous state – it produces a bounty of House seats beyond what the state’s presidential vote alone would predict.</p><p>Vance’s description of California’s map as a “gerrymander” is also doubtful – it was drawn by a bipartisan commission, not Democratic legislators. Gerrymandering is done by politicians and political parties.</p><p>Vance’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>What the numbers show</strong></h2><p>Our first step was to measure the difference between each state’s House-seat breakdown by party and its <a href=\"/news/2024/11/10/us-election-results-map-2024-how-does-it-compare-to-2020\">presidential-vote breakdown</a> by party, which is what Vance cited. (Our analysis builds off of a 2023 Sabato’s Crystal Ball story written by this author. Sabato’s Crystal Ball is a publication of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.) We removed from consideration any state with one, two or three House members in its delegation, because these small states have wide differentials that skew the comparison.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>For red states won by Trump, we took the percentage of Republican seats in the House delegation and subtracted the percentage of the vote Trump won in that state. Conversely, for <a href=\"/news/2024/11/7/us-election-results-how-did-donald-trump-break-the-blue-wall\">blue states</a> won by <a href=\"/news/2024/11/6/us-election-results-key-takeaways-as-trump-wins\">Kamala Harris</a>, we took the percentage of Democratic seats in the House delegation and subtracted the percentage of the vote Harris won in the state.</p><p>Our analysis found that California did elect more Democrats to the House than its presidential vote share would have predicted, but the state was not an outlier. With 83% of its House seats held by Democrats and 58% of its 2024 presidential votes going to Democrats, California ranked 13th nationally among 35 states that have at least four seats in their delegation.</p><p></p><p><strong>California has the nation’s 13th widest difference between House and presidential results</strong></p><p>The top 13 differentials were split roughly evenly between blue and red states.</p><p>In six states that have at least four House seats – red Iowa, Utah, Arkansas and Oklahoma, and blue Connecticut and Massachusetts – a single party controls every House seat, even though the <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/how-big-was-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory\">winning presidential candidate</a> won between 56% and 66% of the vote in those states.</p><p>Another six states had a differential equal to or wider than California’s: Red South Carolina and Tennessee, and blue Oregon, Illinois and Maryland, plus purple Wisconsin.</p><p>California does stand out by another measure, because of its size.</p><p>If you multiply the House-to-presidential differential by the number of House seats in the delegation, you get a figure for “excess House seats”, the term used in the 2023 Sabato’s Crystal Ball article – essentially, a majority party’s bonus in House seats beyond what presidential performance would predict.</p><p>Because <a href=\"/news/2024/10/12/trump-to-rally-in-solid-blue-california-in-unorthodox-campaign-move\">California</a> has a large population represented by many House districts, even its modest differential produces a lot of extra Democratic House seats – 12, to be exact. That’s the largest of any state; the closest competitors are blue Illinois and New York, and red Florida, each of which has more than four excess seats for the majority party.</p><p>Texas’s current congressional map has 3.7 excess seats for the Republicans. That would increase to an 8.7-seat GOP bonus if the GOP can flip the five seats they’re hoping for in 2026.</p><h2><strong>Is California a “gerrymander”?</strong></h2><p>Vance described California’s map as a gerrymander, but political experts doubted that this term applies. A gerrymander typically refers to a map drawn by partisan lawmakers, and California’s is drawn by a commission approved by voters specifically to remove the partisanship from congressional map drawing.</p><p>“California’s congressional map is no gerrymander,” said Nathaniel Rakich, a contributing analyst to Inside Elections, a political analytics publication. “It was drawn by an independent commission consisting of five Republicans, five Democrats, and four independents that is generally upheld as one of the fairest map-drawing entities in any state.”</p><p>Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, said commissions tend to produce a more competitive House battleground than a fully partisan system. Of the 19 House seats his outlet currently rates as toss-ups going into 2026, only two come from states where one party had a free hand to gerrymander the current district lines.</p><p>“I think it’s fair to say that commission and court-drawn maps can inject some competitiveness into the process,” Kondik said.</p><p>Because the seats were drawn by a commission, California has a lot of competitive seats. This helps California Republicans despite the state’s Democratic tilt.</p><p>According to the 2024 pre-election ratings by Sabato’s Crystal Ball, California had three Democratic-held seats in the “lean Democratic” category, and two more that were rated “likely Democratic”.</p><p>So, going into the election, five of California’s 40 Democratic-held seats are at least somewhat vulnerable to a Republican takeover. Texas Democrats aren’t so lucky, under its existing map: They are able to realistically target only one “likely Republican” seat out of 25 held by the GOP.</p><h2><strong>Sometimes, geography is the enemy of a “fair” map</strong></h2><p>Despite map makers’ efforts, it is sometimes impossible to produce a map that jibes perfectly with a state’s overall partisan balance. The cold facts of geography can prevent this.</p><p>One oft-cited example is Massachusetts, which hasn’t elected a Republican to the US House since 1994. There are few Republican hotbeds in Massachusetts, and experts say they can’t be easily connected into coherent congressional districts.</p><p>“Especially in deep-red or deep-blue states, parties tend to get a higher share of seats than they do of votes,” Rakich said. “Imagine a state where Republicans get two-thirds of the vote in every district; obviously, they would get 100 percent of their seats.”</p><p>Rakich said Democrats are geographically distributed more favourably in California. But in other states, Republicans benefit from better geographic distribution.</p><p>“I haven’t heard Vance complain about the fact that Democrats only get 25 percent of Wisconsin’s congressional seats despite regularly getting 50 percent of the vote there,” Rakich added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The river and its tributaries irrigate about 80 percent of the country’s farmland, supporting millions of livelihoods.

Earlier this year, several military-led canal projects on the Indus River were halted when farmers in the low-lying riverine areas of Sindh province protested.</p><p>To combat the degradation of the Indus River Basin, the government and the United Nations launched the “Living Indus Initiative” in 2021. One intervention focuses on restoring the delta by addressing soil salinity and protecting local agriculture and ecosystems.</p><p>The Sindh government is currently running its own mangrove restoration project, aiming to revive forests that serve as a natural barrier against saltwater intrusion. Even as mangroves are restored in some parts of the coastline, land grabbing and residential development projects drive clearing in other areas.</p><p>Neighbouring India, meanwhile, poses a looming threat to the river and its delta, after revoking a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan, which divides control over the Indus basin rivers. It has threatened never to reinstate the treaty and to build dams upstream, squeezing the flow of water to Pakistan, which has called it “an act of war”.</p><p>Alongside their homes, the communities have lost a way of life tightly bound up in the delta, said climate activist Fatima Majeed, who works with the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.</p><p>Women, in particular, who for generations have stitched nets and packed the day’s catches, struggle to find work when they migrate to cities, said Majeed, whose grandfather relocated the family from Kharo Chan to the outskirts of Karachi.</p><p>“We haven’t just lost our land; we’ve lost our culture.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Speaking at an event last month to commemorate the uprising, he said: “Safeguarding that unity should have been the new government’s first task. But they let it slip.”</p><p>The coalition of students, professionals and activists, called Students Against Discrimination, that brought down Hasina’s government, began to fragment even before Yunus took charge.</p><p>Hoping to cash in on massive anti-Awami League sentiment, the main opposition BNP has been demanding immediate elections since the uprising. But parties like the National Citizens Party, formed by student leaders of the 2024 protests, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami want deeper structural reforms before any vote is held.</p><p>To reconcile such demands, the Yunus administration formed a National Consensus Commission on February 12 this year. Its mandate is to merge multiple reform agendas outlined by expert panels into a single political blueprint. Any party or coalition that wins the next general election must formally pledge to implement this charter.</p><p>But so far, the meetings of the commission have been marked by rifts and dissent, mainly over having a bicameral parliament, adopting proportional representation in both its houses, and reforming the appointment process for key constitutional bodies by curbing the prime minister’s influence to ensure greater neutrality and non-partisanship.</p><p>“If the political forces fail to agree on reforms, instability could increase,” warned analyst Rezaul Karim Rony.</p><p>But Mubashar Hasan, adjunct fellow at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, thinks a political deadlock is “unlikely”, and that most stakeholders seem to be moving towards elections next year.</p><p>Hasan, however, remains sceptical of the reforms themselves, calling them a “cosmetic reset”.</p><p>“There’ll be some democratic progress, but not a genuine shift,” he told Al Jazeera. He pointed out that the Awami League, which once represented millions, remains banned – a fact that some analysts have pointed out could weaken the credibility of Bangladesh’s electoral democracy.<strong> </strong></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Deepti, who lost her teenage son during the protests, said political parties are scrambling for power, and not acting against the people who enabled Hasina’s brutal repression during last year’s protests.</p><p>“Most of the officials and law enforcement members involved in the violence are still at large, while political parties are more focused on grabbing power,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Sharif Osman Bin Hadi, the spokesman for Inquilab Manch (Revolution Front), a non-partisan cultural organisation inspired by the uprising, warned that elections without justice and reforms would “push the country back into the jaws of fascism”.</p><p>His group, with more than 1,000 members in 25 districts, organises poetry readings, exhibitions and street performances to commemorate the 2024 uprising and demand accountability, amid widespread concerns over deteriorating law and order across the country.</p><h2 id=\"a-city-of-demonstrations\">‘A city of demonstrations’</h2><p>While the police remain discredited and are yet to recover from the taint of complicity in perpetuating Hasina’s strong-armed governance, military soldiers are seen patrolling Bangladesh’s streets, armed with special power to arrest, detain and, in extreme cases, even fire on those breaking the law.</p><p>In a recent report, rights group Odhikar said at least 72 people were killed and 1,677 others injured in incidents of political violence between April and June this year.

Robbery nearly doubled to 318, while crimes against women and children topped 9,100. Kidnapping and robbery have also seen a spike.</p><p>“Mob justice and targeted killings have surged, many with political links,” Md Ijajul Islam, the executive director of the nonprofit Human Rights Support Society, told Al Jazeera. “Unless political parties rein in their activists, a demoralised police won’t be able to contain it.”</p><p>The demoralisation within the police stems mostly from the 2024 uprising itself, when more than 500 police stations were attacked across Bangladesh and law enforcement officials were missing from the streets for more than a week.</p><p>“The force had to restart from a morally-broken state,” Ijajul said.</p><p>Several police officers Al Jazeera spoke to at the grassroots level pointed to another problem: the collapse of what they called an informal political order in rural areas.</p><p>“During the Awami League era, police often worked in tandem with the ruling party leaders, who mediated local disputes,” said a senior police officer at the Roumari police station in the Kurigram district near the border with India.</p><p>“That structure is gone.

In a televised interview on July 15, Yunus’s spokesperson, Shafiqul Alam, also claimed that “if you consider overall statistics, things are stabilising”, he told Somoy Television network, referring to law and order in Dhaka.</p><p>Alam said that many people who were denied justice for years, including during the uprising, are now coming forward to register cases.</p><p>Some agree.</p><p>“Things are slowly improving,” said 38-year-old rickshaw-puller Mohammad Shainur in Dhaka’s upscale Bashundhara neighbourhood.</p><p>The economy, for one, has shown some positive signs. Bangladesh is the world’s 35th largest economy and the second in South Asia – mainly driven by its thriving garment and agriculture industries.</p><p>Foreign reserves climbed from more than $24bn in May 2024, to nearly $32bn by June this year, helped by a crackdown on illicit capital flight, record remittances and new funding from the International Monetary Fund. Inflation, which peaked at 11.7 percent in July 2024, dropped to 8.5 percent by June this year.</p><p>But there is also widespread joblessness, with the International Labour Organization saying that nearly 30 percent of Bangladesh’s youth are neither employed nor pursuing education. Moreover, a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/how-are-countries-and-markets-reacting-to-trump-tariffs\">20 percent tariff</a> announced by the United States, the largest buyer of Bangladesh’s garments, also threatens the livelihood of 4 million workers employed in the key sector.</p><p>Back in Dhaka, Gazi is determined to preserve the memory of 2024’s protests.</p><p>“Let the people remember those martyred in the uprising, and those of us who were injured,” he told Al Jazeera. “We want to remain as living symbols of that freedom.”</p><p>“I lost one hand, and I have no regrets. I will give my life if needed – this country must be governed well, no matter who holds power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
