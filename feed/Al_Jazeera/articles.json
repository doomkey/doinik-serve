An Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdul Mateen Qani, later told The Associated Press news agency that no threats had been made.</p><p>In the meantime, Iran, Pakistan and the US have been sending Afghan refugees back to Taliban rule, where they risk persecution.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands more have since sought asylum by making treacherous journeys across the world to traverse the US southern border.</p><p>Some have relocated via so-called <a href=\"/news/2024/3/15/advocates-fear-special-us-visas-for-afghans-could-run-out-despite-dangers\">Special Immigrant Visas</a> (SIVs), reserved for individuals who worked directly with the US military in Afghanistan, under a notoriously backlogged programme.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Others have been resettled through a special State Department programme, known as Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2), launched by the administration of President Biden, meant for Afghans who face persecution for having worked in various capacities on behalf of the US government or with a US-based organisation in Afghanistan.</p><p>Adam Bates, a supervisory policy counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Programme, explained that some of those pathways, most notably the SIV and refugee programmes, provide a clear course towards US residency and, eventually, citizenship.</p><p>But, he clarified, others do not – a fact that advocates have warned leaves members of the population subject to perpetual uncertainty and political whims.</p><p>“A lot of the advocacy to the Biden administration officials was about finding more permanent legal pathways for Afghans,” Bates told Al Jazeera. “That was with one eye towards the potential of giving the Trump administration this opportunity to really double down and target this community.”</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-afghans-in-the-us\">Pressure on Afghans in the US</h2><p>During Trump’s new term, his administration has taken several concrete – and at times contradictory – moves that affect Afghans living in the US.</p><p>It <a href=\"/news/2025/4/12/trump-officials-end-temporary-protected-status-for-afghans-cameroonians\">ended</a> “temporary protected status” (TPS) for Afghans already in the country at the time of the Taliban takeover, arguing the country shows “an improved security situation” and “stabilising economy”, a claim contradicted by several human rights reports.</p><p>At the same time, the Trump administration added Afghanistan to a new <a href=\"/news/2025/6/9/us-travel-ban-takes-effect-amid-la-protests-against-immigration-crackdown\">travel ban</a> list, restricting visas for Afghans, saying such admissions broadly run counter to US “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism”.</p><p>These actions underscore that “the situation in Afghanistan seems to be whatever it needs to be, from the Trump administration’s perspective,” according to Bates.</p><p>Trump has offered his contradictory messaging, <a href=\"/news/2024/8/30/afghanistan-is-a-us-election-issue-will-its-refugees-voices-be-heard\">criticising</a> the Biden administration on the campaign trail for its handling of the withdrawal, and as recently as July, pledging to “save” evacuated Afghans subject to deportation from the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration terminated a special status for those who entered the US via the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/trump-administration-relaunches-cbp-one-asylum-app-for-self-deportation\">CBP One app</a> in April, potentially affecting thousands of Afghans who entered via the southern border.</p><p>Advocates warn that many more Afghans may soon be facing another legal cliff. After being evacuated in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans were granted humanitarian parole, a temporary status that allowed them to legally live and work in the US for two years, with an extension granted in 2023. That programme is soon set to end.</p><p>While many granted the status have since sought other legal avenues, most often applying for asylum or SIVs, an unknown number could be rendered undocumented and subject to deportation when the extension ends. <a href=\"/news/2022/9/9/afghan-adjustment-act-what-does-it-mean-for-refugees-in-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legislation</a> creating a clearer pathway to citizenship has languished in Congress for years.</p><p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not publicly released how many evacuated Afghans remain in the US on humanitarian parole, and did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for the data.</p><p>Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/as-trump-raises-deportation-quotas-advocates-fear-an-expanding-dragnet\">those without criminal histories</a> targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/who-are-the-students-trump-wants-to-deport\">political advocacy</a>.</p><p>“It’s just an escalation across the board and a compounding of fear and instability in this community,” Bates said. “It’s hard to make life decisions if you aren’t sure what’s going to happen tomorrow or next week or in a year”.</p><h2 id=\"pulled-the-rug-out\">‘Pulled the rug out’</h2><p>Meanwhile, for the thousands of Afghans continuing to seek safety in the US from abroad, pathways have been severely constricted or have become completely blocked.</p><p>The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency. It has almost completely suspended the US Refugee Program (<a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/20/as-trump-seeks-systemic-change-does-the-us-have-an-obligation-to-refugees\">USRAP</a>), allowing only a trickle of new refugees in amid an ongoing legal challenge by rights groups.</p><p>Advocates say the special P1 and P2 programme created for Afghan refugees appears to have been completely halted under Trump. The administration has not published refugee admission numbers since taking office, and did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for data.</p><p>“It feels as if we have pulled the rug out from many of our Afghan allies through these policy changes that strip legal protection for many Afghans in the US and limit pathways for Afghans who are still abroad to come to the US safely,” Kristyn Peck, the chief executive officer of the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She noted that the SIV pipeline has continued to operate under Trump, although there have been some limitations, including requiring those approved for relocation to pay for their own travel.</p><p>Meanwhile, resettlement agencies like Lutheran have been forced to seriously curtail their operations following a stop-work order from the administration on January 24. As of March, Peck said, the organisation has been forced to let go of about 120 of its staff.</p><p>Susan Antolin, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, a non-profit organisation that offers mental health, legal and social support to Afghans in the US, said organisations like hers are also bracing for sustained uncertainty.</p><p>“We are diversifying our funding and trying very hard, as so many other organisations are, to find other avenues to bring in that funding to continue to support our programmes,” she told Al Jazeera. “As organisations that deal with this kind of work, we have to step up. We have to do 10 times more, or 100 times more, of the work.”</p><h2 id=\"no-more-a-priority-for-the-world\">‘No more a priority for the world’</h2><p>The unstable situation in the US reflects a broader global trend.</p><p>The Taliban government, despite promising reforms in a push for international recognition, has continued to be <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165484\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> of widespread human rights abuses and revenge killings. Still, it has upgraded diplomatic ties with several governments in recent years, and in July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.</p><p>At the same time, the governments of Pakistan and Iran have <a href=\"/news/2025/4/15/pakistan-accelerates-deportation-of-afghans-un\">accelerated</a> expulsions of Afghans back to Afghanistan, with more than 1.4 million Afghans either being <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/inside-irans-crackdown-on-afghan-migrants\">expelled or leaving</a> Iran alone from January to July of 2025, according to UNHCR.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.</p><p>Germany, too, has begun deporting Afghans back to Afghanistan, in July, it conducted its second deportation flight since the Taliban came to power, despite continuing not to recognise or maintain diplomatic ties with the group.</p><p>The collective moves send a clear message, evacuee Girowal said: “We know that Afghanistan is no more a priority for the world.”</p><p>Still, she said she has not abandoned hope that the US under Trump’s leadership will “not forget its allies”.</p><p>“I know the resilience of our own Afghan community. We are trained to be resilient wherever we are and fight back as much as we can,” she said.</p><p>“That’s one thing that gives me hope.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

An entrepreneur who made his fortune in cement, Medina now owns hotels and Burger King restaurant franchises in Bolivia.</p><p>In the 1990s, he also served as a minister of planning under President Jaime Paz Zamora.</p><p>The founder of the right-of-centre National Unity Front, Medina previously made three failed attempts to run for president: in 2005, 2009 and 2014.</p><p>He likely faces his stiffest competition from fellow also-ran, the right-wing Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga.</p><p>Like Medina, Quiroga has been a presidential candidate three times before: in 2005, 2014 and 2020. But he briefly ascended to the presidency himself after being elected as the country’s youngest vice president in 1997.</p><p>He shared a ticket at the time with the country’s former military dictator Hugo Banzer, whose government in the 1970s was associated with abuses such as torture and enforced disappearances.</p><p>As president, Banzer decided to leave office in 2001 after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and Quiroga served the final year of Banzer’s term.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3887577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3887577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3887577 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25130779241512-1755124063.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Andronico Rodriguez in a felt hat and flower garlands.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3887577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bolivian Senate President Andronico Rodriguez waves to supporters at a rally in La Paz, Bolivia, on May 10 [Juan Karita/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-any-contenders-on-the-left\">Are there any contenders on the left?</h2><p>Yes, but they have not been polling as strongly as their conservative counterparts.</p><p>Andronico Rodriguez is the leading left-wing candidate, running as an independent. The president of the Senate, Rodriguez boasts roots in Bolivia’s rural coca-growing regions, which tend to be strongholds for the governing MAS party.</p><p>Rodriguez, however, split from the MAS party this year as Bolivia’s leftist coalition fractured.</p><p>Outgoing president and MAS member Luis Arce has been blamed for Bolivia’s slumping economy, and MAS founder <a href=\"/news/2024/10/27/bolivias-morales-says-shots-fired-at-his-car-as-political-tensions-rise\">Evo Morales</a> has been locked in a feud with both Arce and Rodriguez as he seeks to regain the presidency himself.</p><p>The official MAS candidate in the 2025 election, former minister Eduardo del Castillo, has barely made a ripple in the polls.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-the-polls-say\">What do the polls say?</h2><p>A poll <a href=\"https://www.as-coa.org/articles/poll-tracker-bolivias-2025-presidential-election\">aggregator </a>compiled by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas shows conservatives Samuel Doria Medina and Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga vying for the lead.</p><p>But the polls note that a significant number of voters are either undecided or intent upon casting null votes, adding a wild-card element to Sunday’s race.</p><p>Three polls taken between early June and late July show Medina in the lead, with between 19.6 and 24.5 percent support.</p><p>Quiroga, meanwhile, garnered between 16.6 percent and 22.9 percent in the polls.</p><p>And Andronico Rodriguez, the left-wing candidate, earned between 6 percent and 13.7 percent support among the survey respondents.</p><h2 id=\"what-issues-are-top-of-mind-for-voters\">What issues are top of mind for voters?</h2><p>The country’s economic turbulence and cost of living crisis are among the highest-profile issues for voters this election cycle.</p><p>“Bolivia is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation,” said Gonzalez Calanche, the analyst with the International Crisis Group.</p><p>She pointed out that the national currency has lost more than half of its value.

In 2023 and 2024, the country saw its currency reserves shrink, and its natural gas industry suffered.</p><p>Morales, meanwhile, began to position himself as a critic of Arce’s government. Under Arce’s leadership, Bolivia’s judicial system barred Morales from seeking a fourth term as president, and an arrest warrant was issued against Morales for statutory rape.</p><p>Tensions rose in June 2024, when a general stormed the presidential palace and appeared to attempt a coup d’etat. Arce blamed Morales’s supporters, and Morales claimed Arce had staged the coup to rescue his popularity.</p><h2 id=\"what-role-is-evo-morales-playing\">What role is Evo Morales playing?</h2><p>Bolivia’s election is notable for the absence of one of the country’s most influential figures: MAS founder Evo Morales.</p><p>As a three-term president from 2006 until 2019, Morales oversaw a period of substantial economic growth that made him popular in Bolivia and across the Latin American left.</p><p>But in 2019, Morales sought a controversial fourth term in office. Though official results showed he won, protests, threats and claims of vote tampering forced Morales to leave the country.</p><p>Some have described his exile as a coup, driven by the military and the political right.</p><p>When Arce, his former finance minister, was elected president in 2020, Morales was able to return to Bolivia.</p><p>But the two leaders have fallen out, in part as a result of their rivalry for the presidency, and Morales has rallied his supporters to his side in a split that has fractured the Bolivian left.</p><p>In May, a constitutional court upheld <a href=\"/news/2024/11/9/bolivia-court-bars-former-leader-evo-morales-from-running-for-office\">a ruling</a> that Morales could not run again, due to term limits imposed since he left office.</p><p>But Morales has continued to press for a fourth term in office, and he has urged his supporters to cast null ballots to protest Sunday’s election.</p><p>Polls estimate the combined number of undecided voters and protest votes could amount to between 25 and 34 percent of voters.</p><p>Morales’s supporters have also led <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/antigovernment-protests-in-bolivia-leave-multiple-people-dead\">demonstrations</a> in protest of the former president’s exclusion from the election. Some have blocked roads. Others have erupted into clashes that left police and protesters dead.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-long-is-a-presidential-term\">How long is a presidential term?</h2><p>Presidents are elected in Bolivia for a term of five years. In recent years, the country’s courts have limited presidents to two consecutive terms in office.</p><p>This has been a source of consternation for Morales, who served three consecutive terms and hopes to gain a fourth.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-election-important\">Why is this election important?</h2><p>Bolivia’s left is likely on track for its first defeat in a presidential race in nearly two decades. That would send shockwaves throughout Latin America, where Bolivia has been a left-wing stronghold for much of the 21st century.</p><p>“The left has been weakened by schisms and personal disputes between Morales and Arce,” analyst Gonzalez Calanche said.</p><p>She explained that those schisms will be reflected in the ballot box, as trade unions and other left-leaning organisations struggle to unite behind a candidate.</p><p>With <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/antigovernment-protests-in-bolivia-leave-multiple-people-dead\">tensions high</a>, economic conditions deteriorating, and no consensus candidate to lead the country, Gonzalez Calanche fears Bolivia could be heading into a period of uncertainty as it approaches a possible second round of voting.</p><p>“There’s a very dire economic situation, made worse by social and political unrest,” she said. “It’s a cycle that continues to feed itself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Schwalb urged a judge to rule that control of the department remains in the city’s hands, and he has also sought an emergency restraining order.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>“The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.</p><p>Washington’s police chief said Trump’s directive would deeply threaten law and order by upending the department’s command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.</p><p>Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser also pushed back, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”</p><p></p><p>The White House defended its move: “The Trump Administration has the lawful authority to assert control over the D.C. Police, which is necessary due to the emergency that has arisen in our Nation’s Capital as a result of failed leadership,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.</p><p>The lawsuit comes after Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Thursday night that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police”. The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said.</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump announced that the federal government would take control of the District of Columbia (DC) Metropolitan Police Department to address surging crime.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the news conference, in which he was joined by Bondi, who was initially set to oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control.</p><p>“This is Liberation Day in DC, and we’re going to take our capital back. We’re taking it back,” Trump said.</p><p>He also announced the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/trump-deploys-us-national-guard-to-dc-amid-crime-emergency-claims\">deployment of the National Guard</a>.</p><p>“I’m deploying the National Guard to help re-establish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC, and they’re going to be allowed to do their job properly,” he said.</p><p>Trump also said that he intends to remove the capital’s homeless population, but did not provide details on how the plan would be carried out.</p><h2 id=\"residents-wary-of-escalated-show-of-force\">Residents wary of escalated show of force</h2><p>A Washington population already on edge from days of Trump administration ramp-ups has begun witnessing more significant shows of force across the city.</p><p>National Guard troops watched over some of the country’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train hub, Union Station.</p><p>Volunteers have helped homeless people leave longstanding encampments, but where they were relocating to was often unclear.</p><p>Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a baseball game on Thursday. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighbourhood.</p><p>The sudden spike in high visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many busy traffic areas, has struck residents going about their day-to-day lives.</p><p>Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he will re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.</p><p>National Guard troops are usually less of a heavy presence in Washington’s metropolitan area, typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration.

Here’s an overview of the reactions so far.</p><h2 id=\"palestine\">Palestine</h2><p>Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said the E1 development, in combination with the war in Gaza and escalating settler violence, would only lead to further escalation, tension and instability.</p><p>He said he held the US responsible for halting Israel’s expansionist actions, and noted that the settlement announcement came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had spoken of his vision for a “Greater Israel”.</p><p>The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement, called for international intervention to halt the settlement plans.</p><p>It considered the E1 settlement “a continuation of the occupation’s plans to undermine the opportunity to establish the Palestinian state on its homeland, weaken its geographical and demographic unity, entrench the division of the West Bank into isolated areas surrounded by a sea of settlements, and facilitate the completion of their annexation”.</p><h2 id=\"qatar\">Qatar</h2><p>Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed the move, saying it “reaffirms Qatar’s unequivocal rejection of the Israeli occupation’s policies aimed at expanding settlements and forcibly displacing Palestinian people, measures intended to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state”.</p><p></p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h2 id=\"saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia</h2><p>Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry condemned the settlement plans “in the strongest possible terms”, saying they were a violation of international law and a serious threat to the possibility of a two-state solution.</p><p>In a statement, it called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, protect the Palestinian people, and fulfil their legitimate rights, including recognition of the Palestinian state”.</p><h2 id=\"jordan\">Jordan</h2><p>Jordan’s Foreign Ministry condemned the move in the “strongest terms”. The ministry’s spokesman Sufyan Qudah affirmed his country’s “absolute rejection and condemnation of this settlement plan and the illegal Israeli measures that constitute a blatant violation of international law and international Security Council resolutions”.</p><p>Qudah warned against the continued expansionist policy of the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which the ministry said “encourages the perpetuation of cycles of violence and conflict in the region”.</p><h2 id=\"turkiye\">Turkiye</h2><p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the settlement plan “disregards international law and United Nations resolutions” and “targets the territorial integrity of the State of Palestine, the basis for a two-state solution, and hopes for lasting peace”.</p><p>It reaffirmed Turkiye’s support for an independent Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p><h2 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h2><p>British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the plan must be stopped.</p><p>“The UK strongly opposes the Israeli government’s E1 settlement plans, which would divide a future Palestinian state in two and mark a flagrant breach of international law,” he said in an emailed statement to the Reuters news agency.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"germany\">Germany</h2><p>The German government, a strong supporter of Israel, urged Israel to “stop settlement construction” and said it “strongly rejects” the plan for the new development</p><p>“The settlement construction violates international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Office in Berlin said.</p><p>“It complicates a negotiated two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, as demanded by the International Court of Justice,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"spain\">Spain</h2><p>Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called the expansion plan “a new violation of international law”.</p><p>“It undermines the viability of the two-state solution, the only path to peace,” he said in a social media post.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888360\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888360\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888360\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Occupied-West-Bank-E1-settlement-expansion-map-graphic-1755168549.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -

Asked about the settlement development, a spokesperson for the US State Department said Washington was focused on ending the war in Gaza and ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again.</p><p>“A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Israeli government for further information.</p></div></div></body></html>"
