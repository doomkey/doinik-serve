Another two-week-old baby, Mohammed Khalil Abu al-Khair, <a href=\"/features/2025/12/18/baby-mohammed-freezes-to-death-as-gaza-battles-winter-and-displacement\">froze to death</a> without access to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/whats-causing-gazas-war-damaged-homes-to-collapse-in-winter\">proper shelter</a> or clothing earlier this week.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Ahmed al-Farra, head of the maternity paediatric department at Nasser Medical Complex, said in a video update that “hypothermia is very dangerous” for babies. “If nothing is offered for these families in the tents, for warming, for mobile homes, for caravans, unfortunately, we will see more and more” deaths, al-Farra said.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Children are “losing their lives because they lack the most basic items for survival,” Bilal Abu Saada, a nursing team supervisor at Nasser Hospital, told MSF. “Babies are arriving to the hospital cold, with near-death vital signs.”</p><p dir=\"LTR\">In addition to the growing number of deaths, MSF said its staff has recorded high rates of respiratory infections that it expects to increase throughout the winter, posing a particular danger to children under five.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">“As Gaza is battered by heavy rains and storms, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians continue to struggle in flooded and broken makeshift tents,” the organisation added. “MSF calls on Israeli authorities to urgently allow a massive scale up of aid into the Strip.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-letup-in-israeli-attacks\" dir=\"LTR\">No letup in Israeli attacks</h2><p dir=\"LTR\">Palestinian news agency Wafa, meanwhile, reported that Israeli forces demolished buildings, carried out artillery shelling and shot guns in areas east of Gaza City on Saturday morning, with more gunfire reported east of Khan Younis.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">On Friday, an Israeli strike on a shelter for displaced Palestinians <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/19/live-gaza-ceasefire-mediators-to-hold-talks-on-second-phase\">killed at least six people</a>. The Israeli military claimed to be firing on “suspects”.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Graphic videos from the scene showed body parts and terrified civilians trying to carry wounded people out of danger.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Military vehicles also descended upon the town of az-Zawiya, located west of Salfit in the occupied West Bank, where forces severely beat and injured a number of citizens and stormed homes, the agency said.</p><h2 id=\"i-can-still-hear-his-tiny-cries\" dir=\"LTR\">‘I can still hear his tiny cries’</h2><p>Heavy rain, high winds and freezing temperatures have battered Gaza in recent weeks, flooding or blowing away more than 53,000 tents that have served as makeshift shelters for displaced Palestinians.</p><p>With huge swaths of buildings and infrastructure destroyed, streets <a href=\"/gallery/2025/12/16/winter-storms-plague-palestinians-left-in-desperate-need-of-aid-by-gaza-war\">are quick to flood and sewage overflows</a>. Displaced families have sought refuge in the shells of partially fallen-down buildings despite the risk of collapse, with 13 buildings caving in across Gaza last week.</p><p>The winter weather and Israel’s blocking of vital aid and mobile homes for shelter have proven deadly for children and babies.</p><p>Late in the evening of December 13, Eman Abu al-Khair, a 34-year-old displaced Palestinian living in al-Mawasi west of Khan Younis, found her sleeping baby Mohammed “cold as ice”, his hands and feet frozen and “his face stiff and yellowish”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She and her husband couldn’t find transportation to get to hospital, and intense rain made it impossible to make the trek by foot.</p><p>After rushing Mohammed by animal-drawn cart to Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis at dawn, he was admitted to intensive care with a blue face and convulsions. He died two days later.</p><p>“I can still hear his tiny cries in my ears,” Eman said. “I sleep and drift off, unable to believe that his crying and waking me at night will never happen again.”</p><p>Mohammed “had no medical problems,” she added. “His tiny body simply couldn’t withstand the extreme cold inside the tents.”</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Since the October 10 ceasefire took effect, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/winter-storms-worsen-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-as-un-says-aid-still-blocked\">continued to block the entry of humanitarian aid</a> into the Gaza Strip despite calls from a host of United Nations agencies, international organisations and other states for it to stop.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">The UN has said that Israel has prevented tents and blankets from reaching Palestinians, even as an estimated 55,000 families have seen their belongings and shelters damaged or destroyed in the storm.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Dozens of child-friendly spaces have also been damaged, affecting 30,000 children, according to the UN.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Natasha Hall, a senior advocate for Refugees International, told Al Jazeera that aid is entering Gaza in a “trickle” in part due to its opaque list of “controlled dual-use items” that has included nappies, bandages, tools, tents and other essentials.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">“It’s unclear how those could be used as weapons or any kind of dual use,” Hall said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF7510-1738068526.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"537\" data-end=\"990\">On a splendid November afternoon in Goa, I watched something familiar unfold on a chessboard. The Indian grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi, world number six, was destroyed by his Chinese counterpart Wei Yi. Erigaisi was playing on home soil and was a favourite of the schoolchildren who had crowded around his board in pin-drop silence. He moved his pawn to the centre of the board, pressed the button on the dual-timer chess clock, and the game had begun.</p><p data-start=\"992\" data-end=\"1599\">In this country where chess was born, grandmasters rise as effortlessly as the coastline grows coconut trees. The game enters a child’s life early, slipping through the cracks of classrooms, kitchens, and cramped, overworked working-class homes, teaching them to strategise or, more likely, to endure. That, at least, was how chess entered mine. My brilliant Periappa (uncle), without money to pursue higher education and with a temper that kept him between jobs, often ended up babysitting me. I must have been six when, during one of those days, he gave me my favourite inheritance: the game of chess.</p><p data-start=\"1601\" data-end=\"1952\">All these years later, I still remember Periappa holding a chipped, toy-sized plastic knight in front of my face and declaring, “These are my favourite. They are deadly if you master them.” I knew I’d tasted something I would always want. Chess entered my life not as a pastime, but as a sensation. My relationship with chess was a pheromonal one.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2361\">I was a difficult, friendless child, prone to sulking when Periappa sat me down for a game. I expected to win it. Because what kind of adult takes pleasure in beating a six-year-old? Everything I knew about life insisted on that point, that Periappa would throw the game because he loved me. But his was not that kind of love. And chess is not that kind of game. There was no mercy in either, only strategy.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2788\">He taught me my first chess lesson: no one loses at this game. You either learn a lesson or you teach one. I, of course, was ready for no lessons. I threw a fit, then threw the pieces, cried for a bit and never got into chess. If I had a chess career, it was short. I recall winning a local tournament in my neighbourhood, and then getting distracted by school, boys and life, drifting away from both my uncle and chess.</p><p data-start=\"2790\" data-end=\"2835\">By the time I returned to chess, he had died.</p><p data-start=\"2837\" data-end=\"3157\">Perhaps it was his death that brought me back. A chessboard became the only place where I could still be near him. This time I stayed. In fact, when the pandemic washed ashore, the chessboard was my only refuge between reporting and the uncertainty of life. It meant grappling with myself, with his voice in my head.</p><p data-start=\"3159\" data-end=\"3723\">When you start feeling strongly about chess, sooner or later, you develop a style, the same way writers develop a voice. Bobby Fischer was famous for his love of bishops. Garry Kasparov’s rook activity in the middlegame was deadly. Magnus Carlsen, one of the current greats, is known for his extremely active king in endgames. Erigaisi is known as the “madman on the board” because he is one of the few players who play without caring too much about results. It makes him reckless and dangerous, precise as a German sniper. But that is only when things go to plan.</p><p data-start=\"3725\" data-end=\"4098\">They did not. In the Erigaisi–Yi match, with one minute on the clock, Erigaisi blundered his rook. From that moment on, he made moves that steadily weakened his position. Sitting in the playing hall, between two rows of spectators, notebook on my knee, I watched him lose piece after piece, the way an animal is stripped to the bone, layer by layer, with no escape.</p><p data-start=\"4100\" data-end=\"4166\">It was a theatrical affair of the kind that keeps devotees hooked.</p><p data-start=\"4168\" data-end=\"4802\">My decades as an amateur chess addict have taught me that the addiction rarely comes from the game in its entirety, but from a fragment, like the exacting, disciplined violence of the Erigaisi–Yi match or an obsession with a single piece. For Periappa, it was the knight. For me, zugzwang is the spell that binds. It is a kind of endgame in which a player must make a move, but every move they make weakens their position. They cannot pass; they cannot skip a turn. The board offers choice, but no relief. I have spent years trying to understand zugzwang, hoping it could make sense of the ending of my relationship with Periappa.</p><p data-start=\"4804\" data-end=\"5534\">When I was a child, we spoke easily, the way people do before life complicates the board. But growing up changes the geometry of closeness, and I started seeing his flaws. He was quick to temper, a difficult husband and father, and his opinions about my education, boyfriends, and even chess became unwelcome. There was no single moment of rupture, just a slow accumulation of unreturned calls and postponed visits, until we had fewer and fewer things to talk about. Our relationship ended with me watching him in incredible pain in a Bombay hospital, with nothing left to say or do. By the time he died, we had slid into separate corners, like pieces drifting into an endgame, locked into an emotional zugzwang of our own making.</p><p data-start=\"5536\" data-end=\"6203\">After he died, I studied zugzwang obsessively, in the hope that I could tie a neat bow of chess wisdom over the ugly turn of events. I can spend hours watching and reading about the 1923 game between Aron Nimzowitsch and Friedrich Saemisch, known as the “immortal zugzwang”. It is one of the most celebrated games in chess history because, in the final position, white is completely tied up: every single legal move makes his position collapse. It is total, board-wide paralysis, as if Nimzowitsch wrapped Saemisch’s pieces in invisible wire. There is no checkmate, no need for the obvious humiliation of defeat. The game ends without spectacle, only inevitability.</p><p data-start=\"6205\" data-end=\"6917\">After Periappa died, the grief did not sweep in; it percolated. I regretted never telling him that mastering the knight had become my personal Mount Everest. I regretted that he died without knowing that I loved knights for no reason other than the fact that he loved them. That the knights had curled up in my brain and nestled in some deep, reptilian part of it, where my childhood lives. That this one small preference, passed down casually, had endured longer than our conversations ever did. It has no secret meaning. In fact, I suspect it has no meaning at all.

They give us their worst people.”</p><p>The Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme was established in 1990 to ensure applicants from underrepresented countries had access to the US immigration system.</p><p>Immigration rights advocates have long argued that pathways to permanent residency are narrow for those who do not already have a spouse, relative or some other kind of sponsor in the country.</p><p>The visa lottery helps to answer that need by creating an alternative route to residency.</p><p>The lottery system selects visa recipients randomly, but critics argue it remains a long-shot avenue to gain US residency, and even successful applicants must still pass a rigorous screening process after the lottery.</p><p>While the Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme used to accept 55,000 applicants each year, in 2000, that number was lowered to its current level, according to the American Immigration Council.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4185383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4185383\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4185383\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25353530715939-1766189719.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C575&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Surveillance footage of the Brown University suspect, with a suitcase\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4185383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Surveillance images released by police show Claudio Neves Valente, the suspect in the mass shooting at Brown University [Providence Police Dept via AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"suspect-identified\">Suspect identified</h2><p>Friday’s decision to immediately suspend the lottery comes as new details emerge about Neves Valente, a physics scholar found dead in a storage unit in New Hampshire after a nationwide manhunt.</p><p>The search began on December 13, when gunfire erupted on the campus of Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>The school’s fall semester was at its conclusion, and the exam period had begun.

Lots of them. And we will continue.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said the strikes hit central and northeastern parts of the country.

It did not provide further details on the exact locations or casualties.</p><p>CENTCOM said that “the Jordanian Armed Forces also supported with fighter aircraft”.</p><p>The operation came as Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa “is trying to rehabilitate his image and the image of Syria,” said Al Jazeera’s Oghanna.</p><p>US authorities considered al-Sharaa to be a “terrorist” as recently as last month, when the US Department of the Treasury <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/us-removes-syrian-president-from-global-terrorist-sanctions-list\">removed him</a> from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list ahead of a meeting with Trump.</p><p>Al-Sharaa “wants the world to know Syria is no longer safe haven for ISIL … and he’s also trying to transform his own image in the eyes of the world,” Oghanna said.</p><p>This latest episode, however, puts more pressure on the new Syrian government, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the US and Jordan “to work more closely together in eradicating the ISIL threat”, Oghanna said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last weekend, three Americans – two US National Guard members and a civilian interpreter – were killed in Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of US and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military.</p><p>Three US soldiers were also wounded in the attack. The US blamed that attack on ISIL and promised to retaliate.</p><p>About 1,000 US soldiers are stationed in Syria as part of a years-long operation targeting the remnants of ISIL forces in the region.</p><p>A US-led coalition has also carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting ISIL suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces.</p><p>An agreement on cooperation was reached last month when <a href=\"/news/2025/12/6/syrias-al-sharaa-promises-peace-and-unity-in-face-of-israeli-aggression\">al-Sharaa</a> met with Trump at the White House.</p><p>Although it was unclear whether Syrian defence forces took part in the US operation, the Syrian government appeared to have “signed off” on it, Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan reported earlier from Washington, DC.</p><p>“The US does consider it important to try to help Syria move beyond the Assad regime’s years of dictatorship,” Jordan said.</p><p>“In order to do so, getting rid of what the US considers a national security threat – members of ISIL – is part of helping Syria move into its next phase as a sovereign country,” she said.</p><p>ISIL <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/isil-takes-full-control-syria-palmyra-reports-150520184842272.html\">captured Palmyra</a> in 2015, at the height of its military ascendancy in Syria, before losing the city 10 months later.

Refused entry by border police as they did not have departure stamps from Israel on their passports, they were stuck on the aircraft for 12 hours before being allowed to disembark.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa admitted the passengers “out of compassion”, but said at the time that his government, which has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, would investigate as it seemed that they had been “flushed out” of the Gaza Strip.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"forced-evacuations\">Forced evacuations</h2><p>Israeli officials have previously openly stated that they support what they have termed the “voluntary emigration” of Palestinians from Gaza, in what effectively would be their forced evacuation.</p><p>In March 2025, Israel’s security cabinet set up a controversial bureau to get Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, which was headed by former deputy director of the Ministry of Defence, Yaakov Blitstein. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said at the time that 40 percent of Gaza residents were “interested in emigrating”.</p><p>The previous month, Al-Majd Europe set up its online presence with a new website stating that it focused on relief efforts in Muslim countries, specifically “for Gazans wishing to exit Gaza”, with claims that it had organised mobile health clinics in the enclave and trips for Palestinian doctors abroad that Al Jazeera later discovered to be false.</p><p>A passenger from the November flight to South Africa, whose identity was kept hidden for his own protection, said he contacted the organisation after finding the link online, which promised not only a way out of Gaza, but safety and medical treatment for injuries. “Initially, it said it was free. Then they asked for $1,400 [per person]. Then the price went up to $2,500,” he said.</p><p>Testimonies gathered by Al Jazeera showed that payments requested varied from $1,000-2,000 per person, with strict criteria for signing up. Only families would be accepted on condition that they kept their departure secret, with details on flight departures only released a few hours before takeoff.</p><p>Passengers say they were told to arrive at the Karem Abu Salem crossing (called Kerem Shalom in Israel) in southern Gaza. When they arrived, their personal belongings were confiscated, and they were put on buses to Ramon Airport, near the Israeli city of Eilat, apparently by Israeli authorities.</p><p>Nigel Branken, a South African social worker who helped tho Palestinians on the plane, previously told Al Jazeera that there were “very clearly … marks of Israel involved in this operation to take people … to displace them”.</p><p>Evacuees told Al Jazeera they were not informed of their final destination until moments before boarding. They were then escorted onto a flight registered to a brand new airline called FLYYO without exit stamps in their travel documents.</p><p>Al Jazeera discovered that FLYYO has organised a number of similar flights, all taking off from Israeli airports, headed to Romania, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya and other destinations.</p><h2 id=\"false-identity\">False identity</h2><p>Further scrutiny of Al-Majd Europe, which said it was a “humanitarian foundation established in 2010 in Germany”, with a head office located in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem, later revealed its identity to be a sham.</p><p>Al Jazeera found no company registered by that name on any German or European database. The supposed address does not appear in official Jerusalem records, with the location on Google Maps corresponding to a hospital and a cafe.</p><p>While digging into the flights, Al Jazeera found two faces linked to the organisation – both Palestinians. The first was Muayad Hisham Saidam, which the organisation lists as its humanitarian projects manager in Gaza.</p><p>A search of Saidam’s name reveals that in May 2024, his wife created a public page to ask for donations to help her family leave Gaza. A year later, Saidam posted an image of himself boarding a plane chartered by Fly Lili, another Romanian airline, announcing that he was departing Gaza.</p><p>Using the angle of his shadow, time of the flight and the location of the plane on the Ramon Airport runway, Al Jazeera discovered Saidam was likely on a flight on May 27, 2025, which left Israel for Budapest, with 57 Palestinian passengers from Gaza.</p><p>It appears that Saidam’s identity is real, and that his family was likely evacuated to Indonesia. But his connection to Al-Majd Europe is unclear.</p><p>The second public face of the organisation belongs to a man named only as Adnan, though he appears to have no digital footprint.</p><p>On November 13, the day of the Johannesburg flight, a page containing a number of partner companies was deleted from Al-Majd’s website. Using open-source intelligence techniques, Al Jazeera recovered the page, which showed a number of well-known groups that Al-Majd claimed to have been working with, including the International Red Cross.</p><p>One name stood out: Talent Globus – a recruitment company established in Estonia in 2024, with a fund containing only $350. Its website lists four employees, including Director Tom Lind, a businessman with Israeli and Estonian citizenship.</p><p>Lind’s name has been linked to a number of other companies where he’s listed either as a founder or director – all without official registration or physical addresses.</p><p>Lind’s name appeared in reports by Israeli newspaper Haaretz as one of the coordinators of the flights of Palestinians leaving Ramon Airport.</p><p>In May 2025, Lind posted on his LinkedIn page that he had left Talent Globus, and was instead focused on “humanitarian efforts to support Palestinians”. He said that, alongside a network of individuals and groups, he had assisted with the evacuation of a “substantial number” of people from Gaza.</p><p>Photos of the other three employees of Talent Globus from its website – James Thompson, Maria Rodriguez, David Chen – all turned out to be stock images.</p><p>And much like those employees, it appears as though Al-Majd itself is a fake humanitarian group, leading to the question of what those behind the organisation are trying to hide.</p><p>Publicly, Israel has seemed to back down from its plan to encourage “voluntary emigration”. But Al Jazeera’s investigation poses more questions – is Al-Majd part of a bigger plan, a way to quietly empty Gaza of its inhabitants, one secret flight at a time?</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those assertions, however, have been contradicted by the US intelligence community, which found no evidence that Maduro controls the gang.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Friday, Rubio said that the US is working with governments in the Western Hemisphere to ensure stability in the Caribbean region. But Venezuela, he underscored, is an outlier.</p><p>“There’s one place that doesn’t cooperate, and it’s the illegitimate regime in Venezuela. Not only do they not cooperate with us, they openly cooperate with terrorist and criminal elements,” he said.</p><p>“For example, they invite Hezbollah and Iran to operate from their territory.”</p><p>Trump’s allies have accused Maduro of forging ties with Hezbollah, but the US has not provided evidence that the Lebanese armed group, which was weakened by last year’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/israel-lebanon-officials-meet-as-pressure-mounts-to-disarm-hezbollah\">war with Israel</a>, is operating in the South American country.</p><p>Rubio’s comments come as the US continues to amass troops and military assets around Venezuela, raising speculation about plans to topple Maduro by force.</p><p>Trump has also announced an oil blockade on Caracas as he and his top aides continue to falsely claim that Venezuela’s oil <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">belongs to the US</a>.</p><p>Rubio was asked on Friday how he would square Trump’s self-image <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-nation-address\">as a peacemaker</a> with the escalating military threats to Venezuela.</p><p>“We reserve the right – and have the right – to utilise every element of national power to defend the national interest of the United States,” Rubio said. “And no one can dispute that. Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-not-our-war\">Ukraine ‘not our war’</h2><p>The ongoing war in Ukraine, which has been raging since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, was also a key topic in Friday’s news conference.</p><p>Rubio explained that the Trump administration is trying to gauge what <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/putin-takes-aim-at-zelenskyy-in-annual-qa-says-he-wont-negotiate-on-land\">Russia and Ukraine</a> are able to accept to help reach a peace deal, but he emphasised that the war is not a top priority for Washington.</p><p>“It’s not our war. It’s a war on another continent,” he said.</p><p>However, Rubio insisted that only the US can bring about a peace agreement in Ukraine.</p><p>“What we’re trying to figure out here is, what can Ukraine live with and what can Russia live with? Sort of identify what both sides’ positions are, and see if we can sort of drive them towards each other to some agreement,” Rubio said.</p><p>“If you were to ask [for] prioritisation, I would argue that something <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">in our hemisphere</a> for our national interest is more important than something in another continent,” he said. “But it doesn’t make Ukraine and Russia unimportant. We care about it. That’s why we’re involved in it.”</p><p>While campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump pledged to end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours of reclaiming the presidency.</p><p>He has since had to walk back those remarks, but the Republican leader has maintained an active role in peace negotiations, even hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin for a meeting in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump has lobbied for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on ending world conflicts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-pressing-to-finalise-phase-one-of-gaza-truce\">US pressing to finalise phase one of Gaza truce</h2><p>Rubio also stressed on Friday that Washington is pushing to complete phase one of the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/19/live-gaza-ceasefire-mediators-to-hold-talks-on-second-phase\">ceasefire in Gaza</a>, so the second stage can begin.</p><p>The three elements Rubio highlighted were setting up a Palestinian technocratic committee to help govern Gaza, establishing the foreign-led “board of peace”, and deploying an international policing force to the territory.</p><p>“This is something we’re aiming at very soon. It’s what we’re focused on right now like a laser,” he said.</p><p>“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion.”</p><p>“Once we’ve established that, we have a lot of confidence that we are going to have the donors for the reconstruction effort and for all the humanitarian support in the long-term building of phases two and phases three.”</p><p>The US is currently hosting talks with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye to discuss moving to the next stage.</p><p>Since the Trump-brokered ceasefire in October, Israel has killed 395 people in Gaza, including an average of two children a day. On Friday, Israeli forces attacked a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/us-to-host-qatari-turkish-and-egyptian-officials-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks\">wedding gathering</a>, killing at least six people and wounding many others.</p><p>Israel has also refused to allow an adequate amount of aid into the territory, and blocked the entry of temporary homes, despite the fact that displaced people’s tents have flooded amid harsh winter weather.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera asked Rubio about Israel’s violations, but the secretary of state failed to address the premise of the question. Instead, he stressed that work to ensure peace in Gaza is ongoing.</p><p>“This is the hard work of diplomacy and peacemaking. Peacemaking isn’t just signing a piece of paper; it’s actually complying with it,” he said. “And compliance, oftentimes, in most cases, requires daily, constant follow-up and nurturing.”</p><h2 id=\"cooperation-with-china\">Cooperation with China</h2><p>As a senator, Rubio was a <a href=\"/features/2025/2/20/marco-rubio-a-traditionalist-hawk-in-the-age-of-trump\">China hawk</a>. But on Friday, he struck a softer tone when he spoke about relations with Beijing, underscoring the need for cooperation despite bilateral tensions.</p><p>“I think I’ve been nice to China,” Rubio said jokingly. He added that the US has made “good progress” with China.</p><p>“If there’s a global challenge that China and the US can work together on, I mean, we can solve it,” he told reporters. “And there’ll be points of tension. We recognise that our job is to balance these two things. I think both sides understand that.”</p><p>After an escalating trade war early in Trump’s second term, the US and China reached a <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/30/trump-says-xi-agreed-to-one-year-trade-deal-after-amazing-talks\">one-year deal</a> in November to freeze tariffs and resolve other issues.</p><p>For nearly a decade, US officials have described the global competition with Beijing as their most pressing foreign policy issue.</p><p>But in recent months, Trump has turned his attention to the Americas, appearing to de-prioritise the rivalry with China.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"commitment-to-nato\">Commitment to NATO</h2><p>The Trump administration has been blasting Europe and its leaders over their migration policies and the regulations of the European Union, but Rubio reasserted the US’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/rubio-says-progress-but-ways-to-go-in-efforts-to-end-russia-ukraine-war\">commitment to the NATO military alliance</a> on Friday.</p><p>He suggested that NATO’s common defence, as spelled out in Article Five of the alliance treaty, which commits each member to treat an attack on an alliance ally as an attack against every NATO country, would deter any Russian military campaign beyond Ukraine.</p><p>“It’s why we remain in NATO,” he said. “That’s why we’re in this alliance, and that’s why Article Five in the NATO alliance is important.”</p><p>The only request the US has of its fellow NATO allies, Rubio added, is that they increase their military spending.</p><p>Trump has sought to raise the minimum defence spending for members of the alliance to 5 percent of each country’s gross domestic product (GDP), but some countries, most notably Spain, have pushed for greater flexibility in their military budgets.</p><p>European allies in NATO have also expressed concerns about Trump’s commitment to the military alliance, citing ambiguous statements he has made in the past about the Article Five commitment. But Rubio sought to put those worries to rest.</p><p>“We’re committed to the alliance. And our commitment isn’t just rhetorical,” Rubio said. “Our commitment is action, in the troops that have been deployed and the monies that have been spent, and the capabilities that are located in the cooperation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It allowed the government to redact information that might be used in ongoing investigations or that might identify victims. Explicit material was also allowed to be concealed.</p><p>Still, Khanna said Justice Department leaders owed the public “ a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today”.</p><p>He also criticised Friday’s release for containing “ very heavy redactions”, even for material that should have already been publicly available from grand jury materials.</p><p>“They owe the Congress and the American public an explanation for every redaction that I didn’t see published on the DOJ page,” Khanna told reporters. “The law is very clear that any redaction has to be justified in writing.”</p><h2 id=\"frustrations-with-friday-s-release\">Frustrations with Friday’s release</h2><p>Friday’s release on the Justice Department website included a search bar that promised the “full Epstein library”.</p><p>But on social media, users complained that there was a queue to enter the Justice Department’s site and that the search tool failed to return results for basic terms related to the case.</p><p>Viewers also pointed out that many of the newly released materials included pages that were largely blacked out.</p><p>“ I was encouraged initially when Todd Blanche said that we were going to have hundreds of thousands of documents released,” Khanna himself said. “So far, I have not seen much new.”</p><p>Khanna and Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky were among the sponsors for the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><p>He warned that members of the Trump administration could face consequences if they fail to release the full Epstein file.</p><p>“Thomas Massie and I will continue to explore all options to fight to make sure that they comply with the law, whether that is holding people in inherent contempt, recommending people for prosecution, recommending impeachment or private lawsuits,” Khanna said.</p><p>The official account for the Democratic Party, meanwhile, underscored Blanche’s comments that Friday’s release would be partial.</p><p>“Trump’s DOJ will not comply with today’s release deadline for the Epstein files,” the party wrote. “All files were required by law to be released today.”</p><p>Even some Republicans appeared to express frustration with the limited scope of Friday’s file drop.</p><p>“Release all the files,” Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on social media in the hours after Blanche’s interview. “It’s literally the law.”</p><p>In the lead-up to Friday’s release, Massie himself posted a 14-minute video on social media instructing the public about how to evaluate Friday’s file release.</p><p>“The victims’ lawyers have been in contact with me, and collectively they know that there are at least 20 names of men who are accused of sex crimes in the possession of the FBI. These would reside in the FD-302 forms,” he said.</p><p>“The FBI fills out these forms to summarise or memorialise what a witness gave them as far as testimony when they interviewed with the FBI.”</p><p>“So if we get a large production on December 19, and it does not contain a single name of any male who’s accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven’t produced all the documents.”</p><h2 id=\"honouring-survivors-requests\">Honouring survivors’ requests</h2><p>Survivors of Epstein’s abuses have long petitioned for the US government to release its full file on the late financier, who died in 2019 while in a New York City jail, awaiting federal trial.</p><p>Previously, in 2008, he had been found guilty on solicitation and child prostitution charges after reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors in Florida, but critics slammed that deal as a lightweight sentence that failed to hold Epstein accountable for the magnitude of his crimes.</p><p>Hundreds of women have stepped forward in recent years to testify to sexual abuse and misconduct at Epstein’s hands. Many say they were minors at the time of the abuse.</p><p>Public scrutiny has long swirled around the case, given Epstein’s wealth and prominent connections. He was known to socialise with figures including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, scholar Noam Chomsky and political figures like Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.</p><p>Earlier this year, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly a prince in the United Kingdom, had his royal titles and privileges stripped as a result of his association with Epstein and the sexual abuse allegations against him.</p><p>In the US, the case has proven to be a lingering black eye for the Trump White House, which has publicly touted itself as the “most transparent administration in history”.</p><p>Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base was strongly associated with Epstein-related conspiracy theories, including that the late financier kept a “client list” to coerce the rich and powerful.</p><p>But despite a public statement in February that the list was on her desk, Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi later issued a memo in July, alongside FBI director Kash Patel, saying that the government had no such document.</p><p>That fuelled public outcry against the Trump administration, reigniting rumours and scrutiny about the president’s own relationship with Epstein.</p><p>Trump has long denied being friends with Epstein, despite photos and documents that suggest a certain intimacy.</p><p>In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein had a falling-out after the financier allegedly poached employees from the Mar-a-Lago spa.</p><p>“I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,'” Trump explained. “And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Outta here.'”</p><p>In a recent article with the magazine Vanity Fair, Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles acknowledged Trump was in the Epstein files, but she denied he was involved in any wrongdoing: “He’s not in the file doing anything awful.”</p><p>“I know it’s a passe word, but [they were] sort of young, single playboys together,” Wiles told the publication.</p><p>Trump has often gone on the offensive against critics who sought to tie him to the Epstein files, calling members of his own base “stupid” for fixating on the file.</p><p>But in November, he reversed course and urged Republicans to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act. It passed with bipartisan support, with a vote of 427 to one in the House of Representatives and unanimous approval in the Senate.</p></div></div></body></html>"
