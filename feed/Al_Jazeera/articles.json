            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Illiberal systems often look most permanent just before they change. But moments of upheaval can also produce a different illusion: That the system is one dramatic external blow away from collapse. With Iran convulsed by unprecedented protests against the country’s leadership, it is tempting to imagine that the United States’ air power could deliver the final shove.</p><p>That temptation misreads how the Islamic Republic actually survives. Coercive cohesion is the cement of the system: The ability of parallel security and political institutions to keep acting together, even when legitimacy erodes. When that cohesion holds, the system absorbs shocks that would more conventional states would fall under.</p><p>Iran is not a single pyramid with one man at the apex. It is a heterarchical, networked state: Overlapping hubs of power around the Supreme Leader’s office, the Revolutionary Guards, intelligence organs, clerical gatekeepers, and a patronage economy. In such a system, removing one node, even the most symbolic one, does not reliably collapse the structure; redundancy and substitute chains of command are a design feature. Decapitation – a prominent narrative after US President Donald Trump’s tactical “success” in Venezuela – thus looks less like a strategy and more like a gamble on chaos.</p><p>This is why Trump’s dilemma matters. He sits between neoconservative hawks who want regime change by force and an America First base that will not support lengthy wars, post-conflict stabilisation, or another Middle Eastern adventure. The instinct, therefore, is quick-in, quick-out punishment that looks decisive without creating obligations.</p><p>Regional politics further narrow Trump’s menu. Israel wants Washington to do the heavy lifting against Tehran. Key Gulf interlocutors, notably Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, have pressed for de-escalation and diplomacy. Operationally, the Gulf’s lack of support for a new campaign might push the US towards military options launched from a distance, making sustained air operations harder to sustain.</p><p>Trump has also boxed himself in rhetorically. Having warned that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters”, the US would “come to their rescue”, he has had to signal credible military options even as he suggests diplomacy is preferable and hints that the killing is “stopping”. In practice, this oscillation appears to be less strategic ambiguity and more bargaining and indecision, encouraging every faction around him to believe it can still win the argument.</p><p>It is important to be clear about what Washington’s inner circle seems to want. The goal is not liberal democracy. The prize is a pragmatic Iran that can be drawn into a regional geo-economic framework, opened to business with the US, and nudged away from overreliance on China. That implies constraints on nuclear activity, some curbs on ballistic missiles, and a drawdown – real or cosmetic – of Iran’s support for the so-called “axis of resistance”. This is a transformation of posture, not a wholesale replacement of the Islamic Republic.</p><p>Air power can punish and signal. It can degrade specific facilities. It can raise the cost of repression by authorities. But it cannot reorganise a security sector, arbitrate succession, or deliver a behaviour change. And it cannot protect protesters from the air. Libya in 2011 remains the cautionary tale. Military force, at most, is a high-risk attempt to coerce Iranians to the negotiation table that will likely backfire.</p><p>The most plausible military scenario is limited standoff punitive strikes, using cruise missiles and long-range munitions against Iranian Revolutionary Guard centres or enabling infrastructure. This fits the “quick and clean” preference and can be framed as punishment rather than war. Its strategic downside is that it hands the Guards an “existential threat” narrative that can legitimise harsher repression, while raising retaliation risk through proxies, shipping disruption, and pressure on US bases in the Gulf. It can also reduce the chance of internal fragmentation by pushing rival factions to rally around the flag.</p><p>A leadership “decapitation” attempt is more cinematic and less credible. It is the most escalatory option, likely to unify hardliners, and still unlikely to collapse a networked system.</p><p>A sustained air campaign is the least plausible and the most dangerous. Without Gulf basing and overflight, the logistics push operations towards more distant platforms and thinner sortie generation. Politically, it would violate the America First premise; strategically, it would internationalise the crisis, widen the battlefield, and invite a tit-for-tat escalation cycle that neither side can reliably control.</p><p>Cyber- and electronic disruption sits in a different category: Lower visibility, sometimes deniable, and potentially compatible with Gulf preferences for avoiding open war. But the effects are uncertain and often temporary, and a networked state can route around disruption. The most realistic outcome is that cyberoperations might accompany other moves, yet they are unlikely to deliver decisive political change on their own.</p><p>The deeper point is that external shocks rarely produce the specific internal outcome Washington claims to want: A pragmatic transition at the top. Severe outside pressure often hardens a system’s coercive core, because escalating violence is not always confidence; it is frequently panic wearing a uniform. The only durable trigger for transformation is internal: Fractures within the security services or elite splits that create competing centres of authority with incompatible survival strategies.</p><p>If the US wants to influence those dynamics, it should focus on cohesion-shaping levers rather than dramatic bombing. Maintain deterrence against mass slaughter but avoid promising “rescue” that cannot be delivered without war. Calibrate economic pressure towards the individuals and entities driving violence while leaving credible off-ramps for technocrats and pragmatists who might prefer de-escalation and negotiation. Above all, coordinate with the US’s friends in the region, chief of all Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia, who can constrain escalation and translate coercive discourse into bargaining space.</p><p>The Islamic Republic may still crush this round of protests. It may also rearrange itself internally and survive in a new form. But the anger witnessed on the streets cannot be reined in unless sanctions are lifted and the economy transformed. For that, the regime needs to transform from theocratic paralysis to a more pragmatic system.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.</p><p>“Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”</p><h2 id=\"why-did-machado-win-the-prize\">Why did Machado win the Prize?</h2><p><a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/who-is-maria-corina-machado-2025-winner-of-the-nobel-peace-prize\">Machado</a>, 58, is the leader of the Venezuelan opposition party, Vente Venezuela. She is also one of Maduro’s staunchest critics.</p><p>In 2023, she won the Venezuelan opposition’s presidential primary, placing her in a prime position to challenge longtime leader Maduro in the 2024 presidential elections.</p><p>However, Venezuela’s top court, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, upheld a ban stopping Machado from running for office. The court backed government claims that she supported US sanctions, was linked to a weapons plot through her party and had helped cause losses to Venezuelan assets like the US-based oil refiner Citgo and chemicals company Monomeros, which operates in Colombia.</p><p>Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, a diplomat, replaced her as presidential candidate for the opposition bloc. Machado campaigned for him.</p><p>However, Maduro won the election, continuing to hold onto his presidential seat, which he has held since 2013. The election was disputed and earned widespread accusations of fraud from within and outside Venezuela, including from a panel of United Nations experts. Nine Latin American countries demanded a review of the election results in the presence of independent observers.</p><p>After spending more than a year in hiding and defying a decade-long travel ban imposed by Venezuelan authorities, Machado secretly left Venezuela in December to travel to Oslo to collect her prize.</p><p>While announcing her win, the Nobel Committee said Machado was “receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-machado-give-trump-the-nobel-prize\">Why did Machado give Trump the Nobel Prize?</h2><p>Trump’s longstanding desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize is well known. Before the prize for 2025 was announced, Trump repeatedly suggested that he <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/nobel-peace-prize-2025-what-are-trumps-credentials-and-can-he-win\">deserved to win it</a> and claimed it would be a “big insult” to the US if he did not.</p><p>Speaking at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York in September 2025, Trump said, “Everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.”</p><p>Trump added, “I ended seven wars. No president or prime minister has ever done anything close to that.” The wars he claimed to have ended include conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand; Kosovo and Serbia; the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda; Pakistan and India; Israel and Iran; Egypt and Ethiopia; and Armenia and Azerbaijan. Subsequently, Trump also oversaw the signing of the Gaza ceasefire deal.</p><p>In reality, analysts have pointed out, several of these conflicts are still alive – Thailand and Cambodia have fired at each other since their truce; Israel has killed more than 450 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on October 10; and tensions remain high between India and Pakistan.</p><p>Trump has openly expressed his frustration with not winning the Nobel Peace Prize. “I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS, and Norway, a NATO Member, foolishly chose not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on January 7.</p><p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which determines who wins the prize, is independent from the government of Norway.</p><p>The White House posted a picture of Trump and Machado with the framed prize. The text on the frame read: “Presented as a personal symbol of gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan people, in recognition of President Trump’s principled and decisive action in pursuit of a free Venezuela.”</p><p>After her meeting with Trump, Machado told reporters it was “excellent” and that she presented Trump with the medal as “a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom”.</p><h2 id=\"does-that-mean-the-nobel-prize-is-trump-s-now\">Does that mean the Nobel Prize is Trump’s now?</h2><p>Under the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, a Nobel Prize cannot be revoked, reallocated, or transferred to another person. Once a prize has been awarded, the decision is final and permanent.</p><p>The statutes of the Nobel Foundation are the formal rules that govern how the Nobel system works in practice.</p><p>While Trump can hold the physical prize, it has still been awarded to Machado, which is a decision that will continue to stand.</p><p>The Nobel Peace Center account on X, the official account of the museum about the Nobel Peace Prize, reiterated this in an X post on Wednesday.</p><p>“A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,” the post says.</p><p></p><h2><span>What does this mean for Venezuela?</span></h2><p>On January 3, Maduro, 63, was abducted by special forces of the US during an operation in the Latin American country’s capital, Caracas.</p><p>Since his abduction, Venezuela has been confronted by questions over who will lead it – and whom Trump would back for the role.</p><p>The US president quickly ruled out the possibility of supporting <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/venezuelas-machado-says-she-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-since-october\">Machado</a> as the leader of Venezuela. “She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country. She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect,” Trump said about Machado during a news conference on January 3.</p><p>On January 4, The Washington Post reported, quoting two anonymous sources close to the White House, that Trump had withheld support from Machado because he was upset that she had accepted the Nobel – even though she had dedicated it to him – instead of refusing it.</p><p>One of these people said Machado accepting the award was the “ultimate sin”, while the other person told the Post: “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ she’d be the president of Venezuela today.”</p><p>Instead, Trump has backed Maduro’s deputy, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, who was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president. Rodriguez has expressed eagerness to work with the US.</p><p>During the meeting between Machado and Trump, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while Trump had been looking forward to meeting Machado,  he stood by his “realistic” view that Machado lacks the backing required to lead the country for now.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump spoke to Rodriguez over a phone call on Wednesday. In a post on Truth Social that day, Trump described the call as “very good”.</p><p>“Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security. This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!”</p><p>Rodriguez described the conversation as long, productive and courteous, saying they discussed a bilateral agenda aimed at benefitting both countries.</p><p>Machado left the White House carrying an official gift bag – a red paper bag stamped with Trump’s gold facsimile signature. It was less clear whether she departed with any better sense of where she stands in Washington’s plans for Venezuela’s future.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tambadou has since taken a position at the United Nations – he is the Registrar of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, an international court founded by the United Nations Security Council. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021.</p><p>Seven countries – Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, the Maldives, France and Britain – have since successfully applied to support The Gambia’s case at the ICJ.</p><p>Rohingya people in Myanmar were subjected to violent, months-long offensives by Myanmar’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, from late 2016. Although the group had long faced persecution in Myanmar, according to rights groups, the attacks escalated sharply, as Rohingya communities were targeted in cases of arson, mass shootings, rapes and kidnappings.</p><p>In 2019 – the year The Gambia lodged its case with the ICJ – a United Nations fact-finding mission reported that about 10,000 people had been killed, and 730,000 people displaced to refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. The military offensive showed “genocidal intent” and the government aimed to “erase” Rohingya identity and remove them from Myanmar, the United Nations mission found.</p><p>The Gambia may have been inspired to take up the case due to its own long history of repression under former dictator Yahya Jammeh, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 22 years until 2017, Imran Darboe, a barrister formerly with the Gambian justice ministry, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Jammeh was forced out of office in 2017 by a regional military mission when he failed to leave office after losing the presidential elections.</p><p>In 2018, the new government began investigating Jammeh-era atrocities perpetrated by his “killer squad” security forces, including widespread abductions and killings.</p><p>Gambians were collectively reckoning with the painful testimonies of scores of victims as the Rohingya crisis unfolded, prompting the government to take action, despite a lack of precedent at the ICJ at the time.</p><p>“At that point, we were also going through our truth-and-reconciliation commission, and realising the value of protecting human rights,” Darboe said.</p><p>“Most people [in The Gambia] were shocked by what was being revealed, so there was the thinking that if the concept of human rights is universal, we cannot just focus on our own issues. We feel what the Rohingya people were feeling … we were all on the same page about that.”</p><p>The Gambia’s active role in the OIC also likely played a large role, Darboe added. While bringing an ICJ case would be expensive for the small nation, the OIC’s backing likely alleviates financial pressures, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-gambia-s-argument-at-the-icj\">What is The Gambia’s argument at the ICJ?</h2><p>Dawda, The Gambia’s justice minister, told the ICJ judges in his opening arguments on Monday that the Rohingya had been “deliberately targeted” by Myanmar’s ruling military and that their lives had been turned upside down.</p><p>“They have been targeted for destruction,” he said.</p><p>“Myanmar has denied them their dream, in fact it turned their lives into a nightmare, subjecting them to the most horrific violence and destruction one could imagine.”</p><p>Paul Reichler, another lawyer on the Gambian team, read out extensive witness testimony from 2017, describing scenes of houses being set ablaze with people in them, gang rapes and arbitrary killings.</p><p>The Myanmar government, Reichler added, had called the Rohingya an “impure and subhuman race” that threatened the local population.</p><p>A third team member, Phillipe Sand, concluded that the scale of the violence showed “Myanmar acted in this case with genocidal intent”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3906977\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3906977\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3906977\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250825__72D28XE__v1__HighRes__BangladeshMyanmarRohingyaConflictAid-1756122801.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Rohingya refugees take part in the 'Genocide Remembrance Day' rally to mark the anniversary of their mass exodus from Myanmar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3906977\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rohingya refugees take part in the ‘Genocide Remembrance Day’ rally to mark the anniversary of their mass exodus from Myanmar following a military crackdown, at a refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar on August 25, 2025 [Piyas Biswas/ AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-has-myanmar-argued\">What has Myanmar argued?</h2><p>Myanmar’s defence team, led by the minister of international cooperation, Ko Ko Hlaing, will begin its response to the allegations on Friday, January 16, continuing until January 20.</p><p>In 2019, when the case was filed, Myanmar was under civil rule. In preliminary hearings for the case in December that year, Myanmar denied the allegations. Former leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, personally appeared at the court and called The Gambia’s claims “incomplete and misleading”.</p><p>In January 2020, the ICJ ordered Myanmar to take emergency measures to prevent a genocide of Rohingya, in what experts called a <a href=\"/news/2020/1/23/icj-orders-myanmar-to-protect-rohingya\">“stunning rebuke”</a> of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p>Myanmar’s government – now under the control of the military, which is also grappling with an ongoing rebellion – continues to reject genocide and ethnic cleansing allegations, and says it was targeting Rohingya armed groups in “clearance operations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181834\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181834\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181834\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25350482939828-1766048517.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Aid cuts push Rohingya girls into marriage, labor, and exploitation\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181834\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Rohingya refugee girl sells goods at her stall inside a Rohingya refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, on Friday, November 21, 2025 [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-rohingya\">Who are the Rohingya?</h2><p>The Rohingya are a largely Muslim ethnic group based primarily in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State, which sits on the border with Bangladesh.</p><p>Until their forced displacement in 2017, there were about one million Rohingya in Myanmar, making them an ethnic minority among Myanmar’s 137 ethnic groups. Other Rohingya populations live in India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Although Rohingya identify as Indigenous to Myanmar, the government does not recognise them and maintains they are “illegal migrants” from Bangladesh.</p><p>Rohingya have long complained of state-sanctioned attacks and general discrimination – they are not granted citizenship and laws severely restrict their movement. Several armed groups have emerged, calling for an independent Arakan state, a historical name for Rakhine state and reminiscent of the vanished Arakan Empire which existed in the same area between the fourth and 13th centuries.</p><p>In October 2016, violent attacks on Rohingya people escalated sharply when the government launched attacks it said were targeting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), an armed group formed in 2013.</p><p>At least 750,000 Rohingya fled, primarily to Bangladesh, but also to India, Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p>Survivors have recounted horror stories of security officials torching their communities, wounding, killing and torturing people – including children – by throwing them into fires.</p><p>Many fled across land through dangerous forests, while others crossed the Bay of Bengal on perilous boat journeys, which have resulted in an unknown number of deaths.</p><p>By 2025, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were living in squalid, packed tent camps in Bangladesh’s Cox Bazar.</p><p>Most are reliant on humanitarian aid. Recent cuts in foreign aid funding by the United States government have badly hit missions serving these communities, rights groups say, with reduced food rations and the closure of schools for children.</p><p>Some have attempted to leave the camp by boat journeys for other countries. In May 2025, the UN reported that two boats carrying 427 Rohingya fleeing Bangladesh and Rakhine state capsized at sea, in just one example.</p><p>While the Bangladesh government has willingly received fleeing Rohingya refugees, the country maintains that the Rohingya must eventually return to Myanmar.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the widely-cited United States-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (<a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">HRANA</a>) put the death toll at 2,615 on Wednesday this week. Iran’s government claims numbers have been vastly exaggerated.</p><p>Tensions with the US escalated this week when President Donald Trump threatened to take action if killings continued, but then appeared to back down on Wednesday night when he said he had received assurances from Tehran that the killings would stop and executions of detained protesters would not take place.</p><p class=\"p1\">But while protesters may have been silenced for now, their concerns remain far from resolved. The threat of intervention by the US <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/trumps-bluffs-why-us-strike-on-iran-remains-real-threat\">remains very real</a>, and, critically, the dire economic conditions that first prompted protest in the closing days of 2025 have only worsened.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-have-protests-erupted-over-the-economy\">Why have protests erupted over the economy?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“The recent unrest was undoubtedly rooted in economic distress,” Hassan Hakimian, emeritus professor of economics at SOAS, told Al Jazeera. “Decades of chronic corruption and extensive economic mismanagement were accentuated by international economic sanctions, adding to the misery of large swaths of ordinary people.”</p><p class=\"p1\">On top of this, Hakimian said, Iran has suffered severe environmental-related problems in recent months – “critical <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis\">water shortages</a>, power outages and crippling <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/tehran-shrouded-in-thick-smog-as-iran-burns-dirty-fuel-amid-energy-crisis\">air pollution</a> – generating a perfect economic storm”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The value of the Iranian rial, whose near collapse on December 28, when it fell to a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\">record low</a> against the dollar, first prompted the protest, remains at a low.</p><p class=\"p1\">Banking ATMs are offline, flights and currency transactions remain limited, casualties of the shutdown of the National Information Network, Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/is-starlink-helping-iranians-break-internet-blackout-and-how-does-it-work\">state-controlled domestic intranet</a>, which is essentially the country’s internet.</p><p class=\"p1\">“If you think of the shutdown as having run for around a month, then we can fairly say that Iran’s economy has run at around 50 percent capacity over that period,” Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, said. “Assuming that’s correct, you’re looking at a loss of around a tenth of the country’s GDP if that extends to a month. How much that is in dollars depends on what currency conversion you use. They change all the time, but, over a year, it’s likely somewhere between $20bn and $90bn.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-affected-the-iranian-economy\" class=\"p1\">How have sanctions affected the Iranian economy?</h2><p class=\"p1\">Iran’s economy today is unrecognisable from that at the time of the 1979 Islamic revolution, as war, sanctions and shifting economic priorities have slowed it to a crawl, experts say.</p><p>One of the main reasons is that Iran is one of the <a href=\"/economy/2012/10/17/timeline-sanctions-on-iran\">most heavily sanctioned</a> countries in the world.</p><p class=\"p1\">Economic sanctions on Iran, beginning with those imposed by the US in the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/a-timeline-of-crises-faced-by-iran-since-1979\">immediate wake</a> of the revolution, followed by further tranches imposed by the United Nations over its nuclear programme in 2006, have played a central role in tilting Iran’s economy to the point of collapse. Israel’s attack in June last year, which resulted in a 12-day war between the two countries, further undermined confidence.</p><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Iran in 1979, when the Islamic revolution overthrew the shah, or monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose forces notoriously used repression and torture to keep him in power, without a democratic mandate.</p><p>In 1979, Washington also halted oil imports from Iran and froze $12bn in Iranian assets.</p><p>In 1995, then-President Bill Clinton issued executive orders preventing US companies from investing in Iranian oil and gas and trading with Iran. A year later, the US Congress passed a law requiring that the US government impose sanctions on foreign firms investing more than $20m a year in Iran’s energy sector.</p><p>In December 2006, the United Nations Security Council imposed its own sanctions on Iran’s trade in nuclear-energy-related materials and technology and froze the assets of individuals and companies involved in activities pertaining to it.</p><p>In subsequent years, the UN toughened sanctions and the European Union also followed suit.</p><p>In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – with the US, United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Russia and the EU. Under that pact, Iran agreed to refrain from any uranium enrichment and research into it for 15 years.</p><p>But in 2018, during his first term as president, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear treaty and reimposed all sanctions on Iran.</p><p>In 2019, the Trump administration designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “foreign terrorist organization”. Additionally, Trump imposed sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium, copper), as well as senior Iranian officials.</p><p>On January 3, 2020, after the US assassinated Qassem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, it also imposed more sanctions on Iran.</p><p>In September 2025, the UN’s sanctions were reimposed on Iran over its nuclear programme when the UNSC <a href=\"/news/2025/9/19/un-security-council-rejects-resolution-to-extend-iran-sanctions-relief\">voted against</a> permanently lifting economic sanctions on Iran.</p><p class=\"p1\">Currently, under US and other international sanctions, nearly all of Iran’s oil revenues remain frozen. Additionally, assets held overseas are frozen, trade is restricted, and banks have been targeted.</p><p class=\"p1\">Financial networks and companies linked to the development of Iran’s nuclear, ballistic-missile network and entities, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which many in the international community hold responsible for domestic repression, are also sanctioned and are not permitted to do business with the US or other nations levying sanctions.</p><p>Now, China buys more than 80 percent of Iran’s shipped oil, data for 2025 from analytics firm Kpler shows. Much of it is transported by a “shadow fleet” of oil tankers which fly false flags or switch off tracking devices to avoid sanctions.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-this-affected-people-in-iran\">How has this affected people in Iran?</h2><p class=\"p1\">Even before the conflict with Israel last year, many economists regarded Iran’s economy as locked in a period of “stagflation”, as sluggish growth – estimated by the International Monetary Fund at just 0.6 percent per year – combined with soaring prices, robbed many in Iran of their last hopes for a stable future for themselves and their families.</p><p>Economists generally consider an annual economic growth rate of 2 to 3 percent to be ideal.</p><p>Over the past eight years, Iranians’ purchasing power – the value of the money they have to spend, compared with prices – has fallen by more than 90 percent. Food prices have soared by an average of 72 percent compared with last year, as the rial has collapsed against the US dollar, official statistics show.</p><p>In December 2025, one US dollar was priced at about 1.36 million rial in the open market, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\">the rial’s worst rate ever</a>.</p><p>Then, in early January, as protests were in full swing, the Iranian rial dropped even further to 1.42 million against the US dollar – a 56 percent drop in value in just six months and a sharp decline from about 700,000 in January 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly one in five young people is out of work.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-rial-exchange-rate-important\" class=\"p1\">Why is the rial exchange rate important?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“One of the key economic indicators that really matters to people is the exchange rate,” Iranian American economist Nader Habibi explained. “People pay real attention to where the dollar is against the rial and, as their uncertainty grows, so does the amount of hard currency they store, such as dollars or gold.”</p><p class=\"p1\">According to Habibi, shortages in the supply of hard currency following Israel’s attack in June last year, as well as competition for funds from a government scrambling to rebuild and maintain its defences after 12 days of war, sent confidence in the Iranian economy reeling and accelerated the collapse of the rial.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The rapid devaluation of the rial was more than even conservative elements of society, such as the Bazaaris, could cope with,” Habibi said, referring to the common name for the shopkeepers who work in the grand bazaar.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Imagine you want to sell a TV. Say you sell it and the next day you need to buy another to replenish your inventory,” he explained. “Everything depends on the ability to buy a new TV at a price lower than that which you sold the last one for. However, after the rial collapsed, that was something the Bazaaris no longer felt they could do, so they shut their shops and took to the streets.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-now\" class=\"p1\">What will happen now?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“The protests have calmed in the last two or three days because of the sheer number of people killed. That’s why people did not go out,” one <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/15/iran-us-live-tension-lingers-amid-threats-as-tehran-reopens-airspace\">Tehran resident</a>, who did not wish to be named, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, people remain angry about the state of the economy, experts say. “The reality is that the regime has no quick fix to alleviate the dire situation it confronts this time. Even if it were to succeed in suppressing the protests by brute force, the underlying issues will not be going away,” Hakimian, the economics professor, said.</p><p>Outside intervention by the likes of the US is unlikely to help, he added.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Those favouring kinetic action overlook its poor record in the region and its likelihood to complicate an already difficult situation, whether through collateral damage in Iran or wider regional conflict.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"129\" data-end=\"532\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland on December 26 had little to do with the long-standing aspirations of communities living in the breakaway region of Somaliland in northwest Somalia. It was, instead, a product of shifting geopolitics and a rapidly fragmenting global order. An issue once confined to the margins has since been pulled into the centre of regional and international power rivalries.</p><p data-start=\"534\" data-end=\"1025\">The Horn of Africa and the Red Sea corridor, anchored by the Bab al-Mandab Strait, one of the world’s most vital maritime chokepoints, have become arenas of intense competition. Israel, the Gulf countries, Turkey, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea and China are all now deeply engaged. Within this context, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland signals something broader: the growing use of secessionist movements as disruptive instruments of geopolitical strategy across the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.</p><p data-start=\"1027\" data-end=\"1556\">What some experts describe as an “Axis of Secession” is already visible in Libya, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Syria. Led by Israel and supported by a network of regional partners, this axis targets countries whose central governments, hollowed out by conflict, exercise only partial control over their territory. The logic is simple: weaken central authority, bolster breakaway regions, and cultivate dependent entities willing to align with Israel and sign onto the Abraham Accords.</p><p data-start=\"1558\" data-end=\"2237\">For Israel, these emerging client polities offer strategic footholds in volatile regions. From them, it can monitor rivals, project power, secure key maritime routes and expand intelligence networks. Over time, Israel also hopes this strategy will coerce “mother states” into reluctantly joining the Abraham Accords themselves. Yet this approach carries a contradiction. Rather than consolidating the accords, it risks destabilising the region further and eroding their legitimacy. Saudi Arabia, long regarded by Washington and Tel Aviv as the ultimate prize of regional normalisation, has taken the lead in assembling a concerted effort to block the Axis of Secession.</p><h2 id=\"the-scramble-for-the-red-sea\">The scramble for the Red Sea</h2><p data-start=\"2273\" data-end=\"2807\">Beyond broader geopolitical rivalries, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland is closely tied to competition over access to the Red Sea. The Bab al-Mandab Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, carries around 10 percent of global trade. Control over ports and coastlines along this route confers outsized leverage over international commerce. Somaliland’s long coastline has therefore become a strategic prize. By recognising Somaliland, Israel seeks to entrench itself within the Horn of Africa’s strategic geography.</p><p data-start=\"2809\" data-end=\"3558\">This competition was evident in January 2024, when Ethiopia signed a controversial Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland, offering political recognition in exchange for access to the sea. For Ethiopia, the world’s most populous landlocked country, the deal carried obvious strategic appeal. Yet it proved short-lived. In December 2024, following Turkish-brokered talks in Ankara, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed on a framework that reaffirmed Somalia’s sovereignty and pointed to sea access arrangements under Somalia’s authority, signalling a retreat from the earlier recognition-for-access logic. The episode highlighted both the fragility of such arrangements and the intensity of the geopolitical contest surrounding Somaliland’s status.</p><p data-start=\"3560\" data-end=\"4138\">China has also become an increasingly active player. Somaliland’s decision to cultivate ties with Taiwan inevitably drew Beijing’s attention, given China’s strict adherence to the “One China” policy and its view of any engagement with Taipei as a direct challenge. At the same time, China has consistently supported Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, using its diplomatic and economic leverage to counter what it sees as destabilising secessionist dynamics. Beijing is now working to dissuade key regional actors, including Ethiopia, from recognising Somaliland.</p><p data-start=\"4140\" data-end=\"4481\">For China, the Horn of Africa is not only about ports, shipping lanes and mineral resources. It is also about preventing the spread of separatist precedents and countering moves that could embolden Taiwan. The result is an increasingly crowded and volatile theatre, where global power rivalries intersect with unresolved local aspirations.</p><h2 id=\"the-new-middle-east-alliance-and-somalia-s-choices\">The new Middle East alliance and Somalia’s choices</h2><p data-start=\"4539\" data-end=\"4879\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland has accelerated a wider realignment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, once close partners, are now increasingly at odds, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt have begun coordinating to counter what they view as a destabilising “Axis of Secession”.</p><p data-start=\"4881\" data-end=\"5438\">This shift was first set in motion by the advance of the Southern Transitional Council in Yemen, which announced a transition towards declaring an independent state, and was then sharply reinforced by Israel’s recognition of Somaliland. For Saudi Arabia, these developments represented a direct threat to its sphere of influence and national security. In response, Riyadh has taken the lead in assembling a new regional alignment that brings together Turkey, Egypt and Qatar to push back against secessionist movements and their external sponsors.</p><p data-start=\"5440\" data-end=\"6205\">Each member of this emerging alliance brings distinct concerns. Egypt fears that recognising Somaliland would embolden Ethiopia, with which it remains locked in a bitter dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Turkey, which has invested heavily in Somalia’s security and economic sectors for more than a decade, sees state fragmentation as a direct challenge to its strategic interests in the Horn of Africa. Saudi Arabia views the Axis of Secession as an existential danger, beginning in Yemen, where secessionist advances directly undermine its security. Together, these states are positioning themselves as defenders of sovereignty and regional cohesion, while also coordinating diplomatic efforts to dissuade Washington from following Israel’s lead.</p><p data-start=\"6207\" data-end=\"6837\">For Somalia, the implications are stark. Anchoring its foreign policy within this emerging alliance is no longer a matter of preference but of urgency. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar all have a direct stake in preserving Somalia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. Yet Somalia’s external relations has too often been erratic, marked by mixed signals and internal contradictions. At a moment of existential threat, hedging between competing blocs is no longer viable. Somalia must urgently recalibrate its diplomacy, using its geostrategic importance to forge durable and credible partnerships.</p><p data-start=\"6839\" data-end=\"7445\">Equally critical is the need for domestic political cohesion. With parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for May, the Federal Government of Somalia must work to build consensus among key political stakeholders on unresolved and divisive issues, including the controversial 2024 amendments to the Provisional Constitution and the framework for credible elections. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has so far shown limited willingness to compromise. Failure to secure urgent domestic consensus risks creating openings for Israel and its regional proxies to exploit Somalia’s internal divisions.</p><h2 id=\"somaliland-s-paradox\">Somaliland’s paradox</h2><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7845\">Ironically, Somaliland’s pursuit of international recognition may have been undermined by its reliance on Israel. Israel’s global standing, already severely damaged by its genocide in Gaza, has made recognition by Tel Aviv politically toxic across much of the Arab and Muslim world. Rather than advancing Somaliland’s case, the association risks deepening its isolation.</p><p data-start=\"8304\" data-end=\"8800\">The move also carries domestic consequences. A significant segment of Somaliland’s population opposes normalising relations with Israel, particularly amid widespread claims that Israel is exploring resettlement of Palestinian refugees from Gaza in Somaliland — an allegation the leadership of the breakaway region denies. Instead of consolidating sovereignty, Somaliland now faces the prospect of internal dissent alongside growing external resistance.</p><p data-start=\"8304\" data-end=\"8800\">These challenges are compounded by changing realities on the ground. Somaliland no longer exercises control over all the territory it claims as the former British Somaliland. In July 2025, a new federal member state, the Northeast State of Somalia, was established in large swathes of this territory and swiftly pledged allegiance to the Federal Government of Somalia. Its emergence has reinforced Somalia’s territorial integrity and further weakened Somaliland’s bid for international recognition.</p><p data-start=\"8802\" data-end=\"9474\">At the diplomatic level, Israel’s decision has triggered a wave of international support for Somalia. Key regional and global organisations, including IGAD, the African Union, the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the European Union and India, have all reaffirmed Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Even the United States, Israel’s closest ally, joined other members of the UN Security Council in restating its commitment to Somalia’s unity. What was intended as a breakthrough for Somaliland has instead strengthened Somalia’s diplomatic position, exposing the paradox of recognition in an increasingly fragmented international system.</p><p data-start=\"9476\" data-end=\"9705\">Unless Israel succeeds in persuading US President Donald Trump to recognise Somaliland, an uphill task given the countervailing weight of the Saudi-led alliance, hopes of a wider domino effect appear to have reached a dead end.</p><h2 id=\"when-recognition-backfires\">When recognition backfires</h2><p data-start=\"9739\" data-end=\"10172\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland is not an isolated act but part of a broader strategy, the so-called Axis of Secession, which exploits fragility in war-torn states from Libya and Yemen to Sudan, Somalia and Syria. By empowering breakaway regions, Israel, with the backing of key regional partners, especially the United Arab Emirates, has sought to reshape the regional order. Instead, it has provoked determined resistance.</p><p data-start=\"10174\" data-end=\"10596\">Ethiopia’s aborted Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland, China’s assertive defence of Somalia’s sovereignty, and the deepening rupture between Saudi Arabia and the UAE all underscore the volatility and limits of this approach. For Somaliland, the decision to tie its recognition strategy to Israel has backfired, increasing its diplomatic isolation while internal opposition grows and territorial control weakens.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\">For Somalia, the lesson is equally clear. Its survival as a sovereign state now depends on urgency, internal cohesion and firm alignment with the emerging Middle East alliance that has positioned itself against fragmentation and secession. Far from advancing secessionist ambitions, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland has reinforced the international consensus around Somalia’s territorial integrity. It has also exposed the limits of recognition as a geopolitical instrument in an increasingly fractured global order.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_6961039d90-1767965597.jpg?resize=1920%2C1292",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"505\" data-end=\"833\">Elon Musk recently declared on X that “an immediate increase in the birth rate is needed”. It’s the kind of statement that sounds dramatic, urgent and vaguely civilisational, but it is also profoundly disconnected from reality. However, Musk is far from an isolated voice within the far right and among the world’s billionaires.</p><p data-start=\"835\" data-end=\"1171\">Low birthrates are not a mystery. They are not the result of moral decay, declining ambition or an excess of “woke politics”, but rather the predictable outcome of an economic system in which people are paid too little, work too much and are told to feel personally responsible for structural failures engineered far above their heads.</p><p data-start=\"1173\" data-end=\"1662\">This disconnect is not limited to fertility. The same billionaires and CEOs who lament demographic decline also complain that people do not buy locally, that European industries are losing ground, and that “the West” is becoming economically fragile, with some even calling for bans on Chinese online platforms such as Temu or Shein. And yet, when it comes to solutions, they reliably converge on the same prescriptions: longer working hours, wage restraint, mass layoffs and deregulation.</p><p data-start=\"1664\" data-end=\"1795\">In other words, even when their diagnosis occasionally overlaps with reality, their remedies systematically make the problem worse.</p><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"2302\">Start with wages. Across much of Europe, real wages have stagnated or fallen in recent years. Inflation has eaten into purchasing power, while salary increases have lagged behind the cost of housing, energy, food and childcare. The results are visible in the numbers: the EU’s average fertility rate has fallen to around 1.4 children per woman, well below replacement level. For millions of households, income is no longer a foundation for planning a future, but a constant exercise in damage control.</p><p data-start=\"2304\" data-end=\"2526\">But better wages alone will not make a difference if the cost of living continues to rise. Young people simply cannot buy a home in most European countries and basic living costs have risen several times faster than wages.</p><p data-start=\"2528\" data-end=\"2909\">All of this has direct consequences for fertility. Having children requires not just love or desire, but time, money and a sense of stability. When rent absorbs half your income, when childcare costs rival a second mortgage, and when job security is eroded by endless “restructurings”, choosing not to have children is not a cultural failure, but an economically rational decision.</p><p data-start=\"2911\" data-end=\"3441\">Yet this reality is routinely ignored by those at the top. Musk, for instance, is famous not only for his concern about population decline, but also for championing extreme work cultures. Employees at companies he controls have been told to work “hardcore” hours or leave, and similar messages echo across corporate America and increasingly in Europe: work more, rest less, be grateful, and somehow also find time to have children and buy local products, which are often more expensive than those sold by Chinese online retailers.</p><p data-start=\"3443\" data-end=\"3766\">The contradiction is obvious. You cannot demand longer working days, weekend availability and permanent precarity, and then act surprised when people do not have the time, energy or confidence to raise children. Biology may set limits but economics determines whether people feel safe enough to build families within them.</p><p data-start=\"3768\" data-end=\"3957\">It is also true that falling birthrates in wealthy societies are a long-observed pattern shaped by structural conditions, not simply by “cultural decline” or a lack of desire for children.</p><p data-start=\"3959\" data-end=\"4281\">This leads to a paradox. Wealthy societies tend to have fewer children, so it is often assumed that the problem cannot be economic. But this confuses national wealth with individual security. Rich countries can still be hostile places in which to raise families. What suppresses fertility is not prosperity, but precarity.</p><p data-start=\"4283\" data-end=\"4560\">Where income is concentrated, time is scarce and risk is individualised, having children becomes a gamble rather than a choice. The question, then, is not why people in rich countries have fewer children, but why so many rich countries make family life economically irrational.</p><p data-start=\"4562\" data-end=\"4858\">The same logic applies to consumption. European business leaders often complain that consumers are turning away from local products and towards cheap imports from China. This is framed as a failure of loyalty or taste, and as an imminent danger to Western economies, but the truth is far simpler.</p><p data-start=\"4860\" data-end=\"5169\">People buy cheaply because they are paid poorly. When wages stagnate, price becomes the dominant factor in purchasing decisions, and supporting local producers becomes a luxury, accessible primarily to those insulated from the economic pressures shaping the debate, often the same actors who helped create them.</p><p data-start=\"5171\" data-end=\"5430\">This is where the hypocrisy becomes clear. The same corporate actors who suppress wages through outsourcing, automation and relentless cost-cutting then complain that domestic demand is weak. They hollow out the middle class and then lament its disappearance.</p><p data-start=\"5432\" data-end=\"5922\">None of this is accidental. Extreme inequality is not a side effect of modern economies, but a political choice, actively defended by those who benefit most from it. Millionaires, and especially billionaires, exercise outsized influence over public policy, labour markets and regulatory frameworks. Through lobbying, tax avoidance, media ownership and direct access to decision-makers, they shape economies in ways that concentrate wealth while externalising risk onto workers and families.</p><p data-start=\"5924\" data-end=\"6339\">The result is a system in which insecurity is normalised for the many and optional for the few. When economic power translates so seamlessly into political power, policies that could restore balance, such as higher wages, shorter working hours, progressive taxation, robust public services and wealth taxation, are dismissed as unrealistic, even as the social consequences of inequality become impossible to ignore.</p><p data-start=\"6341\" data-end=\"6805\">It is not uncommon for politicians aligned with economic elites to propose tax cuts for corporations, often through reductions in social contributions and labour protections, while shifting the burden onto the rest of the population under the claim that it will “create jobs”. In this sense, today’s fertility crisis is not a demographic mystery, but a governance failure rooted in the unchecked power of those who profit from scarcity while lamenting its effects.</p><p data-start=\"6807\" data-end=\"7112\">History offers a simple lesson. Henry Ford famously understood that paying workers enough to buy the products they made was not charity, but sound economics. Today’s corporate elite appears to have forgotten that insight, even as it enjoys productivity gains and record profits unimaginable a century ago.</p><p data-start=\"7114\" data-end=\"7392\">Instead, mass layoffs are presented as efficiency. Thousands of highly skilled workers are dismissed, even as executive compensation and shareholder payouts remain intact. Jobs are treated as expendable, families as optional and stability as a privilege rather than a baseline.</p><p data-start=\"7394\" data-end=\"7573\">And when the social consequences become impossible to ignore, billionaires suddenly rediscover “society” and issue pronouncements about what ordinary people should do differently.</p><p data-start=\"7575\" data-end=\"7910\">Despite the complexity of the situation, the core logic is simple. If people do not earn enough to live decently, they will not buy expensive goods, have children or plan long-term futures. If they are expected to be permanently available for work, they will not have the time or emotional capacity to care for families or communities.</p><p data-start=\"7912\" data-end=\"8300\">If billionaires are genuinely concerned about demographic decline, the prescription is not cultural panic or reproductive moralising, or showcasing their own large families, but higher wages, stronger labour protections, affordable housing, accessible childcare and shorter working hours. Above all, reducing the extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of a few would be fundamental.</p><p data-start=\"8302\" data-end=\"8455\">If they are concerned about the decline of local industries, the answer is not scolding consumers, but rebuilding purchasing power and economic security.</p><p data-start=\"8457\" data-end=\"8882\">The uncomfortable truth is that many of today’s elites benefit from the very fragility they decry. Stability, by contrast, requires redistribution, limits and shared responsibility. If billionaires are truly concerned, they should accept heavy taxation on their wealth. Philanthropy and charitable giving, often used as tools for tax avoidance and reputational laundering, are no substitute for democratic accountability.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\">When billionaires demand more babies, more loyalty, more work and more sacrifice, the real question is not why ordinary people are failing to deliver, but why those with the most power refuse to acknowledge their own role in creating the conditions they now condemn. Addressing this crisis ultimately requires political choices that rebalance power towards workers, families and democratic institutions, rather than further entrenching the authority of those who profit from insecurity.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

more than 2,500 hectares, the Ministry of Environment said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sum represents both fines for damage and the proposed monetary value of recovery efforts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The suits were filed to courts on Thursday in Jakarta and North Sumatra’s Medan, the ministry added.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We firmly uphold the principle of polluter pays,” Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said in a statement.</p><p>He added that any corporation that “profits by damaging the ecosystem must be held fully responsible for restoring it”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Environment Ministry declined to offer more details when speaking with the AFP news agency on the alleged damage caused by the defendants, listed in the statement only by their initials.</p><p>The Indonesia Business Post reported that the ministry is also conducting environmental audits on more than 100 companies operating in the provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh, quoting Nurofiq as saying that potential criminal suspects will be identified after the audits are completed.</p><p>Separately, a task force comprised of the military, police, Attorney General’s Office, and ministries has identified 12 companies suspected of contributing to flash floods and landslides in Sumatra, The Indonesia Business Post said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p2\">Environmental groups say the government also holds some responsibility when granting companies the right to raze large tracts of land.</p><p class=\"p2\">Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaigner Arie Rompas called the lawsuits a “minimalist” move, adding that authorities should comprehensively review policies responsible for the disaster.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Besides the impact of the climate crisis, the flooding was also caused by land degradation, including deforestation, carried out by corporations,” Arie told AFP.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Those companies were granted permits by the government.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Mining, plantations, and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush Indonesian rainforest over recent decades.</p><p class=\"p1\">More than 240,000 hectares of primary forest were lost in 2024, according to analysis by conservation start-up The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project.</p><p class=\"p1\">Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said last month that the government will revoke 22 forestry permits across the country, including permits that encompass more than 100,000 hectares in Sumatra.</p><p class=\"p1\">Antoni did not specify whether the decision was linked to the disaster, though he earlier said that the floods provide an opportunity to “evaluate our policies”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The “pendulum between the economy and ecology

Her memory declined and she had muscle spasms, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-near-death-intent-on-continuing-protests\">a sign</a> of possible neurological damage.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/three-palestine-action-activists-end-uk-hunger-strike\">until they announced</a> the end of their hunger strikes on Wednesday amid their rapidly collapsing health, Muraisi and prisoners Kamran Ahmed, 28, and Lewie Chiaramello, 23, were determined to continue.</p><p>A Londoner who worked as a florist and lifeguard, Muraisi <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uk-hunger-striker-heba-muraisi-i-think-about-how-or-when-i-could-die\">told Al Jazeera</a> this week that she had resigned herself to the idea of death but wanted to keep refusing food in protest because she was “finally being heard”.</p><p>Ahmed, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera, has said ending the hunger strike after 65 days felt “bittersweet”.</p><p>Chiaramello had fasted every other day, as he is a Type 1 diabetic, for 46 days.</p><h2 id=\"i-was-willing-to-go-the-distance\">‘I was willing to go the distance’</h2><p>In total, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/who-are-the-palestine-action-hunger-strikers\">eight individuals</a> have participated in the protest since early November. Currently, just one remand prisoner, Umer Khalid, continues to refuse food.</p><p>“I was willing to go the distance,” said Ahmed, who is also from London and had worked as a mechanic. “But others were not willing to see me walk a mile further.”</p><p>Described by loved ones as having become paper-thin, Ahmed has lost 25 percent of his body weight. His heart muscle has shrunk, he suffers from chest pains and has lost hearing in one ear. His speech was slurring, and walking took so much energy it made him breathless.</p><p>On Monday, when they last spoke by phone, his sister Shahmina Alam, a pharmacist, urged him to consider ending the strike.</p><p>“We just knew that it’s coming to a point where it’s really dangerous and actually, the probability of death was very high,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Alam and physicians consulting the group are concerned that the hunger strikers may have already suffered irreversible health damage, as long-term symptoms related to starvation can take years to show. There are also fears around refeeding, which can be fatal if mismanaged.</p><p>Ahmed was hospitalised again this week, the seventh time since the protest began.</p><p>The collective held at various prisons includes Qesser Zuhrah; Amu Gib; Muraisi; Teuta Hoxha; Ahmed; Chiaramello; Jon Cink and Khalid, who has muscular dystrophy and has been on hunger strike for seven days.</p><p>All will have spent more than a year in prison before their trials are expected to take place later this year, far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>Some of the group, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at the UK subsidiary of Israel’s largest arms manufacturer, Elbit Systems, in Bristol. Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at a Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Oxfordshire. They deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.</p><p>Palestine Action, the group they are allegedly linked to, claimed responsibility for both incidents.</p><p>Six of those charged in the Bristol action are currently on trial.</p><h2 id=\"were-the-hunger-strikers-demands-met\">Were the hunger strikers’ demands met?</h2><p>The collective had five key protest demands, including immediate bail, the guarantee of a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action.</p><p>They also called for all 16 of Elbit’s sites in the UK to be closed and demanded an end to what they call censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.</p><p>Throughout the protest, the government said the group would face a fair trial, that it had no power over the issue of bail, as this is a matter for the judiciary, and that prison welfare procedures were being followed. It has not commented on the end of the latest hunger strikes.</p><p>Elbit Systems, a target of Palestine Action’s campaign, describes its drones, which have been used extensively in Gaza to deadly effect, as “the backbone” of Israel’s drone fleet.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">Palestine Action</a> had been calling to “shut Elbit down” before it was outlawed as a “terrorist organisation” in July, putting it on par with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. The group, which said it backed direct action without violence and accused the UK of complicity in Israel’s atrocities, is fighting the ban in courts.</p><p>In the later stages of the hunger strike, the group added a further demand – that Muraisi be returned to Bronzefield prison near her home, having been moved to a jail in northern England.</p><p>That will now happen, said Prisoners for Palestine, an activist-led group that supports the collective’s families, hailing the transfer as a triumph.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine has claimed several “victories” – primarily the UK government’s recent decision, reported by The Times newspaper, against awarding Elbit Systems UK a 2-billion-pound ($2.68bn) army training contract. The contract is instead reportedly going to Raytheon UK, the subsidiary of the US defence firm, which also has several deals with the Israeli military. Back in October 2023, Raytheon’s CEO said the company would “benefit” as the “war in Gaza or in Israel … will eventually lead to additional orders”.</p><p>“Obviously we will never know – and I don’t think they’ll ever admit – how much of an influence the hunger strike had on [the contract decision against Elbit],” Alam, Ahmed’s sister, said.</p><p>“There were some wins,” she added, such as raising awareness about Elbit’s role in Israel’s genocide and the overuse of pre-trial detention in the UK.</p><h2 id=\"there-has-been-some-concessions-by-government-mp\">‘There has been some concessions by government’: MP</h2><p>The group’s supporters have also claimed victory.</p><p>“There has been some concessions by government,” said John McDonnell, a Labour MP, as he paid tribute to the hunger strikers’ “dedication”.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine said it considers as another success the offer of a meeting between Hoxha and the head of JEXU (Joint Extremism Unit) at her prison. Hoxha had claimed she was being monitored by the JEXU task force and that it had ordered prison officers to strip her of a library job in jail.</p><p>The group also saw as a win its meeting with prison healthcare leaders “at the behest of the Ministry of Justice”, and the “bulk” release of mail it alleged had been “withheld”.</p><p>“Books on topics of Gaza and feminism have also been given [to the prisoners] after months of waiting,” the group said.</p><p>The protest is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in UK history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands. Sands died on the 66th day of his protest, becoming a symbol of the Irish Republican cause. Nine others also died of starvation.</p><p>“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state,” said Prisoners for Palestine, which offers “direct action training” on its website.</p><p>“While these prisoners end their hunger strike, the resistance has just begun,” said the group, adding that 500 people have recently expressed interest in taking “direct action against the genocidal military-industrial complex”.</p><p>It added that in pursuit of a fair trial, the hunger strikers had demanded the disclosure of export licences for the last five years from Elbit Systems. “After repeated requests, this information was disclosed to an independent researcher by the Department of Trade during the hunger strike,” it said, hailing another “victory”.</p><p>Alam said she imagines Ahmed will have had a few cups of tea since the hunger strike ended. He requested soya milk, she said, as it is easier on the stomach.</p><p>The government does not “get to decide whether these guys live or don’t live”, she said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, it’s their decision, and that’s what they did.</p><p>“They took back control.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But about 350 kids and teens – some of the nation’s best young cross-country skiers and biathletes – still practise in fenced-off areas amid the sporadic buzz of drones passing overhead, then explosions as they’re shot down.</p><p>“We have adapted so well — even the children — that sometimes we don’t even react,” Mykola Vorchak, a 67-year-old coach, said. “Although it goes against safety rules, the children have been hardened by the war. Adapting to this has changed them psychologically.”</p><p>War has taken a heavy toll on Ukrainian sport. Athletes were displaced or called up to fight. Football matches are often interrupted by air raid sirens, so attendance is capped by bomb shelter capacity. Elite skaters, skiers and biathletes usually train abroad, with attacks and frequent blackouts shuttering local facilities.</p><p>But the government-run Sports Ski Base of the Olympic Reserve is open for cross-country skiing and biathlon, the event which combines skiing with shooting. The sprawling complex is on the outskirts of Chernihiv, a city two hours north of Kyiv along the path of destruction that Russia’s army left in its 2022 attempt to capture the capital. Chernihiv remains a regular target for air attacks aimed at the power grid and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Several temporary structures at the sports centre serve as changing rooms, toilets and coaches’ offices. Athletes train on snowy trails during the winter and, throughout the rest of the year, use roller skis on an asphalt track pocked by blast marks.</p><p>Biathletes aim laser rifles at electronic targets and, between shooting drills, sling skis over their shoulders and jog back to the start of the course, cheeks flushed from the cold.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-s-first-olympic-medal\">Ukraine’s first Olympic medal</h2><p>Valentyna Tserbe-Nesina spent her adolescence at the Chernihiv centre performing these same drills, and won bronze at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer. It was Ukraine’s first Olympic medal as an independent country.</p><p>“The conditions weren’t great, but we had nothing better. And for us, it was like a family — our own little home,” she said inside her apartment, its shelves and walls lined with medals, trophies and souvenirs from competitions around the world.</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina, 56, was shocked when she visited the complex in 2022. Shelling had torn through buildings, fire had consumed others. Shattered glass littered the floors of rooms where she and friends once excitedly checked taped-up results sheets.</p><p>“I went inside, up to my old room on the second floor. It was gone — no windows, nothing,” she said. “I recorded a video and found the trophies we had left at the base. They were completely burned.”</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina has been volunteering to organise funerals for fallen Ukrainian soldiers in her hometown while her husband, a retired military officer, returned to the front. They see each other about once a year, whenever his unit allows him brief leave.</p><p>One adult who in 2022 completed a tour in a territorial defence unit of Ukraine’s army sometimes trains today alongside the centre’s youngsters. Khrystyna Dmytrenko, 26, will represent her country at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics that start on February 6.</p><p>“Sports can show that Ukraine is strong,” Dmytrenko said in an interview next to the shooting range. “We represent Ukraine on the international stage, letting other countries, athletes and nations see our unity, strength and determination.”</p><p>The International Olympic Committee imposed bans and restrictions on Russian athletes after the invasion of Ukraine, effectively extending earlier sanctions tied to state‑sponsored doping. But a small group of them will participate in the upcoming Winter Games.</p><p>After vetting to ensure no military affiliation, they must compete without displaying any national symbols — and only in non-team events. That means Russian and Ukrainian athletes could face one another in some skating and skiing events. Moscow’s appeal at the federation level to allow its biathletes to compete is pending.</p><p>That’s why many Ukrainians view training for these events as an act of defiance. Former Olympic biathlete Nina Lemesh, 52, noted that some young Ukrainians who first picked up rifles and skis at the Chernihiv ski base during wartime have become international champions in their age groups.</p><p>“Fortunately, Ukrainians remain here. They always will,” she said, standing beside the destroyed dormitories. “This is the next generation of Olympians.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
