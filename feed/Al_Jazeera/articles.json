Slovenia has an electorate of 1.69 million people.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said it will alleviate unnecessary pain. Those against said society should care for the sick, not help them die.</p><p>Several European countries – including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland – already allow terminally ill people to receive medical help to end their lives.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-slovenes-proposing\"></h2><h2 id=\"what-are-the-slovenes-proposing\">What are the Slovenes proposing?</h2><p>Under the disputed law, which was set to take effect this year, lucid but terminally ill patients would have had the right to die if their suffering had become unbearable and all other treatment options had been exhausted.</p><p>The legislation is similar to the assisted dying bill passed by the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/british-parliament-votes-in-favour-of-assisted-dying-law\">United Kingdom Parliament</a> in June. Britain’s bill allows assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, the approvals of two doctors, judicial oversight and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>Slovenia’s law would require the approval of two doctors but also cooling-off periods and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>About 54 percent of citizens back the legalisation of assisted dying, almost 31 percent oppose it and 15 percent are undecided, according to a poll published this week by the Dnevnik daily based on 700 responses. In June 2024, 55 percent backed the law.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-supporters-saying\">What are supporters saying?</h2><p>Prime Minister Robert Golob urged citizens to back the law “so that each of us can decide for ourselves how and with what dignity we will end our lives”.</p><p>Marijan Janzekovic, an 86-year-old who lives in the town of Sveti Tomaz near the capital, Ljubljana, also supports the bill.</p><p>His wife, Alenka Curin-Janzekovic, was in pain from diabetes-related illnesses before she ended her life at a suicide clinic in Switzerland in 2023.</p><p>“She was in a wheelchair … and in pain so bad my heart hurt just by watching her,” he told the Reuters news agency.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-opponents-think\">What do opponents think?</h2><p>The main political group opposing the law, called Voice for the Children and the Family, has accused the government of using the law to “poison” ill and elderly people.</p><p>Opponents said the law is inhumane and violates Slovenia’s Constitution, which declares human life inviolable.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slovenian Catholic Archbishop Stanislav Zore said the state should focus on palliative care instead.</p><p>“Let’s care for the sick and dying but not offer them suicide,” he said. The Catholic Church is opposed to euthanasia.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-countries-practice-assisted-dying\">What other countries practise assisted dying?</h2><p>Assisted dying is already permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, several states in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.</p><p>In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several US states, assisted dying laws are generally framed around medical aid. These jurisdictions typically require that patients be terminally ill, mentally competent and assessed by two independent doctors.</p><p>In many of these countries, the patient must self-administer lethal medication rather than have a doctor provide it directly. These regimes prioritise patient autonomy and strict procedural safeguards, such as waiting periods.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal, the approach to assisted dying is permissive. Active euthanasia or doctor-administered treatment is legal under defined conditions of unbearable suffering, even if the patient is not terminally ill.</p><p>In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only assisted suicide is legally tolerated as opposed to active euthanasia. Switzerland is an outlier insofar as there is no dedicated regulatory regime for euthanasia, meaning nonresidents may access the service via organisations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4125340\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4125340\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4125340\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-assisted-dying-legal-world-NOV23-2025-1763907325.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is assisted dying legal - world-NOV23, 2025-1763907325\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4125340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-currently-debating-assisted-dying-laws\">Which other countries are currently debating assisted dying laws?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/french-lawmakers-approve-assisted-dying-bill\">May</a>, France’s National Assembly approved a “right-to-die” bill. The legislation would allow adults over 18 who are citizens or residents and suffer from incurable illnesses and “intolerable” physical or psychological suffering to request lethal medication.</p><p>Under the bill, a medical team must assess the patient’s condition before a mandatory reflection period before the prescription of a lethal substance. If the patient is physically unable to self-administer, a doctor or nurse may assist.</p><p>The proposal excludes people with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative disorders like advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The bill now has to go to the Senate and must return to the National Assembly for a second reading before it could become law.</p><p>Elsewhere, Britain’s lower house voted to legalise assisted dying in June. The House of Commons narrowly voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, marking a major step towards legalising assisted dying in England and Wales.</p><p>The bill would allow mentally competent adults with a prognosis of less than six months to live to request medical help to end their lives, subject to assessments by two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a social worker.</p><p>The legislation is not yet law. It must still get through the House of Lords, where it will be further scrutinised and may be amended. If it does become law, the timeline for implementation may not be until 2029.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The right level is the head of state, a special envoy appointed by the president of that country or it could also be a minister.”</p><p>The US will be G20 president for 2026 and says it will host its summit at President Donald Trump’s golf club in Doral, Florida.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump boycotted the summit of leaders from rich and emerging economies on Saturday and Sunday because of allegations that the host country’s Black majority government persecutes its white minority – allegations that have been widely debunked.</p><p>The diplomatic rift between the US and South Africa deepened this week when Ramaphosa said the US had changed its mind and wanted to participate in the summit at the last minute.</p><p>The White House denied that and said US officials would attend only the formal handover of the G20 presidency.

Israeli media say the military tried to kill him twice during last year’s war. This would represent a third attempt. Hezbollah has yet to confirm if he was injured or killed.</p><p>Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported that an enemy air strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs targeted an apartment building in Haret Hreik.

Ambulances arrived immediately at the scene and transported the injured to nearby hospitals.</p><p>A large plume of smoke could be seen in the busy neighbourhood, according to local media.</p><p>One video widely circulated on social media shows dozens of people crowded around the area of the strike, which appears to be just next to a building.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said the fact that the capital was targeted without prior warning is an indication that they were after “a high value target”.</p><p>She said that Israel has previously issued forced evacuation orders before its strikes on the capital.</p><p>“We still have no confirmation, but if indeed Haytham Ali Tabatabai was targeted and killed, this would be a major blow to the organisation, which already suffered many blows in Israel’s war against the group,” she said.</p><p>“It would also be a major security breach,” she added.</p><p>Israel <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">assassinated longtime leader</a> Hassan Nasrallah in an air attack on southern Beirut just over a year ago.</p><p>The strike comes days before Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to visit the country amid intensified Israeli aggression in recent weeks.</p><p>Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar said that Israel has been striking all of Lebanon since the ceasefire agreement was brokered by Washington about a year ago.</p><p>“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty, and the security of its citizens,” he said.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Souhaib Jawher, a nonresident fellow at the Alternative Policy Institute, said of the possible target: “I believe that Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks.”</p><p>He said it is “a means of exerting pressure, and there is no destructive decision that constitutes a ground invasion as long as the atmosphere is open to bombing and assassination”.</p><p>“Lebanon has offered everything, including clearing the area south of the Litani River of weapons and agreeing to direct negotiations. The president presented an initiative two days ago, but the current situation benefits Israel,” Souhaib added on Sunday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4125235\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4125235\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4125235\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251123__84WH9UR__v1__HighRes__LebanonIsraelConflictHezbollah-1763904763.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israeli attack on Beirut\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4125235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People gather around the residential building hit in an Israeli military strike in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood [Ibrahim Amro/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"repeated-israeli-attacks\">Repeated Israeli attacks</h2><p>Israel has been carrying out near-daily strikes on southern Lebanon and has also attacked Beirut several times, but the capital had not been hit in the past several months.</p><p>At least 13 people were killed in an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">Israeli air strike on a Palestinian refugee camp</a> in southern Lebanon this week, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.</p><p>A drone hit a car on Tuesday in the car park of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run NNA reported.</p><p>Israel and the United States have been piling the pressure on Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>The Lebanese military issued a plan that the government approved in September that would disarm Hezbollah across the country by the end of the year.

Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.</p><p>The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.</p><p>The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.</p><p>Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.</p><p>What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.</p><p>Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.</p><p>That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.</p><p>It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.</p><p>The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.</p><p>Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.</p><p>It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p><p>To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.</p><p>The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.</p><p>But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.</p><p>He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.</p><p>A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.</p><p>The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

and its western allies.</p><p class=\"s3\">The Specialized Criminal Court in the capital Sanaa handed down the sentences on Saturday morning in the cases of “espionage cells within a spy network affiliated with American, Israeli, and Saudi intelligence”, Houthi-run media said.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"s3\">The court sentenced the 17 men to execution “to be carried out in a public place as a deterrent”, Saba and other outlets said, also publishing a list of names.</p><p class=\"s3\">A woman and a man were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while another man was acquitted of all charges, bringing the total number of people put on trial in this case to 20.</p><p class=\"s3\">Houthi-run media said state prosecutors had charged the defendants, who can theoretically appeal the sentences, with “espionage for foreign countries hostile to Yemen” in 2024 and 2025, which also included the United Kingdom.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel’s Mossad spying agency reportedly “directed” intelligence officers who were in contact with the accused Yemeni citizens, whose work allegedly “led to the targeting of several military, security, and civilian sites and resulting in the killing of dozens and the destruction of extensive infrastructure”.</p><p class=\"s3\">The United States and the UK <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/uk-joins-latest-us-air-strikes-in\">conducted dozens of deadly joint air strikes</a> across Yemen after the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, as the Houthis launched attacks on Israel and international maritime transit through the Red Sea in a stated attempt to support Palestinians under fire.</p><p class=\"s3\">The Houthis have stopped their attacks since last month’s Gaza ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel has also unleashed huge air attacks on Yemen and its infrastructure, repeatedly hitting fuel tanks, power stations and a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/21/israel-says-it-has-attacked-houthi-targets-in-yemens-hodeidah-port\">critical port city</a> where desperately needed humanitarian aid flows through, killing political leaders and dozens of civilians.</p><p>In August, the Houthis confirmed that an Israeli air raid killed the prime minister of their government in Sanaa.</p><p>Ahmed al-Rahawi was killed with “several” other ministers, the Houthis said in a statement at the time.</p><p class=\"s3\">Houthi authorities, who control Sanaa and parts of Yemen to the north after an armed takeover more than a decade ago, made no mention of any links with the United Nations or other international agencies in the cases announced Saturday.</p><p class=\"s3\">But they have, over the past year, increasingly raided UN and NGO offices, detaining dozens of mostly local but also international staff and confiscating equipment.</p><p class=\"s3\">Amid condemnation and calls for the release of staff by the UN and international stakeholders, the Houthis have framed the efforts as necessary to stave off Israeli

IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEY SAID!”</p><p>The latest post came after Trump caused a firestorm on Thursday when he appeared to call for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/punishable-by-death-trump-threatens-democrats-with-sedition-charges\">the death penalty</a> for the Democrats in the video.</p><p>“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The 90-second video was first posted on Tuesday by Senator Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer.

You can refuse illegal orders,” they say.</p><p>The Democratic legislators did not specify which illegal orders members of the military should refuse. But their message coincided with Trump’s effort to deploy <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/on-edge-trumps-military-deployment-in-us-capital-sparks-fear-confusion\">federal forces</a> to several Democratic-led US cities.</p><p>Trump’s invoking of the death penalty prompted condemnation from Democrats, with critics accusing the president of calling for killing the lawmakers.</p><p>“There’s no other way to explain it than to say that emphatically the president has put our lives in danger,” Chrissy Houlahan, one of the Democrats who appeared in the video,  told CNN on Thursday.</p><p>“He directly, literally said that we were seditious and traitors and literally said that we should be hung. So there’s no other way to interpret that other than a call for our death.”</p><p>The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Charlie Kirk</a> in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite the outcry over his earlier comments about the death penalty, Trump appeared undeterred by the criticism.</p><p>“MANY GREAT LEGAL SCHOLARS AGREE THAT THE DEMOCRAT TRAITORS THAT TOLD THE MILITARY TO DISOBEY MY ORDERS, AS PRESIDENT, HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME OF SERIOUS PROPORTION,” he wrote on Saturday.</p><p>The president serves as the commander-in-chief of the US military, and the law requires officers to follow the orders of their superiors.</p><p>But some legal scholars have highlighted that the service members swear an oath to the Constitution, and that the Uniform Code of Military Justice – which applies to all active duty officers – only details penalties for members who disobey “lawful orders”.</p><p>Moreover, the laws of war do not offer legal protection for soldiers who follow illegal orders.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross database of international humanitarian law says “manifestly unlawful” orders “must be disobeyed”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
