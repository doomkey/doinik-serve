Most of these funds have been earmarked for US weapons manufacturers.</p><h2 id=\"what-demands-did-democrats-make-regarding-venezuela-operations\">What demands did Democrats make regarding Venezuela operations?</h2><p>Since early September, the US has engaged in a series of aerial strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug trafficking operations in the Caribbean Sea. About 90 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes.</p><p>But lawmakers have grown increasingly sceptical about the boat strikes and their legality – many have expressed concern that the operation’s end game is, in fact, to oust Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2013/4/3/profile-nicolas-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>Many legal experts say targeting vessels in international waters <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">likely violates</a> US and international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.</p><p>On Tuesday, Hegseth visited Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers about the US military operation in international waters near Venezuela. Reactions to the briefing were mixed, with most Republicans supporting the campaign and Democrats voicing unease, arguing they lacked sufficient information.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><span>Representatives from both parties, therefore, agreed to freeze 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel funds until he submits unedited footage </span>of attacks off the coast of Venezuela – along with strike authorisation orders – to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.</p><p>Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the Navy officer who ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">“double-tap” strike</a> – a second hit on a boat which had already been destroyed and which killed two survivors in the water in September – testified in a classified session before the committees on Wednesday, which did include video footage of the incident.</p><p>Democrats, however, are demanding that portions of the footage be released publicly and that all members of Congress be granted access to the full video.</p><p>“The American people absolutely need to see this video,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.</p><p>“I think they would be shocked.”</p><h2 id=\"does-this-bill-assuage-democrat-fears-about-a-potential-war\">Does this bill assuage Democrat fears about a potential war?</h2><p>Not really. While the NDAA has strengthened legislative oversight over recent military operations in Venezuela, many lawmakers continue to worry about <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-orders-total-blockade-of-sanctioned-venezuelan-oil-tankers\">growing tensions</a> between Washington and Caracas.</p><p>“The Constitution vests this body with authority over matters of war and peace. That power has too often been ceded to the executive branch,” Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks said on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</p><p>“Congress must make clear to all of us that no president can unilaterally draw the United States into a conflict,” he added.</p><p>“It’s easy to get into a war. It’s hard as hell to get out of war,” Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern warned. “I’ve been around long enough to hear representatives of both parties talk about war as something simple, ‘You can get into it. We get out of it easy. No big deal.’ That’s never happened.</p><p>“Even the Pentagon says it will be very, very complicated to topple Maduro,” he said.</p><p>Furthermore, the bill was passed on the same night that a Democrat-led resolution requiring explicit congressional approval for US military action in Venezuela was voted down. Introduced by lawmakers including McGovern and Meeks, the measure reflected concern that Trump’s strikes risk sliding into an undeclared war.</p><p>While the Constitution does give Congress sole authority to declare war, presidents have been known to act under broader authorities. The Democrat bill aimed to close that gap. Its defeat leaves the administration wide latitude to continue operations without new congressional consent, Democrats fear.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Last month, their alliance won the Bihar legislative <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/bihar-2025-election-result-who-won-who-lost-why-it-matters\">assembly election</a>, in which the BJP emerged as the single largest party for the first time.</p><p>The video was first posted on X by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), a political party opposed to the Modi-Kumar coalition.</p><p>“What has happened to Nitish ji [“ji” is an honorific in Hindi]? Has his mental condition completely deteriorated, or has Nitish ‘Babu’ [another Hindi honorific] now become 100 percent Sanghi?” the RJD asked in its post.</p><p>Sanghi refers to a person affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a 100-year-old secretive far-right organisation that aims to turn a constitutionally secular India into an ethnic Hindu state. Modi and most other BJP leaders are lifetime members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of what is referred to as the Sangh Parivar (or Sangh Family), with hundreds of Hindu organisations working under its umbrella.</p><p>The BJP and its allies have long <a href=\"/news/2022/2/15/what-lies-beneath-the-indias-hijab-ban-row\">campaigned against</a> the use of hijab by Muslim women. In 2022, the then-BJP government in the southern state of Karnataka banned hijab in classrooms, triggering a huge protest by the Muslim community. Later that year, a two-judge Supreme Court bench delivered a <a href=\"/news/2022/10/13/indias-supreme-court-panel-split-on-allowing-hijab-in-classrooms\">split verdict</a> in the case, which meant the debate and politics over hijab continued in the country of 200 million Muslims. Several Hindu groups have demanded a <a href=\"/news/2022/3/16/india-hindu-groups-muslims-wider-ban-hijab-karnataka-court-verdict\">nationwide ban</a> on hijab.</p><p>Nearly 18 percent of Bihar’s 127 million residents are Muslim.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Opposition parties and Muslim groups have condemned Kumar’s action and demanded his resignation.</p><p>“This is Bihar’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. A female doctor had come to collect her appointment letter, and Nitish Kumar pulled off her hijab. A man occupying the highest position in Bihar is openly indulging in such a vile act. Think about it – how safe will women be in the state? Nitish Kumar should immediately resign for this disgusting behaviour,” the main opposition Congress party posted on X.</p><p>On Wednesday, members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), a political party representing Muslims and other minorities, held a protest in Mumbai and demanded that criminal charges be filed against Kumar.</p><p>“A Muslim woman has been dishonoured,” shouted a protesting woman as she was dragged away by a group of police officers, according to a report by the Press Trust of India news agency. “Nitish Kumar should resign,” said another member there, wearing a hijab.</p><p></p><p>Zaira Wasim, a former actor from Indian-administered Kashmir, demanded an “unconditional apology” from Kumar. “A woman’s dignity and modesty are not props to toy with,” she posted on X. “Power does not grant permission to violate boundaries.”</p><p>Even the foreign minister of neighbouring Pakistan spoke out, calling the incident “shameful” and “extremely disturbing”.</p><p>“Such acts underscore the imperative to safeguard minority rights and to address the troubling rise of Islamophobia. Respect for women and religious beliefs must remain fundamental and non-negotiable principles in every society,” Ishaq Dar posted on X on Wednesday.</p><p>Kumar has not yet responded to the criticism. On Thursday, his party, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U), posted on X that the chief minister has always “supported the minorities” during his multiple tenures.</p><p>“The minorities are safe and secure in the Nitish government,” the party wrote, without referring to Monday’s incident.</p><p>In a statement emailed to Al Jazeera, Aakar Patel, India head of rights group Amnesty International, said Kumar’s act was “an assault on this woman’s dignity, autonomy, and identity”.</p><p>“When a public official forcibly pulls down a woman’s hijab, it sends a message to the general public that this behaviour is acceptable. No one has the right to police a woman’s faith or clothing,” he said.</p><p>“Such actions deepen fear, normalise discrimination, and erode the very foundations of equality and freedom of religion. This violation demands unequivocal condemnation and accountability. Urgent steps must be taken to ensure that no woman is subjected to such degrading treatment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property.”</p><p>He added: “These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.”</p><p></p><p>Miller also shared a screenshot of a Truth Social post from Trump on Tuesday, in which he accused Venezuela of “stealing” US oil, land and other assets, and using that oil to fund crime, terrorism and human trafficking.</p><p>In the post, Trump declared Venezuela’s government a “foreign terrorist organisation” and ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-orders-total-blockade-of-sanctioned-venezuelan-oil-tankers\">total blockade</a> of all sanctioned oil tankers going in or out of the country.</p><p>Trump added that migrants sent by Venezuela are being deported quickly and demanded that all “stolen assets” be returned to the US immediately.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4182000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4182000\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4182000\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-24T215209Z_471939770_RC2KIHAET3AR_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1766052734.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Miller\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4182000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Miller speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington, DC, on October 24, 2025 [Kylie Cooper/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-does-venezuela-have\">How much oil does Venezuela have?</h2><p>Today, Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a vast region in the eastern part of the country stretching across roughly 55,000 square kilometres (21,235sq miles).</p><p>While the country is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels (Bbbl) as of 2023 – it earns <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">only a fraction</a> of the revenue it once did from exporting crude.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn), and Russia ($122bn).</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925817\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-does-the-us-believe-it-has-a-claim-to-venezuelan-oil\">Why does the US believe it has a claim to Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>US companies began drilling for oil in Venezuela in the early 1900s.</p><p>In 1922, vast petroleum reserves were initially discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in Venezuela’s Lake Maracaibo, in Zulia state, northwestern Venezuela.</p><p>At this point, the US ramped up its investment in the extraction and development of Venezuelan oil reserves. Companies such as Standard Oil led development under concession agreements, propelling Venezuela to a position as a key global supplier, especially for the US.</p><p>Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC, joining at its creation on September 14, 1960. OPEC is a group of major oil-exporting countries that work together to manage supply and influence global oil prices.</p><p>That began to wind up when Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 under then-President Carlos Andres Perez amid the oil boom. He established the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to control all oil resources.</p><p>Venezuela continued to be a major oil exporter to the US for some years, supplying 1.5 – 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But after Hugo Chavez took office in 1998, he nationalised all oil assets, seized foreign-owned assets, restructured PDVSA and prioritised political goals over exports, leading to declining production alongside mismanagement and underinvestment.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-the-us-impose-sanctions-on-venezuela\">When did the US impose sanctions on Venezuela?</h2><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in retaliation for nationalising oil assets in 2005.</p><p>Under US sanctions, named individuals and companies are barred from accessing any property or financial assets held in the US. They cannot access US bank accounts, sell their property, or access their money if it passes through the US financial system.</p><p>Any US companies or citizens doing business with any sanctioned individual or company will be penalised and risk becoming subject to enforcement actions.</p><p>The sanctions extend beyond the individuals on the list. Any entity that is owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more of the blocked people is also sanctioned as well, even if that company isn’t explicitly named.</p><p>Under President Nicolas Maduro, the US imposed more sanctions in 2017 and tightened them again in 2019. This further restricted sales to the US and access for Venezuelan companies to global finance. As a result, oil exports to the US nearly stopped, and Venezuela shifted its trade mainly to China, with some sales to India and Cuba.</p><p>Last week, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-family-venezuelan-tankers-what-we-know\">imposed yet more sanctions</a> – this time on Maduro family members and on Venezuelan tankers carrying sanctioned oil.</p><p>Today, PDVSA controls the petroleum industry in Venezuela, and US involvement in Venezuelan oil drilling is limited. Houston-based Chevron is the only US company that still operates in Venezuela.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire for the US to regain control of Venezuela’s oil.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4182041\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4182041\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4182041\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2251601503-1766053562.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Lake Maracaibo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4182041\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A commercial container ship sails on Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, where oil was discovered in 1922 [Jose Bula Urrutia/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-any-legal-basis-to-us-claims-on-venezuelan-oil\">Is there any legal basis to US claims on Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>No. International law is clear that sovereign states own the natural resources within their territories under the principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources (PSNR).</p><p>This means that sovereign states have the inherent right to control, use and dispose of their resources for their own development.</p><p>The concept of PSNR emerged after 1945 during the decolonisation of former European colonies. It was solidified by the United Nations General Assembly in a resolution adopted in December 1962.</p><p>Under this law, therefore, Venezuela owns its oil. It would be illegal under international law for the US to lay claim to it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-does-chevron-continue-to-operate-there\">Why does Chevron continue to operate there?</h2><p>Foreign oil companies are not permitted to own oil fields outright in Venezuela, so US oil group Chevron pays PDVSA a percentage of its output under a joint operation, which accounts for about one-fifth of Venezuela’s official oil production.</p><p>This setup allows PDVSA to earn revenues from oil without directly selling to US buyers, which sanctions restrict, giving Venezuela an incentive to continue allowing Chevron to operate.</p><p>To get around US restrictions, Chevron was granted a special licence by US President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate outside US sanctions. The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year.</p><p>Chevron increased shipments of Venezuelan oil from 128,000bpd in October this year to 150,000bpd last month.</p><p>Chevron has been operating in Venezuela for decades and has billions of dollars in assets there in the form of oil fields, facilities and infrastructure. If it were to withdraw from Venezuela, it would run a high risk of losing those assets forever, as Venezuela could seize them.</p><p>In the past, the Chavez and Maduro administrations have seized private assets when hundreds of companies were nationalised, including parts of foreign companies such as Exxon, Cargill and Hilton.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then in June, when Hasina was 16, her teacher announced the school’s funding had been cut. The school was closing. In an instant, both her education and childhood vanished.</p><p>With educational opportunities eliminated and her family fearing worsening conditions from aid reductions, Hasina – like hundreds of other underage girls – was quickly married off. Many, including Hasina, now endure abuse from their husbands.</p><p>“I dreamed of being something, of working for the community,” Hasina says softly. The The Associated Press news agency is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. “My life is destroyed.”</p><p>In a sweltering building near her cramped shelter, Hasina nervously fidgets with her pink phone case marked “Forever Young”. Though still young, the aid cuts forced her prematurely into adulthood – and horror. Soon after marriage, her husband isolated her from her family and began physically and sexually abusing her. She constantly dreams of school, where she excelled in English and aspired to become a teacher. Now she’s largely confined to her shelter, performing domestic duties while dreading the next assault.</p><p>She would escape, if possible, but has nowhere to go. Return to Myanmar is impossible, with the military responsible for the 2017 genocide still controlling her homeland. Her husband now controls her future, though she no longer envisions one.</p><p>“If the school hadn’t closed,” she says, “I wouldn’t be trapped in this life.”</p><p>The situation has become increasingly dangerous for the 600,000 children in these overcrowded camps. UNICEF reports that child violations have surged this year, with abduction and kidnapping cases more than quadrupling to 560 compared with last year. Reports of armed groups recruiting children have increased eightfold, affecting 817 children.</p><p>In the Bangladesh camps, the US has reduced funding by nearly half compared with last year, while the overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50 percent funded for 2025. Although UNICEF has repurposed some remaining funds to reopen most of its learning centres, many schools run by other aid organisations remain closed, leaving thousands of children without education.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Amid the devastation left by Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, she simply wasn’t able to keep him warm enough.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“I can still hear his tiny cries in my ears,” Eman tells Al Jazeera, the pain visible on her face. “I sleep and drift off, unable to believe that his crying and waking me at night will never happen again.”</p><p>The family’s tragedy began late on the night of December 13 in al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, where they had moved to after being displaced from their home in the east of Khan Younis.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181472\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181472\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A3837-1766042141.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Baby Mohammed freezes to death as Gaza battles winter and displacement\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mother Eman Abu Al-Khair and her two-year-old daughter Mona checking baby Mohammed’s clothes bag after his death [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Eman put her baby to sleep, then woke later to check on him and found him in an alarming condition.</p><p><a href=\"/gallery/2025/12/16/winter-storms-plague-palestinians-left-in-desperate-need-of-aid-by-gaza-war\">Temperatures had dropped</a>, and without <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/whats-causing-gazas-war-damaged-homes-to-collapse-in-winter\">proper shelter</a> or clothing for a newborn, there was no protection for Mohammed.</p><p>“His body was cold as ice. His hands and feet were frozen, his face stiff and yellowish, and he was barely breathing,” she recalls.</p><p>“I woke my husband immediately so we could take him to the hospital, but he couldn’t find any means of transportation to get us there.”</p><p>It was late at night, and <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/10/winter-storm-devastates-gaza-tents-amid-deepening-humanitarian-crisis\">heavy rain</a> was still pouring, making it impossible for the father to reach the hospital even on foot.</p><p>With no alternative, the family had to wait until the morning.</p><p>“As soon as daylight broke, we rushed with an animal-drawn cart towards the hospital,” Eman says. “But unfortunately, we arrived too late. His condition was already critical.”</p><p>Medical staff at the Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis were shocked by the infant’s deteriorated state. His face had turned completely blue, and he was convulsing, prompting doctors to rush him into the paediatric intensive care unit.</p><p>Mohammed spent two days in intensive care on a ventilator before he died on the morning of December 15.</p><p>“My baby had no medical problems. His tests showed no illness. His tiny body simply couldn’t withstand the extreme cold inside the tents,” Eman says, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>On Tuesday, Gaza’s Ministry of Health announced the death of an infant due to a severe drop in body temperature caused by extreme cold amid harsh living conditions brought on by the recent weather.</p><p>In a press statement, the ministry said that infant Mohammed Khalil Abu al-Khair, two weeks old, had died from acute hypothermia.</p><p>“The child, Abu al-Khair, arrived at the hospital two days ago and was admitted to the intensive care unit, but he passed away yesterday,” the statement said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181466\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181466\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181466\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A3755-1766042121.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Baby Mohammed freezes to death as Gaza battles winter and displacement\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Medical report of baby Mohammed, describing his deteriorating condition upon hospital admission two days before his death [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>With Mohammed’s death, the number of children who have died from the cold weather in Gaza has risen to four this month, after the ministry announced three similar deaths during the previous week.</p><h2 id=\"celebration-turned-to-devastation\">Celebration turned to devastation</h2><p>The Abu al-Khair family had welcomed the birth of Mohammed on December 1 in an atmosphere of joy and celebration after a gruelling pregnancy that, as ِِEman describes, was filled with hardship, with the war still ongoing.</p><p>“My pregnancy was extremely difficult. We went through very hard conditions and famine, and I was exhausted,” she says.</p><p>“But all my suffering faded when Mohammed was born healthy and well. I never imagined we would lose him after just two weeks.”</p><p>Eman recounts her desperate attempts to keep her newborn warm using every piece of clothing and the blankets she had, while the baby’s father, Khalil, tried to secure the tent and seal every opening to protect the baby from the cold.</p><p>But all their efforts were in vain.</p><p>“We’re living in tents on the street, as you can see. What can a piece of cloth or nylon really do?” she says, pointing around the tent.</p><p>“The cold is indescribable. Every morning, we wake up to find water flooding our bedding from underneath.”</p><p>Baby Mohammed was Eman and Khalil’s second child, after their two-year-old daughter, Mona, who had grown up during the war, which began in October 2023.</p><p>“When we returned from the burial, little Mona came to me asking, ‘Where is the baby?’ Every moment she asks where her little brother went, and her question kills me,” Eman says as she holds her daughter and cries.</p><p>Eman wonders what crime her baby, and other children his age, have committed to deserve what she describes as the “cruel” fate of a life of misery inside tents.</p><p>“Our children have died in every possible way: bombing, snipers, hunger, cold, one after another. My child is not the first, and he will not be the last.”</p><h2 id=\"not-a-life\">‘Not a life’</h2><p>Munir al-Bursh, the director general of Gaza’s Ministry of Health, has warned of further deaths among children, the elderly and the sick due to plummeting temperatures inside rain-soaked displacement tents.</p><p>Al-Bursh said that moisture and standing water inside tents create an environment ripe for the spread of respiratory diseases among displaced people, while patients are unable to access any form of healthcare.</p><p>Despite the start of a ceasefire in October, little reconstruction has taken place in Gaza, where the majority of residential buildings have been destroyed by Israeli bombing and systematic demolition.</p><p>Israel has also continued to attack Gaza on a regular basis and shows little sign that it is willing to allow real reconstruction to begin, at least in the near term.</p><p>That means that the conditions that led to Mohammed’s death are likely to continue.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A3950-1766042152.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Baby Mohammed freezes to death as Gaza battles winter and displacement\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The family lives in a tent made of fabric and nylon in Khan Younis’ camps after their displacement a year ago and the destruction of their home [Abdelhakim Abu Riash, Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>And the tragic loss of her baby has left Eman obsessed with fear for the life of her two-year-old daughter.</p><p>“I over-warm her, cover her with everything I have, and I never sleep. I check on her constantly. I feel a fire burning in my heart,” she says.</p><p>Caught between trying to console herself and clinging to patience, Eman wonders how long conditions in Gaza will continue to deteriorate to this extent.</p><p>“This is not a life. Sadly, the reality looks like it will continue this way for 10 more years,” she says.</p><p>“We want a dignified life for our children, nothing more. Where are the caravans? Where are the housing units? Why is no one moving to save us?”</p></div></div></body></html>"
