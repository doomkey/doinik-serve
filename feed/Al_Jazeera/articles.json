Fires have consumed forests, ravaged villages and damaged or destroyed at least 25 homes, with emergency officials warning that the blaze remains out of control.</p><p>“All of the nation’s resources are mobilised,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a post on X, urging people to act with “the utmost caution”.</p><p>More than 1,800 firefighters have been sent to battle the flames, backed by 600 vehicles and water-dropping aircraft.</p><p>“We have at our disposal in the Aude department the maximum number of personnel and resources that we can have in the south of France in its entirety,” said Remi Recio, deputy prefect of Narbonne.</p><p>An elderly woman who refused to evacuate was killed, while another person is missing. Two civilians were injured, including one in critical condition with burns, and seven firefighters suffered smoke inhalation.</p><p>Camping grounds and at least one village were partially evacuated, and roads were closed. “I left everything behind me,” said David Cerdan, 51, who fled the village of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse. “I’m putting it into perspective. I only have material damage.”</p><p>Officials say the fire has already consumed as much land as all French wildfires in 2024 combined – more than double that of 2023. “The fire is advancing in an area where all the conditions are ripe for it to progress,” said fire official Roesch. “This fire will keep us busy for several days. It’s a long-term operation.”</p><p>An investigation into the cause is under way. France’s environment ministry said drought conditions and dry vegetation contributed to the spread, with water restrictions already in place in the Aude region.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The risk of fire is greatest in the Mediterranean,” said climate and agriculture analyst Serge Zaka. “In France, it is the hottest and driest area. But with climate change, these fire risks are expected to become more significant during the summer.”</p><p>Last month, a blaze near Marseille injured about 300 people. Scientists warn that climate change is driving more intense heat and dryness across Europe, the world’s fastest-warming continent.</p><h2 id=\"spain-and-portugal-face-heat-driven-blazes\">Spain and Portugal face heat-driven blazes</h2><p>In Spain, a prolonged heatwave since Sunday – with temperatures reaching 43C (109F) – has helped fan multiple wildfires across the country.</p><p>The resort town of Tarifa in Andalusia saw more than 1,500 people and 5,000 vehicles evacuated after a fire broke out near La Pena, a wooded area close to the beach. The fire, believed to have started in a camper van, was rapidly spread by strong winds.</p><p>“What concerns us most right now is the wind, whether it shifts between the west and east,” said Antonio Sanz, Andalusia’s interior minister.</p><p>Fire crews worked through the night to keep flames away from hotels and tourist accommodation, but the blaze remains active, and residents have not been allowed to return.</p><p>Elsewhere, a fire near Ponteceso in the Galicia region forced the evacuation of Corme Aldea village. In Cadiz, a blaze that erupted Tuesday led to mass evacuations, according to state broadcaster RTVE.</p><p>The Spanish meteorological agency AEMET has issued orange alerts across several regions through Friday. Civil protection authorities warn of “high” or “extreme” fire risk in much of the country.</p><p>Spain’s Ministry of Health reported 1,060 excess deaths linked to extreme heat in July, a 57 percent increase over the same month last year, based on data from the national mortality monitoring system. While the data does not confirm direct causation, it is widely used to estimate heat-related deaths.</p><p>In neighbouring Portugal, wildfires have already burned more than 42,000 hectares (104,000 acres) in 2025 – the largest area since 2022 and eight times more than this time last year. More than half of that land was scorched in just the past two weeks.</p><p>Firefighters managed to bring a large blaze under control near Vila Real in the north on Wednesday, but others remain active. A fire in the city of Amarante continued to burn, while another in A Coruna reached emergency level 2 due to its proximity to populated areas.</p><p>Lisbon declared a state of alert until August 7, with more than 100 municipalities on maximum fire risk amid soaring temperatures.</p><p>Scientists say Southern Europe is on the front line of climate breakdown. Rising global temperatures are creating the conditions for longer and more destructive fire seasons.</p></div></div></body></html>"

During Trump’s first term in 2019, the president went so far as to host a dedicated Texas rally for the Indian prime minister, calling the event “Howdy Modi”.</p><p>Modi, for his part, has embraced Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, offering his own spin on the slogan: “Make India Great Again”.</p><p>But Trump has been outspoken in his belief that India’s economic practices are unfair to the US, and he has pledged to reduce trade deficits with foreign trading partners overall.</p><p>According to US government trade <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistics</a>, India exported nearly $87.3bn in goods and services to the US in 2024, dwarfing the amount of US exports to India, which totalled $41.5bn.</p><p>Relations have further been strained by Trump’s claim that he brokered a peace between India and Pakistan after an armed standoff in May. Modi has denied any such foreign involvement.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-to-end-ukraine-war\">Pressure to end Ukraine war</h2><p>Trump has also grown increasingly frustrated with Russia, despite his previously warm relationship with that country’s president, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Upon taking office for a second term, Trump positioned himself as a “peacemaker”. He had previously pledged to end the war between Russia and Ukraine within 24 hours if re-elected, a pledge he has since walked back, saying it was meant to be “sarcastic”.</p><p>But Trump has pressed forward with peace negotiations between the two countries. But with no ceasefire in sight, Trump announced in July a deadline for Russia to wind down its military campaign — a deadline that expires on Wednesday.</p><p>Russia first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the war has since become a costly, slow-grinding conflict.</p><p>In his executive order on Wednesday, Trump left open the possibility that other importers of Russian oil products could be subject to higher tariffs, just as India had.</p><p>He also reserved the right to “modify” the executive order if any retaliatory action were taken, or if countries like India “take significant steps” to align with US policy goals.</p><p>The tariff announcement followed meetings taken by Trump’s top diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow aimed at pushing Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine.</p><p>Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval was likewise in Russia this week, with Reuters reporting that he was discussing the pressure to end Indian purchases of Russian petrol.</p><p>Reporting from outside the White House, Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett pointed out that other countries besides India have continued to import Russian oil products, but they were absent from Trump’s executive order.</p><p>China, for instance, remains the top buyer of Russian oil, and Turkiye is its third largest consumer.</p><p>“There is a list of countries that buy Russian oil. India’s number two, and China number one,” Halkett explained.</p><p>“ The United States, even the European Union, buy from Russia themselves. They buy fertilisers. So what is it about India?  Well, India’s buying it at a very steep discount from Russia, this oil and gas. They say it’s to meet their commercial needs for the more than 1.4 billion living in the country.”</p><p>But Halkett explained that Trump officials perceive that specific trade to be a threat to US national security.</p><p>“ They see this as a threat to US interests because this is funding directly the Russian war machine, just as the United States is trying to wind down Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Halkett said.</p><p>“ So this, in the eyes of the United States, is counter to US interests, and India is the biggest offender in their eyes at this moment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"396\">In September 2025, I am supposed to start a new life, not in war-torn Gaza, but in a lecture hall in the United Kingdom. After nearly a year of endless efforts, applications, exams, and navigating bombings, displacement and blackout zones just to apply, I was accepted. Not once, but five times, by the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Exeter, and Ulster. I even secured funding.</p><p data-start=\"398\" data-end=\"1081\">But instead of boarding a plane, I remain trapped in Gaza, a place where war has flattened homes, stolen futures and caged dreams. The bombs have not stopped. Neither has our will. Unlike students in other war-torn areas, we, Gaza Palestinian students, are not being offered any path out. Many countries, such as France, Ireland and Italy, have successfully evacuated their students through government-coordinated efforts and humanitarian corridors, like via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). These governments made it clear that their students matter. The UK has not. Despite its global standing and historic reputation for championing justice and education, it remains silent.</p><p data-start=\"1083\" data-end=\"1395\">This is not just my story. It is a collective cry from dozens of us, admitted to top British universities, with scholarships or personal savings, who survived bombs and sieges only to be abandoned at the final border: there is no visa centre in Gaza to submit fingerprints, and no route out without evacuation.</p><p data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"2120\">After the war broke out in late 2023, I was forced to pause my online university studies, as both the classes and the fees became impossible to maintain under the siege. But I did not give up on education. Instead, I began applying to UK universities through UCAS, a process that demanded a carefully written personal statement, recommendation letters, detailed documentation and weeks of waiting. I submitted everything using borrowed internet in relatives’ homes or from paid co-working spaces that I reached on foot, under the midday sun or pouring rain, with no transportation. There were days when I sat on a plastic chair in the street, emailing colleges and researching entry requirements while missiles flew overhead.</p><p data-start=\"2122\" data-end=\"2568\">When universities asked for English qualification submissions, I had no centre in Gaza to support me, not for training, not even to register. Most UK universities would not accept Duolingo, the only test I could afford and access online. So I stretched every resource and applied for each institution’s approved test, juggling freelance mobile programming by day to support myself and studying English by night, often under a mobile flashlight.</p><p data-start=\"2570\" data-end=\"2861\">Some tests required constant camera and microphone monitoring, difficult in a war zone where displacement, noise and unstable internet made focus nearly impossible. One infraction and the test would be void. My laptop battery often died before the test ended. But I endured and succeeded.</p><p data-start=\"2863\" data-end=\"3345\">My family shares this hunger for education. My brother is a mechanical engineer who won the competitive Qaddumi scholarship last year to begin a master’s programme at the University of Liverpool in January 2025, but it has been deferred. My sister was accepted into a Turkish government-funded medical programme at Samsun University, which was also postponed because of the war. Three of us, all with dreams and drive, are stuck in Gaza. We did everything right. So why are we left behind?</p><p data-start=\"3347\" data-end=\"3658\">After much struggle, I finally passed the tests and converted my conditional offers into unconditional ones. I even secured funding, enough for at least the first year’s tuition fees and living expenses. I was also promised support from private foundations, conditional only on submitting my visa application.</p><p data-start=\"3660\" data-end=\"4192\">But when I tried to apply for a visa, I hit a dead end: biometric fingerprints. The UK has no visa centre in Gaza. To complete the process, I would need to cross a border that is shut unless I am listed for evacuation. There are more than 100 Gazan students accepted to UK universities, 48 with full scholarships, who face the same deadlock. Many, like me, are running out of time. Inside the UK, institutions like the Gaza Scholarship Initiative (GSI) have stepped in to amplify our voice to the government because they believe in us.</p><p data-start=\"4194\" data-end=\"4400\">Some have carried their offers from 2024, after universities generously deferred their admission. Most universities, however, will not offer such flexibility again. For all of us, 2025 is our last chance.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Other countries acted.</p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Ireland coordinated directly with Israel to evacuate its students via the Karem Abu Salem (known to Israelis as Kerem Shalom) crossing. France and Italy did the same. Students were transported to nearby countries to finish visa processing and begin their studies. They understood the stakes, not just academic, but human. These governments coordinated with humanitarian agencies to get their students out, then facilitated visas and asylum claims.</p><p data-start=\"4839\" data-end=\"5152\">The UK has done nothing similar, despite numerous appeals from students, universities, advocacy groups like GSI, and members of parliament. We have written letters to MPs, university heads and the British Council. Even university leaders who support our admission cannot help unless the UK government steps in.</p><p data-start=\"5154\" data-end=\"5469\">This silence hurts most because it is not due to incapability. The UK can act but it simply chooses not to. If the government coordinated with Israeli authorities and humanitarian groups like the ICRC, students could be evacuated through Kerem Shalom into Egypt or Jordan, where they could finalise visas and travel.</p><p data-start=\"5471\" data-end=\"5594\">This is not speculative. It is exactly what other democratic nations have done. The difference? They cared enough to try.</p><p data-start=\"5596\" data-end=\"5644\">What does this say about whose futures matter?</p><p data-start=\"5646\" data-end=\"6091\">The UK has invested for decades in international education, offering prestigious scholarships like Chevening and the Commonwealth. It champions learning and opportunity and leads countless international partnerships. But when it comes to Gaza students, who embody that very ethos, we are being forgotten. What message does that send? Does our survival, our future, matter less? Are we invisible to the very system that welcomed us in writing?</p><p data-start=\"6093\" data-end=\"6365\">I still believe in British education. I am inspired by its professors, challenged by its rigour, and drawn to its diversity and values. I fought for my place there. I hope, not just for me but for my peers, that the UK government remembers its legacy and chooses to act.</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Because if not now, when?</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A few days later, on July 12, Acosta announced he had <a href=\"/video/2019/7/12/epstein-scandal-us-labor-secretary-acosta-to-resign\">resigned</a> as labour secretary, after Democratic leaders and presidential candidates called for him to do so.</p><p>On the day Acosta resigned, Khanna said Acosta should testify before the House oversight committee, and later that month Senator Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats who called on the Justice Department to make public the results of its review of Acosta’s handling of the Epstein case.</p><p>Also in July, the congressional Democratic Women’s Caucus requested that the House Oversight and Reform Committee open an investigation into how the Palm Beach, Florida Sheriff’s Office handled the Epstein investigation.</p><p>Days after Epstein’s August 2019 <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">death</a> in a Manhattan jail cell, Khanna posted his support for an investigation into the death, writing: “There are too many unanswered questions, and far too many who deserve closure, to leave this case unexamined.” Khanna attached to his post a link to a Daily Beast article that said bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to the FBI demanding answers about Epstein’s suicide.</p><p>Democrats continued their push for a plea deal investigation, writing multiple letters, including one to Trump’s then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another to the House judiciary and oversight committees.</p><p>Democrats, along with some Republicans, proposed legislation to prevent prosecutors from striking secret plea deals, and Democrats also sought records about the Epstein case from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</p><h2 id=\"2020-to-2024-focus-on-records\">2020 to 2024: Focus on records</h2><p>Democrats tried other tactics to obtain records, such as requesting them from a Palm Beach judge – a strategy spearheaded by the Palm Beach Post that can take years to succeed.</p><p>Some records emerged from civil lawsuits and the federal prosecution of <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/why-is-ghislaine-maxwell-so-central-to-trump-epstein-conspiracy-theories\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, who was convicted for her role in a scheme with Epstein to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When Maxwell was <a href=\"/news/2020/12/29/epstein-associate-ghislaine-maxwell-denied-bail-in-abuse-case\">charged</a> in 2020, Democrats continued to push for transparency.</p><p>Frankel told PolitiFact in an August 1 interview that the House oversight committee wanted to hold a hearing at which they would hear from Epstein victims, their lawyers and prosecutors. They wanted to subpoena the prosecutors to ask them under oath “why they gave this guy a slap on the wrist, who pressured them?” Frankel said.</p><p>However, “We were told by the Justice Department to cut it off” because it could compromise the Maxwell investigation, Frankel told PolitiFact.</p><p>After Biden <a href=\"/news/2021/1/20/joe-biden-sworn-in-as-president-of-the-united-states\">took office</a> in 2021, Democrats appeared to dial back their public calls for Epstein records’ release.</p><p>“Pushes for oversight and record releases were at times tempered by a need to respect both the victims’ pursuit of justice in courts and their fears of reprisals,” Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact. “As disclosures were denied or delayed, we did what lawmakers do and legislated to protect future victims.”</p><p>In February 2024, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a bill to allow the release of Epstein 2006 grand jury testimony after a similar effort failed in previous state legislative sessions. Frankel praised the legislation.</p><p>A Palm Beach judge released records in July 2024, which showed prosecutors had heard testimony about how Epstein sexually assaulted two teenage girls before they gave Epstein a plea deal. Frankel again repeated her push for an explanation.</p><p>In September 2024, Wasserman Schultz along with Representative Burgess Owens, introduced a bill, similar to earlier proposals, to require prosecutors to inform victims of such plea deals.

It targets travellers from countries with historically higher rates of visa overstays, according to the department’s temporary final rule published on August 5 in the Federal Register. If visitors comply with the terms of the bond, the amount will be refunded.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>On Tuesday, the State Department confirmed that visitors from Zambia and Malawi would be the first to be targeted under the new policy.</p><p>The rule follows a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries and other new fees being levied on US visitors.</p><p>The new rule targets citizens from countries with high visa overstays. It excludes visitors from Mexico, Canada and the more than 40 countries enrolled in the US Visa Waiver Program. That programme allows citizens to travel to the US for tourism or business for up to 90 days without a visa.</p><p>Here’s what else to know about the mechanics of the proposal and the history of the idea.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-visa-bond\">What is a visa bond?</h2><p>A visa bond is a financial guarantee that some countries require for certain foreign nationals applying for temporary visas to ensure visa holders adhere to the terms of their visa – particularly the length of stay.</p><p>Each year, the US grants thousands of temporary nonimmigrant visas to foreign students, tourists and workers. The visas can last from a few weeks to several years.</p><p>If a nonimmigrant remains in the US longer than their authorised period of admission, it’s known as a visa overstay.</p><p>Most countries require proof of funds for visas but don’t use a system where visitors have to post a refundable bond to enter. New Zealand previously had a visa bond policy to manage overstays, but it is no longer in effect. In 2013, the United Kingdom tried and subsequently scrapped a plan to require a bond on visitors from certain “high-risk” countries.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-are-the-bonds\">How much are the bonds?</h2><p>The proposed US bonds have three tiers: $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000.</p><p>The State Department notice said it expects about 2,000 visa applicants will need to post visa bonds during the programme.</p><p>“If the average bond is $10,000 (from options of $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000), the initial cost to aliens of bonds for 2,000 visa applicants will be $20,000,000,” the notice said.</p><p>Bond amounts will be set by consular officers who will also consider an applicant’s “personal circumstances,” including their reason for travel, employment, income, skills and education.</p><p>Consular officers will be able to request waivers in limited circumstances, the department said, such as travel for US government employees or urgent humanitarian needs.</p><h2 id=\"has-this-been-tried-before\">Has this been tried before?</h2><p>Trump’s State Department tried a visa bonds programme in 2020, but it was not fully implemented because of a decrease in global travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>State Department guidance historically discouraged consular officers from requiring visa bonds, because the process was “cumbersome” and could lead to misperceptions by the public, the State Department’s notice said.</p><p>However, the department said this view “is not supported by any recent examples or evidence, as visa bonds have not generally been required in any recent period, notwithstanding a 2020 pilot programme that did not provide any substantive data.”</p><p>The number of noncitizens who arrived on a visa with no matching departure data “demonstrates that hundreds of thousands of nonimmigrant visitors fail to timely depart in accord with the terms of their visitor visa,” the notice said, citing government reports since 2000.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-would-be-affected\">Which countries would be affected?</h2><p><a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/tourists-from-malawi-and-zambia-are-first-to-face-15000-visa-bonds-in-us\">Malawi and Zambia</a> are the first two countries subject to visa bonds, the State Department announced on August 5.</p><p>“Beginning August 20, nationals of Malawi and Zambia applying for B-1, B-2 business and tourist visas will be required to post a bond of up to $15,000,” Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokesperson, said.</p><p>Additional countries subject to the bond programme will be identified based on high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or countries that offer Citizenship by Investment. The department said the list may be revised throughout the programme.</p><p>Citizenship by Investment programmes essentially sell citizenship to noncitizens by having them invest in the country’s economy and have no residency requirement. Some countries with these programmes include Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Austria, Jordan, St Lucia and Turkiye.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-high-visa-overstay-rates\">Which countries have high visa overstay rates?</h2><p>In fiscal year 2023, numerous countries in Africa, as well as Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and Yemen, recorded the highest overstay rates for people visiting on B-1 and B-2 visas, a Department of Homeland Security Overstay Report found.</p><p>Many of the 12 countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban, including Chad and Eritrea, also have high rates of visa overstays.</p><h2 id=\"what-percentage-of-migrants-in-the-country-illegally-are-visa-overstays\">What percentage of migrants in the country illegally are visa overstays?</h2><p>In its report to Congress, the DHS said it anticipated 39 million departures for visa holders in fiscal year 2023; there were about 400,000 visa overstays that year.</p><p>Visa overstayers are estimated to account for a sizable proportion of migrants in the US illegally, which partly explains the increase in the country’s unauthorised migrant population, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.</p><p>Drawing on data from the 1990s, the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) concluded in 2002 that about 41 percent of migrants in the country illegally are visa overstayers. That figure became the most widely quoted percentage, echoed by politicians including John Carter, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.</p><p>In 2003, the INS reprocessed the data and estimated that 33 percent of the undocumented migrant population in the nation in 2000 had overstayed their visas.</p><p>In more recent years, the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank studying international migration, found that about 42 percent of the 2014 population in the country without proper documentation were overstayers. The centre cited this figure in 2024.</p><p>Identifying and tracking visa overstays remains tricky, especially as the nature and origin of border crossers have changed, Jeffrey Passel, a Pew Research Center senior demographer, said. “In simple terms, the way we make our estimates doesn’t take into account mode of entry and the underlying data doesn’t have this information either.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s a huge risk for civic society, activists, journalists and anyone who communicates on the internet.</p><p>Breaking encryption would be “disproportionate and dangerous,” Sulston added.</p><p>“We don’t expect the post office to open all letters and read them for illegal content – in fact, most countries have laws specifically against this,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

economies are facing new uncertainty from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, as his administration cracks down on exports directed through third countries to avoid his tariffs on China.</p><p>Under an executive order issued by Trump last week, goods imported into the US face a punitive 40 percent tariff, plus penalties and any applicable country-of-origin duties, if US Customs and Border Protection determines they have been “transshipped”.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4

4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>The tariff is set to go into effect on Thursday, along with Trump’s latest country-specific tariffs ranging from 10 to 41 percent.</p><p>While China is the main target of the new tax on transshipments, which applies to all redirected goods irrespective of country of origin, Southeast Asia could suffer much of the fallout because of the region’s highly integrated supply chains with Chinese manufacturers, trade experts say.</p><p>The fallout will depend on exactly how the Trump administration defines transshipments, which is still unclear, said Puan Yatim, an associate professor at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Graduate School of Business.</p><p>“If Washington maintains a narrow interpretation – targeting only those goods that are imported from China, minimally processed or relabeled and then re-exported to the US – the economic impact on ASEAN may be limited,” Yatim told Al Jazeera, referring to the Southeast Asian regional bloc.</p><p>“However, a broader and more punitive interpretation – where goods with any significant Chinese input are also deemed in violation – could prove economically devastating for countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Chinese manufacturers have for years been steadily expanding into Southeast Asia as part of a strategy known as “China Plus One”.</p><p>The strategy has helped Chinese firms avoid US tariffs, exploit cheaper labour, and diversify their supply chains – a particular concern during China’s COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>From 2020 to 2024, Chinese foreign direct investment into the 10 ASEAN nations grew from $7.1bn to $19.3bn, according to ASEAN data.</p><p>During the same period, exports from China to Southeast Asia rose from $385bn to $587bn, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>The surge in Chinese exports, including goods illegally mislabeled to conceal their origin in some cases, has placed Southeast Asia in the Trump administration’s crosshairs.</p><p>“[Companies] need intermediate imports from China to create products which get shipped to the US, but because companies have been embroiled in illegal transshipments in the region, there’s a huge bias in the Trump administration that ASEAN is the predominant channel,” Priyanka Kishore, principal economist at Asia Decoded in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A key example of trade that invoked Washington’s ire centred on the solar cell industry.</p><p>Following a years-long investigation, the US Department of Commerce in April announced tariffs of up to 3,500 percent on Southeast Asian manufacturers alleged to have illicitly exported Chinese goods.</p><p>Southeast Asia is now in a “sticky situation” where it must appease the US – the region’s top export market – while not alienating China, Kishore said.</p><p>Beijing has threatened to “resolutely take countermeasures” against countries that agree to trade deals with the US that go against its interests.</p><p>In May, Malaysia announced that it would no longer allow nongovernmental organisations such as chambers of commerce to issue certificates of origin, as part of its efforts to ensure the integrity of its exports.</p><p>Vietnam similarly agreed to a 40 percent transshipment tariff in a framework deal reached with the US in May, while Indonesia’s Trade Minister Budi Santoso said last month that his country was opposed to transshipping.</p><p>Despite Southeast Asian governments’ efforts to mollify the US, the transshipment tariff could create major compliance issues for the private sector, said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore.</p><p>A top concern will be how the US treats products made with components from multiple countries.</p><p>US tariffs are typically determined by the location where a product underwent “substantive transformation”, but if the Trump administration were to apply duties based on the presence of even small amounts of Chinese components, compliance and enforcement would be extremely difficult, Okun said.</p><p>“You’re going to have to be doing due diligence on supply chains that you never had to do before,” Okun told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The changes would “potentially redefine trade,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3875000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3875000\" class=\"wp-caption

Plus One competitive advantage with his tariffs on the region’s economies, said Richard Laub, CEO and cofounder of Dragon Sourcing, a global procurement service provider.</p><p>Under Trump’s latest tariffs, Singapore is subject to a 10 percent rate, while Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia are subject to rates of 19 or 20 percent – less than the 30 percent rate proposed for China under the White House’s latest tariff framework.</p><p>Trump’s transshipment tariff potentially eats into that advantage.</p><p>“A lot of the Chinese supply strategy has been to establish some kind of facility abroad with limited content, limited value, adding those facilities to basically circumvent those transshipments. I suspect that that will come to a standstill,” Laub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A Washington, DC-based consultant, who advises businesses on trade and supply chain issues in China, said he had observed a similar phenomenon, but to the detriment of US exporters.</p><p>“We are seeing [multinational corporations] from around the globe, particularly those that served the China market from the United States, doing more to localise supply chains for China in China,” the consultant told Al Jazeera, asking not to be named due his engagements with the US government.</p><p>Companies in sectors that rely on materials like foreign-sourced steel – which is subject to separate US tariffs – have found manufacturing becoming too expensive in the US and started moving manufacturing out of the country, the consultant said.</p><p>“This is a terrible outcome and the opposite of what the administration intends,” he said.</p><p>Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said despite the uncertainty, the direction of the policy in Washington is ambiguously bad for Southeast Asia.</p><p>“Clearly, the US is concerned about transshipments,” Marro told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Clearly, it is moving to crack down on them, and so for those investors, those companies, those governments that have staked their premise on things like China Plus One, we are now seeing a reassessment, and that is something which investors have to be integrating into their strategies.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
