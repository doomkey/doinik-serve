The DMZ proposals, he said, were part of a 20-point peace plan seeking the end of the Ukraine war, which Zelenskyy on Tuesday said was backed by the US.</p><p>Here is what we know about the plan, and whether demilitarised zones could work in Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-20-point-peace-plan\">What is the 20-point peace plan?</h2><p>Zelenskyy unveiled the plan in a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading aloud from a highlighted and annotated copy. The plan was negotiated between negotiators from Washington and Kyiv in Florida over the weekend.</p><p>Here’s where negotiations stand on key issues:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Ukraine’s NATO membership: </strong>Russia has insisted, from the start of the war, that it will not accept Ukraine as a part of NATO. The Trump administration, too, has made clear that Ukraine must give up its hopes of joining the North Atlantic military alliance. But Ukraine continues to resist pressure to introduce constitutional amendments, explicitly stating that it will stay neutral and not seek NATO membership. “It is the choice of NATO members whether to have Ukraine or not. Our choice has been made. We moved away from the proposed changes to the Constitution of Ukraine that would have prohibited Ukraine from joining NATO,” Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.</li>\n<li><strong>Territorial concessions: </strong>Zelenskyy said any proposal requiring Ukraine to withdraw its troops would have to be approved through a national referendum. Ukraine has repeatedly pointed to its constitution, which prevents the government from changing the country’s borders on its own. But many analysts believe that Ukraine might need to settle for a midway path – not recognising Russian-occupied regions officially, while acknowledging that it does not actually control them.</li>\n<li><strong>Elections: </strong>Zelenskyy said Ukraine will hold presidential elections only after a peace agreement is signed. US President Donald Trump has been pushing for elections in Ukraine, while Russia has cited the absence of elections during the war to question Zelenskyy’s legitimacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Demilitarised zones: </strong>Zelenskyy said any areas that Ukraine pulls out from will become DMZs, which he also called free trade zones. “They are looking for a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides,” he said on Tuesday, referring to US negotiators.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-proposed-dmzs-in-ukraine\">What are the proposed DMZs in Ukraine?</h2><p>Russia has demanded full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that constitute the Donbas, historically Ukraine’s industrial belt.</p><p>Its troops currently control almost all of Luhansk and 70 percent of Donetsk.</p><p>The latest proposal would involve Ukrainian soldiers pulling out of the remaining 30 percent of Luhansk – as long as Russia does not seek to occupy the region. Instead, that region is to become a DMZ.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russian troops are in control of a nuclear plant that Ukraine has tried – so far in vain – to get back.</p><p>The latest proposal suggests turning the region around the nuclear plant into a DMZ, too.</p><p>But it is unclear how the proposed DMZs – if both sides were to agree to them – will be governed, who might ensure that both sides play by the rules, and how resources there, such as the nuclear plant, could be shared.</p><p>“It’s a point in the plan that is supposed to satisfy both sides,” Marina Miron, an analyst at King’s College, London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“However, I don’t see how this is going to function because, in Ukraine Zelenskyy said that Russia would have to withdraw its forces, and we’re talking about the Donbas, and I don’t see that happening, especially if Russia is winning on the battlefield.”</p><p>Miron explained that Ukraine designating demilitarised zones in this peace plan was a tactic by Ukraine to signal that it was ready for peace, thereby pushing “the diplomatic burden on Russia”.</p><h2 id=\"has-russia-responded\">Has Russia responded?</h2><p>Moscow has not accepted or rejected the latest peace plan so far.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Russia was “formulating its position” on the plan. He did not comment on the specifics of the plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-other-demilitarised-zones-in-the-world\">What are other demilitarised zones in the world?</h2><p>Several DMZs exist all over the world. Some of them include:</p><h3>Korean Demilitarized Zone</h3><p>The Korean DMZ is a 4km- (2.5-mile)- wide buffer strip separating North Korea and South Korea.</p><p>It was established in 1953, after the <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/25/assassinations-nuclear-tests-hugs-70-years-of-the-korean-war\">Korean War</a> armistice was signed.</p><p>The Korean War had broken out in June 1950, when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel to invade South Korea in an attempt to reunify the peninsula.</p><p>Korea was temporarily divided at the 38th parallel by the US and the Soviet Union after World War II. This division placed the Soviet-backed Kim Il-Sung’s Workers’ Party in control of the North, and the US-supported Syngman Rhee government in the South.</p><p>The conflict lasted three years, with Soviet- and Chinese-backed northern troops fighting against US-led United Nations forces. It killed an estimated two million people and devastated cities and villages on both sides.</p><p>The war concluded with an armistice signed by the US, China, and North Korea, but South Korea refused to agree, and no formal peace treaty was ever concluded. More than 70 years later, the two Koreas remain technically at war.</p><h3>United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone in the Golan Heights</h3><p>The UN established a narrow strip of land as a DMZ in the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/29/what-is-the-golan-heights-and-who-controls-it\">Golan Heights</a> in 1974 after the war that year between Israel and Syria, following an armistice signed by the two countries.</p><p>The broader Golan Heights is a rocky patch of land, which under international law belongs to Syria. Israel captured it during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1982, in a move recognised only by the US.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2005/6/17/un-force-to-stay-in-golan-heights\">Observer Force Zone</a> separates Israeli-occupied territory from the remaining part that is still under Syria’s control. The zone is still monitored by UNDOF peacekeepers.</p><h3>Sinai Peninsula Demilitarised Zones</h3><p>DMZs were established in the Sinai Peninsula as part of the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. The peace treaty divided the Sinai Peninsula into four security zones with different military restrictions.</p><p>These zones are monitored by an international peacekeeping force called the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO).</p><h3>Aland Islands</h3><p>The Aland Islands are a small archipelago in the Baltic Sea, between Sweden and Finland. They are an autonomous, Swedish-speaking region of Finland.</p><p>They have been demilitarised since 1921, as per a decision by the now non-existent League of Nations. Finland and Sweden took the issue to the League because in the early 20th century, the islands were part of Finland, which gained independence from the Tsarist Russian Empire in 1917.</p><p>After this, many Alanders wanted to reunite with Sweden, which spurred tensions.</p><h3>Antarctica</h3><p>Antarctica has been established as a demilitarised zone under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.</p><p>This forbids military activity and nuclear testing, ensuring the continent is used exclusively for peaceful purposes and scientific research.</p><p>This is because several nations had made overlapping territorial claims in Antarctica, raising fears of future conflicts.</p><h3>Preah Vihear temple</h3><p>The Thailand-Cambodia border, shaped by French colonial-era delineation, contains ambiguous boundaries and overlapping claims.</p><p>These disputes have grown more contentious as both countries strengthened their institutions and the strategic value of certain areas increased.</p><p>One of the contested zones is the culturally significant Preah Vihear temple from the Khmer Empire, which is symbolically important to both nations. In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the temple belonged to Cambodia.</p><p>Disputes erupted from 2008 to 2011, marked by exchanges of artillery fire, mass displacements and duelling legal interpretations of the ICJ ruling.</p><p>In 2011, the ICJ ordered a provisional demilitarised zone around the temple.</p><h2 id=\"have-dmzs-worked-before\">Have DMZs worked before?</h2><p>DMZs have been considerably successful in some cases, such as in the case of Korea.</p><p>The zone between North and South Korea has prevented the two from large-scale military conflict.</p><p>On the other hand, violence broke out over the Preah Vihear temple between Thailand and Cambodia on December 7 this year, killing 40 people and displacing about a million, according to official counts. The two countries reported <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/new-clashes-as-cambodia-thailand-hold-first-talks-to-end-latest-violence\">new clashes</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>In other cases, such as in the Golan Heights or Sinai Peninsula, demilitarised zones have prevented direct, large-scale clashes.</p><p>However, Israel has repeatedly violated the Golan Heights buffer zone, especially over the past year, using the chaos following the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024 to grab territory and expel Syrian families. The UN has criticised Israel’s DMZ violations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has been in power since August 2024, following the ouster of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led uprising.

But he also drew allegations of cronyism, corruption and political violence. A military-backed caretaker government that held office between 2006 and early 2009 investigated those allegations.</p><p>In March 2007, he was arrested by army units that dramatically pulled up outside his luxury Dhaka house late at night. Months later, he was released on bail and flew to the United Kingdom for medical treatment  — not returning until Thursday.</p><p>Rahman and the BNP have consistently described the accusations against him as politically motivated, but his reputation for corruption extended beyond his political opponents. Rahman’s name popped up in leaked diplomatic cables, published by WikiLeaks in 2011, where American diplomat James F Moriarty <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-201716\">described him</a> as a symbol of “kleptocratic government and violent politics”.</p><p>Recommending blocking his entry into the United States, the American embassy in Dhaka wrote: “In short, much of what is wrong in Bangladesh can be blamed on Tarique and his cronies.”</p><p>He was subsequently convicted by the Awami League government on charges of money laundering, fraud and political violence – including a grenade attack on rival Hasina’s rally in 2004 that killed at least 20 people.</p><p>But after the August 2024 uprising against Hasina, the charges and convictions against Rahman have mostly been stayed or overturned, facilitating his return to Dhaka.</p><p>Addressing his supporters at a rally in Dhaka on Thursday, Rahman said, “Just like 1971, people from all walks of life, all together, defended the independence and sovereignty of this country in 2024,” referring to the country’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, and Hasina’s ouster last year.</p><p>He called for an inclusive Bangladesh, saying, “It is time for us all to build the country together. We want to build a safe Bangladesh.

The protests began as a campaign against a controversial affirmative-action policy for government jobs, but amid a brutal crackdown by security forces, escalated into wider demands for an end to her rule. The United Nations says up to 1,400 people were killed.</p><p>Anger grew over her iron-fisted 15-year leadership, during which thousands of political opponents and critics were arrested, killed, tortured or forcibly disappeared. In elections widely viewed as illegitimate, Hasina won landslides in 2014, 2018 and 2024.</p><p>Ultimately, protesters overran her residence after she fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, to India.</p><p>Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death by hanging after she was found guilty of crimes against humanity for ordering the deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising, by a tribunal. The Awami League, her party, has been barred from participating in the February elections.</p><p>Meanwhile, interim leader Yunus met Rahman during a visit to London in June.</p><p>Rahman has also returned at a time when his mother, Khaleda, is in hospital.

Bangladesh follows a first-past-the-post system in its elections, so in a multiparty contest, candidates do not need a majority to win.</p><p>The National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by a faction of student leaders after the uprising, has been struggling to convert street power into electoral strength due to weak organisation and limited funds. The party trails far behind the BNP, with just 6 percent support, according to the IRI poll.</p><p>With Hasina’s Awami League barred from participation in the election, Rahman’s BNP looks poised in a favourable electoral landscape for the post-Yunus period in Bangladesh.</p><p>Danilowicz, the former US diplomat, noted that the upcoming election is BNP’s to lose; “The party has demonstrated great resilience over the past 17 years; it has been out of government, with party leaders facing the full repressive force of the state,” he said.</p><p>Now, upon his return, Rahman also faces the weight of his own political legacy: “The challenge will be integrating [Rahman’s] small core of trusted lieutenants who stuck with him throughout his exile with the broader party apparatus that was assembled by his mother, and which remained in the country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But celebrations returned on Wednesday with parades and music. Hundreds of worshippers also gathered for mass at the Church of the Nativity on Wednesday night.</p><p class=\"p1\">With pews filled long before midnight, many stood or sat on the floor for the traditional mass to usher in Christmas Day.</p><p class=\"p1\">At 11:15 pm (21:15 GMT), organ music rang out as a procession of dozens of clergymen entered, followed by Jerusalem’s Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who blessed the crowd with signs of the cross.</p><p class=\"p1\">In his homily, Pizzaballa urged peace, hope and rebirth, saying the Nativity story still held relevance in the turbulence of modern times.</p><p class=\"p1\">He also spoke of his visit to Gaza over the weekend, where he said “suffering is still present” despite the ceasefire. In the Strip, hundreds of thousands of people face a bleak winter in makeshift tents.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The wounds are deep, yet I have to say, here too, there too, their proclamation of Christmas resounds,” Pizzaballa said. “When I met them, I was struck by their strength and desire to start over.”</p><p class=\"p1\">In Bethlehem, hundreds also took part in the parade down the narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square. As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity.</p><p class=\"p1\">The basilica dates back to the fourth century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bethlehem residents hoped the return of Christmas festivities would breathe life back into the city.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

place”, Petra said.</p><p>Syrian state broadcaster Al-Ikhbariah TV reported on its Telegram channel that the Jordanian army had carried out air strikes on locations in the southern and eastern countryside of Syria’s Suwayda governorate.</p><p>A resident of Syria’s Suwayda border region told the AFP news agency that the bombardment “was extremely intense and targeted farms and smuggling

attacks had been carried out previously in a bid to <a href=\"/news/2023/5/9/what-is-captagon-the-addictive-drug-mass-produced-in-syria\">stem the flow of captagon</a> – an addictive, amphetamine-type

both Lebanon and Damascus to ramp up efforts to combat the trade.</p><p>Although Damascus denied any involvement in the drug trade, analysts estimated that production and smuggling of captagon brought in billions of dollars for al-Assad, his associates and allies as they looked for an economic lifeline amid the civil war, which was fought between 2011 and the regime’s toppling last year.</p><p><img

The Israeli army also continued its military raids in <span>the occupied West Bank.</span></p><p>And even as the festive atmosphere lightened the mood in Manger Square, the reality of the war was not absent. Israeli military raids and checkpoints continued, with Israeli forces arresting three young men from the nearby refugee camps of Dheisheh and Aida just hours before the celebrations began.</p><p>Pizzaballa, who has just returned from Gaza, was quick to reference the suffering of Palestinians.</p><p>“In Gaza … I witnessed total destruction,” he said. “But amid Gaza’s destruction, I felt a passion for life. In the midst of nothingness, people created reasons for joy and celebration. They reminded us that we can return and rebuild again despite human destruction.”</p><p>“We will be able to celebrate in Gaza and Bethlehem,” Pizzaballa continued. “We will return to rebuild everything anew.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194655\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00010-1766614086.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24, on the occasion of Christmas.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24 [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tough-journey\">Tough journey</h2><p>About 1,500 people – both Palestinians and foreign visitors – attended the Christmas celebrations, which have become one of the biggest symbols of Christian life in the region, even as the percentage of Palestinian Christians living in the West Bank gets smaller as a result of the Israeli occupation, among other factors.</p><p>George Zalloum, from occupied East Jerusalem, was one of the Palestinian Christians who had made the journey to Bethlehem.</p><p>He told Al Jazeera that he was enjoying the atmosphere, but that it was tinged with sorrow.</p><p>“Today’s atmosphere is half joy and half sadness, because we have brothers who are still dying in Gaza due to the ongoing bombardment and killing there,” Zalloum told Al Jazeera. “We hope the war will end, the killing will stop, peace will prevail in the Holy Land, and that these holidays … will continue.”</p><p>Other Palestinians travelled to Bethlehem from cities and villages across the West Bank, but their journeys highlighted the difficulties placed on them by Israel.</p><p>Many waited for hours at checkpoints surrounding Bethlehem, even as the physical distance between their homes and the city was not long.</p><p>“It is true that the atmosphere of joy, love and peace has returned to us, but the road to Bethlehem was difficult,” said Hussam Zraiqat, who travelled to Manger Square from Birzeit, near Ramallah. “We spent a long time at an Israeli military checkpoint, but thank God, we arrived.”</p><p>That was echoed by another Palestinian attendee, Ghassan Rizqallah, from the village of Jifna, also near Ramallah.</p><p>“We faced the military checkpoint, where we waited for at least an hour and a half before we were able to enter the city,” Rizqallah said. “The journey was very difficult.”</p><p>But once he arrived, Rizqallah was overjoyed to experience the Christmas atmosphere. “Watching the scout bands and hearing the music takes us back to the beautiful past of our country, our land, and our heritage – and we deserve to live in safety and peace.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194659\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00003-1766614156.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian young women play drums\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christmas celebrations had been suspended in Bethlehem for the past two years because of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and raids in the occupied West Bank [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"vital-tourism\">Vital tourism</h2><p>Bethlehem’s mayor, Maher Canawati, said that the Manger Square celebrations carried a meaning that went beyond Bethlehem.</p><p>“Bethlehem’s message today is one of steadfastness and hope for the people of the city, for Gaza, and for all of Palestine,” Canawati told Al Jazeera. “Today, we send a message to the entire world that the Palestinian people love life and peace, and that they cannot be uprooted from their land and their roots because they are the rightful owners.”</p><p>Canawati pointed to tentative signs of economic revival in the city, whose Church of the Nativity is a major site of Christian pilgrimage, after a prolonged collapse in tourism.</p><p>“All the Bethlehem hotels are reopening their doors to receive local and foreign visitors after nearly two years of almost complete shutdown,” Canawati said. “God willing, the wheel of tourism has started turning again.”</p><p>Bethlehem’s economy, heavily dependent on tourism, has been badly hit. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, hotel occupancy rates since the beginning of the year stood at only 25 percent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194667\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194667\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00017-1766614496.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Women gathered at a barrier\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians travelled from across the West Bank and Israel to attend the celebrations in Bethlehem [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Elias al-Arja, the head of the Palestinian Hotel Association, said that hotels in Bethlehem had suffered $300m in losses this year. However, the renewal of the Christmas celebrations has been a huge boon.</p><p>“Hotel occupancy rates over the past two days have risen to 80 percent, with around 8,000 visitors – 6,000 of them Palestinian citizens of Israel, and 2,000 from various nationalities from Europe and the United States,” al-Arja said.</p><p>Some of those visitors took the opportunity to watch the Christmas celebrations in Manger Square.</p><p>“It is good to see these celebrations returning,” said Dwayne Jefferson, who travelled from the US state of North Carolina. “It is a positive experience and opens the door to the possibility that this entire region can return to a state of normal life. I am very happy to be here.”</p><p>Jean Charles, a tourist from Italy, said that it was his first visit to Bethlehem, and that he was happy to see so much joy after two years of war.</p><p>“I see this feast as a celebration for every Palestinian, not only Christians,” said Charles. “I see Muslims here as well, and this is very important and interesting for the future of this people.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I noticed the low number of tourists … But honestly, the situation is very calm. Everyone tells me, ‘Welcome to Palestine’. It is a very beautiful day, and a very beautiful Christmas.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194671\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194671\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00022-1766614564.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jack Jaqman, owner of an Oriental antiques shop, arranges traditional artifacts\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jack Jaqman arranges traditional artefacts inside his store at Manger Square near the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, as he prepares to welcome tourists and visitors [Monjed Jadou/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"more-visitors-needed\">More visitors needed</h2><p>For businesses around Manger Square, the day brought cautious optimism. George Ejha, the owner of St Georges Restaurant, said: “Today’s activity was good and relied mainly on Palestinians from inside Israel, but it is not good enough compared to the period before the war.”</p><p>“I completely stopped working when the war broke out and only reopened the restaurant two weeks ago. The losses I suffered cannot be counted,” he said. “We hope there will be more activity at the beginning of the year.”</p><p>Souvenir shop owner Jack Jaqman struck a similar note. “The activity we saw today is not enough … Those who visited Bethlehem were [mainly] foreign workers in Israel from the Philippines, India and Romania, or our own people [living in Israel],” Jaqman said. “Still, it is important in showing the city’s reality and its readiness to receive pilgrims and tourists again.”</p><p>“I have been in my souvenir shop for 10 days and have not felt the presence of real tourist groups that could improve the economic situation,” he said. “On this day, we pray for the end of the siege that has turned Bethlehem into a large prison.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
