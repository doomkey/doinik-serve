Public health experts sounded the alarm after his election win in November, warning there would likely be a “war on vaccines” under Trump.</p><p>“My main concern is that this is part of an increasingly ideological rather than evidence-based approach to healthcare and vaccination in particular that is being adopted in the US,” David Elliman, associate professor at University College London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is likely to increase vaccine hesitancy … [and] will result in more suffering and death, particularly for children. This would be a tragedy, even more so because it is avoidable.”</p><h2 id=\"what-new-cuts-to-vaccine-funding-have-been-made\">What new cuts to vaccine funding have been made?</h2><p>In a statement posted on Tuesday on X, Kennedy said 22 projects on mRNA vaccine development worth nearly $500m will be cancelled. The main reason, he said, was that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had reviewed mRNA vaccines and found them to be “ineffective” in fighting mutating viruses.</p><p>“A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,” Kennedy said in a video statement. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts, … HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.”</p><p>Instead, Kennedy said, the US will shift mRNA funding to other vaccine development technologies that are “safer” and “remain effective”.</p><p>Some notable institutions and companies that will be affected by the latest decision, as <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listed</a> on the HHS website, include:</p><ul>\n<li>Emory University and Tiba Biotech (terminated contracts)</li>\n<li>Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus (rejected or cancelled proposals)</li>\n<li>Luminary Labs, ModeX (“descoped” or weakened contracts)</li>\n<li>AstraZeneca and Moderna (“restructured” contracts)</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-mrna-vaccines-and-are-they-really-ineffective-against-virus-mutations\">What are mRNA vaccines, and are they really ineffective against virus mutations?</h2><p>Messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines prompt the body to produce proteins that help it build immunity against certain microbes. They differ from traditional vaccines that introduce weakened or dead microbes into the body to stimulate immunity. Both types of vaccines have their strengths and weaknesses, but mRNA vaccines are notably faster to manufacture although they don’t provide the lifelong coverage that traditional vaccines might.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>However, Elliman said virus mutations are a general problem for any vaccines and present a challenge scientists are still contending with.</p><p>“As yet, there are no vaccines in use that have solved this problem, so this is not a good reason for abandoning mRNA vaccines,” Elliman said. “The technology has great promise for vaccines and therapeutics, so ceasing research in the field without good evidence is unjustified.”</p><p>The move, he added, could discourage investors and scientists, both inside and outside the US, from keeping up research.</p><p>Dorit R Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who focuses on vaccine law, told Al Jazeera that the decision is “troubling and shortsighted”.</p><p>“Procedurally, the decision was done in a very flawed manner. At the least, there should be notice and an opportunity for hearing and explanation under our administrative law, and there was instead a short and cursory X video with no references, no real data,” she said.</p><p>The move will not only hurt innovation, she said, but will also leave the country less prepared for emergencies.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3756557\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3756557\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3756557\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/afp_6842b7f4cdbd-1749202932.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 29: In this photo illustration, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (top) and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines sit in boxes at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

The organisation has also campaigned against the fortification of drinking water with fluoride, which prevents tooth decay.</p><p>During a 2013 autism conference, Kennedy compared the CDC’s childhood vaccine programme to Nazi-era crimes. “To me, this is like Nazi death camps, what happened to these kids,” he said, referring to an increasing number of children diagnosed with autism. “I can’t tell you why somebody would do something like that. I can’t tell you why ordinary Germans participated in the Holocaust.”</p><p>In a 2023 interview with Fox News, Kennedy claimed vaccines cause autism. He cited a widely debunked study by Andrew Wakefield, a discredited British doctor and antivaccine activist whose study on the matter has since been retracted from journals. In another 2023 podcast, Kennedy said, “No vaccine is safe or effective.”</p><p>Aside from his vaccine scepticism, Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, has also made several controversial remarks about other health issues, such as COVID-19. He criticised vaccine mandates and lockdown restrictions during the pandemic under former President Joe Biden. He also claimed in a leaked video in 2022 that COVID-19 “attacked certain races disproportionately” because of their genetic makeup and Ashkenazi Jews were most immune to the virus. Several research <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8586903/#:~:text=Findings,mortality%20rates%20than%20White%20individuals.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies</a>, however, found that social inequalities were major influences on how COVID-19 affected different ethno-social groups because certain people had reduced access to care.</p><p>During a congressional hearing in the lead-up to his appointment in Trump’s administration, Kennedy denied making several of the controversial statements attributed to him in the past. He also promised to maintain existing vaccine standards.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-trump-s-views-on-vaccines\">What are Trump’s views on vaccines?</h2><p>Trump has flip-flopped on this issue.</p><p>He has previously downplayed the usefulness of vaccines and, in particular, criticised the schedules under which children receive several vaccine doses within their first two years. In his election campaign last year, Trump promised to dismantle vaccine mandates in schools.</p><p>In a 2007 interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Trump claimed that an autism “epidemic” had arisen as a result of vaccines, a theory which has since been debunked. “My theory – and I study it because I have young children – my theory is the shots [vaccines]. We’re giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children.”</p><p>In subsequent interviews, Trump called childhood vaccines a “monster shot” and in 2015 during a debate among Republican presidential candidates said vaccines were “meant for a horse, not a child”.</p><p>In 2015, he told a reporter he had never received a flu shot.</p><p>But Trump has also spoken in favour of vaccines at times. During his first term as president, Trump said at a news briefing that children “have to get their shots” after outbreaks of measles emerged across the country. “The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now,” he said.</p><p>Additionally, in his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration initially downplayed the virus, but it ultimately oversaw the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines in a project it called Operation Warp Speed.</p><p>After Biden became president in 2021, Trump’s camp criticised his vaccine and face mask mandates, which critics said contributed to rising levels of antivaccine sentiment among conservative voters.</p><p>Trump also avoided using Operation Warp Speed’s success as a selling point in last year’s presidential campaign. He also did not publicly announce that he had received initial and booster COVID-19 vaccine shots before leaving the White House.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-trump-administration-targeted-vaccines-more-broadly\">Has the Trump administration targeted vaccines more broadly?</h2><p>During Trump’s second term, the US introduced vaccine regulations that some critics said undermine the country’s vaccine system.</p><p>Furthermore, the Trump administration has cut funding to the US Agency for International Development, which supported hundreds of vaccine development programmes across the world.</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>In February, Trump halted federal funding for schools that required students to have what his administration called “coercive” COVID-19 vaccines.</li>\n<li>In May, Kennedy announced that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women without giving details about the reasons behind the change in policy. That went against the advice of US health officials who had previously urged boosters for young children.</li>\n<li>In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of a CDC panel of vaccine experts, claiming that the board was “rife with conflicts”. The panel, which had been appointed by Biden, was responsible for recommending how vaccines are used and for whom. Kennedy said the move would raise public confidence, stating that the US was “prioritising the restoration of public trust above any specific pro- or antivaccine agenda. However, the move drew condemnation from scientists and health bodies.</li>\n<li>At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration, which also comes under the remit of the HHS, has approved at least one COVID-19 vaccine. In May, the FDA approved Novavax’s non-mRNA, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine although only for older adults and those over the age of 12 who also have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk from the virus. That was unusual for the US, where vaccines are usually approved without such limitations.</li>\n<li>The 2026 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), a public-private entity formed in 2002 to support vaccine distribution to low and middle-income countries. GAVI was instrumental in securing vaccines for several countries in Africa and other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was feared that richer countries could stockpile the available doses. The US currently provides more than 10 percent of GAVI’s funding. In 2024, that amounted to $300m.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"did-trump-seek-to-undermine-vaccine-research-and-development-during-his-first-term-as-well\">Did Trump seek to undermine vaccine research and development during his first term as well?</h2><p>Yes.</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Trump’s health budget proposals in 2018 and subsequently proposed budget cuts to the National Institute of Health and the CDC would have impacted immunisation programmes and a wide range of life-saving research on vaccines. However, the proposals were rejected by Congress.</li>\n<li>In May 2018, the Trump administration disbanded the Global Health and Biodefense Unit of the National Security Council. The team, which was set up to help prepare the US for pandemics and vaccine deployments, was formed in 2015 under President Barack Obama’s administration during an Ebola epidemic. Later, when the COVID-19 pandemic reached the US, scientists blamed the country’s vulnerability on Trump’s decision.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

In Romania, they represent approximately seven percent of the population, with one-fifth reporting discrimination experiences in the past year, according to European Union data.</p><p>Lakatos began his mission in the early 1980s as an art student during Nicolae Ceausescu’s communist regime. When anti-Roma sentiment was widespread, he discovered that Elvis’s music created connections with ethnic Romanian students while simultaneously symbolising resistance against government oppression.</p><p>Now, 40 years later, his audience has expanded. As a teacher for 25 years, Lakatos uses music to show his students they can aspire beyond the limited opportunities of their northwestern Romanian village.</p><p>“The adjective Gypsy is used everywhere as a substitute for insult,” Lakatos said. “We older people have gotten used to it, we can swallow it, we grew up with it. I have said many times, ‘Call us what you want, dinosaur and brontosaurus, but at least join hands with us to educate the next generation.'”</p><p>Despite his teaching career, Lakatos continues performing throughout Romania at various venues.</p><p>The eclectic mix of languages can sometimes lead to surprises because there is not always a literal translation for Elvis’s 1950s American English.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>For example, “Don’t step on my blue suede shoes” does not make sense to many of the children he teaches because they are so poor, Lakatos said.</p><p>In his version, the lyric Elvis made famous becomes simply “Don’t step on my bare feet.”</p><p>It is a message that Elvis – born in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, during the Great Depression – probably would have understood.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Anne is a common female name in Norway and France, which suggests that by this stage, the toymaker was aware of the legend behind the face. In the English-speaking world, she became known as “CPR Annie”.</p><p>“Annie, are you OK?” became the go-to training phrase as people simulated how to check for responsiveness in the event of a cardiac arrest.</p><p>In the 1980s, about a century after Annie was reported to have been found in the Seine, Michael Jackson immortalised her in pop culture.</p><p>As the story goes, the superstar heard the phrase during a first aid training session and, struck by the rhythm and urgency of it, worked it into the chart-topping song, Smooth Criminal, repeating it like a heartbeat: “Annie, are you OK?

But even as the ban was <a href=\"/amp/news/2025/8/7/police-raid-kashmir-bookshops-after-india-bans-titles-for-secessionism\">followed by police raids</a> on several bookstores in the region’s biggest city, Srinagar, during which they seized books on the blacklist, Indian officials are holding a book festival in the city on the banks of Dal Lake.</p><p>“Nothing is surprising about this ban, which comes at a moment when the level of censorship and surveillance in Kashmir since 2019 has reached absurd heights,” Kanjwal told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s crackdown on the region since it <a href=\"/news/2020/1/1/how-2019-changed-the-kashmir-dispute-forever\">revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status</a> six years ago.</p><p>“It is, of course, even more absurd that this ban comes at a time when the Indian army is simultaneously promoting book reading and literature through a state-sponsored Chinar Book Festival.”</p><p>Yet even with Kashmir’s long history of facing censorship, the book bans represent to many critics a particularly sweeping attempt by New Delhi to assert control over academia in the disputed region.</p><h2 id=\"misguiding-youth\">‘Misguiding youth’</h2><p>The 25 books banned by the government offer a detailed overview of the events surrounding the Partition of India and the reasons why Kashmir became such an intransigent territorial dispute to begin with.</p><p>They include writings like Azadi by Booker Prize winner <a href=\"/opinions/2024/7/22/why-does-india-hate-arundhati-roy\">Arundhati Roy</a>, Human Rights Violations in Kashmir by Piotr Balcerowicz and Agnieszka Kuszewska, Kashmiris’ Fight for Freedom by Mohd Yusaf Saraf, Kashmir Politics and Plebiscite by Abdul Gockhami Jabbar and Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? by Essar Batool. These are books that directly speak to rights abuses and massacres in Kashmir and promises broken by the Indian state.</p><p>Then there are books like Kanjwal’s, journalist Anuradha Bhasin’s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 and legal scholar AG Noorani’s The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012, which dissect the region’s political journey over the decades.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878501\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Kashmir_India_books_banned_August8_2025-1754654061.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Kashmir_India_books_banned_August8_2025-1754654061\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>The government has blamed these books for allegedly “misguiding youth” in Kashmir and instigating their “participation in violence and terrorism”. The government’s order states: “This literature would deeply impact the psyche of youth by promoting a culture of grievance, victimhood, and terrorist heroism.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2019/2/27/the-kashmir-conflict-explained\">dispute in Kashmir</a> dates back to 1947 when the departing British cleaved the Indian subcontinent into the two dominions of India and Pakistan. Muslim-majority Kashmir’s Hindu king sought to be independent of both, but after Pakistan-backed fighters entered a part of the region, he agreed to join India on the condition that Kashmir enjoy a special status within the new union with some autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.</p><p>But the Kashmiri people were never asked what they wanted, and India repeatedly rebuffed demands for a United Nations-sponsored plebiscite.</p><p>Discontent against Indian rule simmered on and off and exploded into an armed uprising against India in 1989 in response to allegations of election fixing.</p><p>Kanjwal’s Colonizing Kashmir sheds light on the complicated ways in which the Indian government under its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, consolidated its control over Kashmir.</p><p>Some of Nehru’s decisions that have come under criticism include the unceremonious dismissal of the region’s leader Sheikh Abdullah, who advocated for self-rule for Kashmir, and the decision to replace him with his lieutenant, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, whose 10 years in office were marked by the strengthening of New Delhi’s rule of Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Kanjwal’s book won this year’s Bernard Cohn Book Prize, which “recognizes outstanding and innovative scholarship for a first single-authored English-language monograph on South Asia”.</p><p>Kanjwal said the ban gives a sense of how “insecure” the government is.</p><h2 id=\"intensification-of-political-clampdown\">‘Intensification of political clampdown’</h2><p>India has a long history of censorship and information control in Kashmir. In 2010, after major protests broke out following the killing of 17-year-old student <a href=\"/news/2017/12/12/in-kashmir-a-fathers-fight-against-forgetfulness\">Tufail Mattoo</a> by security forces, the provincial government banned SMS services and restored them only three years later.</p><p>At the height of another civil uprising in 2016, the government stopped Kashmir Reader, an independent publication in Srinagar, from going to press, citing its purported “tendency to incite violence”.</p><p>Aside from prohibitions on newspapers and modes of communication, Indian authorities have routinely detained journalists under stringent preventive detention laws in Kashmir.</p><p>That pattern has picked up since 2019.</p><p>“First they came for journalists, and realising they were successful in silencing them, they have turned their attention to academia,” said veteran editor <a href=\"/opinions/2020/6/20/bringing-the-israeli-model-to-kashmir\">Anuradha Bhasin</a>, whose book on India’s revocation of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 is among those banned.</p><p>Bhasin described the accusations that her book promotes violence as strange. “Nowhere does my book glorify terrorism, but it does criticise the state. There’s a distinction between the two that authorities in Kashmir want to blur. That’s a very dangerous trend.”</p><p>Bhasin told Al Jazeera that such bans will have far-reaching implications for future works being produced on Kashmir. “Publishers will think twice before printing anything critical on Kashmir,” she said. “When my book went to print, the legal team vetted it thrice.”</p><h2 id=\"a-feeling-of-despair\">‘A feeling of despair’</h2><p>The book bans have drawn criticism from various quarters in Kashmir with students and researchers calling it an attempt to impose collective amnesia.</p><p>Sabir Rashid, a 27-year-old independent scholar from Kashmir, said he was very disappointed.  “If we take these books out of Kashmir’s literary canon, we are left with nothing,” he said.</p><p>Rashid is working on a book on Kashmir’s modern history concerning the period surrounding the Partition of India.</p><p>“If these works are no longer available to me, my research is naturally going to be lopsided.”</p><p>On Thursday, videos showed uniformed policemen entering bookstores in Srinagar and asking their proprietors if they possessed any of the books in the banned list.</p><p>At least one book vendor in Srinagar told Al Jazeera he had a single copy of Bhasin’s Dismantled State, which he sold just before the raids. “Except that one, I did not have any of these books,” he shrugged.</p><h2 id=\"more-acclaimed-works-on-the-blacklist\">More acclaimed works on the blacklist</h2><p>Historian Sumantra Bose is aghast at the suggestion by Indian authorities that his book Kashmir at the Crossroads has fuelled violence in the region. He has worked on the Kashmir dispute since 1993 and said he has focused on devising pathways for finding a lasting peace for the region. Bose is also amused at a family legacy represented by the ban.</p><p>In 1935, the colonial authorities in British India banned The Indian Struggle, 1920-1934, a compendium of political analysis authored by Subhas Chandra Bose, his great-uncle and a leader of India’s freedom struggle.</p><p>“Ninety years later, I have been accorded the singular honour of following in the legendary freedom fighter’s footsteps,” he said.</p><p>As police step up raids on bookshops in Srinagar and seize valuable, more critical works, the literary community in Kashmir has a feeling of despondency.</p><p>“This is an attack on the people’s memory,” Rashid said. “These books served as sentinels. They were supposed to remind us of our history. But now, the erasure of memory in Kashmir is nearly complete.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

For him, deforestation activities have contributed to the undermining of generational knowledge, as physical landmarks have been removed from their lived environment.</p><p>“It’s difficult for us to go to the jungle now,” he explains.</p><p>“We don’t know any more which hill is the one we go to for hunting,” he says.</p><p>“We don’t even know where the hill went.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878202\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878202\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878202\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CE6AE106-E695-441C-AC0F-8DC398A6BB75-1754638498.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"William Tinggang examines a mushroom within Nawan.

Indigenous communities across Ulu Baram have shown their resistance to logging activities by making physical blockades.</p><p>This typically entails community members camping for weeks, or even months, along logging roads to physically obstruct unwanted outsiders from entering native customary territories.</p><p>The primary legal framework regulating forest use is the Sarawak Forest Ordinance (1958), which grants the state government sweeping control over forest areas, including the issuance of timber licences.</p><p>Now, local communities are increasingly turning to strategic tools to assert their rights.</p><p>One of these tools is the creation of community maps.</p><p>“We are moving from oral tradition to physical documentation,” says Indigenous human rights activist Celine Lim.</p><p>Lim is the managing director of Save Rivers, one of the local organisations supporting Ulu Baram’s Indigenous communities to map their lands.</p><p>“Because of outside threats, this transition needs to take place,” Lim tells Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878210\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878210\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\"

government maps, these maps reflect the community’s cultural landmarks.</p><p>They include markers for things like burial grounds, sacred sites and trees which contain poison for hunting with blow darts, reflecting how Indigenous people actually relate to and manage their land sustainably.</p><p>“For Indigenous people, the way that they connect to land is definitely a lot deeper than many of our conventional ways,” says Lim.</p><p>“They see the mountains, the rivers, the land, the forest and in the past, these were entities,” she says.</p><p>“The way you’d respect a person is the way that they would respect these entities.”</p><p>By physically documenting how their land is managed, Indigenous communities can use maps to assert their presence and protect their native customary territory.</p><p>“This community map is really important for us,” says Bilong, who played a role in the creation of Long Semiyang’s community map.</p><p>“When we make a map, we know what our area is and what is in our area,” he says.</p><p>“It is important that we create boundaries”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The tradition of creating community maps in Sarawak first emerged in the 1990s, when the Switzerland-based group Bruno Manser-Fonds – named after a Swiss environmental activist who disappeared in Sarawak in 2000 – began supporting the Penan community with mapping activities.</p><p>The Penan are a previously nomadic indigenous group in Sarawak who have now mostly settled as farmers.</p><p>Through mapping, they have documented at least 5,000 river names and 1,000 topographic features linked to their traditions, and their community maps have been used numerous times as critical documentation to prevent logging.</p><p>Other groups, such as the Kenyah, are following suit with the creation of their own community maps.</p><p>“The reason why the trend of mapping has continued is because in other parts of Baram and Sarawak, they’ve proven to be successful,” says the Borneo Project’s Merriman, “at least in getting the attention of logging companies and the government.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878221\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878221\"

community map with a member of Long Moh village [Izzy Sasada/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Now, local organisations are encouraging communities to further solidify their assertion to their native customary territories by joining a global platform hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme that recognises Indigenous and community conserved areas, known as the ICCA.</p><p>Communities participating in the ICCA are listed on a globally accessible online database, and this international visibility offers a place for them to publicise threats and land grabs.</p><p>In Sarawak, the international visibility afforded through ICCA registration could offer an alternative avenue of protection for communities.</p><p>Merriman says that another important aspect of applying for ICCA recognition is the process itself of registering.</p><p>“The ICCA process is fundamentally an organising tool and a self-strengthening tool,” she says.</p><p>“It’s not just about being on the database. It’s about going through the process of a community banding together to protect its own land, to come up with a shared vision of responding to threats and what they want to do to try to make alternative income.”</p><p>Safeguarding Indigenous communities in Sarawak also has an international significance, activists say.</p><p>As the impacts of climate change intensify in Malaysia and globally, the potential role of Sarawak’s rainforests in climate change mitigation is increasingly being recognised.</p><p>“There’s plenty of talk at the state level about protecting forests,” says Jettie Word, executive director of The Borneo Project.</p><p>“Officials often say the right things in terms of recognising their importance in combatting climate change. Though ongoing logging indicates a gap between rhetoric and reality,” Word says.</p><p>“While mapping alone can’t protect a forest from a billion-dollar timber project, when it’s combined with community organising and campaigning, it’s often quite powerful and we’ve seen it successfully keep the companies away,” she says.</p><p>“The maps provide solid evidence of a community’s territory that is difficult to refute.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, Vox’s branch in the Murcia region celebrated the measure, saying on X that “Spain is and always will be a land of Christian roots!”</p><p class=\"p1\">The town’s mayor, Seve Gonzalez, told Spain’s El Pais newspaper that the measure did not single out any one group and that her government wanted to “promote cultural campaigns that defend our identity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Mohamed El Ghaidouni, secretary of the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain, said it amounted to “institutionalised Islamophobia”, taking issue with the local government’s assertion that the Muslim festivals celebrated in the centres were “foreign to the town’s identity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The ban, he said, “clashes with the institutions of the Spanish state” that protect religious freedom.</p><p class=\"p1\">Saiz told Spain’s Antena 3 broadcaster that policies like the ban in Jumilla harm “citizens who have been living for decades in our towns, in our cities, in our country, contributing and perfectly integrated without any problems of coexistence”.</p><p>Separately, Miguel Moratinos, the UN special envoy to combat Islamophobia, said he was “shocked” by the City Council of Jumilla’s decision and expressed “deep concern about the rise in xenophobic rhetoric and Islamophobic sentiments in some regions in Spain”.</p><p></p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The decision undermines the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion” as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>“Policies that single out or disproportionately affect one community pose a threat to social cohesion and erode the principle of living together in peace,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"far-right-clashes-with-locals\">Far-right clashes with locals</h2><p class=\"p1\">For centuries, Spain was ruled by Muslims, whose influence is present both in the Spanish language and in many of the country’s most celebrated landmarks, including Granada’s famed Moorish Alhambra Palace.</p><p class=\"p1\">Islamic rule ended in 1492 when the last Arab kingdom in Spain fell to the Catholics.</p><p class=\"p1\">The ban stipulates that municipal sports facilities can only be used for athletic activities or events organised by local authorities. Under no circumstance, it said, can the centre be used for “cultural, social or religious activities foreign to the City Council”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Its introduction follows clashes between far-right groups and residents and migrants that erupted last month in the southern Murcia region after an elderly resident in the town of Torre-Pacheco was beaten up by assailants believed to be of Moroccan origin.</p><p class=\"p1\">Right-wing governments elsewhere in Europe have passed measures similar to the ban in Jumilla, striking at the heart of ongoing debates across the continent about nationalism and religious and cultural pluralism.</p><p class=\"p1\">Last year in Monfalcone, a large industrial port city in northeastern Italy with a significant Bangladeshi immigrant population, far-right mayor Anna Maria Cisint banned prayers in a cultural centre.</p><p class=\"p1\">The move led to protests involving some 8,000 people, and the city’s Muslim community is appealing it in a regional court.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In his statement, Milliken said the payment would have wide-ranging consequences.</p><p>“As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources, and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Civil liberties organisations have also <a href=\"/news/2024/5/1/how-a-gaza-protest-at-indiana-university-became-a-battle-for-free-speech\">underscored</a> that students at publicly funded universities are typically afforded wider constitutional protections while on campus.</p><p>That stands in contrast to private institutions, where students are generally subject to whatever restrictions on speech are outlined by administrators in their enrollment agreement.</p><p>The First Amendment of the US Constitution restricts the government’s ability to limit free speech. Any future agreement between the University of California system and the Trump administration might face a legal challenge, should it be perceived to trample on free-speech rights.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been one of Trump’s most vocal Democratic opponents, urged the state’s university officials not to kowtow to the administration’s demands.</p><p>“We’re not Brown, we’re not Columbia, and I’m not going to be governor if we act like that,” Newsom said, according to the Los Angeles Times. “Period. Full stop. I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rajab Khader said he would refuse to move to southern Gaza, to “stay in the streets with dogs and other animals”.</p><p>“We must stay in Gaza [City] with our families and loved ones. The Israelis will find nothing except our bodies and our souls,” he said.</p><p>Maghzouza Saada, who was previously displaced from northeastern Beit Hanoon, expressed her outrage over being forced to move again, when nowhere in the Strip could be considered safe.</p><p>“The south is not safe.

They want to be ready for the time the Israeli military is forcing them out,” said Mahmoud.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The fear, the concern, the desperation are all on the rise. The Israeli military promises an evacuation zone where people, in fact, end up being killed in these areas,” he added.</p><p>Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network, said residents were tired of being forcibly and repeatedly displaced. This time, he said, the prospect of evacuation posed even greater dangers, with hospitals, water facilities and other infrastructure destroyed.</p><p>“Now, there is nothing to give to the people, and it’s risky,” he said.</p><p>“We have to move elders who cannot walk, and we have patients and injured people who cannot move.

And at least two people were killed at an aid distribution site run by the controversial United States and Israel-backed GHF, which is slated for expansion under Israel’s new offensive.</p><p>Reporting from Jordan’s capital, Amman, Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid said that the notorious foundation, which currently runs four aid sites where over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get food, mainly by Israeli forces, would be operating 12 more hubs in the enclave.</p><p>Abdel-Hamid said that Israel had not given an “exact timeline” for taking control of Gaza City, but that a ground offensive was in the offing, with “troop movement along Israel’s southern border with Gaza”. Forcibly removing up to 900,000 Palestinians from the city could, she said, take weeks.</p><p>In the longer term, military experts have said Israel’s plans – which would see it assume security control over the enclave, establishing an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority – could take years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"war-crime\">‘War crime’</h2><p>Amid mounting <a href=\"/news/2025/8/8/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-israels-plan-to-take-over-gaza-city\">global condemnation</a> from the United Nations, the European Union and a number of countries, it was unclear what Israel’s chief military backer, the US, made of the plans.</p><p>US Vice President <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/8/8/no-plans-to-recognise-palestinian-state-us-vice-president-says\">JD Vance</a> declined to comment on whether his administration had been given prior notification about Israel’s Gaza City plans, but continued to withhold support for a Palestinian state and underlined that “Hamas can’t attack innocent people”.</p><p>Experts say Israel would not be able to move forward with its plan to take total military control of Gaza without billions of dollars in backing from Washington. And few have forgotten President Donald Trump’s stated desire to “clean up” Gaza and turn the enclave into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.</p><p>On Friday, Hamas called Israel’s plans for Gaza City a “war crime”, saying that the decision explained why the country had suddenly withdrawn from the last round of ceasefire negotiations.</p><p>In a separate statement on Telegram, it said Palestinians would “resist any occupation or aggressive force”, slamming the US for providing cover for Israel, and accusing the international community of complicity in crimes against the Palestinian people.</p><p>The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session this weekend to discuss Israel’s escalation.</p></div></div></body></html>"
