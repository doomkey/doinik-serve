Doumbouya’s government is banking on its vast mines, especially the mega Simandou mine – one of the largest iron ore projects in the world, to create more jobs and revenue in the coming years. Diamond, gold and uranium deposits are also abundant in the country.</p><p>Doumbouya has gained some support due to new policies that have boosted mining exports. However, the general’s detractors question his legitimacy, citing his previous pledge not to run in elections, as well as his various bans on protests and media.</p><p>The 2021 coup destabilised Guinea’s democratic trajectory. After decades of coups and dictatorships, it was only in 2010 that Guineans voted in the first, truly free and fair elections since independence from France in 1958. The coup also caused suspensions from the African Union and sanctions from the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc.</p><p>Guinea’s capital is the coastal city of Conakry. Most Guineans practise Islam (85 percent), while others are Christians and animists (15 percent). The Fulani or Peul, Malinke and Soso are the largest ethnic groups, although there are more than two dozen ethnic groups. The country is known for being the source of the Niger River, which flows through several countries and empties into the Atlantic Ocean through Nigeria.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194511\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194511\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194511\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22T070035Z_1455506136_RC2RPHAOIKCW_RTRMADP_3_GUINEA-ELECTION-DOUMBOUYA-1766606862.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Simandou mines\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mining vehicles operate at the Simandou mine, one of the largest high-grade iron ore deposits, run by Australian company Rio Tinto and joint-venture partners SimFer in the Nzerekore region, Guinea, on November 4, 2025 [Luc Gnago/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-does-voting-work\">How does voting work?</h2><p>About 6.7 million eligible voters (those over 18 years) are registered for the elections. There are 23,662 polling stations.</p><p>The president will be elected by an absolute majority vote through a two-round system, for a seven-year term.</p><p>A high turnout is expected based on the 87 percent of voters who turned up for a referendum held in September. That vote was largely seen as a test of Doumbouya’s popularity, and more than 90 percent voted “yes” to a new constitution that allows military leaders to run for office, extends the presidential mandate from five to seven years, and creates a senate, of which a third of members would be presidential appointees.</p><p>Nine presidential candidates have been cleared to run, although the major opposition challengers who stood a real chance were barred on technicalities. None of the eight opposition candidates has a solid political footing. Candidates took part in an evening series on state television where they debated each other’s proposals weeks ahead of the vote.</p><p>Campaigns opened on November 28 and closed at midnight on December 25. Doumbouya largely stayed off the campaign trail, although his ministers travelled across the country, urging civilians and the military to vote at large rallies that featured musicians and attracted young people. One private businessman also held a carnival in Conakry to support Doumbouya this week.</p><p>About 10,000 election observers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the European Union, the United Nations, the International Organisation of the Francophonie and several other organisations will be present.</p><h2 id=\"who-has-been-excluded\">Who has been excluded?</h2><figure id=\"attachment_1205219\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1205219\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1205219\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/000_8QM4AM.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Diallo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1205219\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former prime minister and once main challenger Cellou Dalein Diallo speaks at the Press House in Dakar on September 24, 2020, during an invitation by the foreign media in Senegal.

The former prime minister (2004-2006) heads the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG). He contested the 2010 and 2015 elections but was beaten by Alpha Conde, his archrival, on both occasions. When the coup leaders seized power in 2021, Diallo welcomed the move and pledged his willingness to work with them in restoring democracy.</p><p>However, Doumbouya’s government launched corruption proceedings against him in relation to the sale of Air Guinee, the national carrier, back in 2002, when Diallo was transport minister. Diallo, who accused the military ruler of a witch-hunt to block him from elections, has since been forced into exile in neighbouring Senegal and in France. In August, his party was one of three suspended because documents they submitted had “substantial deficiencies”, according to the Ministry of Territorial Administration, which is in charge of the elections, as opposed to an independent elections commission. Diallo was also disqualified based on his residency, as the new constitution adopted in September requires that presidential candidates have their primary residence in the country.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1220691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1220691\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1220691\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-24T122237Z_381428548_RC20PJ9VYYMV_RTRMADP_3_GUINEA-ELECTION-1.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alpha Conde\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1220691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guinea’s then-president Alpha Conde laughs as he addresses a conference in Berlin, Germany, on November 19, 2019 [John MacDougall/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"alpha-conde-87\">Alpha Conde, 87</h2><p>Conde’s decision to run for a third term in 2021, after serving two five-year terms, threw Guinea into chaos and led to the September coup.</p><p>A longtime opponent of military regimes in the country, Conde promised to strengthen democracy upon his election in 2010, after polls that, despite being turbulent, were also a chance for the country to depart from decades of dictatorship. He was the first Guinean president to be elected in a free election. His government oversaw improvements in the mining sector and managed the 2014 Ebola epidemic, but is also accused of gross corruption and mismanagement.</p><p>In March 2020, he pushed through a referendum that allowed him to seek two more terms, claiming it reset his limit. The move led to widespread protests across the country that turned violent as the police and army attempted to shut them down, leading to dozens of deaths. The elections in October 2020 were held amid the turmoil, and at least 30 people were killed during the polls. In September 2021, Conde was deposed and arrested by a group of soldiers led by Doumbouya, whom he had appointed in 2018 as head of the elite Special Forces Group. He is believed to be in exile in Turkiye. Conde’s Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) was one of the parties suspended in August because it had “not fulfilled the obligations required,” according to the authorities.</p><h2 id=\"sidya-toure-80\">Sidya Toure, 80</h2><p>The former prime minister (1996-1999) is another well-known opposition figure who has been sidelined. He came third in the historic 2010 elections with 13 percent of the vote. Toure is the leader of the Union of Republican Forces (UFR). He has lived in exile in the Ivory Coast for several years and was disqualified from the elections based on his foreign residency.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-running\">Who is running?</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4194525\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194525\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194525\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-03T185630Z_1819649164_RC24PHAO44QG_RTRMADP_3_GUINEA-ELECTION-1766607749.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Doumbouya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194525\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guinean leader Mamady Doumbouya waves after submitting his candidacy at the Supreme Court ahead of the presidential election scheduled for December 28, in Conakry, Guinea, on November 3, 2025 [Luc Gnago/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"general-mamadou-doumbouya-41\">General Mamadou Doumbouya, 41</h2><p>The incumbent is the clear favourite to win the elections and is accused by opposition parties and activists of using the vote as a power grab to secure and legitimise his rule.</p><p>Doumbouya took power in the September 2021 coup, deposing then-president Alpha Conde after months of tension and protests. He promised to end the chaos and return the country to democratic rule.</p><p>The regional ECOWAS bloc has pressured Doumbouya to present a fast transition timeline. The military ruler initially promised an 18-month transition, but then remained largely uncompliant, missing two deadlines. However, ECOWAS, while keeping up pressure, has not been overly critical. Doumbouya has remained open to staying in the bloc, unlike his compatriots in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, who, under pressure to hold elections after their coups, rebuffed ECOWAS by leaving the alliance and creating a new union in January. ECOWAS is wary of antagonising Doumbouya and possibly causing Guinea to join the rival alliance.</p><p>Doumbouya’s government has, since 2022, banned protests, restricted local news organisations, and targeted activists in arrests, according to local news reports and civil society groups. A week before the elections, authorities also blocked Facebook.</p><p>Supporters of the military ruler say he has boosted infrastructure, with more than 2,250 kilometres of new roads built, schools renovated, and new hospitals built. They also point to the launch of the mega Simandou iron ore mine project, which saw its first iron ore exports this year, 30 years after it was licensed to operate.</p><p>The project has attracted international interest. Analysts say that’s partly why Western governments, with whom Doumbouya has maintained a friendly stance even as Conakry ramps up trade with China, are careful not to criticise his hold on power.</p><p>With campaign posters of the smiling Doumbouya splashed across Conakry’s streets and in the city of Kankan, his political stronghold, the president has promised to improve the infrastructure gains in the past four years. He has also pledged to build better democratic institutions; fight corruption; boost health and education access; and support women and youth. He is running under the Generation for Modernity and Development, or GMD movement.</p><p><strong>Others are:</strong></p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Aboulaye Yero Balde – a former education minister under Alpha Conde and ex-World Bank economist. Balde is running under the Front for Democracy in Guinea (FRONDEG).</li>\n<li>Makale Camara – the only female candidate and president of the Front for National Alliance (FAN) party. She has promised better access to water and electricity, and wants to diversify the economy beyond mining. She was a former foreign minister from 2016 to 2017.</li>\n<li>Faya Millimono – the head of the Liberal Bloc party. He was critical of Conde and initially supported the military coup, but has since antagonised Doumbouya.</li>\n<li>Ibrahima Abe Sylla – the former energy minister under the military government, is running under the New Generation for the Republic party.

Literacy levels are low and about half of the working population is unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.</p><p>Much hope for change hinges on restructuring in the mining sector to unlock lucrative deals for the country. The Simandou mine, which Chinese and Australian firms own stakes in, is of particular importance, as Doumbouya’s government is banking on it to provide enough money to bankroll more infrastructure and amenities. The first shipment from the mines left for China early in December, after a newly constructed railway allowed for ore to be transported out of the remote Simandou highlands to the port of Conakry. While many Guineans are hopeful about the proceeds, there are also fears that persistent government corruption could drain the revenue. Many are also concerned about the fate of the thousands of construction workers employed at the mine once building projects are complete.</p><h2 id=\"justice-for-september-28-stadium-massacre\">Justice for September 28 stadium massacre</h2><p>In 2009, former military leader Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in 2008, oversaw the massacre of protesters who gathered in their tens of thousands at a stadium in Conakry to call for democratic rule. Camara’s forces opened fire on the demonstrators in an attempt to suppress them. Many were shot, while others were crushed in the ensuing stampede. At least 156 people were killed, and 109 women and girls were raped during the massacre. It was one of the country’s most tragic events.</p><p>Many Guineans have long hoped for justice and a trial against Camara, who fled to Burkina Faso after a coup and assassination attempt months later. Doumbouya’s government launched a 22-month-long trial against him, and a court convicted Camara and seven of his military commanders in July 2024. Rights groups hailed the verdict as a historic moment for justice. Camara was handed a 20-year sentence, and he and the others were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the massacre. However, this March, just a year later, Doumbouya pardoned Camara on alleged health grounds – to the disappointment of victims and rights campaigners.</p><p>Although the government has taken on the task of compensation, with a first phase of reparations under way, there’s a lingering feeling among many victims that justice has not been fully served.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The group faced competition from a rival consortium led by Lucky Cement, as well as Air Blue, a private airline.</p><p>The auction, widely publicised and broadcast live by the government, marked the second formal attempt to privatise PIA. A previous effort in October 2024 collapsed when a single bid of $36m from a private real estate firm fell far short of the government’s $305m floor price.</p><p>The privatisation of PIA followed pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which urged Islamabad to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises. Pakistan, currently under a <a href=\"/news/2024/9/26/imf-loan-offers-pakistan-relief-but-long-term-reforms-remain-a-challenge\">$7bn IMF loan programme</a>, had committed to completing the airline’s privatisation by the end of this year.</p><p>Here is what is known so far about the sale, the winning consortium, and why the deal has drawn criticism from opposition parties and other quarters.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-winning-bid\">What do we know about the winning bid?</h2><p>On Tuesday, bidding took place in a packed five-star hotel in Islamabad and lasted about 90 minutes, with several breaks. Three parties submitted initial bids for a 75 percent stake in the national carrier.</p><p>To attract investors, the government restructured PIA last year by hiving off long-term liabilities worth more than $2.3bn into a separate entity. It also offered policy continuity guarantees and tax relief, measures approved by the IMF.</p><p>In the first round, Air Blue was disqualified from open bidding after offering $94.59m, well below the government’s minimum price of $356.9m.</p><p>Once the two remaining consortia cleared the floor price, open bidding began. The AHL-led group emerged victorious with a final offer of $482m for the 75 percent stake.</p><p>At a news conference a day later, Muhammad Ali, the government’s adviser on privatisation, said 92.5 percent of the winning bid, amounting to about $446m, would be reinvested into PIA itself. The remaining $36m would go to the government, which will also retain a 25 percent share valued at roughly $160.6m.</p><p>Arif Habib later told a private television channel that the consortium intends to buy the remaining 25 percent stake as well, with the aim of relaunching the airline by April next year.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, the consortium must pay two-thirds of the purchase price within three months, with the remaining one-third due within a year. A decision on acquiring the remaining 25 percent stake must also be made within three months.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-need-to-privatise-pia-arise\">Why did the need to privatise PIA arise?</h2><p>Once regarded as Pakistan’s most prestigious brand, PIA operated flights across the world and even boasted uniforms designed by Pierre Cardin. Founded in 1955 with a fleet of 13 aircraft, the airline quickly expanded its footprint.</p><p>PIA operated its first international flight to London via Cairo and Rome and went on to achieve several milestones. It became the first Asian airline to acquire a jet aircraft, the Boeing 707, opened new international routes, and is credited with helping launch Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, in the 1980s.</p><p>More than two decades later, however, the airline is widely viewed as a debt-ridden burden on the state. Successive governments attempted to offload PIA but failed amid resistance from opposition parties and protests by employee unions.</p><p>According to Ali, PIA accumulated more than $1.7bn in liabilities between 2015 and 2024, while long-term liabilities exceeded $2.3bn.</p><p>“This time, the process was carried forward with lessons from the past and completed with extensive preparation and accountability,” he said at Wednesday’s news conference.</p><p>Ali said PIA once operated about 50 aircraft and served nearly 40 international destinations. Today, only 18 aircraft are operational out of a fleet of 33.</p><p>He added that the airline currently serves about 30 destinations, operates roughly 240 weekly round-trip flights, and holds more than 30 percent of the domestic market. That share has fallen sharply from at least 60 percent in earlier decades with the rise of private carriers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-24T080843Z_1648099475_RC2WMIAZCA86_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-PRIVATISATION-PIA-1766710000.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C503&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali speaks at his office in Islamabad, Pakistan December 24, 2025.

Over the years, that number gradually reduced to fewer than 7,000 employees.</p><p>PIA was also barred from flying to the United Kingdom and Europe in June 2020, a month after one of its aircraft plunged into a Karachi street, killing 97 people. The disaster was attributed to human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and was followed by allegations that nearly a third of the licences for its pilots were fake or dubious.</p><p>However, the four-year ban from Europe was lifted in December 2024 by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and the Pakistani state-owned carrier resumed flights to the continent in January. Then, in July, the UK, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/uk-lifts-restrictions-on-pakistan-airlines-after-five-year-ban\">too, lifted its ban</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-criticism-against-the-auction-and-how-do-analysts-view-the-sale\">What is the criticism against the auction and how do analysts view the sale?</h2><p>While the government hailed the transaction as the “best possible outcome” with “great symbolic value”, opposition parties condemned the deal.</p><p>The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), an opposition alliance led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, rejected the privatisation, warning that disposing of a national asset without public mandate, parliamentary oversight, transparency and constitutional legitimacy would be unacceptable.</p><p>Other commentators questioned the bidding process, describing it as an act of “obfuscation” that raised more questions than answers. Some accused the government of effectively selling the 75 percent stake for just $36m — since the rest is to be invested back into an airline that its new, private owners will now benefit from.</p><p>Ali dismissed those claims.</p><p>“Our structuring was such that we get 10 billion rupees ($36m) in cash, and the value of our equities is 45 billion rupees ($160m). So, the government will get a value of 55 billion rupees ($196m) in total, and 125 billion rupees ($446m) will flow back into the airline,” he said.</p><p>Several economists and aviation analysts argue that the outcome was the best deal possible, regardless of which government was in power.</p><p>Fahd Ali, an economist and assistant professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), described the agreement as watertight.</p><p>“Critics have also been talking about the lucrative landing rights and routes that it holds and how the new owner may sell these to recover its costs. But people fail to understand that PIA’s destinations are the geese that lay the golden eggs,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The airline was unable to capitalise on those routes because it required additional investment that the state could not provide, he said, adding that selling them would hurt future earnings.</p><p>“Given these constraints, the deal seems all right,” he said.</p><p>Karachi-based economic commentator Khurram Husain said the transaction was unconventional, driven less by profit than by the need to stem losses.</p><p>“You can cut your losses two ways. Either you shut it all down, denotify and delist the company, with PIA ceasing to exist. Or the other was to hand it over to private sector, and have them run it,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Husain, a former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said PIA’s long-term liabilities of $2.3bn would have continued to grow had the government not acted.</p><p>“At what point does one stop? That was the government’s calculus. They were not looking to bring down losses, but to control it,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-part-of-the-consortium-and-why-is-the-military-s-inclusion-raising-questions\">Who is part of the consortium and why is the military’s inclusion raising questions?</h2><p>The consortium is led by Arif Habib, whose business interests span brokerage services, fertilisers, steel and real estate. He has previously served as a member of the Privatisation Commission.</p><p>Other partners include Fatima Fertilizer, part of the Fatima Group and Arif Habib Group, City Schools, founded in the late 1970s and now operating more than 500 campuses with at least 150,000 students, and Lake City Pakistan, a Lahore-based real estate developer. AKD Holdings, led by businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi, is also part of the group.</p><p>But the post-sale decision by the Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) to join the consortium has triggered debate. FFC, which is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, is a subsidiary of the military-run Fauji Foundation, which owns more than 40 percent of its shares.</p><p>As Pakistan’s largest fertiliser producer with interests in energy, food and finance, FFC’s move is seen by some as an expansion of the military’s footprint into the aviation sector.</p><p>Pakistan’s military remains the country’s most powerful institution, having directly ruled for more than three decades and retaining deep influence over political, social, and economic affairs.</p><p>Critics point to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as an example of the <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/25/elite-capture-how-pakistan-is-losing-6-percent-of-its-gdp-to-corruption\">military’s growing role</a> in economic decision-making. Established in June 2023 during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s first term, the SIFC is a high-powered body of civilian and military leaders tasked with promoting investment by cutting through bureaucracy. It has faced sustained criticism over transparency.</p><p>Husain said FFC’s presence in the consortium could prove “very significant” over the long term.</p><p>“It’s possible that under this deal, what has really happened is that PIA has moved from one arm of the state to another,” he said.</p><p>Ali Khizar, a Karachi-based economic analyst, said FFC’s inclusion could provide long-term security assurances for private investors.</p><p>“Historically, we have seen in Pakistan with policies taking 180-degree turn with changing government, so perhaps they needed to ensure to have military presence for providing investor security. But if FFC ends up with more shares than AHL, then that could change their influence and decision-making,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Fahd Ali said military-run businesses tend to operate differently from other state-owned enterprises (SoEs).</p><p>“They remain shielded from the political interference that besets other SoEs. However, those who think that the state will now be able to wash its hands of PIA might be mistaken,” he said.</p><p>Khizar added that while the transaction marks a breakthrough after two decades of failed attempts at privatising the carrier, concerns will persist if one airline — now backed by significant private capital and the military’s clout — ends up controlling the aviation market.</p><p>“There is a fear for other domestic airlines,” he acknowledged. “But then there is a lot of potential. PIA’s main opportunity is the international market and that is where it must compete,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His first trial for embezzlement of funds began in April 2019. In 2020, he was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust, and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment over the misappropriation of $9.9m in 1MDB funds. His sentence was later cut in half in a partial pardon.</p><p>In all, investigators said they believe some $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private accounts, including Najib’s. Legal proceedings for both his trials have spanned seven years and seen lawyers call 76 witnesses to the stand, including Najib himself.</p><p>Najib and his supporters – dozens of whom gathered at the court on Friday – claim the charges against him are politically motivated and that he was misled by his advisers.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in his verdict: “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused ‍his own powerful position in ⁠1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-1mdb\">What is 1MDB?</h2><p>1MDB is an abbreviation used for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. Berhad is the Malay term for “public limited company”.</p><p>The fund was set up in 2009 to promote development in Malaysia through foreign partnerships and investment.</p><p>Najib, who served as both prime minister and finance minister between 2009 and 2018, was also the chairman of 1MDB.</p><p>Prosecutors claimed that Najib abused his position as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move large amounts of money from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund to his personal accounts more than a decade ago.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-najib-now\">Where is Najib now?</h2><p>Najib is in Kajang Prison in Malaysia’s Selangor state, having been found guilty of embezzlement in the first, separate case in 2020. His sentence was later <a href=\"/news/2024/2/2/malaysia-reduces-sentence-of-former-pm-najib-razak\">commuted from 12 years to six years</a> after he received a partial royal pardon.<strong> </strong>He was due to be released on August 23, 2028.</p><p>During this second trial, which resulted in the verdict on Friday this week, investigators found that Najib used the 1MDB funds to buy his superyacht Equanimity and high-end properties, as well as to finance the production of the film, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-najib-said\">What has Najib said?</h2><p>Najib, who was defeated in the 2018 general election by Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister who had helped him come to power, has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the 1MDB scandal.</p><p>In October 2024, he apologised for mishandling the scandal, but maintained that he had no knowledge of the illegal fund transfers to his personal bank account. During the trial, Najib said he believed the money he received was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah – a claim that the judge rejected on Friday.</p><p>Najib also claimed that he had been deceived by advisers and other officials affiliated with 1MDB, including <a href=\"/features/2020/11/16/how-1mdb-fugitive-jho-low-tried-to-bargain-for-his-freedom\">Jho Low</a>, a Malaysian financier alleged to be the mastermind behind the scandal but who remains at large.</p><p>“It pains me every day to know that the 1MDB debacle happened under my watch as minister of finance and prime minister,” Najib said in a letter.</p><p>“For that, I would like to apologise unreservedly to the Malaysian people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Venezuela and the United States teeter on the brink of war, China has been vocal in condemning US actions. In Beijing’s view, Washington’s escalation – which includes seizing Venezuelan oil tankers, striking alleged drug-smuggling boats and imposing a blockade off the Venezuelan coast – is a textbook example of American unilateralism, infringing on another country’s sovereignty and violating the United Nations Charter.</p><p>During a December 17 call with his Venezuelan counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced opposition to US “unilateral bullying” and expressed his support for Venezuela’s right to “defend its sovereignty and national dignity”.</p><p>Yet, Beijing has failed to offer Caracas anything beyond rhetoric. China is clearly wary of falling into a geopolitical trap and its inaction demonstrates the limits of its influence in Latin America.</p><h2 id=\"engagement-with-latin-america\">Engagement with Latin America</h2><p>For more than two decades, China has pursued an expansion of economic relations with Latin American countries. As a result, today it is South America’s top trading partner; it is also the second-largest trading partner of Mexico, one of the US’s closest allies in the region.</p><p>China’s engagement with Latin American countries is fuelled by the high degree of complementarity between their economies. Agricultural goods – notably soya beans from Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay – have improved China’s food security, especially during its trade war with the US. Meanwhile, minerals such as lithium carbonate from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have become indispensable to China’s rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) industry.</p><p>In recent years, Chinese EV exports to Latin America have surged, growing by 55 percent in 2023 alone. The region has not only alleviated China’s overcapacity problem, but has also offered Chinese telecommunication technology, such as Huawei’s 5G  – which has long been<a href=\"/economy/2018/12/7/why-are-countries-banning-huawei\"> spurned </a>by Western countries – a market. Currently, Huawei’s 5G equipment is present in most Latin American countries.</p><p>The US, traditionally viewing Latin America as its back yard, has been naturally suspicious and hostile towards China’s growing influence in the region. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – an outspoken China hawk who has previously labelled the Communist Party of China an “evil, genocidal regime” – embarked on a diplomatic blitz across the region. Declaring that he was on a mission to “counter the [CPC’s] influence in the Western Hemisphere”, he sought to persuade several Latin American countries to scale back ties with China.</p><p>Despite being unable to offer a compelling alternative model of economic cooperation and opting for extortion tactics through tariffs, Washington nonetheless holds the upper hand in this battle for influence. For example, although most countries in the region have been economically enticed to adhere to the one China policy, recognising that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, the region continues to be the last bastion of diplomatic support for Taiwan, with seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan over China.</p><p>This week, the US achieved a resounding victory when Trump-backed conservative <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-backed-conservative-nasry-asfura-wins-honduras-election-authorities\">Nasry Asfura</a> won the presidential elections in Honduras; during his campaign, he pledged to sever diplomatic ties with China and re-establish formal relations with Taiwan.</p><p>Over the past year, under the Trump administration, several Latin American countries have yielded to US pressure to limit economic ties with China.</p><p>In February, Panama formally <a href=\"/news/2025/2/7/china-blasts-us-as-panama-quits-belt-and-road-initiative\">withdrew</a> from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Then in March, the Panama Canal’s Hong Kong-based operator <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/china-scrutinising-hong-kong-firms-sale-of-panama-canal-ports\">announced</a> that it was selling most of its stake to a consortium of American companies – a move that followed Trump’s allegation that the vital waterway was controlled by China. In December, Mexico announced it would slap tariffs of up to 50 percent on Chinese goods, starting on January 1.</p><p>In Venezuela, US pressure is not related to its close ties to China, as it has more to do with US domestic politics: Rubio is seeking to fulfil a long-held political agenda to please opposition-minded Venezuelan and Cuban American constituencies.</p><p>Nevertheless, any regime change in Caracas would certainly hurt China’s interests. As the biggest customer of Venezuelan crude oil, China has a vested interest in maintaining Venezuela’s peace and stability. While China itself is not dependent on Venezuelan oil – with Venezuela not even ranking among its top 10 crude suppliers – the US’s interception of Venezuelan oil tankers nonetheless undermines China’s energy strategy, which aims to avoid becoming over-reliant on any single energy supplier.</p><h2 id=\"monroe-doctrine-2-0-or-a-trap\">Monroe Doctrine 2.0 or a trap?</h2><p>China views the escalation in Venezuela not only through the economic lens, but also through a geopolitical one. The larger context of US global power projection is important.</p><p>In the recently released National Security Strategy (NSS), the Trump administration declared that the days of the US acting as the world’s policeman are over, advocating instead for a return to the principles of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy strategy which sought to block any outside interference in the Americas that could infringe on US interests.</p><p>Although notably, the NSS does not designate China as the greatest threat to the US, it nonetheless states that the US government will maintain a military capable of deterring Chinese ambitions on Taiwan by military means.</p><p>This document, along with escalating US-Venezuela tensions, has sent mixed signals to China. On the one hand, the US appears to deprioritise competition with China and instead focus on reasserting its hegemony over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>On the other hand, it has not made any significant steps to indicate disengagement in Asia; for example, its military bases in South Korea and Japan remain fully operational.</p><p>Beijing fears that Washington might be trying to lure it into a false sense of security with its rhetoric and an ostensible geopolitical shift; thus, it remains cautious.</p><p>Following the NSS’s release, China put out a policy paper on Latin America and the Caribbean. Likely a response to recent events, the paper reflects Beijing’s attempt to bring the fight to the US’s doorstep.</p><p>However, the policies and strategies laid out in the document share the same shortcomings that Chinese foreign policy has always had: they offer support that is more symbolic than substantive. China’s attempt to rally the Global South under the banner of opposing US hegemony and to foster grievance-based unity, seriously falls short of its mark when confronted with American military might.</p><p>In this context and given Venezuela’s limited economic value to China and its geopolitical distance, the Chinese government would not commit any resources to defending the Latin American country.</p><p>In the event of a US invasion, China would likely leverage it to promote its vision of a multipolar world, and position itself as the champion of international law and the UN Charter. While it would consider the US being bogged down in a protracted war a positive development, China would almost certainly not come to Venezuela’s aid.</p><p>A US toppling of the Venezuelan government, however, would expose the limits of Chinese power in the region. Such a scenario would undoubtedly prompt many Latin American countries to reconsider whether aligning themselves with China is a good idea when an aggressive US is so close by.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A few months later, the Department of Homeland Security posted in favour of remigration online.</p><p>But it is not just American far-right figures evoking the idea of remigration; European far-right leaders are also joining in.</p><p>Here is a closer look at what remigration means and what its origins are.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-remigration\">What is remigration?</h2><p>Broadly, remigration refers to when an immigrant voluntarily returns to their country of origin.</p><p>However, in the context of far-right movements, remigration is a method of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>For white ethnonationalists, remigration is a process through which all non-white people are forcibly removed from traditionally white countries.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-origins-of-remigration\">W<strong>hat are the origins of remigration?</strong></h2><p>Ideas of remigration trace back to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. The Nazis attempted to “remigrate” the Jews in Germany to Madagascar.</p><p>But the concept got wind through the work of Renaud Camus, a French novelist who devised the Great Replacement conspiracy theory in his 2011 book, Le Grand Remplacement.</p><p>His widely debunked white nationalist theory suggests that elites are replacing white Christians in the West with non-white, primarily Muslim, people through mass migration and demographic changes. Camus calls this “genocide by substitution”.</p><p>Far-right nationalists in Europe and beyond have borrowed ideas from this theory.</p><p>Heidi Beirich, an expert on the American and European far-right movements, told Al Jazeera that the term remigration is “relatively new” in far-right circles.</p><p>Beirich said that the concept was popularised by <a href=\"/news/2024/3/19/far-right-austrian-figure-martin-sellner-banned-from-entering-germany\">Martin Sellner</a>.</p><p>Sellner, 36, is the leader of Austria’s ultranationalist <a href=\"/news/2018/5/22/austria-cracks-down-on-far-right-identitarian-movement\">Identitarian Movement</a>, a far‑right group known for anti-immigration activism and promoting ethnonationalist ideology. Ethnonationalists define the nation primarily by shared ethnicity, ancestry, culture and heritage.</p><p>“Remigration advocates the forced removal of non-white people from what Sellner and others with his beliefs view as historically white countries, basically Europe, Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand,” Beirich explained.</p><p>Beirich said remigration in essence, is a “policy solution to the white supremacist ‘Great Replacement’ conspiracy theory”.</p><h2 id=\"do-different-groups-have-different-ideas\">Do different groups have different ideas?</h2><p>There are strands of nationalists beyond ethnonationalism.</p><p>Civic nationalists, who also called liberal nationalists or constitutional nationalists, define the nation by shared political values, laws and institutions, regardless of ethnicity. They believe that a person belongs to a country if they hold legal citizenship and are committed to the state’s principles.</p><p>While civic nationalists are less enthusiastic about remigration than ethnonationalists, to them, remigration means voluntary return migration.

It was attended by far-right activists from across Europe. InfoMigrants, a website which covers migration issues in Europe, estimated that 400 right-wing activists attended the summit.</p><p>But Beirich said that remigration, if implemented as a policy, would in effect be an “attempt to create all-white countries through ethnic cleansing”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The onslaught turned my life upside down – it erased colours, shattered dreams, and broke my spirit. University education – the centre of my life and ambition – stopped. Gaza itself came to a standstill amid unprecedented destruction.</p><p>Like all families in Gaza, my family and I have suffered greatly during this war. Two years of genocide robbed us of our health and sense of stability. We were forced to flee 10 times, moving from northern Gaza to Khan Younis in the south, then to Rafah, then to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. After more than a year, we returned to Gaza City, only to be displaced again to Khan Younis eight months after our return. Our home was badly damaged; we are now forced to live in it, with tarpaulins instead of walls.</p><p>In the summer of 2024, universities reopened but only for online learning. I registered, not because I still believed I could achieve my dream of being a teaching assistant, but because I wanted to finish what I had started.</p><p>I completed my third year – the year that was supposed to shape me as a future lecturer – from inside a tent, using unstable internet.</p><p>In February, my final year began. A few months later, famine hit us. My health started to deteriorate due to the lack of food, the displacement, and the constant fear of bombing. I lost nearly 15kg in a sudden, unhealthy bout of weight loss. My body became frail, and I was constantly dizzy due to the lack of food. At some point, we had just one meal in the middle of the day, one that was hardly enough to feed a baby. I could see my collarbones becoming more prominent as the famine worsened.</p><p>I also began to notice the severe weight loss of my family members, especially my mother. There were moments when I felt that we were on the brink of losing her. I became afraid to stay awake past 8pm, fearing the hunger I constantly felt.</p><p>Despite all the hardship, I decided not to let the war break me. I kept reminding myself that Gaza is the land of everything, and that what matters is the “now”.</p><p>One night, I decided to start my own project – if I couldn’t light minds with knowledge, I could light phones – or charge them. I shared with my family the idea of starting a small phone-charging project using a small solar panel, and they fully supported me. The next morning, I wrote on a piece of paper: “Phone Charging Point” and hung it outside our tent, and my career as a phone-charging business owner began.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194319\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194319\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194319\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251107-WA00211-1766596977.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a photo of a dozen phones charging\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The charging station of the author [Courtesy of Shahed Abu AlShaikh]</figcaption></figure><p>I made numbered cards and attached them to each phone to ensure none got lost. My days became filled with voices calling out, “Shahed, how’s phone number 7?” I would smile outwardly, but inside, I would carry a deep ache – the ache of never imagining my final year of university would look like this.</p><p>I struggled with cloudy weather, too many phones, and final exams. Every passing cloud that blocked the sun would cut off the power supply since I didn’t have a large battery for storage. In those moments, I cried from exhaustion and helplessness.</p><p>Every day, I earned around $10, just enough to buy internet cards and simple things I once took for granted, like a packet of chips or a box of juice. I would sit there, watching the phones charge, thinking: That was supposed to be my time, my time as a teaching assistant at the university.</p><p>I took my final exams in October while surrounded by phones that were not charging because of cloudy skies, tears streaming down my face.</p><p>I am one of hundreds of thousands of young people in Gaza who refuse to let the war write the end of our stories.</p><p>Education is our form of resistance; that is why the occupation sought to obliterate it. It hoped to send us into the darkness of ignorance, dejection and resignation.</p><p>Yet, the youth of Gaza stand undefeated. We have continued to pursue our education online, battling constant internet blackouts. We continue to support ourselves and our families however we can – some selling food in small street stalls, others offering private tutoring, or starting small businesses.</p><p>Many are applying for scholarships so they can continue their education abroad.</p><p>All of this is proof that Gaza’s youth love life, love their homeland, and are determined to rebuild it, not as it once was, but even better.</p><p>I’m now applying for scholarships outside Gaza to pursue my master’s degree. I want to go abroad, study and then return one day not to charge phones, but to charge minds. If I get accepted, I will hand over my small phone-charging project to my younger brother Anas, whose dream is to become a journalist, to tell the truth about Gaza and its people.</p><p>He and I, and the rest of our peers in Gaza, refuse to give up.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

On Thursday, the son of the critically ill BNP chairperson and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia landed in Dhaka, returning from Britain, where he had lived in exile since 2008. Tens of thousands of supporters gathered at a rally to welcome him home.</p><p>“We want peace,” Rahman said. “We have people from the hills and the plains in this country – Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. We want to build a safe Bangladesh, where every woman, man and child can leave home safely and return safely.”</p><p>His return comes at a time of heightened political uncertainty and tension in Bangladesh, following the assassination of prominent youth leader Osman Hadi and with a national election scheduled for February 2026. The BNP has long been widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls, with Rahman viewed as a leading contender for the prime ministership.</p><p>But the escalating violence in the country following Hadi’s assassination — the offices of the country’s two leading newspapers were set on fire, and a Hindu man was lynched — and deepening political tensions had led to fears that the election might be derailed.</p><p>Analysts say that Tarique Rahman’s return and his speech are likely to help calm the country’s political waters and reinforce the momentum for Bangladesh to hold its election as planned.</p><p>“His arrival has opened a new window of opportunity. I think this will reduce the uncertainty about election and create a sense of stability that the country is looking for,” said Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at the University of Dhaka.</p><p>None of this was guaranteed even a few days ago.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196266\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196266\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196266\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359303711395-1766734458.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman shout slogans following his arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka after more than 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025.

Until recently, however, his return from exile had remained uncertain.</p><p>Rahman himself had demurred on committing to return. His arrival now clears that uncertainty but opens up a new question, said Shahan: Can Rahman truly lead?</p><p>“If he takes a firm stance against extremism, assures the people that he understands their concerns and will work for a stable political future, promises to bring about normalcy and shows that he is ready to govern while establishing a firm control over party apparatus, the political situation will improve significantly,” Shahan said.</p><p>But if Rahman fails to deliver a clear message, “things will deteriorate,” Shahan said.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct researcher at the Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative (HADRI) at Western Sydney University, said the public fervour visible on Thursday over Rahman’s return suggested that he might benefit from support beyond the traditional BNP voter base.</p><p>“People’s interest and reaction to his return is not limited to the BNP alone, but includes people from all walks of life,” Hasan said, adding that many in Bangladesh will likely see the party as a stabilising force amid the chaos of the past 16 months, since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina following massive student-led protests. The interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which assumed office after Hasina fled to India in August 2024, has faced increasing criticism over its failures to ensure law and order, and to deliver on broader promised reforms.</p><p>The enormous rally by supporters to greet Rahman also showed the BNP’s organisational and political strength, Hasan said.</p><p>But there’s another factor, too, that could work in Rahman’s favour, said Hasan: On the streets of Bangladesh, many believe that Khaleda Zia’s son was treated unjustly and forced to leave the country. Under a military-backed caretaker government that was in power between 2006 and 2009, Rahman faced a range of charges. He was subsequently convicted, in absentia, in some of those cases.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359270971109-1766734554.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman, Tarique Rahman, center, arrives at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025, after returning from London, ending more than 17 years of self-imposed exile.

The 2024 uprising gave him a second chance. All the cases against him were dropped over the last year and a half, and convictions were stayed, paving the way for his return.</p><p>“Tarique Rahman’s defining trait as a politician will be his focus on policy. He is known as a policy buff within his inner circle and in today’s speech in front of millions of supporters, he stated repeatedly that he has a plan,” said US-based Bangladeshi geopolitical columnist Shafquat Rabbee.</p><p>One key aspect of his plan that will be watched closely across South Asia is his approach to India.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196277\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196277\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196277\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25359294746777-1766734733.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman waves to supporters from a bus in Dhaka after returning from London, ending more than 17 years of self-imposed exile, Thursday, Dec. 25, 2025.(AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu)\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196277\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarique Rahman waves to supporters from a bus in Dhaka after returning from London on Thursday, December 25, 2025 [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"adult-in-the-room\">‘Adult in the room’</h2><p>Traditionally, India has had a mostly cold relationship with the BNP, maintaining functional ties whenever the Bangladeshi party was in power, but far too often making it clear that it preferred Hasina and her Awami League as its partner.</p><p>The BNP’s decades-old alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist group, didn’t help ties with India. The Jamaat had opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan and has historically favoured closer relations with Islamabad.</p><p>But in recent months, even as anti-Hasina sentiment in Bangladesh has led to intense anti-India rhetoric from several political groups in the country, the BNP has maintained a comparatively restrained posture.</p><p>It has also broken up with the Jamaat, and has tried to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/analysis-bangladeshs-bnp-seeks-hasinas-liberal-mantle-before-elections\">position itself as a centrist party,</a> seemingly eager to occupy the political space vacated by the Awami League, which has been banned from participating in the February election.</p><p>Although Tarique Rahman has adopted a “Bangladesh First” slogan, political observers believe he is unlikely to be a firebrand anti-Indian politician.</p><p>“The baseline assumption for India with Tarique back in Bangladesh will be that the Indians will finally have an adult in the room with serious political muscle to negotiate with,” Rabbee said.</p><p>Recent political surveys in Bangladesh show the BNP and the Jamaat are running close ahead of the election, with a significant number of voters still undecided.</p><p>There too, Rahman’s return should help the BNP, said analysts.</p><p>“His presence will definitely energise the party base and encourage undecided voters to break for the BNP,” Shahan of the University of Dhaka said. “<span>If he performs, we may very well see a ‘wave’ election where the BNP can win in a landslide.” </span></p><p>For that to happen, though, Rahman will need to show that “<span>he can connect with people, reassure them, and provide a clear pathway for reform and democratic transition,” Shahan said. </span></p></div></div></body></html>"
