I am bringing acute awareness to the unjust application of UK laws by our Government and I’m glad that people can now see this after a year of imprisonment and human rights violations. Keep going, keep fighting.”</p><p>The three other detainees still on hunger strike are Teuta Hoxha on day 51, Kamran Ahmed on day 50 and Lewie Chiaramello on day 36. Hoxha and Ahmed have previously been hospitalised during the protest.</p><p>A spokesperson for Justice for the Hunger Strikers criticised the Labour government, saying it has failed to intervene despite advance warning of the hunger strike.</p><p>“Despite being given two weeks notice of the hunger strike, the Labour government has refused to engage with the hunger strikers or their families and legal representatives, even as they have reached a critical stage, with death a very real possibility,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>The hunger strikers are being held in five prisons across England over their alleged involvement in break-ins at the UK subsidiary of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Bristol and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The detainees deny the charges against them, including burglary and violent disorder, and said the UK government should itself be held accountable for its alleged role in Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian people.</p><p>All eight hunger strikers are members of Palestine Action and were charged before the group was designated a proscribed organisation under “antiterrorism” laws. They are expected to spend more than a year in prison before their trials begin – well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pretrial detention limit.</p><p>According to the Prisoners for Palestine group, their trials are expected to begin between April and January 2027.</p><p>The detainees’ demands include release on bail, an end to what they describe as interference with their mail and reading materials, access to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action.</p><p>Additional demands issued this week include transferring Muraisi back to HMP Bronzefield, closer to her family; lifting non-association orders between prisoners; and allowing detainees access to prison activities and courses.</p><h2 id=\"international-concern\">International concern</h2><p>Campaigners have described the protest as the largest hunger strike in Britain since the Irish hunger strikes of 1981, saying it has prompted hundreds of solidarity demonstrations across the country.</p><p>On Friday, a group of United Nations experts – including Gina Romero, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on occupied Palestinian territory – issued a statement expressing alarm at the detainees’ treatment.</p><p>“Hunger strike is often a measure of last resort by people who believe that their rights to protest and effective remedy have been exhausted,” the experts said. “The state’s duty of care toward hunger strikers is heightened, not diminished.”</p><p>Separately, more than 800 doctors have signed a letter addressed to Justice Secretary David Lammy urging him to intervene. The letter, written on December 17, raised “grave concern” about the prisoners’ health, warning they were at high risk of organ failure, irreversible neurological damage, cardiac arrhythmias and death.</p><p>Lawyers for the hunger-striking detainees said last week that they had initiated legal proceedings against the government, alleging it had abandoned its own prison safety policy. The detainees said they have written repeatedly to Lammy and other justice officials without receiving a response.</p><p>James Timpson, the UK minister of state for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said the government would not engage directly with the hunger strikers or their representatives.</p><p>“We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes,” Timpson said. “Over the last five years, we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year. I do not treat any prisoners differently to others. We have a justice system based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening.”</p><p>Trump issued his threat as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>Trump said the US and Israel have been “extremely victorious” against their enemies, referring to the wars in Gaza and Lebanon as well as June’s strikes against Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When asked whether the US would back an Israeli attack targeting Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/netanyahu-pushes-for-iran-conflict-clashing-with-trumps-priorities\">missile programme</a>, Trump said, “If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear? Fast. OK? One will be: Yes, absolutely. The other is: We’ll do it immediately.”</p><p>Another round of strikes against Iran would likely stir opposition in the US, including from segments of Trump’s own base of support.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly said the June strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme, and he has raised the spectre of the country acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p><p>But Iran has denied any such ambitions and said its nuclear programme is solely for the purposes of generating energy for civilian use.</p><p>Still, in Monday’s remarks, Trump discussed Iran’s nuclear capabilities in the same breath as its military ones.</p><p>Analysts point out that Israeli officials and their US allies have recently been drumming up concern about Iran’s missiles.</p><p>During the conflict in June, sometimes referred to as the 12-day war, Tehran fired hundreds of missiles in response to an Israeli attack that killed the country’s top generals, several nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, an Iran hawk who is close to Trump, visited Israel this month and repeated the Netanyahu government’s talking points about the dangers of Iran’s long-range missiles. He warned that Iran is producing them “in very high numbers”.</p><p>“We cannot allow Iran to produce ballistic missiles because they could overwhelm the Iron Dome,” he told The Jerusalem Post, referring to Israel’s air defence system. “It’s a major threat.”</p><p>Iran has ruled out negotiating over its missile programme, which is at the core of its defence strategy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Monday, Trump said Iran should “make a deal” with the US.</p><p>“If they want to make a deal, that’s much smarter,” Trump said. “You know, they could have made a deal the last time before we went through a big attack on them, and they decided not to make the deal. They wish they made that deal.”</p><p>Monday’s sabre-rattling comes weeks after the Trump administration released a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">national security strategy</a> that called for the US to shift its foreign policy resources away from the Middle East and instead focus on the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>But advocates of the strategy warn that another episode of attacking Iran may escalate into a longer, broader war.</p><p>In June, Iran responded to the US strikes with a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/hld-irans-attack-on-al-udeid-air-base-in-qatar-all-you-need-to-know\">missile attack</a> against a US base in Qatar, which did not result in any US casualties. Trump announced a ceasefire to end the war shortly after the Iranian response.</p><p>Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a US think tank that promotes diplomacy, told Al Jazeera last week that the Iranian response would be “much harsher” if the country is attacked again.</p><p>“The Iranians understand that unless they strike back hard and dispel the view that Iran is a country that you can bomb every six months – unless they do that – Iran will become a country that Israel will bomb every six months,” Parsi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It can’t exert enough power to bring those minority groups into the fold,” he said, adding that it also doesn’t want to do so in an “oppressive or repressive way that would only alienate them further”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Over the next few days, Geist Pinfold said, there could be two potential outcomes.</p><p>“The positive outcome would be that the Syrian government reaches some kind of understanding or a tentative understanding with the SDF in eastern Syria that points towards a kind of roadmap for a future integration,” he noted, adding that such a step could ease tensions not only in eastern Syria but in other regions as well.</p><p>However, he warned that continued violence could spark deeper ethnic and sectarian divides.</p><p>“Syria stands on the edge of a very, very dangerous precipice,” he cautioned, comparing the risk to Iraq’s descent into mass sectarian violence after the 2003 United States-led invasion.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The president then nominates the candidate of the largest Shia bloc – the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF) – to be named prime minister.</p><h2 id=\"complicated-picture\">Complicated picture</h2><p>Before the election, Supreme Judicial Council President Faiq Zaidan urged lawmakers to stick to the constitutional timeline for government formation – a maximum of 90 days – and the Federal Supreme Court (FSC) ratified the results faster than usual.</p><p>But few are expecting a swift result.

In 2021, such groups held only 17 seats.</p><p>Their growing presence in parliament potentially presents a problem not only for Iraq’s relations with foreign powers, but for Iraqi Shias who resent Tehran’s powerful influence in the country.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, Congress has passed “numerous statutes that grant the president limited emergency powers under limited circumstances to do specific things”.</p><p>Nearly every modern president has used emergency powers with varying degrees of gusto, with Congress and the Supreme Court historically wary of reining in those actions.</p><p>Like many US presidents, Trump has also used broad and ambiguous national security claims to justify expanding his reach.</p><p>But several factors have set Trump’s second term apart, most notably the lack of distinct inciting events for many of the powers claimed, Driesen said.</p><p>“I’ve never seen a president invoke emergency powers to justify practically all of this policy agenda,” he told Al Jazeera, “and I’ve also never seen a president use them to seize powers that really are not in the statutes at all.”</p><p>Put simply, he added, “to Trump, everything is an emergency”.</p><p>The tone was set on <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/how-trumps-executive-orders-will-roll-out-if-courts-allow\">day one</a>, with Trump’s broad executive order declaring that irregular crossings at the southern border meant nothing less than “America’s sovereignty is under attack”. The order has been used to indefinitely suspend <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/us-supreme-court-to-weigh-metering-of-asylum-claims-at-us-mexico-border\">US asylum obligations</a>, surge forces to the border, and seize federal land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The same day, Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to designate Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) as “foreign terrorist organizations”, posing a threat to the “national security, foreign policy, and economy” of the US.</p><p>The administration has, in part, relied on and expanded that order in efforts to circumvent due process in its mass deportation push and to rhetorically justify a militaristic approach to Latin America.</p><p>Simultaneously, Trump also declared a <a href=\"/news/2025/1/23/as-trump-turns-to-fossil-fuels-europe-sprints-ahead-with-renewables\">wide-ranging energy emergency</a> on his first day in office, laying the groundwork to bypass environmental regulations.</p><p>To be sure, as Bowman explained, Trump’s use of official emergency statutes has been only a piece of the puzzle, combined with his broad interpretation of constitutionally mandated power to reshape the government in ways big and small.</p><p>That has included cleaving civil servants from congressionally created government departments via the <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/6/2/the-take-what-did-elon-musk-get-from-doge-and-whats\">Department of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE), trying to fire heads of independent agencies, renaming institutions – possibly illegally – in his likeness, and allegedly bypassing required approvals to physically transform the White House.</p><p>But the invocation of emergency statutes has remained a backbone of his second term. Trump invoked an emergency to justify <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/icc-judges-stoic-in-face-of-us-sanctions-over-israeli-war-crimes-cases\">sanctioning</a> the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its investigations into Israeli war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>He used the “emergency” of fentanyl smuggling to justify tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, later unilaterally labelling the drug “weapons of mass destruction”.</p><p>In April, in one of his most challenged uses of an emergency authority, Trump cited an emergency statute to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs against nearly all US trading partners.</p><h2 id=\"a-mixed-picture\">A ‘mixed picture’</h2><p>In review, 2025 has shown virtually no willingness from Congress, where both chambers remain narrowly controlled by Trump’s Republican Party, to challenge the president.</p><p>Rulings from lower federal courts, meanwhile, have offered a “mixed picture”, according to the University of Missouri’s Bowman, while the country’s top court has left wider questions unanswered.</p><p>Bowman noted the six conservative members of the nine-judge panel ascribe to varying degrees to the “unitary executive theory”, which argues the drafters of the constitution envisioned a strong consolidation of presidential power.</p><p>“On the one hand, Trump is obviously willing to declare emergencies where no rational person would really believe they exist,” Bowman said.</p><p>“On the other hand, at least the lower courts have pushed back, but it remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will back them up.”</p><p>For example, Trump has been <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/trump-can-keep-national-guard-in-washington-dc-for-now-appeals-court\">temporarily allowed</a> to continue the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, DC, a federal district where he declared a “crime emergency” in August. City officials have said the characterisation defies facts on the ground.</p><p>Despite claiming similar overlapping crime and immigration crises in liberal-led cities in states across the country, Trump has had far less success. Lower courts have limited deployments of the National Guard in California, Illinois, and Oregon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has also floated, but not yet invoked, the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority\">Insurrection Act</a>, another law in the crisis portfolio dating back to 1792 that allows the president to deploy the military for domestic law enforcement to “suppress insurrections and repel invasions”.</p><p>A judicial response to the tactics behind Trump’s deportation drive has also been mixed.</p><p>Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act – a 1798 law designed to quickly expel foreign nationals during times of war – to swiftly deport undocumented individuals without due process has been <a href=\"/news/2025/5/16/us-supreme-court-blocks-the-trump-administrations-use-of-alien-enemies-act\">constrained</a>, but allowed to proceed by the Supreme Court with limited due process protections.</p><p>In one of the most-watched cases on the docket, the Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling when it returns to session in January on the legal justification of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs.</p><p>A lower court has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/trumps-tariffs-ruled-illegal-what-that-means-for-us-trade-war\">previously ruled</a> that Trump deployed the emergency statute illegally. Some conservative justices on the top court have also expressed wariness over the president’s claim.</p><p>The panel has appeared more amenable in a landmark case determining whether Trump can fire heads of independent agencies, also set to be decided in the new year.</p><h2 id=\"the-spectre-of-war\">The spectre of war</h2><p>When it comes to unilaterally making war, Trump has been bounding down a well-trodden path of misused presidential power, according to Matt Duss, the executive vice president of the Washington, DC-based Center for International Policy.</p><p>The end of the year has been marked by US military strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats from Venezuela, decried by rights groups as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/war-on-terror-defence-of-trump-boat-strikes-doesnt-hold-water-experts\">extrajudicial killings</a>.</p><p>The administration has claimed, without evidence, that over 100 people killed had sought to destabilise the US by flooding it with drugs. Trump has made a similar claim about the Nicolas Maduro-led government in Venezuela, as he has continued to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/opening-pandoras-box-what-happens-if-the-us-attacks-venezuela\">rattle the sabre</a> of land strikes.</p><p>The actions have been accompanied by a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/us-department-of-defense-to-be-renamed-department-of-war-report\">pugilistic rebranding</a> of the Department of Defense as the Department of War, a reframing of criminal Latin American cartels as so-called “narcoterrorists” and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">declaring</a> a new drive to bring the Western Hemisphere firmly under the US sphere of influence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We have to understand this in the context of multiple administrations of both parties abusing executive authority to essentially go to war,” said Duss, who explained that the practice accelerated in the so-called “<a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">global war on terror</a>” post-September 11, 2001 attacks.</p><p>Most recently, Republicans – and a handful of Democrats – in the House of Representatives voted down two separate war powers resolutions that would require congressional approval for future strikes on alleged drug boats or on Venezuelan territory.</p><p>The vote, Duss said, underscored “Trump’s near-total control of the Republican Party despite the fact that he is blatantly violating his own campaign promises to end wars, rather than to start them”.</p><h2 id=\"public-opinion\">Public opinion</h2><p>Trump’s control over his party and his influence writ-large over the country will largely be tested in next year’s midterm elections. The vote will determine control of the House and the Senate.</p><p>A slate of polls has indicated at least some degree of wariness in Trump’s use of presidential power.</p><p>In particular, a Quinnipiac poll released in mid-December found 54 percent of voters think Trump is going too far in his authority claims, while 37 percent think he is handling the role correctly. Another 7 percent believe Trump should go further in using the power of the presidency.</p><p>Another Politico poll in November found that 53 percent of US residents think Trump has too much power, while the president has seen an overall slump in his approval ratings since taking office.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>To be sure, a panoply of factors determine US elections, and it remains unclear if voters were more likely to respond to the results of Trump’s approach to the presidency, or to the approach itself.</p><p>“Does the average person really think much about any of the theoretical bases for the things Trump is doing? And frankly, would the average person care very much if the results were, in the short term, results of which they approved?” University of Missouri’s Bowman mused.</p><p>“I don’t know the answer … How all this is perceived across the country, and what’s going to happen next, is anybody’s guess.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, he said the case had been a “top priority” and added that he was “delighted” by Abd El-Fattah’s return, a sentiment echoed by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Abd El-Fattah had been jailed during Egypt’s mass protests in 2011 that ousted then-leader Hosni Mubarak. He went on to become a top critic of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took power in a <a href=\"/features/2018/7/2/egyptian-society-being-crushed-five-years-after-military-coup\">military coup</a> two years later.</p><p>The writer received a 15-year prison sentence in 2014 on charges of spreading fake news. He was briefly released in 2019 before receiving another five-year sentence.</p><p>He <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/egyptian-british-activist-alaa-abd-el-fattah-freed-after-sisi-pardon\">received a pardon</a> in September, along with five other prisoners, after repeated international calls to release him.</p></div></div></body></html>"
