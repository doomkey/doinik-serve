He is 27, grew up in a middle-class neighbourhood of Dhaka, and became eligible to vote nearly a decade ago. He never did – not in Bangladesh’s national elections in 2018, nor in the 2024 vote.</p><p>“My vote had no real value,” he said.</p><p>Like many Bangladeshis in his age group, Alam’s political consciousness formed under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s long period of government, when opposition parties and election watchdogs repeatedly questioned the credibility of polls.</p><p>Over time, he said, disengagement with politics became normal, even rational, for a generation. “You grow up knowing elections exist, but believing they actually don’t have the power to decide anything. So you put your energy elsewhere… studies, work, even trying to leave the country,” he said.</p><p>This calculation began to shift for him in July 2024, when student protests over a government job reservation system favouring certain groups spiralled into a nationwide uprising. Alam joined marches in Dhaka’s Mirpur area and helped coordinate logistics for protests, as Hasina’s security forces launched a brutal crackdown.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office later estimated that up to 1,400 people – most of them young – may have been killed before Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, ending nearly 15 years in power.</p><p>When Hasina left, Alam said the moment felt like something that had appeared permanent had broken. “For the first time, it felt like ordinary people could push for a change,” he said. “Once you experience that, you feel responsible for what comes next.”</p><p>Bangladesh is now heading for a national election on February 12, the first since the uprising. European Union observers have described the upcoming vote as the “biggest democratic process in 2026, anywhere”. And Alam plans to vote for the first time.</p><p>“I’m thrilled to exercise my lost right as a citizen,” he said.</p><p>He is not alone. Bangladesh has about 127 million registered voters, nearly 56 million of them between the ages of 18 and 37, according to the Election Commission. They constitute about 44 percent of the electorate, and are a demographic widely seen as the driving force behind Hasina’s downfall.</p><p>“Practically speaking, anyone who turned 18 after the 2008 parliamentary election has never had the chance to vote in a competitive poll,” said Humayun Kabir, director general of the Election Commission’s national identity registration wing.</p><p>“That means people who have been unable to vote for the last 17 years are now in their mid-30s… and especially eager to cast their ballots.”</p><p>This eagerness comes after three post-2008 elections that “were not considered credible”, Ivars Ijabs, the EU’s chief observer, said.</p><p>The 2014 polls saw a mass opposition boycott, and dozens of seats where Hasina’s Awami League party faced no contest. The 2018 vote, though contested, became widely known as the “night’s vote”, after allegations that ballot boxes had been filled before polling day.</p><p>The 2024 election, meanwhile, again went ahead amid a major boycott by opposition parties, with critics arguing that conditions for a “fair contest did not exist”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24224305623258-1768878892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE- Protesters shout slogans as they celebrate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

Haq described the upcoming election as a psychological release valve after years of repression, during which young people “could not hold their representatives accountable; rather, those representatives appeared to them as oppressors”.</p><p>Many young people still do not trust the existing system, Haq argued, and some remain sceptical of the democratic transition itself.</p><p>Umama Fatema, a Dhaka University student who emerged as a prominent leader during the 2024 protests, said the uprising generated powerful expectations among young people: promises of “no corruption, no manipulation, equality of opportunity and political reform”.</p><p>But translating these aspirations into institutions has proven far more difficult. As the transition unfolded, Fatema said the reform process, led by the interim administration of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, alongside manoeuvring by political parties – including those born out of 2024’s protests – became increasingly complex.</p><p>“Very few people and their aspirations have been meaningfully involved and incorporated,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253092\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25215551352377-1768885347.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Leader of National Citizen Party (NCP), Nahid Islam, addresses supporters during a political rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025.

A far-right Islamist party, the Jamaat’s opposition to Bangladesh’s independence during the 1971 war has long limited its mainstream appeal.</p><p>“Historically, those who rule us come to power with big promises,” Saha said. “But after a few years, power blinds them, and the same abuses repeat.”</p><p>The NCP, he said, initially felt different. “We thought of the NCP as a beacon of light. But seeing it align with a party that carries so much historical baggage made many of us lose hope.”</p><p>Fatema, who led the protests alongside several figures who later founded the NCP, said the party’s alignment with the Jamaat risks shrinking the significance of the July 2024 uprising. “Over time, it could seriously damage how this uprising is remembered in history,” he warned.</p><p>The NCP positioned itself at its launch as a generational alternative to Bangladesh’s traditional parties, promising what it called a “new political settlement” rooted in the 2024 July movement. But as talks advanced over the electoral alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the party saw a wave of resignations, including from several senior figures and women leaders who had been expected to contest parliamentary seats. Many of them have since announced independent bids, saying the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>Nahid Islam, the NCP’s chief, has defended the alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, describing it as a “strategic electoral arrangement aimed at greater unity”, rather than an ideological alignment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253096\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25345467213828-1768885528.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C493&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People watch Bangladesh's Chief Election Commissioner A.M.M.

But I want to see whether the system can at least function properly. That alone would be a major change,” she said.</p><p>For others, like Sakibur Rahman, 23, a voter from the eastern Brahmanbaria district who studies philosophy at the University of Dhaka, the appeal of democracy remains conditional.</p><p>“You can talk about democracy all day, but if people don’t feel safe, can’t speak freely and can’t earn a living, democracy feels abstract, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Rahman said he would support whichever party could credibly guarantee public safety, freedom of expression, religious freedom, and minorities living without fear.</p><p>For many women voters, the calculation is sharper still. Women make up nearly half of Bangladesh’s electorate, but young women say questions of dignity and everyday security will shape their ballot.</p><p>“We hear promises of women’s rights, but the lived reality is far from ideal. That will shape how many of my female friends will vote,” Akter, the master’s student, said.</p><p>Yet the political field they are being asked to choose from remains overwhelmingly male. Election Commission data shows that only 109 of the 2,568 candidates contesting the election, or about 4.24 percent, are women.</p><p>Fatema said the political space for women has narrowed rather than expanded since the uprising. “After August 5, women who speak about their agency, their contributions, and their right to representation have been suppressed in many ways,” she said.</p><p>“Harassment, from online abuse to sexual threats, has become routine in political spaces.” These pressures are pushing women out of visible political roles, just as the country enters a critical political transition, she added.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, a political observer and adjunct researcher at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, said the disconnect between women’s prominence in protest movements and their marginalisation in formal politics raises doubts about the depth of reform.</p><p>“No structural change is possible without women’s political representation, and participation at the highest levels… both in parliament and in policymaking,” he said. “Without that, promises of any new political order remain incomplete.”</p><p>Fahmidul Haq of Bard College said political parties would have to approach young voters differently than in the past, by addressing “their traumas, desires, and demands sincerely”, and by campaigning with honesty and transparency.</p><p>“Young people are deeply sceptical of absurd promises,” he said, adding that those may in fact alienate them.</p><p>Still, something fundamental has changed. For Alam, the first-time voter from Dhaka’s Mirpur, July 2024 permanently altered how his generation relates to power.</p><p>“We now dare to question everyone,” he said. “Whoever comes to power, that habit won’t disappear.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

protect minors online.</p><p>The government said on Monday it would examine <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/why-is-australia-banning-social-media-for-teenagers\">evidence from around the world</a> on a wide range of suggested proposals, including looking at ‌whether a social media ban for minors would be effective, and if one ‌was introduced, how best to ‌make it work.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

Australia, which last month became the first country in the world to ban social media for young people ‌under 16 years old, hoping to learn firsthand from the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/snapchat-starts-age-checks-in-australia-ahead-of-teen-social-media-ban\">Australian approach</a>, the UK government said in a ‍statement.</p><p>“The consultation will look at options including raising the digital age of consent, implementing phone curfews to avoid excessive use, and restricting potentially addictive design features such as ‘streaks’ and ‘infinite scrolling’,” the government said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement comes as governments and regulators worldwide grapple with the rapid explosion of AI-generated content, which was highlighted this month by an international outcry over reports of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/mother-of-elon-musks-child-sues-his-ai-company-over-grok-deepfake-images\">Elon Musk’s Grok AI chatbot</a> generating non-consensual sexual images, including of children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The UK has already set out plans for an outright ban on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/uk-to-investigate-elon-musks-grok-over-deeply-disturbing-deepfakes\">artificial intelligence nudification tools</a>, while working to stop children being able ‌to take, share or view nude images on their devices, ⁠it said in Monday’s statement.</p><p>“We are determined to ensure technology enriches children’s lives, not harms them – and to give every child the childhood they deserve,” UK Secretary of State for Technology Liz Kendall said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement did not mention a particular age limit for social media use, but the statement said it was exploring a ban “for children under a certain age”, in addition to other measures, such as better age checks and looking into whether the current digital age of consent of 13 years was too low.</p><p>The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it were in power, the UK’s PA Media news agency reports.</p><p>Badenoch, PA reports, said the planned consultation by the Labour-led government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer amounted to more delay from his leadership, after earlier accusing him of lacking the “backbone” to enforce a social media ban.</p><p>“The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,” Badenoch said.</p><p>“This is yet more dither and delay from Starmer and a Labour Party that have entirely run out of ideas.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Powell plans to attend the high court’s Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>It is a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell’s announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment</a> of the Fed chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year’s more subdued response to Trump’s repeated attacks on the central bank in favour of a more public confrontation.</p><p>Powell issued a video statement on January 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump’s efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed’s key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6 percent, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1 percent, a position few economists support.</p><p>The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation that Cook has denied. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court on October 1 issued a brief order <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/1/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-fed-governor-cook-firing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allowing her to stay on the board</a> while they consider her case.</p><p>If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed’s board and greater influence over the central bank’s decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The former Air Force general has been a vocal opponent of the leader of the GERB party, Boyko Borissov.</p><p class=\"p1\">Radev has also opposed politician and oligarch Delyan Peevski – under sanctions from the United States and United Kingdom over alleged bribery, corruption and media manipulation – whose MRF New Beginning party has repeatedly backed the outgoing GERB-led coalition.</p><p>The former president has expressed doubt about Bulgaria’s decision to join the eurozone and is opposed to sending military aid to Ukraine, chastising European leaders for not doing enough to support the efforts of US President Donald Trump to facilitate a negotiated peace.</p><p class=\"p1\">Radev did not mention on Monday what his plans are. Asked recently about forming a new party, he said there was a need for a party that “unites all democrats – left and right – regardless of where they belong or whether they are politically active at all, because we all need fair elections and democratic, free development”.</p><p>A recent Market Links poll found that Radev has an approval rating of 44 percent.</p><p>“His goal is to be close to the majority so that he doesn’t have to negotiate,” Parvan Simeonov from the Myara polling agency told the news agency AFP, adding that a solid result for Radev could be “a way out” of the country’s political crisis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, the fastest in two years.</p><p>“The shock and awe we anticipated just didn’t materialise,” Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Yaros said the limited fallout could be attributed to the relative lack of retaliation by other countries and the stock market rally that quickly followed Trump’s dialling back of the steepest tariffs announced on “<a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">liberation day</a>“.</p><p>Since Trump’s April 2 announcement, the stock market, which is heavily weighted towards the “magnificent seven” tech companies, has risen nearly 30 percent, boosting Americans’ paper wealth and encouraging households to loosen their purse strings.</p><p>Gains in net wealth have driven almost one-third of the rise in consumer spending since the COVID-19 pandemic, Oxford Economics said in a research briefing in October.</p><p>At the same time, the gains have not been distributed evenly.</p><p>The top 10 percent of earners are now estimated to account for roughly half of all spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics.</p><p>“The gains are going a lot to people in higher income brackets – they are the ones who have the stock portfolios – and are going to people in sectors and occupations tied to AI,” Marcus Noland, executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But, these numbers mask the unevenness in the growth in this economy.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"net-decline-of-workers\">Net decline of workers</h2><p>A careful parsing of the data reveals that unevenness. For instance, despite the impressive GDP numbers, that growth is not being accompanied by an increase in hiring.</p><p>While hospitality and healthcare added workers last year, retail, manufacturing and construction – sectors that rely heavily on migrants – all shed jobs.</p><p>As a result of the Trump administration’s <a href=\"/features/2025/12/19/how-ice-deports-refugees-and-migrants-despite-years-of-good-conduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mass deportation</a> of undocumented immigrants and tightening of legal migration pathways, the US last year experienced negative net migration for the first time in at least half a century, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.</p><p>“And through this very public and brutal way of going about deportations, they have discouraged illegal immigration, but also intimidated immigrants in the US,” Noland said, adding that the US workforce is projected to see a net decline of two million workers this year.</p><p>The “bifurcation” in the US economy is also being felt across the business world, with smaller companies lacking the deep pockets to stockpile inventories or negotiate with suppliers in the face of increased tariffs.</p><p>“The surge in policy uncertainty this year has had an outsize effect on smaller firms,” Oxford Economics said in a November report.</p><p>These firms are also seeing little benefit from the boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry since revenues have been driven by capital-intensive chip manufacturing and cloud services.</p><p>While AI proponents believe the world is on the cusp of huge gains in productivity that could dramatically raise living standards, there are concerns about large numbers of people being put out of work.</p><p>“This could be the new norm – jobless growth. That’s one reason people are not feeling so great,” Yaros said.</p><p>“While a lot of hype about AI and productivity benefits from AI are still to come, we think that is a risk to the labour market if it continues to hold back hiring.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The 59-year-old “Mozart of Madras” has also been honoured with Padma Vibhushan, India’s third highest civilian award, for his contribution to music.</p><p>But last week, when Rahman, a man of few words, shared in a TV interview that he potentially has lost work due to “communal” bias in Bollywood, India’s Hindi film industry, he was subjected to a massive online backlash from Hindu right-wing voices.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“People who are not creative have the power now to decide things, and this might have been a communal thing also but not in my face,” Rahman told the BBC Asian Network in the interview aired on Friday.</p><p>“It comes to me as Chinese whispers that they booked you, but the music company went ahead and hired their five composers. I said, ‘Oh, that’s great, rest for me. I can chill out with my family,’” he said in the 90-minute interview.</p><p>Right-wing commentators and activists questioned Rahman’s patriotism and talent, accusing him of playing the “victim card”.</p><p>Vinod Bansal from the far-right organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) demanded an apology from Rahman for “defaming” the country.</p><p>“We are proud of him and whatever he has done for the country. But for someone who has earned his living from the Indian industry, the way he is trying to defame the country is highly objectionable,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Barring a few outspoken voices, industry insiders have closed ranks, offering no solidarity and distancing themselves from the remarks.</p><p>Within a day, the composer was forced to tender an explanation amid an unrelenting stream of social media trolling. In a video posted to his Instagram account, Rahman said: “I understand that intentions can sometimes be misunderstood, but my purpose has always been to uplift, honour and serve through music.”</p><p>He stressed that he remained grateful to the nation and noted that he had thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his support of India’s entertainment industry and young creatives and was working on the background score for the upcoming film Ramayana, based on the Hindu epic, with German composer Hans Zimmer.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252302\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252302\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2241632287-1-1768834135.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Khans\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan speak on stage during the ‘EAST TO WEST: The Global Rise of Bollywood’ panel at the 2025 Joy Forum at SEF Arena on October 17, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

No matter how many patriotic songs, movies or tweets. They’ll all live through the cruelty of it.”</p><p>Online trolling helps manufacture majoritarian consent, according to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, coauthor of To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism.</p><p>He argued that when enough noise is generated on social media, it seeps into mainstream coverage and starts to look like the dominant social mood.</p><p>“The loudest voices then drown out tolerance and reason until hate is all that is heard and can be falsely claimed as representative of society,” said Roy Chowdhury, who has written about Bollywood being used as a propaganda tool.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1755836\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1755836\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/000_328E9BX.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protestors hold placards during a demonstration against anti-Muslim violence and hate crimes in New Delhi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India has seen the rise of anti-Muslim violence under the rule of Prime Minister Modi [File: Sajjad Hussain/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hindu-right-s-influence-on-art-and-cinema\">Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema</h2><p>Rahman isn’t known for being outspoken about politics or talking about his Muslim identity. He has worked on a fair share of nationalist films, including Roja, released in 1992 and celebrated for its patriotic themes and portrayal of the armed rebellion in India-administered Kashmir in the 1990s.</p><p>Rahman’s 1997 song Maa Tujhe Salam (Salute to You, Mother) on his album Vande Mataram was seen as unifying the diverse nation of 1.4 billion people.</p><p class=\"p1\">The composer started his career in the southern Tamil film industry. He is based in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.</p><p>The Oscar winner’s comments last week raised questions about the Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema in India, particularly in Bollywood.</p><p>The Hindi film industry has been called out for producing films that echo Hindu supremacist narratives, works that vilify Muslims and secular leaders, or even glorify Hindu extremists.</p><p>Some argued that this has happened because of a sustained culture war on Bollywood, pressuring it to abandon its pluralist, liberal ethos and pushing it towards Hindu majoritarian narratives, aligning cinema closely with the ruling party ideology.</p><p>The Kashmir Files (2022) triggered anti-Muslim hate across India while the Kerala Story (2023) was accused of spreading Islamophobia by portraying Muslims as potential “terrorists”.</p><p>More recently, Rahman composed music for the film Chhaava, which was accused of demonizing Muslims. The film portrayed Mughal ruler Aurangzeb as a brutal and violent ruler. Rahman, in his BBC interview, admitted the film was “divisive”.</p><h2 id=\"vilification-of-muslims\">‘Vilification of Muslims’</h2><p>Raja Sen, a screenwriter and film critic, said: “We’re seeing a kind of vilification of Muslims on our screens.”</p><p>“Earlier, it was just like an anti-Pakistan narrative. Now, there’s a different kind of narrative,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Hindi cinema has traditionally cast Pakistan as the enemy, focusing on topics of war, ‘”terror” and espionage, which are shaped by decades of hostility. The two neighbouring countries have fought several wars over the disputed Kashmir region. They were briefly engaged in a four-day war in May after gunmen killed 26 tourists in India-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Films that once centred on a foreign adversary now increasingly frame Indian Muslims as an internal threat.</p><p>Sen claimed that a major filmmaker changed an upcoming film’s Muslim protagonist’s name to a Hindu name, fearing controversy.</p><p>“They must have thought, why make the protagonist, a good, heroic guy, a Muslim. It’s perhaps similar to what used to happen in post-9/11 America in terms of how the stereotyping was being done,” Sen added.</p><p>Bollywood’s once largely secular ethos presented Muslim characters as positive, even if stereotypical. They were loyal friends, brothers or benevolent poets and singers in films like Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and Coolie (1983).</p><p>In recent years, however, Muslims increasingly have appeared as debauched (Animal), regressive (Haq), “terrorist” (A Wednesday) or violent (Kalank), mirroring post-9/11 Hollywood films when Muslim identity became shorthand for danger or moral deficiency.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1998-12-08T000000Z_291479725_RP1DRIFRTIAG_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-FILM-1768834406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dilip Kumar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dilip Kumar (real name Yusuf Khan – right) was India’s biggest star during the 1950s and 1960s [File: KK/FY/WS]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"muslim-stars-targeted\">Muslim stars targeted</h2><p>Muslim actors, filmmakers and other artists have played a central role in shaping Hindi cinema from its early days to the present.</p><p>The prominence of stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan has often been cited as evidence of Bollywood’s secular credentials and broad appeal.</p><p>Yet in recent years, the country’s biggest Muslim stars have increasingly found themselves targeted. This has not happened only over their films but also for their opinions expressed publicly on religious intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan’s films have repeatedly faced boycott calls from right-wing Hindu groups, including his 2014 film PK for critiquing organised religion, including Hinduism and Islam, and 2022’s Laal Singh Chaddha for his past remarks on intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan had to reassure people that he “really loved his country”. He has also been accused of promoting love jihad, a conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of marrying Hindu women to convert them, a charge amplified by a televised interview with news anchor Rajat Sharma, who questioned him about marrying Hindu women.</p><p>Shah Rukh Khan has been targeted on multiple occasions for remarks and professional choices. In 2015, he was branded “anti-national” for mentioning intolerance. He was also subjected to campaigns questioning his patriotism when his son, Aryan Khan, was arrested in a drugs case in 2021 despite the charges later being dropped.</p><p>More recently, he was labelled a traitor by a ruling party member after his Indian Premier League cricket team signed a Bangladeshi player. The Kolkata Knight Riders, co-owned by Shah Rukh Khan, dropped the Bangladeshi player amid tensions between the two countries.</p><p>In recent years, rights organisations and independent monitors have documented what they described as a systematic campaign of hate and discrimination against Muslims in India, who make up about 14 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion people.</p><p>According to the India Hate Lab Report 2025, there has been a sharp rise in antiminority hate speech – from 668 reported incidents in 2023 to more than 1,300 in 2025 – much of it voiced at political rallies, processions and public events that is then amplified online into mainstream discourse.</p><p>Human rights groups like Amnesty International have also documented demolitions targeting Muslim-owned businesses and homes in several states.</p><p>Beyond studies, lived accounts and news coverage point to systematic exclusion in everyday life from difficulties finding rental housing to practising religion and being lynched over accusations of transporting cow, considered sacred by some Hindus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-chilling-effect\">‘A chilling effect’</h2><p>Such backlash has a chilling effect. Artists said creative freedom in Hindi cinema has narrowed markedly in recent years, mostly by the anticipation of a backlash. Silence and self-censorship, some feel, have become critical for survival in the film industry today.</p><p>“Since 2014, there has been a group within the film industry that works within the influence of government and benefits from it, that boldly and aggressively underlines and creates many of these controversies,” filmmaker Avinash Das said.</p><p>Das revealed how, on several occasions, producers refused to work with him after they found out about his criticism of the government.</p><p>He pointed out that a 1983 satirical film, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, which depicted a Hindu religious performance, cannot be made now.</p><p>According to him, cinema is not just an art form but a business shaped by risk, which makes filmmakers and producers wary of anything that could be seen as controversial. The same extends to those who speak out.</p><p>Indian celebrities seem to be bound by the same code of silence, which explains why so few, regardless of whether they are Hindu or Muslim, speak publicly about the country’s current direction.</p><p>Roy Chowdhury said Bollywood contrasts sharply with Hollywood, where open dissent by celebrities, even disparaging remarks about United States President Donald Trump, is fairly commonplace.</p><p>“But for Muslim celebrities in India, the constraints are even tighter because in new India, Muslims are not meant to be heard,” Roy Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “They are expected to be voiceless and faceless. They are expected to lurk in the fringes and not take the spotlight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The reputational damage to African football will linger for a long time.</p><p>A match that promised so much between two high-quality teams produced astonishing scenes of acrimony and chaos in the Moroccan capital, Rabat. When the dust has settled, the inquest will begin.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trouble started brewing as a tight final, locked at 0-0, entered added time. Senegal’s Ismaila Sarr appeared to have scored, only for the goal to be disallowed by referee Jean-Jacques Ndala, who decided Abdoulaye Seck had fouled Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi. It was a decision that clearly incensed Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.</p><p>Then came the chaos. In the final minute of added time, Morocco’s Real Madrid star Brahim Diaz hit the ground and vehemently appealed for a penalty. After a video assistant referee (VAR) review, where Ndala was jostled by scuffling coaches and players, a highly controversial penalty was awarded, and a chance for Morocco to win it at the death.</p><p>It was then that the sparks of conflict turned into a fire. Thiaw felt Senegal had been cheated and had a case, but when he ushered his team off the field and down the tunnel in protest, he pivoted the final into dangerous territory. It took over 17 minutes for play to restart while objects were thrown from the crowd and some fans staged a pitch invasion. Thiaw later admitted he shouldn’t have taken this action, but the damage was done.</p><h2 id=\"diaz-s-panenka-mistake-costs-the-host-nation\">Diaz’s ‘Panenka’ mistake costs the host nation</h2><p>The tension inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium could have led to even uglier scenes before attention turned to the penalty spot, and the ball in the hands of Diaz, while Senegal’s players continued to complain bitterly. It was his moment, Morocco’s moment, after a painful 50-year wait to be champions of Africa.</p><p>What Diaz – who was the media darling of AFCON 2025 with a tournament-high five goals – did next encapsulated the craziness of the night.</p><p>Inexplicably, he attempted a “Panenka” chip, but embarrassingly, the Real Madrid winger clipped the ball straight into the arms of Senegal’s goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. The home crowd of over 66,000 at the stadium were struggling to comprehend what had just unfolded.</p><p>And when extra time started, there was another shock for the Moroccan fans, as Pape Gueye scored a brilliant winning goal for Senegal, one which would have been the memorable moment if the final hadn’t already descended into total disorder.</p><p>Senegal became champions of Africa for the second time. In football terms, they deserved it. But the inquests into the final will mean the celebrations will be overshadowed by recriminations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250380\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696d4ed7-1768771287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - CAF Africa Cup of Nations - Morocco 2025 - Final - Senegal v Morocco - Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, Rabat, Morocco - January 18, 2026 Morocco's Brahim Diaz misses a penalty REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brahim Diaz misses a penalty that would have won the final for the host nation Morocco [Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"disciplinary-measures-likely-to-follow\">Disciplinary measures likely to follow</h2><p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who was in attendance at the final, took to Instagram to condemn the “ugly scenes”.</p><p>Infantino called it “unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner,” and said that “violence cannot be tolerated in our sport,” adding, “the decisions taken by the match officials must always be respected”.</p><p>The final is likely to bring severe disciplinary measures from the tournament’s governing body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which has seen its big showpiece marred.</p><p>Moroccan coach Walid Regragui called the scenes “shameful” and added that they “do not honour Africa”.</p><p>Strong measures are likely to be taken against Thiaw, whose media briefing had to be cancelled due to further unrest in the press room.  But he’s not the only one who will face scrutiny.</p><p>Before the final, the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) had voiced concerns over the security at the tournament, and said its players and staff were “at risk”. The FSF also raised concerns over the training pitch, hotel and ticket allocation for the final.</p><p>The officiating in the final drew plenty of criticism. While Congolese referee Ndala held his nerve under intense pressure when the Senegal players walked off, there is no escaping that his decision-making in stoppage time was puzzling. Did Seck really foul Hakimi? It felt a harsh call on the Senegal player. And why did the referee not consult VAR?</p><p>Did Morocco’s Diaz then go down too easily from innocuous-looking pressure by Senegal’s El Hadji Malick Diouf? Well, Ndala was initially disinterested, then appeared to cave in to the pressure from a pleading Diaz and the crowd. One such decision in favour of the hosts would be tough to take. Two was inflammatory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252345\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252345\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256507736-1768834998.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C473&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gianni Infantino reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FIFA president Gianni Infantino, left, looks on during the AFCON final between Morocco and Senegal at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium [Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"claims-of-host-nation-bias\">Claims of host nation bias</h2><p>Morocco coach Regragui had felt the need to publicly reject claims of favouritism towards the host nation that have hung around this AFCON, fuelled by Cameroon having two penalties rejected in Morocco’s quarterfinal victory.</p><p>The conspiracy theories distracted from praise Morocco otherwise received as the host nation of the tournament, with Egypt and Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah thanking organisers and saying: “I have never participated in a competition in Africa with such a high level of organisation.”</p><p>This would have been the last thing on the mind of the tearful Moroccan fans leaving the stadium on Sunday night, and those who had gathered across the country ready to celebrate. None of this was their fault, and it was easy to feel sorry for them. The rain captured the moment. Hopes and dreams were doused. The wait to be champions would go on.</p><p>Right up until the carnage late in the final, it felt as though the prevailing narrative of AFCON 2025 would be about the improved standard of African football, and whether top-tier African teams, not least Senegal and Morocco, can go deep at the FIFA World Cup in June. Maybe even create history.</p><p>After reaching the semifinals in Qatar, and with years of youth football investment still bearing fruit, underestimating Morocco’s potential to defeat the biggest football nations would be careless. The same applies to Senegal, whose players also light up European leagues while coming together as a formidable force when representing the Lions of Teranga.</p><p>But in Rabat, the carelessness came from coaches, players and fans who dragged the ascending reputation of African football into the mud. Infantino has already made it clear that such scenes will not be tolerated in Africa or elsewhere.</p><p>The only man to have enhanced his reputation from the final fiasco is Senegal star Sadio Mane, who appeared reluctant to leave the pitch and seemingly urged his teammates to return. He also tried to calm the fury of Senegalese fans after the two controversial decisions.</p><p>Football fans everywhere should be celebrating the success of Senegal and the quality on display from both finalists. Instead, we’ll remember the dishonourable scenes in a country that co-hosts the World Cup in four years.</p><p>It’s over to CAF, and its disciplinary arm, to have the final word on AFCON 2025. With its reputation severely damaged and the need to please FIFA, don’t be surprised if there is more drama to come.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250636\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250636\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250636\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696d6233f37e-1768776244.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Senegal's forward #10 Sadio Mane holds up the trophy as he celebrates with his teammates after winning the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) final football match between Senegal and Morocco at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat on January 18, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4250636\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senegal’s Sadio Mane holds up the AFCON 2025 trophy [Franck Fife/AFP]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

But the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/18/police-chief-steps-down-after-uk-fallout-from-ban-on-tel-aviv-football-fan\">departure</a> of Craig Guildford, chief constable of West Midlands Police, was the result of political pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups amid heightened sensitivities around the issues of Israel and Palestine, legal and political commentators say.</p><p>In November last year, West Midlands Police recommended that <a href=\"/sports/2025/10/17/israeli-maccabi-tel-aviv-football-fans-barred-from-europa-league-game-in-uk\">Maccabi Tel Aviv </a>football fans should be banned from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham on public order and security grounds.</p><p>West Midlands Police said it had classified the match as high risk based on “current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/unrest-in-amsterdam-as-further-arrests-made-over-maccabi-clashes\">2024 UEFA Europa League match</a> between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam”.</p><p>“Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” the police force said at the time.</p><p>The decision was ultimately approved by Birmingham City Council’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), a multi-agency body that brings together police, local authorities and emergency services to assess safety risks at major events.</p><p>There was a public outcry, and numerous media opinion pieces called the ban “anti-Semitic”.</p><p>That pressure has since intensified. Last week, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/14/police-chief-behind-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-clings-to-job-despite-home-secretary-wanting-him-to-quit\">publicly</a> stated that she had lost confidence in Guildford following criticism by a police watchdog of how the ban was handled. Guildford resigned on Friday.</p><p>But observers say Guildford’s departure is a sign that policing decisions which intersect with the issue of Israel and Palestine are no longer insulated from political consequences.</p><p>The reason for this, said Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the British group Stop the War Coalition, is that “most politicians are too scared to challenge the pro-Israel mainstream consensus”.</p><p>He believes the fallout from the ban will have lasting consequences for future policing decisions. “I think it will reinforce the tendency for police forces to go along with the establishment bias against Palestine supporters, which is a product of the British ruling class’s support for Israel and is reinforced by Israel’s impressive lobbying operation,” Nineham told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-very-dangerous-precedent\">‘A very dangerous precedent’</h2><p>Frances Webber, a retired barrister who writes on politics, human rights and the rule of law, said the significance of Guildford’s resignation extends far beyond football or crowd control.</p><p>In the UK, “police forces are operationally independent of government, and any case against Guildford should have been pursued judicially, not politically”, she explained.</p><p>The visible role of central government in the fallout from this policing decision, she argued, “sets a very dangerous precedent, not just for police and local authorities but for democracy”.</p><p>Supporters of the ban on Maccabi fans attending the match in Birmingham argue it was rooted in a risk assessment shaped by events abroad and local context.</p><p>In 2024, Dutch authorities reported <a href=\"/news/2024/11/10/israeli-football-fans-pro-palestinians-attacked-in-amsterdam-what-we-know\">serious disorder</a> involving Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters at a match in Amsterdam, with violence both before and after the fixture. In intelligence shared ahead of the Birmingham match, British police said their Dutch counterparts informed them that significant numbers of visiting fans had been involved in organised confrontations and disturbances.</p><p>Birmingham is one of the UK’s most diverse cities, with around <a href=\"https://muslimcensus.co.uk/early-insights-from-the-2021-census-for-muslims\">30 percent</a> of its residents Muslim and more than 40 percent identifying as Asian or from minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2021 Census.</p><p>Officers were therefore concerned that the arrival of large numbers of high-risk, visiting supporters could spark tensions and even retaliatory disorder.</p><p>Nineham argues, therefore, that while procedural mistakes have since been identified by a police watchdog, the underlying policing decision about the match in Birmingham was sound. “The undeniably violent element within the Maccabi fans would have been a risk to the local population,” he said.</p><p>Webber also points to <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/11/maccabi-hooligans-amsterdam-media-gaza\">reports</a> that visiting Maccabi fans in Amsterdam had openly celebrated the killing of children in Gaza, and officers would have had to consider this when assessing the risks surrounding the Birmingham football fixture.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252299\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-11-08T090056Z_277518430_RC2N0BAVQO3P_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-NETHERLANDS-VIOLENCE-1768834084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Maccabi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters are guarded by police after violence broke out in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on November 8, 2024.

According to a report in the UK newspaper The Guardian this week, Dutch police said key claims about the violence in Amsterdam relied on by West Midlands Police to reach its decision to ban Maccabi fans did not align with its own experience.</p><p>The report also criticised the police’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, erroneous AI-generated material such as a reference to a football match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham that never took place. Guildford later apologised after initially telling MPs that AI had not been used, before <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/51041/documents/282958/default/\">clarifying </a>that the error stemmed from an AI-assisted search tool.</p><p>Since Cooke’s interim report was published, much of the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/police-chief-apologises-for-erroneous-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-evidence-blaming-ai-13494040\">British media</a> has framed Guildford’s resignation as justified, citing the findings in the report.</p><p>However, the report found no evidence that the ban was motivated by anti-Semitism, despite repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/02/jewish-groups-warned-ban-on-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans-attending-match-could-be-seen-as-antisemitic\">claims</a> to that effect.</p><p>Critics of the report, including Jewish Voice for Labour, however, have argued that there was an imbalance when it came to weighing concerns from different members of the community.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/in-support-of-banning-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans/\">letter</a> to the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, the group said the chief inspector of constabulary met with what his report described as “significant people” including representatives of the Israeli Embassy, members of Birmingham’s Jewish community, and Lord John Mann, the government’s independent adviser on anti-Semitism, but did not meet with any groups representing Birmingham’s Muslim community.</p><p>The group said that this disparity showed that Muslim safety concerns had been marginalised during the process.</p><h2 id=\"a-pro-israel-consensus\">‘A pro-Israel consensus’</h2><p>“It is worrying how the line that this ban was anti-Semitic and that only a tiny minority of Maccabi fans are a problem has been able to take hold, despite the clear evidence to the contrary,” Nineham said, adding that most politicians have appeared unwilling to challenge a pro-Israel consensus once it was formed.</p><p>The fallout that resulted in Guildford’s departure, he believes, was ultimately shaped less by the report’s findings than by concern within the political establishment about the precedent the ban might set.</p><p>“Guildford was forced out because the political establishment didn’t want the decision he made to become a precedent… The message to the police is: don’t make decisions based on a real risk assessment, toe the pro-Israel line,” Nineham noted.</p><p>He said he believes the episode will serve to reinforce a wider tendency within policing and other institutions to avoid decisions perceived as unfavourable to Israel, deepening what he describes as an establishment bias against Palestine supporters.</p><p>Indeed, the implications of Guildford’s departure extend far beyond this single case, warns Webber, with leaders in the police force being placed in an “impossible situation”, expected to weigh foreign-policy sensitivities alongside public safety – something she said is absolutely not their role.</p><p>Guildford’s exit may satisfy political demands for accountability. But it has also sent a clear message: when policing decisions intersect with Israel and Palestine, independence comes at a price, and careers can be the cost.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also have a large diaspora population, primarily in Germany but also in other European countries including France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p><p>There are between 30 and 40 million Kurdish people around the globe. Kurds are widely understood to be the largest stateless ethnic group in the world, connected by a shared culture and the Kurdish language.</p><p>Kurdish, a Northwestern Iranian language, has several distinct dialects that vary by region. Most historians agree that Kurds constitute the Iranian branch of the Indo‑European peoples.</p><p>While most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, there are also Kurdish communities that follow Shia Islam, Alevism, Yazidism, Christianity and other faiths.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251438\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-WHERE-ARE-THE-KURDS-JAN19-2026-copy-1768814414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - WHERE ARE THE KURDS - JAN19, 2026 copy-1768814414\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-are-the-kurds-stateless\">Why are the Kurds stateless?</h2><p>The Kurds lost their lands in the 1500s when the Ottoman Empire took over most Kurdish-held territory.</p><p>The Ottoman Empire was dissolved by the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, a post-World War I peace treaty.</p><p>Under this, the Allied powers proposed creating an autonomous Kurdistan. This was seen as a major breakthrough for the emerging Kurdish nationalist movement, but the treaty never came into force. Turkiye later renegotiated the post-war settlement with the Allies, and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne dropped the idea of a self-governing Kurdistan altogether.</p><p>Since then, Kurds have repeatedly tried to establish their own state, but those efforts have so far failed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251646\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251646\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-the-main-Kurdish-groups-SDF-Syria-KDP-Iraq-1768819555.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Who are the main Kurdish groups SDF Syria KDP Iraq-1768819555\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-do-kurdish-grievances-differ-in-syria-turkiye-iran-and-iraq\">How do Kurdish grievances differ in Syria, Turkiye, Iran and Iraq?</h2><p>In each of the four nations, Kurds have endured years of tricky relations with respective governments.</p><h3>Syria</h3><p>Kurds make up about 10 percent of the population in Syria, according to the CIA World Factbook.</p><p>Syria’s Kurds have experienced repression and unfair treatment.</p><p>In 1962, a special census in al-Hasakah province stripped about 120,000 Kurds of Syrian citizenship. Their children and grandchildren remained stateless, and later estimates from early 2011 put the number of Kurds without citizenship at around 300,000.</p><p>Kurdish land has also been distributed to Arab communities under Arabisation policies.</p><p>The Kurds were initially neutral when the uprising against al-Assad began in 2011 and escalated into a civil war. However, in 2012, Syrian government troops pulled out of many Kurdish areas, and Kurdish groups took control.</p><p>In 2013, fighters from ISIL (ISIS) began attacking three Kurdish areas in northern Syria that bordered the armed group’s territory. The People’s Protection Units (YPG) – a Syrian Kurdish armed group that is the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish political party, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) – fought them off. The YPG was backed by the Turkiye-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).</p><p>In 2014, ISIL seized the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane on the Turkish border. After months of heavy fighting, Kurdish forces, led by the YPG and backed by United States-led air strikes, regained control of the town in early 2015. Later that year, in October 2015, the YPG and allied Arab and other factions formally established the SDF as a broader coalition to fight ISIL across northern and eastern Syria.</p><p>In October 2017, the SDF captured Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIL in Syria, and then pushed into Deir Az Zor, ISIL’s last big stronghold. By March 2019, the SDF had taken Baghouz, the last piece of ISIL-held territory in Syria.</p><p>Al-Assad remained in power until he was ousted in December 2024 by Syrian opposition fighters led by al-Sharaa, who is now the interim president.</p><p>As part of his efforts to unite Syria, al-Sharaa on Friday issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree formally recognising</a> Kurdish as a “national language” alongside Arabic, allowing it to be taught in schools, and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians. The decree also abolishes measures dating back to a 1962 census in Hasakah province that actively stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality.</p><p>The decree officially recognises Kurdish identity as part of Syria’s national fabric for the first time and declares Newroz, the Kurdish New Year festival, a paid national holiday.</p><p>It also grants Kurdish Syrians rights, bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging, and sets out penalties for “incitement to ethnic strife”.</p><p>In a statement, the Kurdish administration in Syria’s north and northeast said the decree was “a first step, however, it does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people”. It called for more action.</p><p>“Rights are not protected by temporary decrees, but… through permanent constitutions that express the will of the people and all components of a society,” it said.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>Kurds make up 19 percent of the population of Turkiye but, for generations, have experienced erasure, with Kurds displaced and their names and costumes banned.</p><p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) was founded in 1978 by Abdullah Ocalan, with the aim of creating an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkiye. In 1984, the group launched an armed rebellion against the Turkish state, carrying out guerrilla attacks on security forces and state institutions.</p><p>The ensuing conflict between the PKK and Turkish security forces has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced many more in Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>In the 1990s, the PKK rolled back its demands, instead seeking greater cultural recognition. It continued its armed resistance against the Turkish state, alongside its efforts to build a broader political and social movement through affiliated parties and organisations.</p><p>The SDF’s secular Kurdish leadership is linked to the Turkish-based PKK. Although the PKK signalled in early 2025 that it would lay down its arms and disband, it is still listed as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the European Union and the US. Sporadic clashes between PKK fighters and Turkish forces have continued.</p><p>Despite this, the US backed the SDF because it was an effective partner in fighting ISIL, which the SDF and a US-led coalition had defeated in northeastern Syria by 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Iran</h3><p>Kurdish people make up nearly 10 percent of Iran’s population.</p><p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution led to the overthrow of the shah and the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran.</p><p>While the Kurds initially supported the Islamic Republic and briefly controlled parts of Iran, Iran’s mostly Sunni Muslim Kurdish community has often clashed with the Persian-speaking, Shia Muslim government in Tehran over Kurdish demands for political autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights.</p><p>Several Kurdish groups have long opposed the government in western Iran, where they form a majority, and there have been periods of active rebellion against government forces in those areas.</p><p>Kurdish uprisings in Iran in the 1980s and 1990s were met with heavy repression. Key Kurdish parties were pushed out of their strongholds, and many of their leaders and fighters relocated across the border to bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Civilian communities were also forced into Iraq, although large Kurdish communities remained inside Iran.</p><p>In 2004, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) was formed as an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic in Iran. Since then, it has carried out guerrilla attacks and ambushes on Iranian security forces from bases in the mountains along the Iran-Iraq border.</p><h3>Iraq</h3><p>Kurdish people make up between 15 and 20 percent of the population in Iraq. While they have historically enjoyed more rights than the Kurds in neighbouring countries, they have still faced repression in Iraq.</p><p>Kurdish nationalist leader Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq in 1946. In 1961, he launched a full armed struggle in what is often referred to as the First Kurdish–Iraqi War or the September Revolution.</p><p>The conflict lasted into the 1970s, with on-and-off clashes in the northern provinces of Iraq. Then, in the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs on Kurdish land and displacing Kurds. Some of them – many Yazidis – settled in “Mujammaat” or army-controlled towns or settlements in northern Iraq.</p><p>In 1991, the year that Iraq lost the Gulf War, Barzani’s son, Masoud Barzani of the KDP, and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish uprising in Iraq. It was violently crushed by the administration of then-President Saddam Hussein. More than 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkiye to escape a crackdown by Hussein’s regime. Turkiye shut its borders in response. Thousands died along the border, and the United Nations set up a “safe zone” for refugees in northern Iraq in April 1991. Eventually, most people returned to their homes in Iraq after the situation stabilised.</p><p>In 1992, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) was formed by the Kurdistan National Assembly, the first democratically elected parliament in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. After the UN guaranteed protection for the Kurds in 1991, Saddam Hussein’s government permitted the KRG to take over administration of what is now the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.</p><p>While the KDP and PUK agreed to share power, they experienced rifts and at times engaged in armed fighting with each other between 1994 and 1998.</p><p>However, in 2003, the two groups cooperated with the US to unseat Hussein. The KRG, led by Masoud Barzani, ruled three provinces: Duhok, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. In 2005, Talabani became Iraq’s first Kurdish president.</p><p>In 2017, the KRG held an independence referendum in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and in disputed, Kurdish-claimed territories such as Kirkuk, which is south of Erbil in northern Iraq. More than <a href=\"/news/2017/9/27/iraqi-kurds-overwhelmingly-back-split-from-baghdad\">90 percent</a> of voters backed independence, but Baghdad rejected the poll as <a href=\"/news/2017/11/6/baghdad-court-rules-secession-attempt-unconstitutional\">illegal.</a></p><p>The Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that the referendum was contrary to the Iraqi Constitution, which calls for the preservation of Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity.</p><p>Iraqi forces then moved in and retook Kirkuk and other disputed, fragmented areas, depriving the Kurds of key oil revenues and dealing a major blow to their ambitions for statehood.</p><p>In the aftermath of that, Masoud resigned as regional president, and the post remained vacant until 2019, when his nephew, Nechirvan Barzani, was elected president of the KRG.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In the nuclear age, the United States has to refrain from all-out war since it can easily lead to nuclear escalation. Instead, it wages hybrid wars.</p><p>In recent weeks, we have witnessed two such conflicts: in Venezuela and Iran. Both have been waged through a combination of crushing economic sanctions, targeted military strikes, cyberwarfare, stoking unrest and unrelenting misinformation campaigns. Both are long-term CIA projects that have recently escalated. Both will lead to further chaos.</p><p>The US has long had two goals vis-a-vis Venezuela: to gain control over its vast oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt and to overthrow its leftist government, which has been in power since 1999. America’s hybrid war against Venezuela dates to 2002 when the CIA helped to support a coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez. When that failed, the US ramped up other hybrid measures, including economic sanctions, the confiscation of Venezuela’s dollar reserves and measures to cripple Venezuela’s oil production, which eventually collapsed. Despite the chaos sown by the US, the hybrid war did not bring down the government.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has now escalated to bombing Caracas, kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro, stealing Venezuelan oil shipments and imposing a naval blockade, which, of course, is an act of war. It also seems likely that Trump is thereby enriching powerful pro-Zionist campaign funders who have their eyes on seizing Venezuelan oil assets.</p><p>Zionist interests also have their eye on toppling the Venezuelan government since it has long supported the Palestinian cause and maintained close relations with Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cheered on the US attack on Venezuela, calling it the “perfect operation”.</p><p>The United States along with Israel is also simultaneously escalating its ongoing hybrid war against Iran. We can expect US and Israeli subversion, air strikes and targeted assassinations. The difference with Venezuela is that the hybrid war on Iran can easily escalate into a devastating regional war, even a global one. US allies in the region, especially the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">Gulf countries</a>, have been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to persuade Trump to back down and avoid military action.</p><p>The war on Iran has a history even longer than the war on Venezuela. The first US intervention in the country dates back to 1953 when democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalised Iran’s oil in defiance of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (today’s BP).</p><p>The CIA and MI6 orchestrated Operation Ajax to depose Mossadegh through a mix of propaganda, street violence and political interference. They reinstated Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled the country, fearing Mossadegh, and helped the shah solidify his grip on power. The CIA also supported the shah by helping create his notorious secret police, SAVAK, which crushed dissent through surveillance, censorship, imprisonment and torture.</p><p>Eventually this repression led to a revolution that swept Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power in 1979. During the revolution, students seized US hostages in Tehran after the US admitted the shah for medical treatment, leading to fear that the US would try to reinstall him in power. The hostage crisis further poisoned the relations between Iran and the US.</p><p>From then onwards, the US has plotted to torment Iran and overthrow its government. Among the countless hybrid actions the US has undertaken was funding Iraq in the 1980s to wage war on Iran, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths but failing to topple the government.</p><p>The US-Israeli objective vis-a-vis Iran is the opposite of a negotiated settlement that would normalise its position in the international system while constraining its nuclear programme. The real objective is to keep Iran economically broken, diplomatically cornered and internally pressured. Trump has repeatedly undercut negotiations that could have led to peace, starting with his withdrawal from the 2016 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that had seen Iran’s nuclear energy activities monitored and economic sanctions removed.</p><p>Understanding the hybrid war tactics helps to explain why Trump’s rhetoric oscillates so abruptly between threats of war and false offers of peace. Hybrid warfare thrives on contradictions, ambiguities and outright deceit.</p><p>Last summer, the US was supposed to have negotiations with Iran on June 15 but supported Israel’s bombing of the country two days earlier. For this reason, signs of de-escalation in recent days should not be taken at face value. They can all too readily be followed by a direct military attack.</p><p>The examples of Venezuela and Iran demonstrate just how addicted the US and Israel are to hybrid warfare. Acting together, the CIA, Mossad, allied military contractors and security agencies have fomented turmoil across Latin America and the Middle East for decades.</p><p>They have upended the lives of hundreds of millions of people, blocked economic development, created terror and generated mass refugee waves. They have nothing to show for spending billions on covert and overt operations beyond the chaos itself.</p><p>There is no security, no peace, no stable pro-US or pro-Israel alliance, only suffering. In the process, the US is also going out of its way to undermine the United Nations Charter, which it brought to life in the aftermath of World War II. The UN Charter makes clear that hybrid warfare violates the very basis of international law, which calls on countries to refrain from the use of force against other countries.</p><p>There is one beneficiary of hybrid war, and that is the military-tech industrial complex in the US and Israel. US President Dwight Eisenhower warned us in his 1961 farewell address of the profound danger of the military-industrial complex to society. His warning has come to pass even more than he imagined as it is now powered by artificial intelligence, mass propaganda and a reckless US foreign policy.</p><p>The world’s best hope is that the other 191 countries of the UN besides the US and Israel finally say no to their addiction to hybrid war: no to regime-change operations, no to unilateral sanctions, no to the weaponisation of the dollar and no to the repudiation of the UN Charter.</p><p>The American people do not support the lawlessness of their own government, but they have a very hard time making their opposition heard. They and almost all the rest of the world want the US deep state brutality to end before it’s too late.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
