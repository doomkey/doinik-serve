            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh –</strong> On a Thursday afternoon, 19-year-old Mahmudul Hasan prepared seating on the floor of his bamboo-and-tarpaulin home in Balukhali Rohingya Refugee camp.</p><p>Minutes later, 35 young children trooped in. Hasan is still in his teens, but he is their teacher. They greeted him in Rakhine language: “Sayar, Nay Kaung Lar? [Sir, how are you?]” The children are among 80 who study at Hasan’s community-run private school, where he teaches them Burmese, English and maths.</p><p>But nearby, a Bangladeshi government official on a motorcycle was trying to educate all those who would listen about something else: He was making announcements about the country’s upcoming February 12 elections.</p><p>Between February 9 and February 13, the official yelled out on a microphone, people in the refugee camp should keep their shops shut and not venture outside the camp. And he warned them: Anyone found participating in any political campaign would receive “serious punishment” – they could lose their registration card and a separate document that allows refugees access to subsidised rations.</p><p>The camps in Cox’s Bazar are home to more than 1 million Rohingya refugees, who were forced to flee Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military crackdown. At a time when most countries shunned them, Bangladesh – under then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina – gave them shelter. But the election season warnings to them were a reminder of how, at the same time, life in Bangladesh is life in limbo: Limited education, health, rations, livelihood options, and freedom of movement.</p><p>As Bangladesh’s 127 million voters prepare to elect their next government, Rohingya refugees like Hasan know that they aren’t real stakeholders.</p><p>“I don’t have any new expectations,” Hasan told Al Jazeera. “I deserve to live with dignity and human rights. This life [in Bangladesh] is not my choice.”</p><p>Still, he conceded, candidates from the two main political fronts in the election – the alliances led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami – in the Ukhia and Teknaf regions where the Rohingya camps are based, have spoken of the community’s concerns, as have national leaders from these parties.</p><p>That gives him some hope to cling to.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287278\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287278\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287278\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC3080-1770189355.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Rohingya family outside their temporary home in a camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Rohingya family outside their temporary home in a camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"it-s-not-sufficient\">‘It’s not sufficient’</h2><p>Hasan arrived in Bangladesh with his family when he was 10 years old in 2017, with other Rohingya refugees.</p><p>The massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar – where the community’s members are not even considered citizens – is currently being investigated by the International Court of Justice as a possible genocide. Meanwhile, in November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Myanmar’s military chief, Min Aung Hlaing, accusing him of committing crimes against the Rohingya in 2017.</p><p>Since then, Bangladesh has been home to the biggest chunk of Rohingya refugees globally.</p><p>But Nay San Lwin, a diaspora leader of the Rohingya and a co-chair of the Arakan Rohingya National Council (ARNC), said that while the community was grateful to Bangladesh’s government and people, the country’s policy of “non-integration” of the Rohingya meant that they remained on the peripheries of society. The camps are fenced with barbed wire, and Rohingya children can’t access the formal education system of Bangladesh, for instance.</p><p>“The elected government in February should focus on improving living conditions, access to education, healthcare, livelihoods, and fostering greater engagement between refugees and host communities,” he said.</p><p>That’s easier said than done, though. The Rohingya camps have run with financial support from the United Nations and global aid agencies – and funding cuts in recent years have hobbled the already limited services available to residents.</p><p>“The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate due to insecurity, funding cuts, lack of education, and uncertainty about the future,” said Sayed Ullah, president of the United Council of the Rohingya, a community organisation.</p><p>Hafez Ahmed, a 64-year-old shopkeeper in the camp, said medical facilities there were getting worse. “We only got the basic medicines they provide in the hospital. If any critical illness is detected, hospitals advise us to seek treatment at private hospitals, but we don’t have the money,” he told Al Jazeera. “Rations are getting less; it’s not sufficient.”</p><p>And for young Rohingya like the teenage teacher Hasan, life in the camp is one of dashed dreams.</p><p>“Living camp life is a trauma; camp life is like prison life,” he said.  “I wanted to be a world-class teacher who contributes to world education, but what can I say to myself, a fateless one?”</p><p>Growing frustrations with life in Bangladesh have led more and more Rohingya refugees to try to repeat the perilous journeys they once took to get to the country – to go elsewhere this time.</p><p>In a joint statement issued in November, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that in 2025, more than 5,300 Rohingya refugees embarked on dangerous maritime journeys. Many left Myanmar, but others were also trying to flee Bangladesh. In all, more than 600 are missing or have been killed.</p><p>Bibi Khadija, 23, is among those who tried to leave the refugee camps in Bangladesh. In November, she said, she tried “to go to Malaysia in search of a better life”. But after a human trafficker detained her and her three-year-old son, she escaped with the child. As she tried to make her way back to the camp, she asked locals in a market for help. Instead, she said, they “beat” her. “You are the Rohingya; you always create problems for us,” she recalled the mob telling her. Eventually, another local – a stranger – gave her some money to help her get back home.</p><p>Khadija’s story isn’t unique: The Rohingya in Bangladesh today sit at the intersection of a complex narrative, say experts – both treated as victims of a possible genocide, and held responsible for crime and strained social services.</p><p>As the country looks for a new start with the upcoming election, many – among both the Rohingya and Bangladeshis concerned about their presence in the nation – are hoping for a new deal for the community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287284\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287284\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287284\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC6062-1770189395.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, are home to more than one million Rohingya refugees [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, are home to more than one million Rohingya refugees [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"matter-of-utmost-priority\">‘Matter of utmost priority’</h2><p>In August 2024, then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, seeking exile after a major student-led uprising. She has now been sentenced, in absentia, to death for a brutal crackdown by her security forces against protesters, in which more than 1,400 people were killed.</p><p>Since her ouster, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has led an interim administration. Before the February 12 elections that will determine Bangladesh’s next government, the BNP and the Jamaat – the two main forces, with Hasina’s Awami League banned – have both spoken of the Rohingya crisis.</p><p>“Rohingya repatriation is a matter of utmost priority for the BNP,” party leader Israfil Khosru told Al Jazeera. Khosru is a special assistant to BNP chairperson Tarique Rahman’s Foreign Advisory Committee. In 1992, during the first term of Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, as the country’s prime minister, Bangladesh successfully repatriated Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. “We believe in safe and dignified repatriation of the Rohingyas. Their right to citizenship [in Myanmar] must be ensured.”</p><p>The Jamaat, meanwhile, has launched a platform to seek feedback on potential solutions to the Rohingya crisis from Bangladeshis and the diaspora. “We received a significant number of policy proposals from the people to solve the Rohingya crisis. We will examine those,” Jamaat’s assistant secretary, Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, said.</p><p>“Solving the Rohingya issue is one of our party’s top priorities, to return them to their homeland, Myanmar, with security and dignity,” he added. He said that while previous Bangladeshi governments have focused on seeking a resolution through the UN, “China, India, and other essential stakeholders should play an effective role,” too.</p><p>But Tanvir Habib, assistant professor in international relations at Dhaka University, said the Rohingya issue was not a major factor in the election campaign.</p><p>“The next government would need to engage global and regional stakeholders to ensure that support continues to reach this vulnerable community,” he said.</p><p>Thomas Kean, senior consultant on Bangladesh and Myanmar for the International Crisis Group, said Rohingya refugees would “welcome improvements to their living conditions in the camps” under whichever party wins the election.</p><p>But the refugees see “their stay in Bangladesh as temporary, so the focus remains repatriation”.</p><p>John Quinley, director at the human rights nonprofit Fortify Rights, cautioned that Bangladeshi parties need to go beyond using “the Rohingya as a political tool during election campaigns”.</p><p>“Whoever comes to power in Bangladesh must outline a comprehensive Rohingya strategy that goes beyond repatriation. Repatriation cannot be the sole political agenda for Bangladeshi leaders, as it is not possible at this time,” he argued. “The Myanmar junta continues to commit genocide against the Rohingya.”</p><p>Not everyone is as sympathetic to the Rohingya refugees.</p><p>Outside the camp in Cox’s Bazar, Mahabub Alam, a 29-year-old student and a resident of Ukhia, described the Rohingya as a “burden”.</p><p>“Rohingya are occupying our local labour market at a lower day wage rate, and the job market is decreasing. So the Rohingya issue is a big problem for us,” Alam said.</p><p>Alam also blamed the Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar for local crime, including human trafficking.</p><p>While Rohingya leaders push back against the community being characterised as responsible for crime and violence in parts of Bangladesh, those concerns extend beyond locals in Cox’s Bazar.</p><p>“People are getting impatient with the lingering Rohingya issue in Bangladesh,” Major-General Shahidul Haque, a former diplomat and Bangladeshi defence attache to Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. “It is impacting our law and order situation and our national security. I have attended seminars this week where everybody is worried and wants this solved. They are expecting the  next government to solve the issue.”</p><p>What that solution will look like is unclear.</p><p>But back in the camp in Cox’s Bazar, Ahmed, the Rohingya shopkeeper, knows what he wants from the next government in Bangladesh: Repatriation with rights, to Myanmar.</p><p>“I want to die in my homeland,” the sexagenarian said. “I want to return to my home.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Neither did I. But how do you do an agreement, a pact? It’s not as between twin brothers. It’s between opponents,” Petro said.</p><p>Separately, Trump told reporters from the Oval Office that he felt good about the meeting. “I thought it was terrific,” he said.</p><p>On the agenda for the two leaders were issues including the fight against transnational drug trafficking and security in Latin America.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from Tuesday’s meeting.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-white-house-charm-offensive\">A White House charm offensive</h2><p>Over the past year, Trump has invited the media to participate in his meetings with foreign leaders, often holding news conferences with the visiting dignitaries in the Oval Office.</p><p>Not this time, however. The meeting between Trump and Petro lasted nearly two hours, all of it behind closed doors.</p><p>But the two leaders emerged with largely positive things to say about one another.</p><p>In a post on social media, Petro revealed that Trump had gifted him several items, including a <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018764117893406985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commemorative photograph</a> of their meeting accompanied by a signed note.</p><p>“Gustavo – a great honor. I love Colombia,” it read, followed by Trump’s signature.</p><p>In another <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018772658737869234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, Petro showed off a signed copy of Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal. On its title page, Trump had scrawled another note to Petro: “You are great.”</p><p>“Can someone tell me what Trump said in this dedication?” Petro wrote jokingly in Spanish on social media. “I don’t understand much English.”</p><h2 id=\"a-turning-point-in-a-tense-relationship\">A turning point in a tense relationship?</h2><p>Petro’s joke appeared to be a cheeky nod to his notoriously rocky relationship with Trump.</p><p>It was only six days into Trump’s second term, on January 26, 2025, that he and Petro <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">began their feud</a>, trading threats on social media over the fate of two US deportation flights.</p><p>Petro objected to the reported human rights violations facing the deportees. Trump, meanwhile, took Petro’s initial refusal to accept the flights as a threat to US “national security”. Petro ultimately backed down after Trump threatened steep sanctions on imported Colombian goods.</p><p>They continued to trade barbs in the months since. Petro, for instance, has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/family-of-man-slain-in-a-us-boat-strike-in-the-caribbean-lodges-complaint\">condemned the deadly US attacks</a> on boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, comparing the strikes with murder.</p><p>He has also criticised Trump for carrying out a US military offensive in Venezuela to abduct then-President Nicolas Maduro. That attack, Petro said, was tantamount to “kidnapping”.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, stripped Petro of his US visa following the Colombian leader’s appearance at the United Nations General Assembly, where he criticised the US and briefly joined a pro-Palestinian protest.</p><p>The Trump administration also sanctioned Petro in October, blaming the left-wing leader for allowing “drug cartels to flourish”.</p><p>After removing Maduro from power on January 3, Trump offered a warning to Petro: he had better “watch his a**”. The statement was widely interpreted to be a threat of military action against Colombia.</p><p>But Trump and Petro appeared to have reached a turning point last month. On January 7, the two leaders held their first call together. Tuesday’s in-person meeting marked another first in their relationship.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"agreeing-to-disagree\">Agreeing to disagree</h2><p>Despite the easing tensions, the two leaders used their public statements after the meeting to reaffirm their differences.</p><p>Trump was the first to speak, holding a news conference in the Oval Office as he signed legislation to end a government shutdown.</p><p>The US president, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, used the appearance to reflect on the political tensions the two leaders had in the lead-up to the meeting.</p><p>“He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted, because I’d never met him,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>He added that Tuesday’s meeting was nevertheless pleasant. “I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well.”</p><p>Petro, meanwhile, held a longer news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, where he raised some points of divergence he had with Trump.</p><p>Among the topics he mentioned was Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which the US has supported, and sustainable energy initiatives designed to be carbon neutral. Trump, in the past, has called the so-called green energy programmes a “scam”.</p><p>Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing leader, also reflected on his region’s history with colonialism and foreign intervention. He told reporters it was important that Latin America make decisions for itself, free from any outside “coercion”.</p><p>“ We don’t operate under blackmail,” he said at one point, in an apparent reference to Trump’s pressure campaigns.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"differing-approach-to-combating-drug-trafficking\">Differing approach to combating drug trafficking</h2><p>One of the primary points of contention, however, was Petro’s approach to combating drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, responsible for 68 percent of the global supply.</p><p>The Trump administration has used the fight against global drug trafficking as a justification for carrying out lethal military strikes in international waters and in Venezuela, despite experts condemning the attacks as illegal under international law.</p><p>It has also stripped Colombia of its certification as an ally in its global counter-narcotics operations.</p><p>Trump’s White House has <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> it will consider reversing that decision if Petro takes “more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking”.</p><p>But Petro has rejected any attempt to label him as soft on drug trafficking, instead touting the historic drug busts his government has overseen.</p><p>He made this argument yet again after Tuesday’s meeting, claiming that no other Colombian administration had done as much as his to fight cocaine trafficking.</p><p>Rather than take a militarised approach to destroying crops of coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine, Petro argued that he has had more success with voluntary eradication programmes.</p><p>This push, he said, succeeded in “getting thousands of peasant farmers to uproot the plant themselves”.</p><p>“These are two different methods, two different ways of understanding how to fight drug trafficking,” Petro said. “One that is brutal and self-interested, and what it ends up doing is promoting mafia powers and drug traffickers, and another approach, which is intelligent, which is effective.”</p><p>Petro maintained it was more strategic to go after top drug-ring leaders than to punish impoverished rural farmers by forcibly ripping up their crops.</p><p>“I told President Trump, if you want an ally in fighting drug trafficking, it’s going after the top kingpins,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4286941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4286941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26034840917917-1770173498.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks at a podium\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during a news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, on February 3 [Jose Luis Magana/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-trumpian-note\">A Trumpian note</h2><p>Tuesday’s meeting ultimately marked yet another high-profile reversal for Trump, who has a history of shifting his relationships with world leaders.</p><p>Last year, for instance, he lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a public Oval Office clash, only to warm to the wartime leader several months later.</p><p>But Colombia is quickly approaching a pivotal presidential election in May, which will see Petro’s left-wing coalition, the Historic Pact, seek to defend the presidency against an ascendant far right.</p><p>Petro himself cannot run for consecutive terms under Colombian law. But there is speculation that Tuesday’s detente with Trump may help Petro’s coalition avoid US condemnation ahead of the vote.</p><p>Colombia, after all, was until recently the largest recipient of US aid in South America, and it has long harboured close ties with the North American superpower. Straining those ties could therefore be seen as an election liability.</p><p>While Petro acknowledged his differences with Trump during his remarks, at times he expressed certain views that overlapped with the US president’s.</p><p>Like Trump has in the past, Petro used part of his speech on Tuesday to question the role of the UN in maintaining global security.</p><p>“ Did it not show incapacity? Isn’t a reform needed?” Petro asked, wondering aloud if there was “something superior to the United Nations that would bring humanity together better in a better way”.</p><p>But when it came to donning Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Petro drew a line – or rather, a squiggle.</p><p>On social media, he shared an adjustment he made to the cap’s slogan. A jagged, Sharpie-inked “S” amended the phrase to include the entire Western Hemisphere: “Make Americas Great Again.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s when you realise that these people have no limits: They target the elderly, women and even young girls,” Angel said.</p><p>But the increasing political repression ultimately made her life in Merida, a college town in western Venezuela, untenable.</p><p>After 2024's disputed presidential election, Angel decided to voice her outrage on social media.</p><p>Maduro had claimed a third term in office, despite evidence that he had lost in a landslide. The opposition coalition obtained copies of more than 80 percent of the country's voter tallies, showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had won the race.</p><p>Protests again broke out, and again, Maduro's government responded with force.</p><p>Military and security officers detained nearly 2,000 people, including opposition leaders, journalists and human rights lawyers.</p><p>When Angel denounced the arbitrary detentions on TikTok, she began receiving daily threats.</p><p>By day, anonymous phone calls warned her of her impending arrest. By night, she heard pro-government gangs on motorcycles circling her home.</p><p>Fearing detention, she fled to Colombia in August 2024, leaving her family and friends behind.</p><p>But living outside Venezuela gave her a new perspective. She came to realise that the threats, persecution and violence she had learned to live with were not normal in a democratic country.</p><p>“When you leave, you realise that it isn’t normal to be afraid of the police, of unknown phone calls,” said Angel, her voice trembling. “I’m afraid to go back to my country and to be in that reality again.”</p><p>For exiled Venezuelans to return safely, Angel believes certain benchmarks must be met. The interim government must end arbitrary detention and allow opposition members, many of whom fled Venezuela, to return.</p><p>Only then, she explained, will Venezuela have moved past Maduro's legacy.</p><p>“Exiles being able to return is a real test of whether a new country is taking shape,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, NATO rejected the offer, and the bombardment of Libya continued.</p><p>By the end of June, the International Criminal Court (ICC) had issued an arrest warrant against Saif al-Islam, but he remained at large until after the <a href=\"/news/2011/10/21/muammar-gaddafi-killed-as-sirte-falls/\">death of his father</a> and his brother, Mutassim, in Sirte, on October 20, 2011.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"prison\">Prison</h2><p>Following long negotiations with the ICC, which had been calling for his extradition, Libyan officials were granted the authority to try Saif al-Islam in Libya for war crimes committed during the 2011 uprising.</p><p>At the time, Saif al-Islam’s defence lawyers feared that a trial in Libya would not be motivated by justice, but a desire for revenge. The UN estimated that up to 15,000 people were killed in the conflict, while Libya’s National Transitional Council placed the figure as high as 30,000.</p><p>In 2014, Saif al-Islam <a href=\"/news/2014/5/11/saif-al-islam-appears-before-libya-court\">appeared via videolink</a> in the Tripoli court where his trial was held, as he was imprisoned in Zintan at the time. In July 2015, the Tripoli court sentenced him to death in absentia.</p><p>However, in 2017, he was released by the Abu Bakr as-Siddiq Battalion, a militia that controlled Zintan, as part of an amnesty issued by Libya’s eastern authorities, which are not recognised internationally.</p><p>But he did not re-emerge publicly for years, and continued to be wanted by the ICC. In July 2021, Saif al-Islam gave a rare interview to The New York Times, in which he accused authorities in Libya of being “afraid of … elections”.</p><p>Explaining his underground persona, he said he had “been away from the Libyan people for 10 years”.</p><p>“You need to come back slowly, slowly. Like a striptease,” he added.</p><p>He went on to make his first public appearance in years in November 2021, in the city of Sebha, where he filed to run for the Libyan presidency in an attempt to resurrect the ambitions of his father’s former supporters.</p><p>Initially banned from taking part, he was later reinstated, but the election did not take place as a result of Libya’s tumultuous political situation, with two rival administrations vying for power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"progressive-face\">‘Progressive’ face</h2><p>A Western-educated and well-spoken man, Saif al-Islam presented a progressive face to the oppressive Libyan government. He received a PhD from the London School of Economics in 2008. His dissertation dealt with the role of civil society in reforming global governance.</p><p>He was prominent in his calls for political reform, and was extremely visible and active in the drive to repair Libya’s relations with the West between the year 2000 and the start of the 2011 uprising.</p><p>The London School of Economics was <a href=\"/news/2011/12/2/lse-slammed-over-gaddafi-ties\">later condemned</a> for having sought a relationship with the Libyan regime, namely for accepting Saif al-Islam as a student, who had signed an agreement for a $2.4m gift from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation on the day of his doctorate ceremony.</p><p>As an internationally prominent negotiator and influencer, Saif al-Islam could claim a number of victories and prominent roles. He played a pivotal role in the nuclear negotiations with Western powers, including the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html\">United States</a> and the UK.</p><p>He was also prominent when negotiating <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/08/2008491330697403.html\">compensation</a> for families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing, the Berlin nightclub attack, and the UTA Flight 772, which detonated over the Sahara Desert.</p><p>And he mediated the release of six medics – five of whom were Bulgarian – who were accused of infecting children with HIV in Libya in the late 1990s. The medics were imprisoned for eight years in 1999 and, upon their release, announced that they had been tortured while in detention.</p><p>He had several other proposals, including “Isratine”, a proposal for a permanent resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through a secular one-state solution. He also hosted peace talks between the Philippine government and leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which resulted in a peace agreement that was signed in 2001.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The stock was up 2.1 percent from the market open in midday trading.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Walmart, which has 11,000 stores in 19 countries, joins a slate of nine corporate giants in the so-called trillion dollar club, including Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, among others. Amazon is the only other retailer that has broken the barrier and is now valued at $2.6 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"trade-deal-bump\">Trade deal bump</h2><p>On Monday, United States President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India that would slash tariffs to 18 percent from 50 percent and that impacts Walmart, which has strategically shifted supply chain operations to India and away from China.</p><p>On Tuesday, in an interview with CNBC, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the White House is still ironing out the details of the deal, but that still hasn’t slowed Walmart’s stock from <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popping on the looming deal</a>.</p><p>“We have an announcement of an India deal, but still no timeline about when it comes into effect and whether the secondary tariffs, the 25 percent linked to India’s purchase of Russian oil, when those would be removed, so I think there’s still a lot of questions,” economist Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While there are limited details on the specifics of the deal, markets are responding to tariffs likely to come down.</p><p>“Markets are, of course, forward-looking. I think this sort of reinforces a view in the marketplace that incremental tariffs will be less this year,” Ziemba said.</p><p>The big box retailer jumped from 2 percent of its global exports coming from India in 2018 to 25 percent in 2023, according to a Reuters review of import data in 2023. Walmart hopes to source $10bn in goods from India by next year.</p><p>At the time, the company also decreased its percentage of goods from China to 60 percent from 80 percent.</p><p>Walmart did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), a lobby for exporters, said the cut in US tariffs will significantly boost Indian exports, including textiles and apparel, putting them on par with Asian peers, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.</p><p>According to data from ImportYeti, a platform that tracks import contracts for major companies, Walmart’s biggest import areas are in home fabrics, apparel and toys.</p><p>“Those are the products facing the highest tariffs, while consumer electronics and other categories have largely been shielded. If the India–US deal becomes a reality, it would put tariffs on Indian goods entering the US at roughly the same level as those from Southeast Asia, making that supply-chain realignment more attractive. You also highlight the importance of the Indian market,” Ziemba added.</p><p>While the trade deal is in focus, Walmart has also invested significantly in India domestically, as well, and holds an 80 percent stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart.</p><h2 id=\"c-suite-changes\">C-suite changes</h2><p>The surge also comes concurrently with a shake-up in the C-suite. On Monday, John Furner took over as Walmart’s chief executive, succeeding longtime CEO Doug McMillion who announced his retirement late last year.</p><p>Furner, who started at the company in a job stocking shelves, has climbed up the ladder. Most recently, he served as the CEO of Walmart US, where he focused on key initiatives driving growth, including curbside pick-up. Prior to that, he served as the CEO of Sam’s Club, Walmart’s wholesale chain.</p><p>Furner’s appointment comes as the company grows as an e-commerce giant and intends to double down in AI tech, healthcare services, e-commerce, and hybrid options with its brick-and-mortar footprint.</p><p>“As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members,” Walmart said in a statement last month.</p><p>“Walmart is masterful at brick-and-mortar retail and remains highly competitive with Amazon. I love that because it shows consumerism is still alive and well. Five years ago, the narrative was the fall of the mall and the decline of retail. This confirms the opposite. Walmart also has a clear strategy for retaining consumers and managing the customer experience,” Brett Rose, CEO and founder of United National Consumer Suppliers (UNCS), a distributor that focuses on excess inventories, which it provides to more budget-friendly retailers, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The tech-centric focus comes as e-commerce has grown for the company, which reported a 28 percent jump in e-commerce sales compared with the previous quarter. Walmart is slated to release its next earnings report on February 19.</p><p>“What you need to look at is that Walmart has successfully become a marketplace, not as big as Amazon, but big enough to give it a run for its money,” said Rose.</p></div></div></body></html>"
