His return brought his authority closer to the ground, but it also exposed the difficulty of converting symbolic leadership into effective organisational control.</p><p>One of the immediate challenges the BNP faced was enforcing discipline within the party. Some 92 candidates are contesting against official BNP nominees in 79 of the country’s 300 constituencies, highlighting persistent factionalism at the local level.</p><p>“This seems higher than at any previous time,” said Al Masud Hasanuzzaman, an analyst and professor of political science at Jahangirnagar University.</p><p>Moreover, a recent study by Transparency International Bangladesh found that 91 percent of political violence recorded since August 5, 2024, involved BNP activists, a statistic that raises further questions about the party’s internal control.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299734\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Leaders-since-1971-1770627773.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Leaders since 1971\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Political analyst Dilara Chowdhury, who has studied the nationalist politics of Rahman’s parents, said the lack of discipline within the BNP became increasingly visible during this year’s <a href=\"/features/2026/2/3/jobs-cash-loans-can-bangladeshs-parties-deliver-on-election-promises\">election campaign</a>.</p><p>“This is a major weakness,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “He [Rahman] has not been able to establish discipline within the party so far. Rebel candidates have emerged and, in many cases, they are openly challenging the central leadership.”</p><p>While Hasanuzzaman frames Rahman’s reliance on family legacy as an advantage in the election, Chowdhury sees it as a source of heightened expectation – and pressure.</p><p>“To outshine leaders like Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman is never easy,” Chowdhury said. “I do not think he has yet demonstrated that level of charisma.”</p><p>Chowdhury said the election is the first decisive test of Rahman’s leadership. “If he can lead the party to victory despite all these challenges, that would mark his first real success as a leader in his own right.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"very-little-homework\">‘Very little homework’</h2><p>Rahman’s public messaging has also drawn scrutiny. Analysts say his speeches, often combining ambitious promises with factual inaccuracies, erode confidence, especially among undecided voters.</p><p>Fact-checks of several of his claims have been widely shared online.</p><p>At a rally in the southern district of Faridpur, Rahman said the area produces large quantities of soya beans. The claim was quickly challenged, as soya bean is not a major crop there, with cultivation concentrated mainly in Bangladesh’s southern coastal belt.</p><p>In another instance, a viral graphic mocked several of his pledges as either already implemented or recycled from the 2001-2006 BNP-Jamaat-led government, including declaring the coastal city of Chattogram as the country’s “commercial capital”.</p><p>Analysts and party insiders say such episodes point to gaps in Rahman’s research and leadership, and complicate his efforts to project himself as a national leader who is prepared.</p><p>“Yes, he makes mistakes in speeches,” admitted a BNP leader in southern Bangladesh, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But he was outside the country for a long time. We believe he will improve.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Analyst Chowdhury said his lack of preparation was an issue.</p><p>“He has taken charge of the campaign, but there is very little homework,” she said. “He ends up saying many things that are simply wrong, like claiming he will plant 500 million trees. That is not a credible proposition.”</p><p>Chowdhury also questioned the feasibility of Rahman’s flagship policy proposals, including a “family card” to provide monthly cash to women and the unemployed. “Once you talk about family cards, the obvious question is where the money will come from,” she said. “And if you provide allowances to the unemployed indefinitely, there is a risk the economy becomes less productive.”</p><p>Rahman’s anticorruption rhetoric has also failed to instill confidence among people, Chowdhury said. “He is saying he will eliminate corruption, while he has nominated 23 loan defaulters for the election.”</p><p>In a televised address to the nation on Monday evening, Rahman sought to address such concerns, acknowledging past failures under the BNP’s government and pledging a hard line on corruption.</p><p>“There is no alternative to making the state and government accountable to the people,” he said. “If entrusted with power, a BNP government will be as firm as possible in controlling corruption and restoring the rule of law – this is our commitment to the nation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Khan Sobayel bin Rafiq, a political commentator and former military officer, pointed to the gap between Rahman’s personal appeal and the BNP’s ability to counter longstanding narratives about corruption within its ranks.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Young voters aged between 18 and 26 did not witness BNP rule,” Sobayel told Al Jazeera. “Many of them have internalised the idea that BNP represents corruption and ‘chandabazi’ [extortion]. The party has not been able to decisively turn that perception around.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Sobayel, who describes himself as a victim of Hasina’s hardline policies, himself spent 11 years in forced exile in Malaysia after he, as a member of a military committee investigating a 2009 mutiny by soldiers from the Bangladesh Rifles regiment, refused to endorse what he called a “fabricated investigation report” pushed by the government.</p><p>Thomas Kean, a consultant for Bangladesh and Myanmar at the International Crisis Group, thinks Bangladesh is unlikely to return to the kind of repression seen during Hasina’s long years in power. But he also warned that perceptions about the BNP at the grassroots level continue to shape the public’s trust.</p><p>“The leadership appears to recognise that something has fundamentally changed in Bangladesh,” Kean said. “At the same time, allegations of extortion and criminal activity – whether accurate or not – have damaged the party’s image, particularly among younger voters.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299914\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299914\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299914\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26040342415742-1770631988.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"BNP leader Tarique Rahman Bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rahman waves to supporters during an election rally in Dhaka, on February 9, 2026 [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"loyalty-over-meritocracy\">‘Loyalty over meritocracy’</h2><p>On Friday, while unveiling the BNP’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/analysis-bangladeshs-bnp-seeks-hasinas-liberal-mantle-before-elections\">election manifesto</a> at a luxury hotel in Dhaka, Rahman spoke about the importance of placing “the right person in the right position”.</p><p>Analysts, as well as some party insiders, said they were unsure about whether that principle was reflected in how his campaign team was assembled.</p><p>A BNP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of internal party matters during an election, said Rahman’s public communication shifted after his return, shaped by advisers who accompanied him during his years in exile.</p><p>“He brought his close aides from London, who, like him, had been away from Bangladesh for 17 years,” the leader told Al Jazeera. “A lot has changed in that time, and there is a perception that they have struggled to grasp the changed realities.”</p><p>The party insider said Rahman’s interactions with people are being tightly managed, limiting his exposure to grassroots feedback despite his extensive travels across the country. “Although he is travelling all over Bangladesh, he remains isolated from ground reality,” the BNP leader said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The party insider also alleged that Rahman “opted for loyalty over meritocracy”.</p><p>“You can run a party with people who are loyal to you, but not a government. This is his biggest challenge. If he wants to govern, he will need to promote meritocracy and bring in professionals who can offer sound advice – and that has been missing so far.”</p><p>Analyst Chowdhury agreed, saying the issue has created tensions within the BNP, with many local leaders who endured arrests and hardships during Hasina’s government feeling sidelined. This could undermine Rahman’s appeal, particularly among younger voters.</p><p>“While he was in London, the people around him there are now being given more importance than those who stood by him inside the country,” she told Al Jazeera. “There is a conflict between these groups.”</p><h2 id=\"will-dynasty-undermine-political-legitimacy\">Will dynasty undermine political legitimacy?</h2><p>Asif Mohammad Shahan, a professor of development studies at Dhaka University, thinks Rahman is in “a difficult position”.</p><p>“If the party does not win by a landslide, he will be blamed. If it wins comfortably, people will say it was expected. There is no clear win for him,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Central to both his appeal and the criticism he faces is Rahman’s lineage.</p><p>As the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and three-time leader Khaleda, he embodies a political dynasty that many younger voters say they want to move beyond, even as that legacy continues to mobilise people across the country.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299703\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_At-a-glance-1770627233.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_AT A GLANCE_Feb_9_2026_3\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>BNP leaders, however, reject the idea that being part of a dynasty undermines political legitimacy.</p><p>In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir argued that political inheritance is common across South Asia and should not disqualify a leader if he is “capable, accountable and subject to public scrutiny”.</p><p>Analysts take a more nuanced view, despite seeing Rahman as a leading contender for the premiership.</p><p>Sobayel bin Rafiq, the former military officer, distinguishes the individual and his organisation. “Tarique Rahman as a person and the BNP as a party are two different things,” he said. “I want to see him as the prime minister. But overall, the party’s performance as an organisation has not been strong.”</p><p>Analyst Chowdhury points to a different reality.</p><p>“It seems a segment of the civil and military bureaucracy may support a BNP victory because they see it as a return to a familiar status quo, where they can protect their vested interests,” she said.</p><p>For Rahman, however, the election is not just a contest for power, but a referendum on whether his return from exile marks a genuine break from the past or merely a familiar cycle under a new leadership.</p><p>“If any unintentional mistakes were made while governing the country in the past, I sincerely apologise to the people,” he said in his address to the nation on Monday. “Learning from those mistakes, and building on our achievements, we want to create a safe Bangladesh for the present and future generations.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He would not stay at a hotel or with friends. Instead, he would stay at what used to be his father’s office in Aleppo’s Old City.</p><p>There was only one problem.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Not a single room had a closable window or door,” Shaar, who had been away from the city for a decade, told Al Jazeera. Aleppo’s winters are brutally cold, with temperatures reaching well below zero degrees Celsius.</p><p>Still, he bought a sleeping bag that had been advertised as capable of withstanding extreme weather.</p><p>“That didn’t turn out to be true, and I still woke up with cold toes many nights,” he said. But despite the cold, he did not regret the decision.</p><p>Although his trip to Syria was short – about two weeks, in part due to flight cancellations after <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">armed clashes in Aleppo</a> – Shaar started renovating his old family home, also in the Old City, that had been looted and damaged during the war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The roof was collapsing, and the door to the street had been removed. Two weeks did not seem to be enough time to make a dent in the extensive renovation work required.</p><p>But he got the job done, and placed a metal door on the house to signal that it was no longer an abandoned property.</p><p>“I was happy. I was truly, truly happy to be in Aleppo, not as a guest or as a tourist, but as an Aleppan,” he said. “As someone who is home. And I felt at home.”</p><p>Thousands of Syrians are returning to Aleppo, a great city damaged by years of neglect and war. Much of it, however, is plagued by infrastructure damage, requiring significant reconstruction efforts.</p><p>The new Syrian government – in power since December 2024 – has already started some of the work to rebuild Aleppo. But residents wonder if this will be enough to bring the city back to its past glory.</p><h2 id=\"years-of-damage\">Years of damage</h2><p>Aleppo was Syria’s most populous city until the war heavily reduced its population.</p><p>Its geographical position made it an important stop on the Silk Road trade route, as well as for travellers who passed through Anatolia – a large peninsula in Turkiye – eastwards into Iraq or further south towards Damascus.</p><p>While the emergence of Egypt’s Suez Canal in international shipping diminished Aleppo’s regional role, it still maintained an importance in Syria for being the country’s capital of industry.</p><p>Its prominence lasted throughout the rule of President Hafez al-Assad, who took control of Syria in 1970. The Assad regime’s massacre in the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/hama-a-rebellious-syrian-town-that-can-finally-mourn-the-assad-massacre\">town of Hama</a> in the early 1980s also spread to Aleppo, where thousands of opponents were killed. Still, the city held on.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>However, by the time the 2011 Syrian uprising came around, Aleppo had already faced a lack of state investment and neglect.</p><p>The city deteriorated further as Bashar al-Assad, who took over the presidency when Hafez, his father, died in 2000, violently cracked down, and Syria deteriorated into war. Aleppo soon became divided, with regime forces controlling the west and the opposition controlling the east.</p><p>Then, in 2016, the Assad regime, with the help of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Iran and Russia, violently took the eastern part of the city, which had become the capital of the Syrian revolution. In the process, they <a href=\"/news/2017/11/17/totally-destroyed-east-aleppo-a-year-after-battle\">destroyed vast swaths</a> of east Aleppo, expelling thousands.</p><p>As the Assad regime fell a little more than eight years later, some of Aleppo’s <a href=\"/features/2024/12/22/displaced-youth-liberate-aleppo\">children returned as its liberators</a>. But they found that the regime had not rebuilt the city during their absence. Many of Aleppo’s suburbs, where Syrian production had flourished in the pre-war years, were now ghost towns, after the regime had cut off water and electricity services.</p><p>Aleppo is still struggling. Informal settlements and overcrowded schools are common in the city and the rest of northern Syria, where a European Union <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/funding/hip2026/echo_syr_bud_2026_91000_v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> in January said that “2.3 million people reside in camps and informal settlements, of which 80 [percent] are women and children”.</p><p>Locals say they fear Aleppo may never be the same again.</p><p>“There is nothing that will return to the same as it was,” Roger Asfar, an Aleppo-native and the Syrian country director for the Adyan Foundation, an independent organisation focused on citizenship, diversity management and community engagement, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Asfar said that Aleppo’s needs are the same as all parts of Syria devastated by more than a decade of war. Reconstruction is among the top priorities, but it will require heavy investment, particularly if the city’s historic character is to be protected.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reconstruction\">Reconstruction</h2><p>The Syrian government has worked with organisations like the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) to restore parts of Aleppo’s Old City, including its historic souk – a 13km-long (8 miles) covered marketplace.</p><p>The government also installed water pipes and new lighting around the city’s historic citadel, its crown jewel and a tourist attraction for both Syrians and foreigners. The municipality of Aleppo has also collaborated with the Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums to rehabilitate parts of the citadel, as well as the Old City’s Grand Umayyad Mosque.</p><p>Still, the effort to rebuild Aleppo is Herculean and will require more investment.</p><p>Asfar said the challenge starts with governance. This requires that Damascus, instead of merely imposing its decisions on the city, consults with locals. “Aleppo doesn’t need an authority that decides on its own and ignores all other voices,” he said.</p><p>The Aleppo governorate, which includes the city and eight districts in northern Syria, is Syria’s most densely populated region, according to UNICEF. Its 4.2 million population is forced to live with the problems facing much of Syria, including infrastructural issues and long power cuts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Shaar, the Aleppan native who recently visited his hometown, is also a founding scholar on the Aleppo Project, a Central European University project that aims to address the key issues facing the city’s eventual reconstruction.</p><p>He said he expects infrastructural issues to “improve in the coming years”, particularly as Syria’s oil and gas revenues increase. But he warns that expectations should be tempered.</p><p>Shaar is one Aleppan who holds out hope that the city may bounce back. He pointed out that a silver lining of Assad’s neglect is that the city had not become gentrified by the former government’s economic and political elites, unlike Homs or Damascus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"to-return-or-not-to-return\">To return or not to return?</h2><p>Aleppo has always been a city defined by its culture and diversity. Some Aleppans hope this of its character will return.</p><p>Musician Bassel Hariri is an Aleppo native, now based in London, who learned to play instruments from his father. He remembers the rich and diverse tradition of his native city, which has been passed on from one generation to the next.</p><p>“Music, art, cooking, whatever – everything is carried directly from the community,” Hariri said. “And this richness and this cultural access and the diversity of Aleppo makes it one of the most wonderful cities in Syria.”</p><p>While the city may not return to its past glory, thousands of Syrians are still coming back to their homes in Aleppo and its countryside. Others simply have nowhere else to go.</p><p>For Shaar, Aleppo is still calling. Two things are keeping him away: his wife’s full-time job as a lecturer in Germany, and the lack of a stable salary in Syria.</p><p>“Not much more than this,” he said. “It wouldn’t take much to bring me back to Aleppo, personally.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of the drones launched, 116 were shot down or neutralised, and some missiles were intercepted and did not reach their targets, the Air Force said.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian attacks have damaged production sites of Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas company Naftogaz in the Poltava and Sumy regions of the country, the company’s CEO, Sergii Koretskyi, said in a Facebook post. Koretskyi said it was the 20th attack on the company’s infrastructure since the start of this year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian forces are trying to press forward around the city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv’s military said, hoping to conclude a months-long campaign to seize the strategic hub as Moscow seeks to capture the whole of the Donetsk region. The fall of Pokrovsk would mark Russia’s biggest battlefield victory since it seized the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kyiv’s General Staff said its forces still hold the northern part of <a href=\"/features/2025/11/10/is-the-fall-of-pokrovsk-ukraines-key-eastern-stronghold-inevitable\">Pokrovsk</a>, a city with a pre-war population of 60,000, and are also defending the smaller city of Myrnohrad nearby. Pokrovsk has been the site of fierce fighting since last year.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h3>Weapons</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine is opening up exports of its domestically produced weapons, including combat drones, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, as a way for Kyiv to earn money from wartime technology and generate badly needed funds for the country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Zelenskyy said that 10 “export centres” for Ukrainian weapons would be opened in 2026 across Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Ukraine and France have agreed to start “large-scale” joint weapons production, Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on the Telegram messaging app, after hosting his French counterpart, Catherine Vautrin, in Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Fedorov did not specify what arms would be produced with France or when manufacturing would be launched.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>An agreement on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine must also take into consideration security guarantees for Russia, Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Grushko told the Izvestia media outlet. These guarantees include the rejection of any deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO states, he said.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia remains open to cooperation with the United States, but is not hopeful about economic ties despite Washington’s ongoing efforts to end the war in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the Russia-based media outlet TV BRICS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has claimed that suspects held for the shooting of one of the country’s most senior military intelligence officers in Moscow last week, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/senior-russian-officer-shot-in-moscow-in-apparent-assassination-attempt\">Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev,</a> have confessed that they were carrying out orders from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The FSB also claimed that Polish intelligence was involved in their recruitment. Neither Ukraine nor Poland has commented on the allegations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">India plans to maintain multiple sources of energy supply and diversify them when needed, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said. The minister’s comments come after US President Donald Trump said last week that New Delhi had “committed to stop directly or indirectly” importing fuel from Russia.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Germany has indicted a Ukrainian national in connection with allegations of a plot linked to Russian intelligence to detonate parcel packages in Europe, German prosecutors said in a statement. The suspect was arrested in Switzerland in May of last year and extradited to Germany in December. Moscow has previously denied involvement in the alleged plot.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The European Union has proposed extending its sanctions against Russia to include ports in Georgia and Indonesia that handle Russian oil, the first time the bloc would target ports in third countries that deal with Russia, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a proposal document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The proposal bars EU companies and individuals from conducting transactions with the ports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The EU also proposed adding two Kyrgyz banks – Keremet and OJSC Capital Bank of Central Asia – to its sanctions list for providing crypto asset services to Russia, as well as banks in Laos and Tajikistan, while removing two Chinese lenders.

A separate case in Los Angeles, which accuses Meta and the Google-owned YouTube of deliberately designing their platforms to be addictive for children, is set to begin later this week.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>TikTok and Snap were also named in the original California lawsuit but later settled under undisclosed terms.</p><p>The New Mexico and California lawsuits are the first of a wave of 40 lawsuits filed by state attorneys general around the US against Meta, specifically, that allege that the social media giant is harming the mental health of young Americans.</p><h2 id=\"new-mexico-case\">New Mexico case</h2><p>In the opening argument in the New Mexico case, which was first filed in 2023, prosecutors told jurors on Monday that Meta – Facebook and Instagram’s parent company – had failed to disclose its platforms’ harmful effects on kids.</p><p>“The theme throughout this trial is going to be that Meta put profits over safety,” said lawyer Donald Migliori, who is representing the state of New Mexico against Meta.</p><p>“Meta clearly knew that youth safety was not its corporate priority… that youth safety was less important than growth and engagement.”</p><p>Prosecutors say they will provide evidence and testimony that Meta’s algorithms and account features not only enticed young people and made them addicted to social media, but also fostered a “breeding ground” for predators who target children for sexual exploitation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Late last month, in the process of discovery, the New Mexico attorney general’s office said the company did not put in safeguards to protect children from accessing sexualised chatbots on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>In emails obtained by the court, some of Meta’s safety staff had expressed objections that the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing do not include messages or memos authored by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In October 2025, Meta added parental controls to the chatbots.</p><h2 id=\"california-case\">California case</h2><p>The California case is more wide-reaching and alleges that Meta and YouTube, which is a unit of Alphabet-owned Google, used deliberate design choices that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits.</p><p>The case centres around a 19-year-old identified only by the initials KGM. The case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out.</p><p>KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age made her <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\">addicted to the technology</a> and exacerbated her depression and suicidal thoughts.</p><p>“Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>Executives, including Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. It is unclear if they will attend the New Mexico case.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevvy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>“Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,” Meta said in a recent blog post. “But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens’ well-being aren’t clear-cut or universal.</p><p>Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.”</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said in a recent statement that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it is “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people”.</p><p>Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesperson, said the allegations against YouTube are “simply not true”.</p><p>“Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” he said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"high-stakes\">High stakes</h2><p>The outcome of the cases could shape the future of social media.</p><p>“In my mind, an existential question for social media services is whether they’re liable for harm suffered by users from using the services. If so, the damages could be more money than the defendants have, Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We’re talking about massive financial stakes, and we’re also talking about the ability of the plaintiffs to veto or potentially override editorial decisions by the services about what’s in the best interests of their audiences,” he said.</p><p>“It’s essentially taking away power from the services to decide and handing it to plaintiffs’ lawyers. So, not only could there be existential damages, but there could also be a massive loss of editorial control over their services. The stakes could not be higher for social media services or the internet.”</p><p>Goldman said this was because the same argument could be used to shape claims against video game makers and generative AI, which refers to AI that can create original content, including text and video.</p><p>“If these theories work against social media, they might also work against video games, against generative AI, and who knows what else. That’s why I said the stakes are so high for the internet,” he added.</p><p>There are already lawsuits that claim that interactions with OpenAI’s ChatGPT led to instances of suicide and murder-suicide.</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock is trending up by more than 3 percent in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

agreement signed between the two countries, granting exemptions for some textiles and garments manufactured with US material.</p><p>The trade deal was announced on Monday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser heading Bangladesh’s interim government, said Washington had “committed to establishing a mechanism for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh using US-produced cotton and man-made fibre to receive zero reciprocal tariff in [the] US market”.</p><p>The White House said Bangladesh had agreed to provide significant preferential market access for US industrial and agricultural goods, including chemicals, medical devices, machinery, motor vehicles and parts, soya products and dairy goods, beef, poultry, tree nuts and fruit.</p><p>Bangladesh will also ease non-tariff barriers by accepting US vehicle safety and emissions standards, recognising US Food and Drug Administration certifications, and removing import restrictions on remanufactured goods, the White House added.</p><p>The nations also noted recent and upcoming commercial deals including aircraft procurement, around $3.5bn in purchases of US agricultural products, and an estimated $15bn in US energy product purchases over 15 years.</p><p>Yunus said the agreement followed nine months of negotiations that began in April last year.</p><p>Bangladesh also pledged to uphold internationally recognised labour rights and strengthen environmental protections.</p><p>The South Asian nation in August had secured a reduction in US tariffs on its exports to 20 percent, down from 37 percent initially proposed by Washington, offering much-needed relief to the nation’s apparel exporters.</p><p>The ready-made garments sector is the backbone of Bangladesh’s economy, accounting for more than 80 percent of total export earnings, employing about four million workers and contributing about 10 percent to gross domestic product.</p><p>At the 19 percent tariff rate, Bangladesh will compete comfortably with next-door neighbour India, for which the tariff rate has been set at <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 percent</a>, down from a crippling 50 percent. Both countries make clothing and footwear for clients in the US. When the first round of tariffs was announced on April 2, India had been slammed with 25 percent while Dhaka had been given a much stiffer 37 percent. At the time, Bangladeshi manufacturers feared that they would lose clients to the Indian market. Now both are on an equal footing.</p><p>Bangladesh goes to the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polls on Thursday</a> to elect new leadership after being governed by an interim government since August 2024, when ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, where she remains.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The files show that both Trump and Clinton spent time with the sex offender in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>Clinton and his wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are both set to sit for depositions later this month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-got-nothing\">‘We got nothing’</h2><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said that “people were waiting to hear answers to important questions” during the deposition, “but we got nothing”.</p><p>“What she did say, very briefly, was that she never saw any evidence of Trump or Clinton involved in anything that was illegal,” Fisher said. “Many people suggest that was a deliberate ploy on her part to say, ‘Look, you buy my silence, but I want clemency.’ She’s appealing to both parties here to say, ‘I will clear the people that you care most about’.”</p><p>Asked about Maxwell’s appeal, the White House on Monday pointed to previous remarks from the president that indicated the prospect of a pardon was not on his radar.</p><p>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, meanwhile, expressed frustration with Maxwell’s refusal to testify, noting that she had previously spoken with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who had worked as Trump’s personal lawyer.</p><p>“This position appears inconsistent with Ms Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter,” Khanna said.</p><p>Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas after <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-justice-department-to-discuss-epstein-with-ghislaine-maxwell\">meeting twice with Blanche</a> last year. The deputy attorney general cited “numerous threats against her life”, without providing details.</p><p>The move prompted questions from Democratic lawmakers, who asked whether Maxwell had “been given special treatment in exchange for political favours” as Trump’s own relationship with Epstein comes under growing scrutiny.</p><p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the Epstein scandal a “hoax”, and saying he broke off ties in the early 2000s, before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a prostitution charge.</p><p>Maxwell is the only person convicted of crimes related to Epstein, whose connections to powerful individuals worldwide have been revealed in the Epstein files.</p><p>The release of the documents has set in motion political crises in multiple countries, including in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer is clinging to his job after it was revealed that his former ambassador to the US had maintained close ties with Epstein.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers, however, bemoaned that political figures in the US seem to be escaping unscathed so far.</p><p>“I’m just afraid that the general worsening and degradation of American life has somehow conditioned people not to take this as seriously as we should be taking it,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unredacted-files\">Unredacted files</h2><p>Separately, on Monday, several Democratic and Republican lawmakers also visited a Justice Department office in Washington, DC, to look through the unredacted versions of the Epstein files. The lawmakers were given access to the more than 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers, as part of an arrangement with the Justice Department.</p><p>The lawmakers can only make handwritten notes, and their staff are not allowed in with them.</p><p>In a news conference after their visit, Khanna and Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who sponsored the legislation to force the release of the files, expressed concern that some names had been removed from the records that have been made public.</p><p>The law allows redactions to protect the identities of victims, but says no records could be withheld “on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary”.</p><p>Massie told reporters that he has identified six individuals who are “likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files”, but whose names were redacted.</p><p>Khanna said that “there’s no explanation” why the names of those people were withheld.</p><p>The two lawmakers declined to name the six individuals, but Massie said one was “pretty high up” in a foreign government, and Khanna noted that another is a “prominent individual”.</p><p>Massie also called on the Justice Department to pursue accountability for the men, but said he could potentially name them in a House floor speech, where his actions would be constitutionally protected from lawsuits.</p><p>In a subsequent social media post, Massie shared an image of a redacted document relating to a “co-conspirator”, stating that the person was a “well known retired CEO” and that the redaction should be removed.</p><p>The Justice Department has previously said no new prosecutions are expected over the Epstein case.</p><p>Trump fought for months to prevent the release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein, but a rebellion among Republicans forced him to sign off on the law mandating that all the records be released.</p><p>The move reflected intense political pressure to address what many Americans, including Trump’s supporters, have long suspected to be a cover-up to protect rich and powerful men in Epstein’s orbit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under the proposal, federal employees seeking to challenge their termination would be required to appeal directly to OPM, which reports to the president, rather than to an independent body known as the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The MSPB acts as a mediator between federal workers and the government and has been in place since 1978. After Trump took office, the board’s caseload surged by 266 percent between October 2024 and September 2025. Federal workers who were cut in early 2025 and accepted buyouts received their final paycheques at the end of September.</p><p>If implemented, the proposal would build on Trump’s broader push to shrink the federal government and limit workers’ ability to challenge those decisions. The administration forced out roughly 317,000 federal employees last year.</p><p>The move comes amid a separate proposal announced last week that would reclassify high-level career civil servants as “at will” employees. That change would give the administration broader authority to fire career officials who do not align with the sitting president’s agenda, affecting roughly 50,000 workers at the nation’s largest employer.</p><p>Outlined in a more than 250-page document, the directive would <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/5/new-trump-administration-rule-makes-it-easier-to-fire-career-civil-servants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allow workers to be fired</a> if they were “intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.</p><p>“Congress gave OPM the authority to set how reduction-in-force appeals are handled, and this rule puts that responsibility to work,” an OPM spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement. “It replaces a slow, costly process with a single, streamlined review led by OPM experts. That means agencies can restructure without years of litigation, and employees get faster, fairer resolution if mistakes occur.”</p><p>The proposal also comes as the administration has sought to fire political appointees from previous administrations without just cause. Since last year, the White House has been attempting to remove US Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.</p><p>Cook challenged the decision in federal court, which ruled that the president did not have the authority to fire her. The White House appealed, and the case is now before the Supreme Court.</p><p>While the court <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has not yet issued a ruling</a>, a decision in the president’s favour would make it easier to remove political appointees who do not align with a given administration’s agenda.</p></div></div></body></html>"
