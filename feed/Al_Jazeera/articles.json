            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>United States President Donald Trump has announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on car makers to control pollution from petrol-powered cars and trucks.</p><p>The plan was announced on Wednesday. If finalised next year, it would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon (3.8 litres) of petrol, through the 2031 model year.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of petrol vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles (65.5km) per gallon in the 2031 model year. That frees up car makers to produce larger vehicles like sports utility vehicles, which are more profitable than smaller cars.</p><p>The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse policies from the era of former Democratic President Joe Biden that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles (EVs). Burning petrol for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and in the US, it is the largest contributor.</p><p>Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest US automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.</p><p>Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.</p><h2 id=\"split-response\">Split response</h2><p>Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense”.</p><p>“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.</p><p>Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real-world market conditions”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Environmentalists decried the decision.</p><p>“In one stroke, Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p>“Gutting the [petrol-mileage] programme will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’’ said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All programme.</p><p>“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Major carmakers will save more than $35bn in technology costs through 2031 under a broad rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards, the Trump administration said.</p><p>General Motors would save $8.7bn from 2027 through 2031, while Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis would each save more than $5bn, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said. Hyundai would save $4.6bn, Subaru $3.8bn, and Toyota $2.3bn, it said.</p><p>But at the same time, fuel costs for drivers are expected to soar, and US drivers are expected to pay up to $185bn more through 2050, the NHTSA reported.</p><h2 id=\"false-ev-claims\">False EV claims</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate”, referring incorrectly to  Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8 percent of new vehicle sales in the US in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.</p><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included the use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on petrol. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.</p><p>Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81km) per gallon of petrol for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63km) per gallon today.</p><p>The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2 percent each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2 percent per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.</p><p>The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of petrol from being burned by 2050, according to the NHTSA’s 2024 calculations.</p><p>Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tonnes of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tonnes a year of deadly soot particles and more than 4,870 tonnes a year of smog components – nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons – going into the air in the coming years.</p><p>Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.</p><p>The proposal must undergo public comments over a 45-day period before it can be finalised.</p></div></div></body></html>"

US President Donald Trump has sharply criticised the Fed for not lowering its short-term interest rate more quickly. When the Fed reduces its rate, it can over time lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.</p><p>The prospect of the administration “vetoing” regional bank presidents would represent another effort by the administration to exert more control over the Fed, an institution that has traditionally been independent from day-to-day politics.</p><p>The Federal Reserve seeks to keep prices in check and support hiring by setting a short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs across the economy.</p><h2 id=\"complicated-structure\">Complicated structure</h2><p>The Fed has a complicated structure that includes a seven-member board of governors based in Washington as well as 12 regional banks that cover specific districts across the US.

Regional Fed banks have repeatedly argued that in selecting new leaders, merit and ability have driven their decision-making.</p><p>The seven governors and the president of the New York Fed vote on every interest-rate decision, while four of the remaining 11 presidents vote on a rotating basis. But all the presidents participate in meetings of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee.</p><p>Bessent, who is in the process of selecting a candidate to recommend to Trump as the successor for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said the fact that many of the current regional bank presidents were hired from outside their districts is at odds with the spirit of how the US central bank’s system was designed.</p><p>Bessent argued last month in an interview on CNBC that the reason for the regional Fed banks was to bring the perspective of their districts to the Fed’s interest rate decisions and “break the New York hold” on the setting of interest rates.</p><p>But now, he said last month, “three, maybe four” of the Fed presidents were appointed from outside their districts, with some living in New York.</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s the way the Federal Reserve was designed,” Bessent said in the interview.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Much of the power grid is considered outdated, with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels from sources like Venezuela.</p><p>Most of the infrastructure also dates to the Cold War era. It saw a leap in construction in the 1980s, and by 1989, the grid was expanded to reach 95 percent of all households.</p><p>In recent years, Cuba has invested in renewable energy as an alternative to its current energy production model.</p><p>In April 2024, for instance, the Caribbean nation inked a deal with China to open 92 solar farms by 2028. The first of those solar plants opened in February of this year.</p><p>But natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, have posed continued hurdles to electricity distribution on the island.</p><p>In late September, for instance, Hurricane Imelda churned through the Caribbean Sea, bringing floods and landslides to Cuba, where at least two people died.</p><p>Then, in October, Cuba was struck again, this time by Hurricane Melissa, one of the most intense Atlantic storms on record.</p><p>The hurricane had slowed to a Category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba, but it nevertheless pounded the island with more flash floods, leaving homes destroyed and thousands displaced.</p><p>Cuban officials have also blamed the United States for contributing to the island’s limping infrastructure.</p><p>Since 1962, the US has placed Cuba under a wide-reaching embargo, which critics say has undermined the island’s economy.</p><p>Despite efforts to loosen the sanctions in recent decades, the administration of US President Donald Trump has kept the embargo in place, citing reports of human rights abuses under the Cuban government.</p><p>Nevertheless, in October, a majority vote at the United Nations General Assembly once again passed a non-binding resolution calling on the US to end its embargo, as part of an annual appeal.</p><p>The economic sanctions, the resolution argues, are disproportionately punitive.</p><h2 id=\"president-blames-us-blockade\">President blames US ‘blockade’</h2><p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday cited that rationale, along with the toll of the recent storms, as challenges impeding the proper functioning of the electrical grid.</p><p>“The workers at [the Ministry of Energy and Mines], who never rest amidst the daily challenges imposed by the blockade and the recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa, are already working to resolve the issue,” Diaz-Canel <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/1996212184552980747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “Once again, we have faith in them.”</p><p>Since taking office in 2019, Diaz-Canel has faced significant pressure from the blackouts and the public unrest they cause.</p><p>In 2021, amid the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of basic supplies like fuel, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest deteriorating conditions on the island. Among their complaints were the regular blackouts the island faces.</p><p>Those protests coincided with a record-setting mass exodus from Cuba. Estimates vary as to the island’s population, but government statistics indicate that, in 2021, the total number of residents was around 11,113,215.</p><p><span>As of 2024, that number has plummeted to 9,748,532. That suggests a steep population drop of more than 12 percent, much of which is attributed to migration off the island.</span></p><p>That decline corresponds to a spike in Cuban arrivals documented by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.</p><p>For fiscal year 2023, the agency reported 200,287 “encounters” with Cuban migrants attempting to enter the United States. For fiscal year 2024, that number rose to 217,615.</p><p>Under Trump, however, the US has this month suspended all immigration applications from Cuba and 18 other countries the Republican president <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">has described</a> as “third world”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Disclosures such as the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks have stripped away much of the opacity surrounding it. In France, serious proposals to tax billionaires and centi-millionaires now command broad political support. Within the G20, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has placed taxing the super-rich firmly on the agenda. The debate is no longer about whether the ultra-wealthy can be taxed, but when.</p><p>Winning that argument will not be easy. But, as with income tax — once denounced as Marxist — it has been won before. And redistributing some of the wealth held by the super-rich would also weaken many right-wing nativist narratives about scarce resources that have spread across the West.</p><p>Those narratives have prospered partly because progressive calls for redistribution have lacked the necessary weight, enabling an alliance of the right and billionaire interests to push xenophobia to the fore.</p><p><em>Lucas Chancel, senior economist at the World Inequality Lab of the Paris School of Economics</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250805__68T24DW__v1__HighRes__BangladeshPolitics-1754409201.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"306\" data-end=\"705\">The recent wave of pessimism surrounding Bangladesh’s economy under its interim administration, much of it amplified by selectively framed local commentary, offers an incomplete and often misleading portrait of the country’s actual economic trajectory. Much of this concern is overstated, as the headline indicators reflect a necessary structural correction rather than an economic collapse.</p><p data-start=\"707\" data-end=\"853\">While elevated inflation and a battered banking sector are real and serious challenges, they do not amount to evidence of an economy in free fall.</p><p data-start=\"855\" data-end=\"1096\">A more careful reading, one that accounts for the disruptive legacy of the previous administration and the corrective measures undertaken after the political transition, reveals a difficult but necessary period of structural rebalancing.</p><p data-start=\"1098\" data-end=\"1347\">The claim that the new government is inheriting a crippled economy overlooks the fact that the previous administration left behind a financial system that resembled a house of cards, propped up by manipulated data and systematic concealment of risk.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1605\">To portray the current economy as stagnant is to ignore Bangladesh’s longer arc of resilience in South Asia. Despite the global shocks that followed COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, the country delivered stronger growth than most of its regional peers.</p><p data-start=\"1607\" data-end=\"1831\">It registered 3.5 percent growth in 2020, followed by 6.9 percent in 2021 and 7.1 percent in 2022. Today’s slower growth reflects deliberate fiscal tightening aimed at restoring macroeconomic balance after years of excess.</p><p data-start=\"1833\" data-end=\"1938\">Rather than a sign of decay, this is the predictable cooling that follows the end of artificial stimulus.</p><p data-start=\"1940\" data-end=\"2110\">The anxiety around nonperforming loans and private sector credit tells an even more revealing story, not of new stress but of long-buried weaknesses finally exposed.</p><p data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2353\">The alarming rise in nonperforming loans, with figures ranging from over 20 percent in ADB assessments to more than 35 percent under the central bank’s revised classification rules, stems from a long-overdue commitment to honest accounting.</p><p data-start=\"2355\" data-end=\"2615\">For years, the previous regime reportedly pressured regulators to gloss over defaults, relax classification standards, and extend loan rescheduling indefinitely. The result was a banking sector that looked superficially healthy while quietly deteriorating.</p><p data-start=\"2617\" data-end=\"2717\">The surge in nonperforming loans is therefore the price of confronting the system’s real condition.</p><p data-start=\"2719\" data-end=\"3048\">The compression in private credit growth, which dipped to about 6.29 percent in late 2025, must also be understood in context. Previous double-digit credit growth was inflated by massive, politically connected borrowing that produced little real economic return and ultimately fed into the ballooning nonperforming loan crisis.</p><p data-start=\"3050\" data-end=\"3284\">Many of these loans were never intended to be repaid and were allegedly funnelled into overseas real estate or offshore accounts. In contrast, banks today are more cautious, with credit flowing into sectors less vulnerable to default.</p><p data-start=\"3286\" data-end=\"3526\">The volume of lending has decreased, but the quality has improved. An economy cannot build sustainable growth on a mountain of bad debt. The current adjustment reflects a shift towards stability rather than a collapse in investment appetite.</p><p data-start=\"3528\" data-end=\"3876\">These corrections in the financial sector are only one part of the broader adjustment. The most decisive rebuttal to claims of stagnation is the transformation under way in the fiscal and external sectors. In an unusual show of discipline, the government has sharply reversed the longstanding habit of borrowing heavily from the banking system.</p><p data-start=\"3878\" data-end=\"4103\">Between July and October of the 2025-26 financial year, it repaid more than 5 billion taka (about $40.9m) to banks, in stark contrast to the more than 150 billion taka ($1.23bn) borrowed during the same period a year earlier.</p><p data-start=\"4105\" data-end=\"4303\">Economists note that this shift eases pressure on interest rates and frees up liquidity for private borrowers, marking a significant break with a past where the state crowded out the private sector.</p><p data-start=\"4305\" data-end=\"4417\">For a country long accustomed to fiscal indiscipline, this move signals a meaningful shift towards stability.</p><p data-start=\"4419\" data-end=\"4637\">Foreign direct investment (FDI) tells a similarly counterintuitive story. Against the assumption that political upheaval deters investors, Bangladesh experienced nearly 20 percent growth in FDI in the 2024-25 financial year.</p><p data-start=\"4639\" data-end=\"4867\">For a post-transition economy emerging from a massive uprising that resulted in more than 1,400 deaths, this is extremely rare. Countries emerging from political uprisings typically endure sharp drops in foreign investment for years.</p><p data-start=\"4869\" data-end=\"5028\">In Bangladesh’s case, global firms not only remained but also reinvested their earnings. This reflects a deeper confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.</p><p data-start=\"5030\" data-end=\"5278\">Perhaps the most striking shift has occurred in the external sector. After months of steady erosion, foreign currency reserves have stabilised and then strengthened, climbing from less than $20bn in mid-2024 to more than $30bn a year later.</p><p data-start=\"5280\" data-end=\"5528\">Remittances surged to a record $30.33bn in the 2024-25 financial year, a 26.8 percent increase attributed to renewed confidence in the formal financial system, the crackdown on money laundering, and the return to a market-based exchange rate.</p><p data-start=\"5530\" data-end=\"5836\">Expatriates who once relied on hundi networks are now sending money legally, responding to a more transparent and predictable currency regime. This combination of rising reserves, strong remittance inflows, and exchange-rate stabilisation forms one of Bangladesh’s strongest macroeconomic buffers in years.</p><p data-start=\"5838\" data-end=\"5998\">Inflation remains the most potent concern, and rightly so. With rates above 8 percent, higher than any country in South Asia, the cost-of-living pressure is severe.</p><p data-start=\"6000\" data-end=\"6164\">But here again, comparisons require nuance. Sri Lanka’s low inflation follows a complete economic meltdown and draconian monetary tightening under an IMF programme.</p><p data-start=\"6166\" data-end=\"6384\">Bangladesh’s inflation is structurally different, driven partly by supply chain constraints, lingering market distortions, and the aftereffects of earlier monetary expansion. It is difficult, but not destabilising.</p><p data-start=\"6386\" data-end=\"6626\">Similarly, the poverty figure of 28 percent often cited by critics originates from a limited-sample private study. World Bank projections indicate that poverty is likely to continue falling modestly this financial year, even amid inflation.</p><p data-start=\"6628\" data-end=\"6841\">The battle ahead is not simply about preserving growth rates, but about dismantling entrenched corruption, extortion networks, and bureaucratic bottlenecks that have acted as invisible taxes on the poor for years.</p><p data-start=\"6843\" data-end=\"7046\">Bangladesh’s economy today is not collapsing; it is undergoing a difficult but necessary reconstruction after more than a decade of governance that preferred cosmetic stability over institutional health.</p><p data-start=\"7048\" data-end=\"7230\">High nonperforming loans, slower credit growth, and persistent inflation are symptoms of structural problems finally being confronted. That confrontation was inevitable and overdue.</p><p data-start=\"7232\" data-end=\"7471\">What stands out instead is a set of achievements rarely seen in a post-transition economy: a rapid rebound in reserves, a record surge in remittances, nearly 20 percent growth in FDI, and an unprecedented demonstration of fiscal restraint.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\">These are not the markers of stagnation, but the early foundations of a more transparent, durable economic future. Whether Bangladesh completes this transition will depend on the political will to sustain reform, especially in the banking sector. The story of the economy today is not one of collapse; it is the story of corrective surgery. Whether the country can finish the operation remains the central question.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

China, which is Venezuela’s number one source of oil exports, also provides economic backing.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"413\">Venezuela and Iran also have a deepening bond – sharing an anti-Western worldview and, in the face of sanctions, both seeking alternative economic and diplomatic channels.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"966\">In Latin America, Venezuela relies on longstanding ideological allies such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Bolivia. These governments consistently defend Caracas in regional bodies and maintain close ties through frameworks like ALBA-TCP and Petrocaribe.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"966\">Though Brazil and neighbouring Colombia are governed by left-wing governments, they have refused to recognise Maduro’s 2024 re-election. However, they have voiced concerns about the military threats against Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"why-isn-t-venezuela-wealthier\">Why isn’t Venezuela wealthier?</h2><p>Venezuela holds the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a>, estimated at 303 billion barrels in 2023. But it only exported $4bn worth of crude oil that same year, far below other oil-producing countries, largely due to <a href=\"/economy/2024/7/26/as-maduro-faces-gonzalez-in-venezuela-sanctions-remain-a-key-hurdle\">US sanctions</a> imposed during Trump’s first term.</p><p>The country’s oil production is dominated by PDVSA, which has faced challenges including ageing infrastructure, underinvestment, mismanagement and the effects of sanctions, all of which have limited Venezuela’s ability to fully exploit its vast reserves.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn), and Russia ($122bn).</p><p>Sanctions have also increased the price of imports. The country suffers from goods shortages and rampant inflation – the IMF forecasts it will reach 600 percent next year. The economic crisis, worsened by the US sanctions, has forced <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/venezuela-explained-in-10-maps-and-charts\">millions of people</a> to flee to neighbouring countries in recent years.</p><p>In 2024, Venezuela’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at <a href=\"https://statbase.org/data/ven-gdp-imf-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">$119.8bn</a>, placing it among the smallest economies in Latin America. Venezuela’s economic instability is rooted in years of harsh sanctions, as well as its reliance on oil.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-international-response-been\">What has the international response been?</h2><p>On November 30, Maduro called on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to help his country <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/is-us-president-donald-trump-preparing-to-strike-venezuela\">counter</a> the “growing and illegal threats” from the Trump administration.</p><p>In a letter to OPEC members, Venezuela’s President Maduro said, “I hope I can count on your best efforts to stop this growing aggression” So far, none of the group’s members have publicly responded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On November 25, Colombian President Gustavo Petro told CNN that Trump is “not thinking about the democratisation of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking”. He added that only a tiny portion of the global drugs trade flows through the Caribbean country.</p><h2 id=\"what-could-happen-next\">What could happen next?</h2><p>On November 17, when asked about the possibility of deploying US troops on Venezuelan soil, Trump told reporters at the White House, “I don’t rule out that. I don’t rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.”</p><p>Then, on Monday, Reuters reported that Trump offered Maduro safe passage out of Venezuela during a call on November 21. Maduro allegedly told Trump that he was willing to leave Venezuela, provided he and his family members had full legal amnesty.</p><p>The Venezuelan president also reportedly requested the removal of sanctions for more than 100 Venezuelan government officials, many accused by the US of human rights abuses, drug trafficking or corruption.</p><p>Trump rejected most of his requests on the call, but told Maduro he had a week to leave Venezuela for the destination of his choice alongside his family members. Al Jazeera, however, could not independently verify the report.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump told reporters without specifying whether he was referring to citizens or irregular migrants.</p><p>“Some people will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care … Their country is no good for a reason … Your country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country,” he said.</p><p>“These are people who do nothing but complain,” Trump continued. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”</p><p>Last week, in an address to the nation following the shooting of two National Guard members, which left one dead and another critically injured, Trump ordered that people from 19 blacklisted countries who held US green or permanent residency cards be “re-examined”.</p><p>He then pivoted to the Somali community in Minnesota in that address, saying, “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state.”</p><p>US media reported on Tuesday that an ICE operation focused on Somali communities in the Minneapolis-St Paul area will take place in the next few days.</p><p>A sweep by ICE officers will round up undocumented people for deportation, AP reported, citing a person familiar with the plans.</p><p>At least 100 ICE agents are expected to flood the area. The New York Times, also citing sources close to the plan, said Somalis in the process of seeking legal status could also be swept up.</p><p>Several states in recent months have experienced ICE raids on undocumented people, including Chicago, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York City and Phoenix. By October, at least 527,000 people had been deported from the US since the Trump administration took office in January, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>In a post on X on Tuesday, Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz slammed the plan for Minneapolis, saying that while the state welcomed support for prosecuting crime, “pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem”.</p><p>City officials also condemned President Trump’s attack on the Somali community at a press conference on Tuesday and promised not to cooperate with ICE agents conducting migrant checks.</p><p>“Obviously, this is a frightening moment for our Somali community,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, describing the possible move as “terrorising”.</p><p>“That’s not American. That’s not what we are about,” he said. “To our Somali community, we love you, and we stand with you.”</p><p>Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, who came to the US from Somalia when he was 14, said at the conference: “I know many families are fearful … the city of Minneapolis stands behind you.”</p><p>“Somali Americans are here to stay,” he added. “We love this state. We love this country. This is home. We’re not going anywhere.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Yes. On November 21, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was “immediately” terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, referring to a programme designed to provide emergency refuge for people whose countries are in crisis. About 705 Somalis are on that programme.</p><p>Without providing evidence, Trump claimed that “Somali gangs are terrorising the people of that great State” and accused Governor Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said. “It’s OVER!</p><p>Trump’s accusations about the Somali community come after a conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, published allegations of welfare fraud against Somalis in Minnesota in a magazine called City Journal on November 19.</p><p>In the report, Rufo, citing unnamed “counterterrorism sources” and a police detective, claimed that Somalis benefiting from US welfare programmes were sending back huge amounts in remittances to their country, and that some of that money had ended up with al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked armed group controlling some rural parts of Somalia.</p><p>One of the programmes Rufo referred to was fraudulent – the privately funded, $300m Feeding Our Future charity programme, which falsely claimed to be feeding millions of children amid the COVID-19 crisis but instead stole state funds.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have secured convictions for the ringleader, Aimee Bock, who is white, and several Somali-Americans.</p><p>In July, Somalia became one of 12 countries whose citizens are subject to a <a href=\"/wp-admin/post.php?post=3753857&amp;action=edit\">US travel ban</a>. It was similarly placed under a travel ban during the first Trump administration.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-targeted-ilhan-omar\">Why has Trump targeted Ilhan Omar?</h2><p>Trump also made disparaging remarks about Democratic congresswoman Omar in his Tuesday attack, calling her “garbage”.</p><p>Omar, 43, who emigrated from Somalia to the US in 1995 as a child, has represented her Minnesota district in the US Congress since 2019 and is an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>“She’s an incompetent person; she’s a real terrible person,” Trump said on Tuesday, adding without evidence that Omar “hates everybody” and is anti-Semitic.</p><p>Trump’s verbal attacks on Omar are not new. The president has repeatedly criticised the representative, routinely picking on her hijab and mode of dressing.</p><p>Omar hit back on the latest of Trump’s latest comments on Tuesday, saying: “His obsession with me is creepy.”</p><p></p><p>Omar also pushed back against claims that Minnesota funds have been diverted to al-Shabab or that Somali gangs are rife in the state. “I challenge you to come forward with evidence … if at all there’s any,” she said at a briefing last week. “You can’t victimise a whole community for the actions of a few.”</p><p>There are currently about 260,000 people of Somali descent residing in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. They are among the largest Somali communities outside Somalia, with other major diaspora communities found in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Sweden and Canada.</p><p>Some Somalis arrived in the US in the 1960s as students, after the then-British Somaliland gained independence. Later, there were larger waves of people fleeing the troubled East African country’s <a href=\"/features/2024/7/20/from-somalia-to-south-oregon-how-basketball-reunites-civil-war-survivors\">protracted civil war</a>, which stemmed from armed resistance to the military government of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. That lasted from 1988 until 2000, although the government continues to battle rebel groups and armed militants.</p><p>Most Somalis in the US live in Minnesota, where a number of social programmes are in existence, particularly in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, home to 63,000 people of Somali descent. States like Ohio (21,000), Washington (15,000), Virginia (3,953), Georgia (3,538), and California also have significant populations, according to the World Population Review.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-somali-diaspora-fared-in-the-us\">How has the Somali diaspora fared in the US?</h2><p>Minneapolis hosts several hundred Somali businesses, mostly in retail and food services and including restaurants, grocery stores and clothing stores.</p><p>Somalis arriving in the state during their native country’s civil war often faced challenges with learning English, but were able to take unskilled jobs, such as at meatpacking plants, according to a 2017 report by local publication MinnPost.</p><p>As the community grew, more Somalis branched into finance, health and education sectors. They also started getting into local politics. In 2019, Omar made history as the first Somali-American representative in the US Congress.</p><p>The average age of Somalis in Minnesota is young at 19, according to a 2023 report by the Minnesota state government. Most (53,000) speak English with professional or limited proficiency, but the group also has one of the lowest levels of educational attainment among foreign populations in the state.</p><p>Somalis are often described as active in the labour force, although more Somali men are employed than women. Contrary to Trump’s claims that Somalis do not work in the US, about 84 percent of male Somali refugees between 25 and 64 years were employed in the state of Kentucky compared to 64 percent of females, according to a 2016 report by the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.</p><p>About 58 percent of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US. Of those born abroad, about 87 percent are naturalised citizens. Nearly half of that group entered the US in 2010 or later.</p><p>US authorities have in the past struggled to prevent the recruitment of young Somali-American men by al-Shabab and other armed groups. In 2007, more than 20 Somali-American men travelled to Somalia to join al-Shabab. However, only a few cases have been reported since then. In September, a 23-year-old man in Minnesota pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to join a designated armed group.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
