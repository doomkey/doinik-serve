While the camp was not hit directly, the buildings shook so badly from nearby bunker buster bombs that many fled out of fear they might collapse.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Last November’s ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, after a year of conflict, brought a reprieve for many here, even though Israeli attacks continue across the south and parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. Sunday’s attack, however, has left many in the country worried that another intensification may soon take place.</p><p>Standing on his balcony, a man in his mid-30s called over to his neighbour, “Do you think they’ll launch a wider war?”</p><p>The other, a stocky man with greying hair, shrugged with uncertainty. “May God protect us,” he said, before turning around and heading inside his apartment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"retaliation-would-be-suicide\">Retaliation would be suicide</h2><p>Last year’s war left deep scars on Lebanon.</p><p>Many villages in the south were razed to the ground during the fighting, while others suffered heavily from Israeli <a href=\"/features/2025/2/18/israeli-just-wanted-to-destroy-in-southern-lebanon-despite-the-ceasefire\">destruction</a> during the ceasefire period. More than 4,000 people in Lebanon have been killed since October 2023, mostly from September to November of last year, and more than 1.2 million people were displaced. Many have yet to return to their homes, even a year later. The World Bank estimated Israel left Lebanon with approximately $11bn in needs for reconstruction and recovery.</p><p>The war also left Hezbollah, a Lebanese political and military group, badly weakened. In August, under United States and Israeli pressure, the Lebanese government <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/lebanese-cabinet-holds-more-talks-on-disarming-hezbollah-under-us-pressure\">approved</a> a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm the group. But the group has <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/hezbollah-to-treat-lebanons-disarmament-decision-as-if-it-does-not-exist\">rejected</a> calls for its disarmament based on Israel’s failure to uphold its side of the ceasefire. Israel has not withdrawn from at least five points it occupies in south Lebanon, nor has it stopped its near-daily attacks on the country’s territory, killing more than 120 civilians since last year’s ceasefire was announced.</p><p>Meanwhile, this latest attack has come amid warnings from Israeli officials and reports in the country’s media of a military <a href=\"/features/2025/11/12/israel-intensifying-attacks-on-lebanon-is-it-planning-another-war\">escalation</a> in Lebanon. Israeli officials claim Hezbollah is <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">regrouping</a> and blame the Lebanese government and LAF for failing to move quickly enough to disarm the group.</p><p>Senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qomati said the latest strike crossed a “red line” and that the party’s leadership was considering a response.</p><p>Analysts, however, say the group is not currently in a position to attack Israel. In addition to its losses as an organisation, Lebanon’s Shia Muslim population, the sect from which it derives the majority of its support, also suffered from the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/israels-destruction-in-lebanon-should-be-probed-as-war-crimes-amnesty\">indiscriminate</a> nature of Israel’s attacks, and many fear the return of the war.</p><p>“Retaliation by Hezbollah would be suicide with no military or political value,” Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst and writer, told Al Jazeera. Young said the Israelis could be “overplaying the threat” of Hezbollah’s regrouping, giving themselves a latitude to do what they want in retaliation to Hezbollah”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-are-used-to-this\">‘We are used to this’</h2><p>Last Friday, President Joseph Aoun said Lebanon is willing to sit with Israel in internationally-sponsored <a href=\"/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks\">negotiations</a>. It wasn’t enough to stop Israel’s attack last Sunday.</p><p>The atmosphere has left many in Lebanon deeply fearful of another round of intense Israeli attacks.</p><p>“Things are very bad, unfortunately,” Khaled Muhanaya, a Syrian man living in Beirut’s <a href=\"/news/2024/11/26/israel-escalates-violence-on-beirut-as-lebanon-awaits-ceasefire\">Basta neighbourhood</a>, an area that suffered numerous Israeli attacks last year, told Al Jazeera. “People are afraid to see a new war from Israel.”</p><p>“I am worried about anything happening to my family. My kids are afraid to sleep alone.”</p><p>In Burj al-Barajneh, some locals showed bravado in the face of increased attacks.</p><p>“We are used to this,” said Ali, a barber in his mid-20s, as he sat outside his barbershop.</p><p>Ali was at his shop when Israel hit the Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday. He said the attack wasn’t as loud as many locals heard during last year’s war.</p><p>Still, Ali and others said the recent Israeli <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/un-calls-for-probe-into-israels-strikes-on-lebanon\">attack</a> on Lebanon’s largest refugee camp, Ein el-Hilweh, that killed 13 people, including 11 children, had people speculating that Israel could target other camps, including Burj al-Barajneh.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"parts-of-the-south-practically-empty\">Parts of the south ‘practically empty’</h2><p>The brunt of the war’s damage, however, was done, and is still being done, in south Lebanon.</p><p>Parts of the south are still inaccessible to locals. Attempts to access such areas have been met by <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/lebanese-pm-condemns-wave-of-israeli-attacks-on-southern-lebanon\">Israeli military aggression</a>, including gunfire from the five occupied points.</p><p>Ali Noureddine is from a southern town called al-Habbariyeh, where seven young first responders were <a href=\"/features/2024/6/3/no-one-will-hold-them-accountable-israel-targets-medics-in-south-lebanon\">killed in an Israeli strike</a> in March 2024. He told Al Jazeera that his town is filled with displaced people from villages closer to the border who cannot access their homes.</p><p>“There are areas [in the south] that are practically empty,” Noureddine said.</p><p>“Every day and every night there are drones in the sky and warplanes,” he said.</p><p>There are areas, however, where people have returned and started to rebuild their lives. Many have sunk their savings into repairing their homes. But that doesn’t mean the fear has left them.</p><p>“People are afraid at night,” he said. And not just of air strikes. “They feel that at any moment the Israelis might enter again.”</p><p>Talk of war is everywhere in Lebanon. Should an intensified war come, some southerners say they won’t leave their land again this time. Many have invested their remaining finances into rebuilding or repairing their homes. Others dread going through the living conditions they experienced during the war, such as living in shelters or tents.</p><p>“People are afraid of the idea that they will leave again because they suffered a lot during the war,” Noureddine said.</p><p>“Today, if there’s another war again, people will be very devastated, and it will be much more difficult than the first time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel’s genocide is not over,” she said.</p><p>Some of Israel’s strikes on Thursday morning targeted buildings in central Gaza’s Bureij camp and eastern Khan Younis, according to Al Jazeera’s correspondents on the ground.</p><p>They add to hundreds of attacks that Gaza’s civil defence <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">says are brazen violations</a> of the fragile seven-week ceasefire.</p><p>They also come as Israel’s military carried out another wave of raids and arrests across the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/israels-siege-on-west-bank-city-raises-alarms-over-ethnic-cleansing\">occupied West Bank</a>, including in the areas of Qalqilya, Tubas, Hebron, Tulkarem and Nablus.</p><p>During their raid in Tubas, Israeli forces conducted field interrogations and assaulted at least 25 people who required medical treatment, according to a local Palestinian Red Crescent official quoted by the Wafa news agency.</p><h2 id=\"more-palestinian-prisoners-released\">More Palestinian prisoners released</h2><p>The first stage of the Gaza truce moved closer to completion on Wednesday after Israel transferred the bodies of 15 Palestinian prisoners to Gaza authorities, a day after Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad handed over the body of another Israeli captive.</p><p>Palestinian armed groups have now <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/13/israel-confirms-all-20-living-captives-in-gaza-have-been-released\">released all living captives</a> and returned the remains of 26 of 28 captives stipulated to be transferred under the deal.</p><p>Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the latest handover shows the group’s “steadfast commitment to fully complete the exchange process and its ongoing efforts to finalise it despite significant difficulties”.</p><p>Israel, for its part, has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and returned the bodies of 345 prisoners, many of whom showed signs of <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/17/palestinian-bodies-returned-by-israel-show-sign-of-execution-torture\">torture, mutilation and execution.</a></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the ceasefire continues to face major hurdles, including the presence of dozens of Hamas fighters trapped in tunnels on the Israeli-occupied side of the yellow line in southern Gaza – 20 of whom Israel says it has killed over the past week.</p><p>On Wednesday, Hamas urged ceasefire mediators to pressure Israel to allow the Hamas fighters safe passage. The group accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire by targeting the fighters who are “besieged in the tunnels of Rafah”.</p><p>“We hold (Israel) fully responsible for the lives of our fighters and call upon our mediators to take immediate action to pressure (Israel) to allow our sons to return home,” Hamas said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"will-the-ceasefire-progress-to-phase-two\">Will the ceasefire progress to phase two?</h2><p>Meanwhile, discussions are under way on how to transition to the second phase of the ceasefire, which is to include <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/what-is-the-international-stabilisation-force-for-gaza\">deploying an armed international stabilisation force</a>, tasked with demilitarising Gaza, and developing an international body to temporarily govern the Gaza Strip and oversee reconstruction.</p><p>Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian mediators met in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the second phase, reported Reuters. But major questions hang over nearly every part of the plan, as well as Israel’s commitment to seeing it through.</p><p>“Until this moment, Israel has not given up on its plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza,” said Muhammad Shehada, visiting fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations Middle East and North Africa programme, told Al Jazeera. “Either Gaza stays permanently as a refugee camp in ruins that is unlivable, uninhabitable, and that sustains conditions that are designed to bring about collapse to life there … or Hamas retaliates and Israel uses it as an excuse to resume the genocide.”</p><p>Amnesty’s Callamard urged for continued global pressure on Israel to abide by international law and to not allow the ceasefire to serve as a “smokescreen for Israel’s ongoing genocide”.</p><p>“The international community cannot afford to be complacent: states must keep up pressure on Israel to allow unfettered access to humanitarian aid, lift its unlawful blockade and end its ongoing genocide,” said Callamard.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This does not include the US and Mexico, which are bound by the <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/7/canadas-carney-makes-second-white-house-visit-as-trade-tensions-loom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States-Canada-Mexico</a> free trade deal.</p><p>Canada will also impose a global 25 percent tariff on targeted imported steel-derivative products, and incorporate border measures to combat steel dumping.</p><p>In July, Ottawa set a quota of steel imports at 50 percent of the 2024 level from non-FTA countries in a bid to stop the dumping of foreign steel into Canada.</p><p>The measures are being tightened to open up the domestic market for Canadian-produced steel, said a government official.</p><p>The steel industry contributes more than 4 billion Canadian dollars ($2.8bn) to Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs more than 23,000 people directly. It is, however, one of the two sectors hit hardest by US President Donald Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada.</p><p>Trump has imposed 50 percent tariffs on steel, and softwood lumber, long subject to US tariffs, is currently taxed at 45 percent after the Trump administration’s hike last month.</p><p>Carney said the decades-long process of an ever-closer economic relationship between Canada and the US is now over.</p><p>“As a consequence, many of our strengths have become vulnerabilities. Last year, more than 75 percent of our exports went to the United States. Ninety percent of our lumber exports, 90 percent of our aluminium exports, and 90 percent of our steel exports, all bound for a single market,” Carney said.</p><p>Ottawa will work with railway companies to cut freight rates for the inter-provincial transfer of Canadian steel and lumber by 50 percent, beginning in early 2026.</p><p>“We will make it more affordable to transport Canadian steel and lumber across the country by cutting freight rates,” Carney said.</p><p>The government said it would also support the use of locally made steel and lumber in homebuilding, and financial aid for companies dealing with tariff-related impacts, such as on their workforce, liquidity crunch, and for restructuring operations.</p><h2 id=\"trump-tensions\">Trump tensions</h2><p>Trump cut off trade talks with Canada last month after the Ontario provincial government ran television advertisements in US markets that criticised Trump’s tariffs by citing a speech by <a href=\"/news/2025/11/1/canadas-carney-says-he-apologised-to-trump-over-reagan-anti-tariff-ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">former US President Ronald Reagan</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Carney said he would be in Washington for the final draw on December 5 for the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament. He said he would speak to Trump then and said he spoke briefly to the president on Tuesday.</p><p>“We are ready to re-engage on those talks when the United States wants to re-engage,” Carney said.</p><p>Carney’s announcement comes even as there is increased pressure on US businesses reeling from Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Deere &amp; Co, the maker of John Deere tractors, said on Wednesday that it expects a bigger hit from tariffs in 2026. The company expects a pre-tax tariff hit of around $1.2bn in fiscal 2026, compared with nearly $600m in 2025.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Reds were coming off 3-0 losses in the Premier League to Manchester City before the international break and Nottingham Forest on Saturday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

pressure — an inconceivable scenario, given Liverpool cruised to the Premier League title a matter of months ago — and defensive mistakes again led to his team’s downfall against PSV.</p><p>Firstly, Virgil van Dijk’s raised hand touched the ball at a corner to give away a penalty, converted by 36-year-old Ivan Perisic for the opener to the Dutch champions.</p><p>Dominik Szoboszlai equalised 10 minutes later, but after Guus Til regained the lead for PSV, Liverpool centre back Ibrahima Konate — a target for criticism from fans and pundits alike in recent months — missed the ball completely to let the visitors in on goal again.</p><p>US forward Ricardo Pepi shot against the post, and Couhaib Driouech was there to convert the rebound.</p><p>Driouech added a fourth in stoppage time to complete the humiliation.</p><h2 id=\"arsenal-topple-bayern-to-lead-ucl-league-phase\">Arsenal topple Bayern to lead UCL league phase</h2><p>Arsenal beat Bayern Munich for the first time in a decade to maintain their 100 percent record in this season’s Champions League with <a href=\"/sports/liveblog/2025/11/26/live-arsenal-vs-bayern-munich-uefa-champions-league\">a 3-1 victory</a>, sending them top of the group.</p><p>Jurrien Timber headed Mikel Arteta’s side in front from a corner after 22 minutes, only for Bayern teenager Lennart Karl to equalise in style before half-time.</p><p>Arsenal dominated the second half, though and showed their immense squad depth as substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scored the goals to make it five wins from five.</p><p>It proved a quiet return to north London for prolific Bayern striker Harry Kane as his side suffered their first defeat of the season in all competitions.</p><p>With Inter Milan dropping points, Arsenal are now the only team in the competition with a maximum 15 points and look all but assured of a place in the last 16.</p><p>Six points clear at the top of the Premier League and Bundesliga respectively and boasting flawless records after four games in the Champions League, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have been Europe’s stand-out teams this season.</p><p>The sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago with Bayern coming out on top, but Arsenal have moved to another level since that clash and went into Wednesday’s game on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions.</p><p>With last-16 spots already looking safe for both clubs, the 15th meeting between them lacked jeopardy, but bragging rights and psychological blows were up for grabs.</p><p>It was Arsenal who emerged with both, thanks to a win that will reverberate around Europe.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4133844\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4133844\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

Klein/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Bayern, backed by a vociferous travelling army, looked confident early on but were stunned in the 22nd minute when Arsenal scored the kind of devastatingly simple goal that has become their trademark.</p><p>Bukayo Saka swung in a corner, Myles Lewis-Skelly got the slightest of nudges on Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer, and Timber rose to glance a header into the net.</p><p>The lead lasted only 10 minutes, though, as Bayern responded with another move right off the training ground.</p><p>After a long passing sequence, Joshua Kimmich’s raking pass found Michael Olise, whose volleyed pass across the face of goal was met by 17-year-old Karl, who became the first player to score against Arsenal in the Champions League this season.</p><p>While Kane was largely peripheral, Karl was impressive and should probably have scored again early in the second half when he burst into the area but shot straight at goalkeeper David Raya.</p><p>After that, Arsenal took charge.</p><p>Mikel Merino went close when he nodded a header down and just wide from a Declan Rice corner, Cristhian Mosquera was denied by Neuer and the keeper then saved from Rice after the midfielder’s marauding run.</p><p>Bayern’s defence was creaking, though and Arsenal’s pressure paid off in the 69th minute when Riccardo Calafiori fired in a cross from the left that fellow substitute Madueke turned in for his first goal for the club.</p><p>Neuer then had a moment to forget when he charged out of his goal eight minutes later, trying to cut out Eberechi Eze’s pass, but got nowhere near the ball, and Martinelli was left with the simple task of shooting into an empty net.</p><h2 id=\"mbappe-scores-all-four-as-real-madrid-avoid-olympiakos-scare\">Mbappe scores all four as Real Madrid avoid Olympiakos scare</h2><p>Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe scored four goals, including the second-fastest hat-trick in Champions League history in just eight minutes, to earn a 4-3 comeback victory over hosts Olympiakos.</p><p>Mbappe beat two defenders to slot in from Vinicius Jr’s assist in the 22nd minute, cancelling out Chiquinho’s eighth-minute lead. He then headed in an Arda Guler cross two minutes later, and before the Greeks had time to recover from the double strike, the France forward completed his hat-trick with another fine finish.</p><p>The Spaniards hit the woodwork through Aurelien Tchouameni in a strong first half, but the hosts cut the deficit seven minutes after the restart through Mehdi Taremi’s close-range header before Mbappe’s tap-in from yet another Vinicius Jr assist briefly restored order.</p><p>Olympiacos scored again with Ayoub El Kaabi’s 81st-minute header, but despite intense late pressure, they could not find another goal as Real snapped their three-game winless run in all competitions.</p><p>Real climbed to fifth place on 12 points from five games in the league phase table, with the top eight earning automatic qualification for the knockout stage and with three matchdays remaining. Olympiakos are 33rd with two points.</p><h2 id=\"ucl-holders-psg-made-to-work-by-tottenham\">UCL holders PSG made to work by Tottenham</h2><p>Holders Paris St Germain showed a never-say-die attitude as they twice came from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 5-3 in the Champions League, with two moments of brilliance from Vitinha steering Luis Enrique’s side to victory.</p><p>PSG looked fragile at the back, conceding twice from defensive lapses and showing some of the same issues that contributed to their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the previous round, but they responded with greater control and efficiency to turn the match around at the Parc des Princes.</p><p>Vitinha bagged a hat-trick with two fine strikes and a penalty, while Pacho and Fabian Ruiz also scored for PSG, who were made to work after Tottenham twice led through Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani, the France forward finishing with a double.</p><p>After four victories in five games, PSG, who finished with 10 men after Lucas Hernandez was sent off in stoppage time, are second in the league phase standings, on course for direct qualification to the last 16, while Tottenham are 16th on eight points.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Not only did Trump refuse to attend, but he also declined to send any top officials from Washington, DC, to the event.</p><p>“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115510666739916664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on November 7.</p><p>“No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”</p><p>The G20 has traditionally been a meeting ground for leaders from the European Union, the African Union and other major world economies to discuss technology, environmental initiatives and shared financial growth.</p><p>Next year, the summit is scheduled to take place in Miami. Traditionally, the host of the G20 summit closes the meeting by banging a gavel and then passing the little wooden hammer to officials from the next country to hold the meeting.</p><p>But on Sunday, Ramaphosa did not pass the gavel to anyone.</p><p>Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he had offered to send a member of the US Embassy to accept the gavel, but that the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/s-africa-says-g20-shared-goals-outweigh-differences-as-it-concludes-summit\">offer had been rejected</a> by Ramaphosa’s administration as a slight.</p><p>“At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-tensions\">Heightened tensions</h2><p>Ramaphosa largely avoided addressing the US absence during the G20 conference, instead underscoring his push for global unity and efforts to combat inequality.</p><p>“Our G20 Presidency has been rooted in the conviction that the world needs more solidarity, equality and sustainability,” Ramaphosa <a href=\"https://x.com/CyrilRamaphosa/status/1993281148852560015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“While some have sought to create division and polarisation between nations, we have reinforced our shared humanity. We have fostered collaboration and goodwill. Above all, we have affirmed that our shared goals outweigh our differences.”</p><p>The increasingly hostile relations between South Africa and the US began early in Trump’s second term as president.</p><p>On February 7, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/addressing-egregious-actions-of-the-republic-of-south-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> an executive action denouncing South Africa for alleged human rights abuses against white Afrikaners and saying that all aid and assistance to the country would stop.</p><p>As of fiscal year 2023, US assistance to South Africa totalled approximately $441.3m, according to government statistics. In fiscal year 2024, which is only partially reported at present, the total rose to approximately $581m.</p><p>In February’s order, Trump also directed US government agencies to assist in the resettlement of Afrikaners as “refugees” in the US.</p><p>He doubled down on that call in late October, when he set the lowest cap on refugee admissions in US history.</p><p>Of the 7,500 available refugee slots, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">called for the majority to be</a> “allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and other “victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.</p><p>In May, Trump also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">hosted Ramaphosa at the White House</a>, where he attempted to confront the South African leader with accusations of genocide in his country. Some critics have compared the meeting to an “ambush”.</p><p>Ramaphosa, for his part, has repeatedly denied the accusations. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trumps-us-boycott-of-g20-summit-is-their-loss-south-africa-says\">When asked by reporters</a> about the US boycotting the G20 this year, he said bluntly, “Their absence is their loss.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
