He wants to meet me. We haven’t formally arranged it yet, but he wants to meet me,” Trump told reporters.</p><p data-start=\"2884\" data-end=\"3156\">Qatar and Egypt, who are mediating and guaranteeing the truce after a devastating two-year genocide in Gaza, have urged a transition to the second phase of the agreement.

The official said the army is preparing to remain there indefinitely.</p><p data-start=\"4278\" data-end=\"4494\">The newspaper also reported that Israeli military leaders are proposing continued control over half of Gaza, underscoring Israel’s apparent intent to entrench its occupation rather than implement a genuine ceasefire.</p><p>Compounding the misery in Gaza, a huge storm that recently hit the Strip has killed at least 13 people as torrential rains and fierce winds flooded tents and caused <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/whats-causing-gazas-war-damaged-homes-to-collapse-in-winter\">damaged buildings to collapse</a>.</p><p>Israel’s two-year war has decimated more than 80 percent of the structures across Gaza, forcing hundreds of thousands of families to take refuge in flimsy tents or overcrowded makeshift shelters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It eventually peaked on October 29 during a meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok: “I think by the end of my first term, we should have $21 or $22 trillion dollars invested in the United States from other people and countries,” Trump said.</p><p>Since then, Trump has reported varied investment figures:</p><ul>\n<li>On November 27 and December 2, he said they were worth nearly $20 trillion.</li>\n<li>On December 2, December 3, December 4 and December 9, he said about $18 trillion, a figure he had first cited on October 10.</li>\n</ul><p>Sometimes Trump has phrased the commitments as approaching a dollar figure; other times, he’s said they’ve already hit that number.</p><p>In May, when Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion” in investments, we rated that <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/may/08/donald-trump/foreign-corporate-investment-10-trillion/\">False</a>. The White House had documented at least $4.9 trillion less than what Trump claimed.</p><p>That $10 trillion number has about doubled in the seven months since, according to Trump, but it’s unsubstantiated. On the higher end, $22 trillion would be equal to about three-quarters of the United States’ entire 2024 annual gross domestic product (GDP), an extraordinary total for the richest country in the history of the world.</p><p>The White House website documents $9.6 trillion, and not everything cited on the website was newly pledged during Trump’s second term. Experts say there’s no guarantee the full amounts promised will come to fruition, and some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president.</p><p>The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about Trump’s statements.</p><p>One way to benchmark Trump’s investment figure is to look at what the White House officially documented.</p><p>The White House launched a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">webpage</a> in April that includes a list of countries and companies it said have announced investments during Trump’s second term.</p><p>Using the internet archive Wayback Machine, we tracked the amount of investment the White House website cited over time. The figures Trump has used were usually at least double the amount listed on the website.</p><p>In recent weeks, as Trump cited figures from $18 trillion to $22 trillion, the White House website reported $9.6 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"is-trump-accurately-framing-the-foreign-and-corporate-investments\">Is Trump accurately framing the foreign and corporate investments?</h2><p>The White House website’s figure includes aspirational goals over multiple years and counts future purchases of products rather than capital investments. For some of the biggest line items – such as commitments by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – the pledges are multiple times those countries’ annual gross domestic product, which calls their feasibility into question.</p><p>A Bloomberg Economics’ <a href=\"https://archive.is/ReAwK#selection-3911.37-3916.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis</a> found that of the $9.6 trillion the White House listed on its website in late November, $7 trillion could be considered “real investment pledges”. The remaining $2.6 trillion included countries’ agreements to purchase items such as natural gas or to expand future trade. The analysis characterised some of the investment pledges by other countries as “amorphous”.</p><p>More than 80 percent of the investments from private companies stemmed from artificial intelligence-related spending.</p><p>“Many of the pledges cited by the White House are part of overlapping multi-company projects, making it difficult to determine how much may be counted more than once,” Bloomberg said.</p><p>Ten items on the White House’s website accounted for the vast majority of the $9.6 trillion the White House detailed. Some of the White House’s documentation includes details such as specific companies getting involved and the types of facilities or infrastructure envisioned; other examples are more vague. Some involve conventional investments, while others have to do with projected trade increases.</p><p><strong>1. United Arab Emirates: $1.4 trillion.</strong> The White House says this <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/5/15/trump-honoured-by-uae-as-country-announces-1-4-trillion-investment\">investment</a> focuses on AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, quantum computing, biotechnology and manufacturing. Companies cited in a White House news release include Boeing, GE Aerospace, Emirates Global Aluminum, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Qualcomm and Amazon Web Services. It’s unclear how much of this investment would come from new investments.</p><p>The UAE’s 2024 gross domestic product was $537bn, making the pledge equal to three years of the country’s entire economic output.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>2. Qatar: $1.2 trillion.</strong> The White House press release described this as an “economic exchange”, rather than a one-way investment. It cited the involvement of companies including Boeing, GE Aerospace, Raytheon, General Atomics, ExxonMobil and Chevron Phillips. The announcement described a mixture of trade deals, purchase agreements and investment intentions – items that analysts say often include future-looking efforts rather than capital injections.</p><p>In 2024, Qatar’s gross domestic product was $218bn, making this pledge equivalent to nearly six years of the country’s entire economy.</p><p><strong>3. Japan: $1 trillion.</strong> The White House has said Japan is <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/8/trump-japans-ishiba-play-nice-despite-tariff-threat\">moving towards $1 trillion</a>, following an initial agreement to invest $550bn in sectors such as semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, pharmaceuticals, metals and minerals by the end of Trump’s term. Japan also disputes that this will be a one-way flow of cash into the US. Bloomberg News quoted Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa saying, “It’s not that $550bn in cash will be sent to the US” but rather a combination of investments, loans and loan guarantees provided by financial institutions backed by the Japanese government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>4. Meta: $600bn.</strong> The White House and the social media company said $600bn is tied to Meta’s US AI infrastructure and workforce expansion plans through to 2028.</p><p><strong>5. Apple: $600bn.</strong> Apple’s long history of multi-year domestic investment pledges  means the $600bn figure incorporates prior commitments plus recent accelerations. Apple’s news release described a new $100bn boost to bring its total US commitment to $600bn over several years. The release cites a new American Manufacturing Program, supplier investments and training programmes.</p><p><strong>6. Saudi Arabia: $600bn.</strong> The administration said $600bn from <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/trump-hosts-saudi-arabias-mohammed-bin-salman-five-key-takeaways\">Saudi Arabia</a> would involve the energy, critical minerals and defence sectors.</p><p>The amount cited would be equal to about half of Saudi Arabia’s 2024 gross domestic product.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>7. European Union companies: $600bn.</strong> The EU said in August that “European companies are expected to invest an additional $600bn across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028.” However, the statement frames this as aspirational, not as a commitment.</p><p><strong>8. Stargate: $500bn.</strong> This consortium between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle was unveiled during a January 21 White House event. Stargate said $100bn will be invested “immediately” and that the consortium “intends to invest” a total of $500bn over the next four years. OpenAI, among others, published blog posts describing its plans for five new sites that would bring the project to “over $400bn” in near-term investment, positioning it on a path to the $500bn target.</p><p><strong>9. NVIDIA: $500bn.</strong> The White House said NVIDIA has <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/14/nvidia-commits-to-500bn-ai-server-production-in-the-us\">pledged</a> to build $500bn-worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years. NVIDIA has said it is pursuing “ambitious” manufacturing and server production in the US, but the $500bn figure remains a goal.</p><p><strong>10. India: $500bn.</strong> What is being called “Mission 500” aims to reach $500bn in annual bilateral trade by 2030. But it is a trade goal, not an investment pledge, and its end date would come after the end of Trump’s term. Further, the framework seems to allow US purchases of Indian goods to count towards the goal, which does not foster US investment and production.</p><p>Importantly, experts said, some of these pledges won’t materialise.</p><p>“Historically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver,” Roman V Yampolskiy, an AI specialist at the University of Louisville told PolitiFact in May. “There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.”</p><p>Trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments. President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act had attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent.</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>Trump says the US has received investment commitments totalling $18 trillion to $22 trillion since he took office in January.</p><p>The number Trump cites is about double what the White House’s website lists. And experts say the website’s current figure, $9.6 trillion, should be viewed with caution.</p><p>It includes aspirational, multi-year goals that might or might not come to fruition, and some items are future purchases or sales of products, rather than capital investments.</p><p>For the two biggest line items – commitments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – the amounts are multiple times those countries’ annual gross domestic product.</p><p><strong>We rate Trump’s statement False.</strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that he was seeking to freeze 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.18m) from being transferred to her as prize money.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Nobel Committee awarded Machado the prize in October for promoting democratic rights and fighting to achieve a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.</p><p>Assange’s criminal complaint, filed on Wednesday, accuses 30 individuals associated with the Nobel Foundation, including the organisation’s leadership, of misappropriating funds, facilitating war crimes and crimes against humanity, and financing crimes of aggression.</p><p>By awarding the prize to Machado, “an instrument of peace” was converted “into an instrument of war”, Assange said in the complaint, accusing Machado of inciting and endorsing the “commission of international crimes” by the United States as it applies military pressure to force Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro to step down.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-contentious-selection\">A contentious selection</h2><p>Machado’s selection for the prestigious honour was not without controversy after drawing criticism for her vocal support for Israel during its ongoing genocidal war in Gaza, including in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after her Nobel win was announced in October.</p><p>She has pledged to move Venezuela’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem should she take office.</p><p>Machado has also expressed support for US President Donald Trump’s months-long campaign against Venezuela’s Maduro, aligning herself with right-wing hawks in his administration.</p><p>Trump officials argue that Maduro has links to criminal drug gangs that pose a direct threat to US national security – despite doubts raised by Washington’s intelligence community – and have threatened to take <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/12/the-us-is-already-at-war-with-venezuela\">military action against Venezuela.</a></p><p>Since September, Trump has ordered more than <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/five-killed-as-us-military-destroys-two-more-vessels-in-pacific-ocean\">20 military strikes</a> against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and off Latin America’s Pacific coast, killing 104 people so far.</p><p>A massive deployment of US naval and air forces is also under way in Latin America, as fears grow that Washington <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/trump-administration-discusses-venezuela-amid-military-build-up-concerns\">could order an invasion</a> of Venezuela to topple Maduro.</p><p>Assange said this week that Machado’s backing of Trump’s military campaign “categorically exclude[s]” her from consideration for the prize as it violates the criteria set out in the will of the award’s founder, Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Nobel.</p><p>“The complaint shows that Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will explicitly mandates that the peace prize go to the individual who during the preceding year ‘conferred the greatest benefit to humankind’ by doing ‘the most or the best work for fraternity between nations’,” Assange said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>WikiLeaks also argued that there is “real risk” the funds have been or will be “diverted from their charitable purpose to facilitate aggression, crimes against humanity, and war crimes”.</p><p>The Peace Prize is awarded by a Norwegian selection committee in Oslo, but Assange argued the Stockholm-based foundation must assume financial responsibility. Swedish police confirmed to the AFP news agency that they had received the complaint.</p><p>Assange founded whistleblowing organisation WikiLeaks in 2006 and rose to prominence in 2010 after publishing a series of leaks from US Army intelligence analyst <a href=\"/news/2020/3/13/wikileaks-source-chelsea-manning-released-from-jail-2\">Chelsea Manning</a>.</p><p>In 2012, Assange was granted refuge by Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that were eventually dropped, staying there for seven years.</p><p>He was then jailed in London’s high-security Belmarsh prison from 2019 to 2024, as the US government sought to extradite him over charges he conspired to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information.</p><p>As part of a US <a href=\"/news/2024/6/25/julian-assange-is-free-wikileaks-founder-freed-in-deal-with-us\">Justice Department plea deal</a>, Assange was released from prison in the United Kingdom in 2024 after pleading guilty to a single count of violating espionage laws, before returning to his native Australia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But this is not entirely out of concern for the more than 70,000 people that Israel has killed in Gaza so far. Rather, many of their objections have focused on the cost of supporting Israel and the potential risks of doing so.</p><p>In June, the influential MAGA figure and Trump ally, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, openly broke with the president on the topic. Taking to social media, he wrote: “The real divide isn’t between people who support Israel and people who support Iran or the Palestinians. The real divide is between those who casually encourage violence, and those who seek to prevent it — between warmongers and peacemakers.”</p><p></p><p>Another of Trump’s inner circle, his former aide Steve Bannon, has also questioned the “special relationship”, describing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as having “betrayed” the US by launching strikes on Iran while knowing it did not have the tools needed for outright victory.</p><p>Later the same year, after Netanyahu had suggested that being anti-Israel was incompatible with being part of the MAGA movement, Bannon responded with what commentators described as a “scorched earth” approach, appearing to address the Israeli prime minister directly via social media. Bannon used colourful language to say that US citizens did not care about Netanyahu’s opinions towards MAGA, but instead cared about exposing the prime minister’s “pathological lies” so that the US stays out of “[Israel’s] next war”.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-s-support-for-israel-hurt-his-political-base\">Has Trump’s support for Israel hurt his political base?</h2><p>Up to a point.</p><p>While many Republican figures remain loyal, the most strident criticism – and one of the few on the US right to have accused Israel of genocide – has come from one of his previously most stalwart allies, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p><p>In the midst of a number of ruptures over the cost of living and the release of files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Greene earned Trump’s fury after she took to social media to call out the “genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza”.</p><p>Trump has responded to the congresswoman’s criticism by branding her Marjorie “Traitor” Greene.</p><p>Greene has since announced that she will be leaving Congress, but is still well respected by many in the MAGA movement, who see her as having stood up for an “America First” policy rather than an “Israel First” one.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132562\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132562\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132562\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_6926fbc62de5-1764162502.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"(FILES) US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R), Republican of Georgia, speaks alongside former US President and 2024 presidential hopeful Donald Trump at a campaign event in Rome, Georgia, on March 9, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132562\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) speaks alongside Trump at a campaign event in Rome, Georgia [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-much-might-this-be-costing-him-electorally\">How much might this be costing him electorally?</h2><p>It is not certain.</p><p>A new poll released this week by YouGov and the Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU) Policy Project showed a plurality of Republicans surveyed favoured letting the 10-year aid agreement lapse once it had run its course. Feelings were even more marked among younger Republicans, with 53 percent of those aged between 18 and 44 favouring ripping up the agreement entirely.</p><p>“Even before the war in Gaza, there was less support for Israel and greater sympathy for Palestinians among younger Americans, including young evangelical Christians,” Dov Waxman, professor of Israel studies at the University of California, told <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/spinning-genocide-why-is-israel-trying-to-reframe-its-war-on-gaza\">Al Jazeera</a> in October. “Israel’s behaviour during the war in Gaza has significantly accelerated the erosion of support for Israel among these key groups.”</p><p>But it is not just within Trump’s traditional base where his support for Israel is costing him. Polls also show it to be flagging in one of the most traditional pro-Israel branches of his base, evangelical Christians. In October, the Israeli government hired a newly formed PR company, Faith through Works, to, in its own <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/spinning-genocide-why-is-israel-trying-to-reframe-its-war-on-gaza\">words</a>, “combat low American Evangelical Christian approval of the Nation of Israel”.</p><p>Earlier this month, more than 1,000 US Christian pastors and influencers travelled to Israel, becoming “the largest group of American Christian leaders to visit Israel since its founding”.</p><p>Significantly, the trip was organised by American author Mike Evans, a close evangelical ally of Trump and reportedly a longstanding Netanyahu confidant.</p><p>And yet, as Gaza recedes from US headlines, the importance of Israel within US discourse may recede with it.</p><p>The forthcoming US elections will likely be influenced by a myriad of issues, including Israel, but most probably focused on the economy and other domestic concerns.</p><p>And if they are confronted with electoral losses ahead of the 2028 presidential election, Republicans – both supporters and opponents of Israel – may decide to put the issue to one side as they focus on confronting the Democrats.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This equates to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s funding requirements until 2027.</p><p>The loan would only have needed to be repaid to the EU if Russia agreed to pay reparations for the war to Ukraine.

Many of the moves are mandated by the United Nations, and then implemented by the EU, while other asset freezes come directly as a result of EU decisions, including those on Venezuela.</p><p>Explore the table below to find out which other countries have had assets frozen by the EU.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>In 2017, the EU froze assets of Venezuelan entities and individuals in response to the breakdown of democratic rule and human rights abuses in the country under President Nicolas Maduro. It specifically targeted individuals committing serious violations, and the European Council only recently extended these measures until January 2027.</p><p>In 2013, the European Council decided to place Syria under restrictive measures, including asset freezes and financial restrictions. These include member states being prohibited from entering into new commitments for grants, financial assistance or concessional loans to the Government of Syria.</p><p>These measures were put in place in protest against human rights violations committed under Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which was finally toppled in December last year. In 2014, the measures were expanded to include any individuals or entities which supported the regime and chemical weapons production.</p><p>After the overthrow of the government in December 2024, the EU suspended some of these measures to help support the political transition in Syria, but has maintained freezes on the Assad regime and the drugs trade.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-the-uk-and-us-imposed-asset-freezes-on\">Which countries have the UK and US imposed asset freezes on?</h2><p>According to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), which tracks financial sanctions, the United Kingdom has frozen the UK-based assets of individuals and entities from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-regimes-under-the-sanctions-act\">22 countries</a>, with most being the same states sanctioned by the EU.</p><p>The United States typically freezes assets via the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which catalogues different levels of sanctions, the US has almost fully frozen the assets of the governments of four countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Russia. In June this year, US President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order removing US sanctions on Syria.</p><p>The US has also placed country-specific sanctions on dozens of other nations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"387\" data-end=\"871\">For the past 25 years, Somalia’s political transitions have not succeeded by accident. They were sustained through international engagement, pressure, and mediation aimed at preserving fragile political settlements. Today, however, Somalia stands at a dangerous crossroads. The federal government’s unilateral pursuit of power, cloaked in the language of democratic reform, threatens to trigger a legitimacy crisis and undo decades of political gains and international investment.</p><p data-start=\"873\" data-end=\"1168\">Universal suffrage is an ideal that all Somalis share. However, deep political disagreement among groups, persistent security challenges, the looming expiry of the government’s mandate, and financial constraints make the timely implementation of universal suffrage nearly impossible.</p><p data-start=\"1170\" data-end=\"1442\">Pursuing universal suffrage without political consent, institutional readiness, or minimum security guarantees does not deepen democracy or sovereignty; it concentrates power in the hands of incumbents while increasing the risk of fragmentation and parallel authority.</p><p data-start=\"1444\" data-end=\"1954\">Instead of addressing these constraints through consensus, the government is engaged in a power grab, deploying the rhetoric of universal suffrage. It has unilaterally changed the constitution, which forms the basis of the political settlement. It has also enacted self-serving laws governing electoral processes, political parties, and the Election and Boundaries Commission. Moreover, the government has appointed 18 commissioners, all backed by the ruling Justice and Solidarity Party (JSP).</p><p data-start=\"1956\" data-end=\"2476\">Meanwhile, Somaliland announced its secession in 1991 and has been seeking recognition for the last three and a half decades. Most of Somalia’s national opposition, along with the leaders of Puntland and Jubbaland Federal Member States, have rejected the government’s approach and formed the Council for the Future of Somalia. These groups have announced plans to organise a political convention in Somalia, signalling their intent to pursue a parallel political process if the government does not listen.</p><p data-start=\"2478\" data-end=\"2874\">The Federal Government of Somalia does not fully control the country. Al-Shabab controls certain regions and districts and retains the ability to conduct operations well beyond its areas of direct control. Recently, the hardline group attacked a prison located near Villa Somalia, a stark reminder of the fragile security environment in which any electoral process would have to take place.</p><p data-start=\"2876\" data-end=\"3496\">Given the extent of polarisation and the limited time remaining under the current mandate, the international community must intervene to support Somalia’s sixth political transition in 2026. The most viable way to ensure a safe transition is to promote an improved indirect election model. Somalia’s political class has long experience with indirect elections, having relied on this model five times over the past 25 years. However, even with political agreement, the improved indirect election model for the 2026 dispensation must meet standards of timeliness, feasibility, competitiveness, and inclusivity.</p><p data-start=\"3498\" data-end=\"4091\">The current government mandate expires on May 15, 2026, and discussions are already under way among government supporters about a unilateral term extension. This must be discouraged. If a political agreement is reached in time, some form of technical extension may be necessary, but this should only occur while the 2026 selection and election processes are actively under way. One way to avoid this recurring crisis would be to establish a firm and binding deadline for elections. Puntland, for example, has maintained a schedule of elections held every five years in January.</p><p data-start=\"4093\" data-end=\"4572\">The improved indirect election model must also be feasible, meaning it should be straightforward to understand and implement. Political groups could agree on a fixed number of delegates to elect each seat. Recognised traditional elders from each constituency would then select delegates. Delegates from a small cluster of constituencies would collaborate to elect candidates for those seats. This system is far from ideal, but it is workable under current conditions.</p><p data-start=\"4574\" data-end=\"5134\">Unlike previous attempts, the improved indirect election model must also be genuinely competitive and inclusive. In past elections, politicians manipulated parliamentary selection by restricting competition through a practice known as “Malxiis” (bestman). The preferred candidate introduces a bestman, someone who pretends to compete but is never intended to win. For the upcoming election, the process must allow candidates to compete meaningfully rather than symbolically. A clear threshold of “no manipulation” and “no bestman” must be enforced.</p><p data-start=\"5136\" data-end=\"5646\">Inclusivity remains another major concern. Women’s seats, which should account for about 30 percent of parliament, have frequently been undermined. Any political agreement must include a clear commitment to inclusivity, and the institutions overseeing the election must be empowered to enforce the women’s quota. Government leaders have also arbitrarily managed seats allocated to Somaliland representatives. Given the unique political circumstances, a separate, negotiated, and credible process is required.</p><p data-start=\"5648\" data-end=\"6164\">Finally, widespread corruption has long tainted Somalia’s selection and election processes, undermining their integrity. In 2022, the presidents of the Federal Member States managed and manipulated the process. To curb corruption in the 2026 improved indirect election model, one effective measure would be to increase the number of voters per seat by aggregating constituencies. In practice, this would mean combined delegates from several constituencies voting together, reducing opportunities for vote buying.</p><p data-start=\"6166\" data-end=\"6644\">The international community has previously pressured Somali political actors to reach an agreement, insisting there should be “no term extension or unilateral elections by the government” and “no parallel political projects by the opposition”. This approach, combined with the leverage the international community still holds, can be effective. Somalia’s political class must again be pushed into serious, structured negotiations rather than unilateral manoeuvres.</p><p data-start=\"6646\" data-end=\"6982\">As before, the international community should clearly define political red lines. The government must refrain from any term extensions or unilateral election projects. At the same time, the opposition must abandon plans for a parallel political agenda, including Federal Member States conducting elections outside a political agreement.</p><p data-start=\"6984\" data-end=\"7494\">Somalis have repeatedly demonstrated their democratic aspirations. What stands in the way is not public will, but elite polarisation and the instrumentalisation of reform for political survival. At this critical moment, the international community cannot afford to retreat into passivity. Proactive and principled engagement is essential to prevent a legitimacy collapse, safeguard the gains of the past 25 years, and protect the substantial investments made in peacebuilding and state-building in Somalia.</p><p data-start=\"6984\" data-end=\"7494\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"703\" data-end=\"1026\">I am a Sami reindeer herder from northern Norway. My family and I have herded reindeer for generations. It is not just our livelihood, but an integral part of Sami culture – a way of life built on respect for nature, community and continuity. We make our living from the land, and we are proud of who we are and what we do.</p><p data-start=\"1028\" data-end=\"1080\">Today, that way of life is under serious threat.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"1511\">The Norwegian government is planning to build several hundred wind turbines on our grazing lands. These projects would disrupt reindeer migration routes, damage fragile ecosystems and undermine the very foundations of Sami reindeer herding. I am speaking out because if this goes ahead, we risk losing not just our income, but our culture. This is why I am part of Amnesty International’s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/\">Write for Rights</a> campaign this year.</p><p data-start=\"1513\" data-end=\"1845\">I grew up in a small place called Tana, where there were just 12 children in my school class. Of the five of us who were Sami, two came from families of reindeer herders. At the time, I believed the rest were Norwegian. Later, I learned that everyone in my class was Sami. Their parents had been pressured to hide who they were.</p><p data-start=\"1847\" data-end=\"2272\">When I was at school, the Norwegian state wanted all Sami people to be known simply as Norwegian. We were forced to speak the national language instead of our own. We were not allowed to speak Sami in school or sing Sami songs. At one point, even our traditional drum — used to connect with nature’s spirits — was banned by the church. These policies were designed to erase us, and they left deep scars that remain today.</p><p data-start=\"2274\" data-end=\"2564\">Thankfully, my parents allowed me to speak Sami at home, even though it was considered a forbidden language. I have always been proud of my heritage, but many others were denied that opportunity. We have struggled for decades to reclaim rights that should never have been taken from us.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2877\">I decided early on that I wanted to become a reindeer herder. It felt natural, rooted in the life I knew and loved. My husband and I married young and chose to follow in our ancestors’ footsteps. For a long time, we lived peacefully, believing that we would continue this life as generations before us had done.</p><p data-start=\"2879\" data-end=\"2909\">That peace has not lasted.</p><p data-start=\"2911\" data-end=\"3319\">Today, the government is taking our land. This will have a devastating effect on our income and on the reindeer themselves. From winter to spring, the reindeer graze in one area before migrating for the summer. They migrate on their own and give birth in the same place every year. Our role as herders is to follow them, not to control them. When migration routes are broken, the entire system collapses.</p><p data-start=\"3321\" data-end=\"3634\">In 2023, several hundred wind turbines were suddenly proposed directly on our summer grazing lands in Corgas. These plans threaten to destroy grazing areas, sever migration routes and undermine ancient herding traditions. Despite fierce opposition from Sami communities, the authorities are rushing approvals.</p><p data-start=\"3636\" data-end=\"4018\">We know what wind turbines do to reindeer. The animals avoid the areas entirely. If these projects go ahead, the land will become unusable. While the Norwegian state claims ownership of the land, the Sami people were granted the right to use it hundreds of years ago. Now, that right is being pushed aside in favour of industrial development. Our children risk being left with nothing.</p><p data-start=\"4020\" data-end=\"4410\">Reindeer herding sustains our community in many ways. The reindeer provide meat and materials for traditional handicrafts. My family also runs a small company that shares Sami knowledge and culture with visitors. Every year, about 4,000 people from all over the world come to learn about our way of life. If these wind farms are built, we risk losing everything we have built together.</p><p data-start=\"4412\" data-end=\"4979\">What makes this even harder to accept is the justification. We are told this is about green energy and the future. But at what cost, and to whom? Norway already has abundant electricity. Why is nature valued only when it can be exploited? We are the ones living with the effects of climate change. When I was growing up, winter temperatures could reach minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit). Today, winters are warmer. Sometimes it rains instead of snow, forming ice that prevents reindeer from accessing food. We need this land to survive a changing climate, not to sacrifice it.</p><p data-start=\"4981\" data-end=\"5259\">For more than a year, I have been fighting to defend our land and our community. I attend meetings with energy companies to explain how wind turbines will harm our livelihoods and the animals. I try to make our case to government officials, but it feels like no one is listening.</p><p data-start=\"5261\" data-end=\"5541\">Seven wind farm projects are now planned, involving hundreds of turbines. I have explained again and again what this will mean for us, yet the decisions seem already made. I feel like I am losing my life to this fight, simply to protect what should never have been threatened.</p><p data-start=\"5543\" data-end=\"5743\">I have three children and eight grandchildren. I worry deeply about the future they are being forced to inherit. Young people should not have to grow up constantly fighting for the right to exist.</p><p data-start=\"5745\" data-end=\"6067\">This struggle has taken a toll on my mental health. Some days, I am still trying to understand how to survive what is happening. My community supports me as best they can. They tell me I am strong, and their support gives me strength. I am not doing this only for my own family. I am doing it for the entire community.</p><p data-start=\"6069\" data-end=\"6282\">I will not stop. I protest outside government buildings with friends. We go together, because solidarity matters. I cannot sit back and watch our land be taken. As long as I have the strength to fight, I will.</p><p data-start=\"6284\" data-end=\"6500\">I have always been an activist. When I was six years old, I fought to speak Sami at school. I wanted it to be our first language, not our second, and I was not afraid to say so. That fight has never really ended.</p><p data-start=\"6502\" data-end=\"6821\">I am grateful that Amnesty International is <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/help-ellinor-protect-her-ancestral-lands/\">supporting our case</a> today. Their solidarity reminds me that we are not invisible, even when our own government treats us as if we are. This is our life. I do not know another way of living. We must protect our land so that future generations can continue to live as Sami.</p><p data-start=\"6502\" data-end=\"6821\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Since taking office in January, he has also teased plans to raise a triumphal arch in the capital, similar in style to Paris’s Arc de Triomphe.</p><p>Just this month, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/1996368099160080884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that a congressionally established think tank, the US Institute for Peace, had been renamed after Trump to honour “the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history”.</p><p>The Trump administration had forcibly taken control of the institute in March, and leadership over the think tank remains the subject of an ongoing lawsuit. A federal judge in May, however, called the nonprofit’s seizure “unlawful”.</p><p>Trump has long had his eye on the Kennedy Center in particular, and changes to the art centre arrived quickly after the Republican president took office in January.</p><p>Just a week into Trump’s second term, the president of the Kennedy Center, Deborah Rutter, stepped down amid rumours of a pressure campaign.</p><p>By early February, Trump had announced a purge of the Kennedy Center’s board members, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113964959500715895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claiming</a> on social media that they stood against his “Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”.</p><p>“At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN,” he said, offering a twist on his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.</p><p>He added that he would take the helm as the centre’s chairman, overseeing programming.</p><p>“Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” Trump wrote. “The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”</p><p>The leadership shakeup was greeted by protests and cancellations, with touring productions of hit shows like the musical Hamilton and Fellow Travelers dropping out of the Kennedy Center’s lineup.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4183097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4183097\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25297585935508-1766090891.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Worker paints gold columns white at the Kennedy Center\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Worker Odden Shaw paints over a gold-colored column inside the Hall of Nations at the Kennedy Center on October 24 [Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"renaming-the-kennedy-center\">Renaming the Kennedy Center</h2><p>Still, in the months since, Trump has repeatedly referred to the arts institution as the “Trump-Kennedy Center”, signalling his desire to have his name etched on its marble facade.</p><p>He also selected the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award given for lifetime achievement in US arts and culture.</p><p>While announcing the honorees in August, Trump gave a winking allusion to his petition to change the Kennedy Center’s name.</p><p>“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115015798555807745\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>He also played up the changes he had made to the art centre’s structure, including by painting its formerly gold columns white.</p><p>“Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” Trump wrote. “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!”</p><p>Certain Republicans took up Trump’s call to rebaptise the art centre. Representative <a href=\"https://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Simpson</a> of Idaho, for instance, introduced a bill that would name the complex’s opera house after First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Congressman Bob Onder of Missouri, meanwhile, put forward another piece of legislation to wipe Kennedy’s name away entirely, calling the art complex instead the “Donald J Trump Center for Performing Arts”.</p><p>But those kinds of proposals have met significant pushback, including from the surviving Kennedy family.</p><p>On Thursday, in the wake of Leavitt’s announcement, President Kennedy’s niece Maria Shriver expressed shock that the art centre might be renamed.</p><p>“Some things leave you speechless, and enraged, and in a state of disbelief. At times such as that, it’s better to be quiet. For how long, I can’t say,” she <a href=\"http://x.com/mariashriver/status/2001737390306791682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>When similar proposals had been floated in the past, Shriver <a href=\"https://x.com/mariashriver/status/1949954611793842186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> the idea “insane” and said, “It makes my blood boil.”</p><p>Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy’s grandson and a Democratic candidate for Congress in the 2026 midterms, appeared to question whether the White House’s announcement was even legitimate.</p><p>“Microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/2001728352030232609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Democrats likewise voiced outrage at the proposed name change, with some questioning if it was even legal, given the congressional act that gives the structure its name.</p><p>Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, for instance, called the initiative “deeply troubling”.</p><p>“Renaming the Kennedy Center to include a sitting or former president’s name, particularly one who is still a partisan political figure, undermines the purpose of the institution,” Cohen said in a <a href=\"https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cohen-urges-president-trump-reject-inappropriate-renaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“The Kennedy Center should remain what it was always meant to be: a living memorial to President Kennedy and a cultural home for all Americans, not a vehicle for personal or political branding.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
