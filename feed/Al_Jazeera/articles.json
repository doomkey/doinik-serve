So if Bolsonaro spoke, it’s settled!”</p><p>The announcement sets up a rematch of sorts between the Bolsonaro family and Brazil’s current left-wing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p><h2 id=\"imprisoned-over-a-coup-attempt\">Imprisoned over a coup attempt</h2><p>The elder Bolsonaro and Lula previously faced each other in the 2022 presidential race. It was a closely fought match: Neither candidate won a majority of the vote in the first round, which forced the contest into a run-off.</p><p>But on October 30, Lula emerged victorious in the second round, squeaking out a slim victory with 50.9 percent of the vote. It was the closest outcome to a presidential race since Brazil’s return to democracy in the 1980s.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jair Bolsonaro, the incumbent, refused to publicly acknowledge his defeat. Instead, he and his allies filed a <a href=\"/news/2022/11/22/brazils-bolsonaro-seeks-to-challenge-election-loss\">legal challenge</a> against the vote, arguing there was evidence of “serious failures” and “malfunctions” in the voting machines.</p><p>It was a theory Jair Bolsonaro had publicly advanced even before the first vote was cast, while he was on the campaign trail. Critics have pointed out that there is no evidence to support his claims.</p><p>The legal challenge <a href=\"/news/2022/11/24/brazilian-judge-rejects-attempt-to-overturn-lula-election-victory\">was ultimately tossed</a> for being “in total bad faith”.</p><p>But Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters continued to rally against his defeat. In the months that followed, they attacked <a href=\"/news/2022/12/13/bolsonaro-supporters-attack-police-headquarters-in-brazil\">federal police headquarters</a> in the capital, Brasilia, and after Lula’s inauguration on January 8, 2023, they stormed government buildings in the city’s Three Powers Plaza.</p><p>Some of the protesters sought to provoke a military response that would overthrow Lula’s nascent government.</p><p>The riot at the Three Powers Plaza ultimately spurred federal investigations, raids and arrests.</p><p>Following his electoral defeat, Jair Bolsonaro also found himself mired in probes and legal complaints, which ranged from fraud allegations related to his COVID-19 records to accusations of embezzlement.</p><p>In June 2023, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE) <a href=\"/news/2023/6/30/brazil-court-votes-to-bar-bolsonaro-from-office-until-2030\">voted to bar</a> Jair Bolsonaro from public office for eight years, calling his use of public resources to spread election falsehoods an “abuse of power”.</p><p>And just last month, Jair Bolsonaro <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/brazils-supreme-court-orders-jair-bolsonaro-to-begin-prison-sentence\">was taken into custody</a> to serve a 27-year prison sentence, after he was convicted in September of plotting to stage a coup.</p><p>Jair Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing and described his prosecution as a politically motivated hit job, designed to dent his popularity.</p><h2 id=\"politics-a-family-affair\">Politics, a family affair</h2><p>His sons, meanwhile, have transformed into public advocates for their father, petitioning for his release.</p><p>Earlier this year, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a member of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, travelled to the United States to lobby President Donald Trump for help with his father’s case. Trump has since spoken out against Jair Bolsonaro’s prosecution and imposed tariffs on Brazil’s economy.</p><p>In mid-November, a panel on Brazil’s Supreme Court voted to put Eduardo Bolsonaro on trial to weigh whether his actions amounted to obstruction of justice, as an attempt to sway the outcome of his father’s trial.</p><p>Jair Bolsonaro’s family and allies have also pushed Congress to pass <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/brazilians-protest-bill-that-could-grant-ex-president-bolsonaro-amnesty\">an amnesty bill</a> that would allow the ex-president to walk free.</p><p>In the lead-up to Friday’s endorsement, there was speculation that former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro might be an option to represent the PL in next year’s election. Sao Paulo’s governor, Tarcisio Gomes de Freitas, was also floated as a possibility.</p><p>But the selection of Flavio Bolsonaro, 44, is seen as an appeal to the ex-president’s far-right base.</p><p>That choice could end up alienating centrists in Brazil’s conservative arenas. Flavio has served in the Senate since 2019 and previously was a state deputy for Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Currently, the biggest contender in the upcoming race is Lula himself.</p><p>In late October, the left-wing president announced he would seek <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/brazils-president-lula-announces-he-will-seek-a-fourth-term-in-2026\">a fourth term</a>. Now 80 years old, he has reassured his supporters that he feels as energetic as ever.</p><p>Brazilian law allows for only two consecutive terms at a time, but more are possible if they are not back-to-back. Lula first served as president from 2003 to 2011, before mounting his latest successful bid in 2022.</p><p>Polls currently show Lula in the lead for next year’s race, though much could change. After all, the vote is more than nine months away.</p><p>A survey conducted in late November by the National Confederation of Transport and the research firm MDA Institute attempted to measure the odds of various match-ups Lula could face in October.</p><p>Lula came out on top each time. When pitted against the imprisoned Jair Bolsonaro, he earned nearly 39 percent support to the right-wing leader’s 27 percent. When compared to Michelle Bolsonaro, Lula had even higher support: 42 percent to her 23 percent. Flavio Bolsonaro was not among the options surveyed.</p><p>Lula would be 85 years old if he were to win and complete a fourth term.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We want to live in a safe world, in a safe environment. We want to unite, and that’s what we do here today, and that’s what we want to do at the World Cup,” Infantino said as he presented the award.</p><p>“Mr President, you definitely deserve the first FIFA Peace Prize for your action, for what you have obtained in your way, but you have obtained in an incredible way.”</p><p>Trump has openly campaigned for the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/10/10/nobel-peace-prize-2025-2\">Nobel Peace Prize</a> but missed out on the award earlier this year.</p><p>He said the new FIFA recognition is one of the “great honours” he has received, and he repeated his claim that his presidency has saved millions of lives and ended eight wars.</p><p>The US president’s remarks were brief, but he still could not help but take a shot at the record of his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.</p><p>“The United States, one year ago, was not doing too well, and now I have to say we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-departure-from-past-statements\">A departure from past statements</h2><p>Infantino has previously warned against using football to stoke division. “There’s no more powerful tool than sport to unite the people,” he said in 2023. “Now we have to protect the autonomy of sport: the political neutrality of sport and to protect the values of sport.”</p><p>Two years later, critics point out that Infantino has created a prize to celebrate peace and unity, and then handed it to a president <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">who called</a> people from Somalia “garbage” just days prior.</p><p>“Giving Donald Trump a prize for peace is like giving <a href=\"/sports/2014/8/19/i-wont-bite-anymore-says-suarez\">Luis Suarez</a> a prize for not biting people’s ears off,” football journalist Zach Lowy wrote on social media, referring to the Uruguayan forward who has been caught up in at least three biting incidents on the pitch throughout his career.</p><p>Infantino appears to have forged strong ties with Trump as the US prepares to co-host the World Cup with Mexico and Canada next year.</p><p>The FIFA president has been a regular guest at the White House, and in October, he attended a ceremony with Trump to formalise the Gaza truce in Egypt.</p><p>FIFA did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><p>The Democratic Party was among the critics taking aim at the new FIFA award. “Trump couldn’t win a Nobel Peace Prize so FIFA made one up for him,” it said in a social media post.</p><p>But rights advocates levelled more serious criticism at the US president, invoking his rights record and foreign policy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-record\">Trump’s record</h2><p>While Trump has helped broker some peace deals between warring parties, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/trump-hails-great-day-for-the-world-as-drc-rwanda-finalise-peace-deal\">most recently between</a> Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he has been an advocate for increased military spending across the Western world.</p><p>Trump also ordered the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, and he has continued to arm Israel despite its well-documented abuses against Palestinians.</p><p>In the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">Western Hemisphere</a>, Trump’s administration has also carried out 22 air strikes against vessels that it says are carrying drugs, killing at least 86 people. Legal experts have widely condemned the attacks as unlawful acts of extrajudicial killing.</p><p>Moreover, Trump has been amassing military assets near Venezuela, raising speculation that the US may go to war with the country to topple left-wing President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>At home, Trump has intensified an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">anti-immigration crackdown</a> that has led to the detention and attempted <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/us-judge-orders-release-of-palestine-advocate-mahmoud-khalil\">deportation of non-citizens</a>.

citizen.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order on January 20, his first day in office, decreeing that children born to parents in the US illegally or on temporary visas would not automatically become US citizens.</p><p>Lower courts have ruled the order to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</p><p>Trump’s executive order was premised on the idea that anyone in the US illegally, or on a visa, was not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.</p><p>The Supreme Court rejected such a narrow definition in a landmark 1898 case.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has also argued that the 14th Amendment, passed in the wake of the Civil War, addresses the rights of former slaves and not the children of undocumented migrants or temporary US visitors.</p><p>In a brief with the court, Trump’s solicitor general, John Sauer, argued that “the erroneous extension of birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens has caused substantial harm to the United States”.</p><p>“Most obviously, it has impaired the United States’ territorial integrity by creating a strong incentive for illegal immigration,” Sauer said.</p><p>Trump’s executive order had been due to come into effect on February 19, but it was halted after federal judges ruled against the administration in <a

described the president’s executive order as “blatantly unconstitutional”.</p><p>Conservatives hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, and three of the justices were appointed by Trump.</p><p>Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has spearheaded the legal challenges to the attempt to end birthright citizenship, said she is hopeful the top court will “strike down this harmful order once and for all”.</p><p>“Federal courts around the country have consistently rejected President Trump’s attempts to strip away this core constitutional protection,” Wang said.</p><p>“The president’s action goes against a core American right that has been a part of our Constitution for over 150 years.”</p><p>The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year, allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.</p><p>Among these policies were

The project had reportedly led to his career epiphany.</p><p>Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.</p><p>“They’re going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,” he said with a laugh.</p><p>Eventually, the mall was remodelled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look.

The 76-storey New York By Gehry building, once one of the world’s tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.</p><p>That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.</p><p>Not everyone was a fan of Gehry’s work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.</p><p>Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as “oppressive”, arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.</p><p>Still other critics included Dwight D Eisenhower’s family, who objected to Gehry’s bold proposal for a memorial to honour the nation’s 34th president.</p><p>Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower’s life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4153764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP22260629577634-1764970107.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C478&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Dancing House in Prague\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Architect Frank Gehry designed what’s known as the Dancing House — or the Fred and Ginger Building — in Prague, Czech Republic [File: Petr David Josek/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons cartoon show, in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.</p><p>In that episode, he came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson’s letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, “Frank Gehry, you’re a genius!”</p><p>“Some people think I actually do that,” he would later tell The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on February 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a US citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him anti-Semitism might be holding back his career.</p><p>Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn’t until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognised his talent.</p><p>“It was like the first thing in my life that I’d done well in,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153761\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153761\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4153761\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25339738174095-1764970092.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Guggenheim museum in Spain\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has come to exemplify Gehry’s style [File: Alvaro Barrientos/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954.

Most notable were Egypt’s parliamentary elections, with the first round held in November, and runoffs planned for early December.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The elections have been dominated by a coalition of pro-government parties running <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/27/egypts-all-important-parliamentary-elections-arent-elections-at-all\">unopposed</a> for the party list seats, which are half of the parliamentary seats being voted for. Individual candidates can run for the other half of the seats in contention, but those seats are difficult to win for candidates without the necessary financial resources and connections.</p><p>Critics, therefore, believe that the race is essentially only between loyalists to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, with a group of Egyptian human rights groups saying that the elections had occurred “under chronic and severe restrictions on meaningful political participation”.</p><p>With that context in mind, the elections have not attracted a groundswell of attention from Egyptians, continuing a pattern since el-Sisi took power in the country more than a decade ago, <a href=\"/opinions/2019/6/19/mohamed-morsi-an-egyptian-tragedy\">after a coup</a> against Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi.</p><p>“They are even less important than under [former President Hosni] Mubarak, it is not the talk of the day,” said a businessman in the textile industry, who did not wish to give their full name for fear of reprisals. “There are fewer banners and posters than during previous elections.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"capital-injections\">Capital injections</h2><p>In the shadow of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, it is often forgotten that less than two years ago, Egypt experienced the worst economic crisis seen under el-Sisi. Billions of dollars worth of capital injections from the <a href=\"/news/2024/3/6/egypt-strikes-expanded-8-billion-deal-with-the-imf\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a>, the World Bank and the European  Union, and massive investment pledges from the UAE in early 2024 prevented an economic crisis in Egypt.</p><p>Leading to the question, how is Egypt’s economy faring now? On paper, the picture looks promising. Recently, Egypt’s credit rating was upgraded, GDP growth is increasing, skyrocketing inflation rates that battered the population for years have cooled down, and investment from the Gulf continues. For example, Qatar is planning to develop a prime coastal strip near el-Alamein on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, not far from a similar UAE-funded project now under construction.</p><p>Earlier this year, the IMF completed its fourth review of Egypt’s economic reforms as part of conditions attached to its loan, and distributed a <a href=\"/economy/2024/12/25/imf-egypt-reach-deal-to-unlock-one-to-two-billion-dollars\">further $1.2bn</a> – part of a loan worth $8bn in total, of which Egypt has now withdrawn $3.2bn.</p><p>The IMF continues to voice concern about state and military control in the economy – issues that have been on the table continuously under el-Sisi’s rule – but the overall message has been that Egypt is performing as desired. Between the lines, one can read that el-Sisi’s Egypt, especially as the precious peace agreement between Egypt and Israel has held steady amid Israel’s war in Gaza, is simply too big to fail.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dollars-available\">Dollars available</h2><p>The capital injections have had their impact on the ground. There are dollars in the banks and after a major devaluation in 2024, the Egyptian pound is relatively stable. It serves the business community well.</p><p>“Our exports rise every quarter,” said a textile company owner. “There are many Turkish textile companies opening in Egypt, drawn by our cheap labour costs.”</p><p>That is the intended effect of the devaluation: translated into foreign currency, labour costs decrease, making Egypt an attractive destination to move production that depends on low-skilled labour.</p><p>While Turkish companies are a new competitor to his business, the company owner sees the benefit for Egyptian workers. “I had to raise salaries to keep up with what Turkish companies offer, I can see that has a positive effect on people,” he said.</p><p>That said, when measured in foreign currency, salaries are still lower than before the 2024 devaluation.</p><p>“For the past year or two, exports were ridiculously cheap [due to low labour costs]. We see that advantage slowly fading now. Salaries will get better every year.”</p><p>Mohamed Usama, an engineer in a facility manufacturing steel products, has also seen conditions improve. His employer relies on the import of raw materials and export of higher-value products.</p><p>“The stable exchange rate made a huge difference,” Usama said. “It made imports and exports reliable. There are no more problems with wiring money; it is predictable when shipments come in. There are dollars available.”</p><p>“The waiting time for the arrival of an order of raw materials is now one month instead of three to six,” he added.</p><p>That predictability has allowed factories to hire again, according to Usama, even if he pointed out that many contracts were still temporary, leaving workers cautious.</p><p>Osama Diab, a Egyptian political economist at the Belgium university KU Leuven, is sceptical that the loans and investment deals have fixed Egypt’s economy.  “These mainly treat the symptoms,” he wrote in an email. “I don’t believe that any of the structural issues are resolved. The economy is still dependent on offering high interest rates to generate hard currency, and there are still massive current account imbalances.”</p><p>And while business sentiment is generally positive, hardship for many Egyptians appears far from over.</p><p>One economic parameter, non-oil private sector activity, has remained in contraction for most of the past five years. One culprit is low domestic consumer demand. That is also something the textile company owner has noticed.</p><p>“Purchasing power is not strong; it has not improved yet,” the textile company owner said. “Customers complain about not having money. Not only in textile, but in many sectors.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"more-improvements-needed\">More improvements needed</h2><p>Diab explained that money from international institutions and investments is primarily being used to repay debts, and not on income or job-generating activities. “That means the vast majority of citizens will not feel any improvement,” he said.</p><p>“The government’s ability to honour its increasing debt obligation runs in contradiction with its ability to fulfil its social obligations,” according to Diab.</p><p>While the opening of the Grand Museum was surrounded by promises of increased tourism revenues coming in, people were hit with another fuel price increase in November. The price of electricity and cooking gas are set to rise, as well, early next year.</p><p>That means that even with the improved wages on offer in some sectors, the general sentiment is that they still need to rise further.</p><p>In fact, last year Egypt introduced a new labour law that decreased the mandatory annual raise for workers, and excluded a portion of the workforce from guaranteed annual raises all together. The law also allowed employers to use temporary contracts at will.</p><p>The government presented the law as a positive step for Egypt – for instance, it increases paid maternity leave, modernising relations between employer and employee. “The new law is simple, clear, and easy to apply. It provides contractual flexibility,” said Minister of Labour Mohamed Gobran after the law came into effect in September. “The new law is highly advantageous for employers. It simplifies many aspects of workforce management.”</p><p>Mahmoud, a farmer in his 40s from a village in Egypt’s Nile Delta, north of Cairo, is typical of those who are still struggling despite the economic shots. He owns a small plot of land that provides most of the income for his family of six, and takes up household service jobs in addition.</p><p>Rural areas in the Nile Delta, and especially Upper Egypt, have been hit hardest with high poverty rates in the past years, driving people to move away for work.</p><p>“The museum is good for Egypt, but mainly for tourism, for hotels, not for all Egyptians,” he said. ‘The farmers and others in the countryside are just trying to get by with the expensive prices. They wouldn’t abandon their whole lives and go work in hotels in Cairo. What would a farmer go to do in tourism anyway?’</p><p>Mahmoud complained that subsidies – for instance, those on fuel and food – have been removed as part of the IMF-induced reforms, making life more expensive.</p><p>That leads to often heard criticism of IMF conditions, including that, in the pursuit of free market economics, it is the poor that suffer, even if the general business climate improves.</p><p>“In Cairo, the museum will generate income and new business activity, but that income will never reach us here,” Mahmoud said. “We are looking for subsidies, but nothing is subsidised any more.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Though there may be a broad consensus that Trump is breaking international law, it is unclear what legal or political mechanisms could halt his bombing campaign.</p><p>“Certainly, trying to rein in a superpower like the United States is something very difficult,” Saul said. “This has to stop from within the US itself.”</p><h2 id=\"guardrails-have-been-eroded\">‘Guardrails have been eroded’</h2><p>Experts say that oversight could potentially come from a number of sources.</p><p>On the domestic front, the US Congress has the ability to pass legislation barring military strikes or cut off funds for the campaign.</p><p>Military members involved in the attacks could also refuse to carry out what they see as unlawful orders.</p><p>Foreign leaders could limit or pause intelligence cooperation with the US.</p><p>Thus far, however, few meaningful restraints have been placed on the Trump administration.</p><p>Twice, the US Senate has voted to defeat legislation that would have required the White House to obtain congressional support for its bombing campaign.</p><p>In October, the first bill failed by a vote of 51 to 48. In November, the second was voted down by a margin of 51 to 49.</p><p>On the international side, there have also been reports that the United Kingdom and Colombia considered whether to stop sharing intelligence from the Caribbean with the US.</p><p>But officials from both countries have downplayed those reports, with Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti calling the situation a “misunderstanding”.</p><p>Other mechanisms meant to assess the legality of the Trump administration’s military actions have faced political pressure.</p><p>News outlets such as CNN and NBC News reported that US military lawyers — known as judge advocates general or JAG officers — who questioned the legality of the bombing campaign were sidelined or fired.</p><p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has previously said that he does not want military lawyers acting as “roadblocks” to Trump’s policies.</p><p>“Military lawyers are only roadblocks if you want to break the law,” said Sarah Harrison, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.</p><p>Harrison previously served as an associate general counsel at the Department of Defense, where she advised the military on questions of international law. She said the Trump administration has deliberately weakened institutional norms and legal safeguards meant to prevent the abuse of military power.</p><p>“They have established a blueprint to direct the military to commit an unlawful order without resistance,” she said.</p><p>“The guardrails inside have been eroded.”</p><h2 id=\"unlimited-authority\">‘Unlimited authority’</h2><p>Numerous laws, however, exist to prohibit extrajudicial killings like those Trump is currently carrying out in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific.</p><p>Article Two of the UN Charter, for instance, largely prohibits countries from using force internationally, barring an act of self-defence.</p><p>The Geneva Conventions, a cornerstone of humanitarian law, also bar military violence against “persons taking no active part” in hostilities.</p><p>The Trump administration’s use of “double-tap” strikes — where a second attack is conducted to kill survivors from the first — has raised additional legal concerns.</p><p>The Hague Convention explicitly outlaws “no quarter given” policies, wherein soldiers are ordered to execute those who could otherwise be taken prisoner.</p><p>The Trump administration nevertheless denied that any of its strikes violate international or domestic law.</p><p>Instead, it argues that the vessels it bombed contained deadly narcotics, and that drug-traffickers are ‘unlawful combatants’ whose transportation of narcotics represents an attack on the US.</p><p>“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both US and international law, with all actions in complete compliance with the law of armed conflict,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said.</p><p>“Lawyers up and down the chain of command have been thoroughly involved in reviewing these operations prior to execution.”</p><p>But legal scholars say that the administration’s claims do not hold water.</p><p>Rebecca Ingber, a professor at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University who previously served as an adviser to the US Department of State, said that the Trump administration has tried to erase the distinction between criminal activity and an armed attack that would justify a military response.</p><p>She compared the administration’s reasoning to the kind of garbled legal analysis an AI assistant like Grok might produce.</p><p>“It feels to me that some political actors inside the executive branch have taken all of the statements and memos about the use of force over the last 25 years, jumbled up the words, thrown them into Grok, and asked it to come up with a legal argument,” said Ingber.</p><p>“They think they can throw around words like ‘armed conflict’ and ‘terrorist’, and that if they label someone as such, it can give them unlimited authority,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"a-pliant-congress\">A pliant Congress</h2><p>Trump is not the first president to spur concerns about his broad use of military force.</p><p>After the attacks on September 11, 2001, presidents including George W Bush and Barack Obama carried out military strikes in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen, as part of a global “war on terror”.</p><p>Both men drew on congressional authorisations for military force (AUMFs) that had been narrowly drafted to respond to the September 11 attacks.</p><p>Those authorisations were applied over time to an expanding list of organisations and conflicts.</p><p>Critics, however, have argued that this growing use of military force extends presidential authority beyond its constitutional limits and has weakened oversight and transparency.</p><p>Trump has continued the trend of presidents deploying the military without Congress’s approval first.</p><p>Normally, the power to declare war and authorise military action falls to Congress, not the president, and Congress retains the authority to rein in presidential military deployments.</p><p>Many conservative lawmakers, however, have been hesitant to challenge Trump, who maintains a firm hold over the Republican Party. Others accept the administration’s depiction of the air strikes as an anti-narcotics campaign.</p><p>Only two Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted with Democrats in their recent attempts to stop the boat bombings.</p><p>“From the bombing of Iran to possible attacks on Venezuela, there are some entrepreneurial figures on the right willing to criticise the administration when it carries out interventionist policies,” said Curt Mills, the director of the American Conservative magazine, which advocates for a more restrained foreign policy.</p><p>“But Congress is weak. Its influence over foreign policy is at a historical nadir.”</p><h2 id=\"there-is-no-limiting-principle\">‘There is no limiting principle’</h2><p>Given the reluctance of most Republican lawmakers to assert congressional authority, some experts expressed hope that voters will send lawmakers to Congress who will exert greater control over military attacks abroad.</p><p>But thus far, at least, a majority of voters do not appear to view the current strikes with particular alarm.</p><p>In a CBS News poll last month, about 53 percent of respondents expressed approval for the strikes against the alleged drug boats, while 47 percent expressed disapproval.</p><p>Ingber, the Yale Law professor, speculated that decades of military action overseas during the war on terror may have primed the public to see the current strikes as normal.</p><p>“It’s possible that this is a frog that has already been boiled, and the public has grown to accept the idea of the president using force on his say-so,” said Ingber. “Even, in this case, against suspected criminals for suspected crimes that we don’t even have the death penalty for in this country.”</p><p>But if the “war on terror” has helped desensitise the public to the use of military power overseas, legal experts say the current strikes represent a radical new development: the application of wartime powers to criminal activities.</p><p>“The president is claiming the power to kill anyone he accuses of a crime, no questions asked,” said Annie Shiel, the US director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC), an advocacy group.</p><p>“There is no limiting principle there. And that makes the stakes extremely high for people in the US and around the world.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They come amid a longstanding <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/13/unionised-starbucks-workers-begin-open-ended-us-strike\">history of the coffeeshop</a> chain being at odds with its workers. In December 2024, workers hit the picket line when negotiations for a contract that had started in April, stalled.</p><p>At the time, the union rejected a proposal that guaranteed raises of 2 percent, but did not include any improvements in healthcare packages, which workers said were inadequate. Starbucks has not budged.</p><p>“We’re focused on continuing to offer the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. The facts speak for themselves: partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year,” Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153611\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153611\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4153611 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5965-1764965743.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Starbucks alleges that there 25 Starbucks unionised workers alongside supporters, while Starbucks Workers United said that at least 100 baristas were present at Thursday’s rally in New York [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The union says the wages offered are lower than what the company has claimed [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Starbucks Workers United points out that starting wages, which do not include tips, in 33 states are $15.25 per hour. That’s what Al Jazeera found on Starbucks’ jobs board: a barista position in Elko, Nevada starts at  $15.25, a supervisor role in Kansas starts at $19.37 per hour, a barista role in Brooklyn, New York, is open for a starting wage of $17.25 and a shift supervisor role that starts at $22.25 per hour.</p><p>The union said that many baristas get less than 20 hours per week, which is below the cut-off for benefits; Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify those claims.</p><p>Starbucks said that the union is demanding a 65 percent pay increase in the immediate future and 77 percent over the next three years, and higher pay for other elements of their jobs, including weekend hours, early or late hours, sorting inventory, and working on days of promotions, like the store’s Red Cup Day, which typically brings in heavier traffic.</p><p>Starbucks Workers United has pushed back and has said that it is a misrepresentation of their requests and combines several proposals into one.</p><p>“That allegation is not true. We presented a set of economic proposals as options to negotiate over and ultimately get to more pay and benefits. Starbucks simply said ‘no’ to all of them, and then disingenuously added up all the options as if they were one cohesive demand,”  Michelle Eisen, Starbucks Workers United spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That would be like walking into Starbucks, adding up the entire menu, and saying it costs $1,000 to order a drink at Starbucks.”</p><h2 id=\"political-pressure\">Political pressure</h2><p>Starbucks is also facing increased pressure in New York City, where the chain has 300 stores. Both the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, and the incoming one, Zohran Mamdani, are putting pressure on the company to meet union demands.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153615\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153615\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4153615 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5768-1764965832.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Starbucks Workers United began an open-ended strike in November [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153615\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Starbucks alleges that there 25 Starbucks unionised workers alongside supporters, while the union said that at least 100 baristas were present at Thursday’s rally in New York [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>This week, the current Adams administration solidified a $38.9m settlement with the coffeeshop chain for violations of the city’s Fair Workweek law, which requires employers to provide predictable schedules, advance notice, and to give existing workers the opportunity for more hours before hiring new employees. The city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) said the company committed more than half a million violations of the law since 2021.</p><p>The settlement covers those who worked at one of the 300 locations across New York City between July 4, 2021, and July 7, 2024.</p><p>Also this week, Mamdani and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders joined striking workers outside a Starbucks location in Brooklyn, New York.</p><p>While Mamdani answered Al Jazeera’s questions on Tuesday in a news conference, his press team did not respond to requests for comment following the arrests of members of the union he marched with only two days before.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Sanders — who in March 2023 grilled then-CEO Howard Schultz on union-busting allegations — told Al Jazeera that momentum is now on the side of workers.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what is also different is that for years, four years have come and gone, and hundreds of shops have voted to join unions, 12,000 workers have voted to join unions. And yet Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract,” Sanders told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It’s not clear what the next steps are. On the federal level, under the administration of US President Donald Trump, the National Labor Relations Board — the federal agency where workers bring labour rights complaints to— has been scaled back.</p><p>Since Trump took office, the agency has lacked quorum, meaning there are not enough members to make key decisions related to allegations of unfair labour practices. Earlier this year, the Trump administration fired board member Gwynne Wilcox, and fired the general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, two Biden-era appointees who took pro-labour stances.</p><h2 id=\"long-term-tensions\">Long-term tensions</h2><p>The nationwide movement — a wave of unionisation that has called for better pay has been years in the making, beginning after a store in Buffalo, New York, voted to unionise in 2021.</p><p>Among allegations of union-busting practices under then CEO Schultz, is surveillance amongst workers and what are called “captive audience” meetings in which workers had to listen to anti-union messaging from the company.</p><p>In 2024, the NLRB ruled that Schultz made a threat to employees in a 2022 town hall in which he said, “If you’re not happy at Starbucks, you can go work for another company.”</p><p>“There is an exhaustion amongst New Yorkers at the sheer contrast between these workers, who cannot afford to live in this city, and CEOs who are making $96m a year on the backs of those same workers’ labour,” Mamdani said.</p><p>Mamdani was referring to Brian Niccol, who took over as CEO from Schultz in September 2024,<a href=\"/economy/2025/11/13/unionised-starbucks-workers-begin-open-ended-us-strike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> with a compensation package </a> of nearly $96m — or 6,666 times the median employee salary. That represents the largest CEO-to-worker pay gap among the S&amp;P 500, according to the AFL-CIO’s Executive Paywatch tracker.</p><p>With sales slumping, Niccol was brought in with the hopes that he would turn the company around after a short stint by Laxman Narasimhan, who was ousted by the board amid looming pressure from activist investors and slowing sales.</p><p>Starbucks Workers United said that the former CEO was at the negotiating table.</p><p>“Bargaining commenced in a real way under his [Narasimhan] leadership,” Eisen added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153625\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153625\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4153625 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5991-1764966052.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Michelle Eisen, Starbucks Workers United’s national spokesperson has called on Starbucks to return the negotiating table [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153625\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michelle Eisen, Starbucks Workers United’s national spokesperson, has called on Starbucks to return to the negotiating table [Andy Hirschfeld/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-new-ceo\">A new CEO</h2><p>Niccol’s appointment was a step back, according to Eisen.</p><p>“We had a solid 9 months of really good bargaining in 2024, which came to a screeching halt when this current CEO stepped into that role,” said Eisen, whose Buffalo location became the first store to vote to unionise.</p><p>Niccol has struggled to address slumping sales. Global same-store sales rose by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, lifted by international markets. North America same-store sales remained flat.</p><p>In September, the Seattle-based coffee shop chain announced the closure of 1 percent of its US stores. While it does not impact store workers, 900 corporate employees lost their jobs as part of a $1bn restructuring plan.</p><p>Niccol came from Chipotle, which faced a slew of union-busting allegations and settlements under him during the more than six years he led the company. In 2023, the company closed its first unionised store in Augusta, Maine, and later agreed to pay employees of the store $240,000 as part of a settlement.</p><p>Chipotle also faced similar penalties from the City of New York, much like this week’s settlement with Starbucks. In 2022, the company agreed to pay<a href=\"/economy/2022/8/9/chipotle-to-pay-nyc-workers-20m-for-violating-city-labour-laws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> $20m to settle allegations it violated city labour laws</a>, including failing to provide predictable schedules and paid sick leave. That settlement covered 13,000 workers.</p><p>Under Niccol, the chain was also accused of violating child labour laws and paid out settlements across the country. In 2022, the company settled with the state of New Jersey for $7.75m after a state agency found more than 30,000 allegations of child labour violations. In Massachusetts, the company paid almost $2m to settle 13,000 allegations of child labour law violations.</p><p>Workers hope that amid the settlement this week, renewed pressure from lawmakers, and bigger turnout of picketers will be enough to move contract negotiations forward.</p><p>“I think this company recognises that there are some serious systemic issues within it. I think they do recognise that the people with the solutions are the ones in the cafes every single day and we are just waiting for them to pick that conversation up so we can finalise that contract,” Eisen said.</p><p>And the company spokesperson suggested it is as well amid a jab at strikers on the picket line.</p><p>“We’ve been very clear that we’re ready to talk when the union is ready to return to negotiations. Instead, they are focused on staging and promoting a protest in New York City, where they represent only 200 of the 4,500 partners in NYC,”  Anderson said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Their country is no good for a reason …”</p><p data-start=\"502\" data-end=\"1049\">This is what United States President Donald Trump had to say about Somali migrants on the first day of an immigration crackdown targeting their community. He insisted that Somali migrants have turned the US state of Minnesota, where some 2 percent of the population is of Somali descent, into a “hellhole” and should be “out of here”. Then, directing his ire at his vocal critic, Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic representative from Minnesota, Trump said, “She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people who work. These aren’t people who say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great. ’”</p><p data-start=\"1051\" data-end=\"1585\">Of course, none of this is new or surprising. Hatred of migrants and asylum seekers has always been the glue that holds Trump’s MAGAverse together. Who can forget that, before his cordial meeting with Trump at the White House, several MAGA Republicans made serious efforts to revoke the US citizenship of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Since Trump’s rise to power, hostility to migrants has become not just a mainstream component of contemporary politics in the United States but a governing principle.</p><p data-start=\"1587\" data-end=\"1901\">But the rise in anti-migrant sentiment, and its validation and promotion by those in positions of power, is not exclusive to Trump’s increasingly insular America. Similar rhetoric and tactics are gaining ground elsewhere, revealing a global trend that extends far beyond the United States. Denmark is one such example.</p><p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2459\">Beneath its long-cultivated image as a progressive, humane and orderly society built on universal healthcare, Lego, highly liveable cities and minimalist designer aesthetics, Denmark has in recent years become one of Europe’s most restrictive states on immigration and asylum. During the recently concluded local elections, Islamophobic rhetoric was on full display, and in the lead-up to the 2026 national elections, the ruling Social Democrats have placed their commitment to tackling the so-called problem of immigration at the centre of their campaign.</p><p data-start=\"2461\" data-end=\"3251\">Across the pond, in the United Kingdom, the supposedly progressive Labour government seems eager to follow the Danish example. Under pressure from the far right and Reform UK’s enduring rise in the polls, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is eager to convince people that he can be trusted to take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter of Britain’s immigration policy. He has warned that the UK risks becoming an island of strangers unless immigration is sharply reduced, and has promised that his government’s reforms will ensure that migration will fall. That is a promise. Most strikingly, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration and asylum regime, a gesture that underscores how dramatically Labour’s stance has hardened.</p><p data-start=\"3253\" data-end=\"3450\">Xenophobia is also on the rise outside the Western world. It is a staple of policy and practice from Libya to South Africa, a reminder that anti-migrant politics is now a global tool of governance.</p><p data-start=\"3452\" data-end=\"4213\">Europe-bound migrants in Libya face horrific levels of violence and abuse. According to Amnesty International, they are subjected to prolonged arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, rape, unlawful killings, extortion and forced labour. These abuses occur within a system effectively underwritten by European governments, which have funnelled funding, training and equipment to Libyan coastguard units tasked with intercepting migrants before they reach international waters. Keen to stem the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, European Union states have outsourced border control to Libya despite knowing the consequences, supporting the authorities’ ability to continue with measures the United Nations says could very likely amount to crimes against humanity.</p><p data-start=\"4215\" data-end=\"5002\">Further west, in Tunisia, Black African migrants have faced sporadic violence for years. In early 2023, President Kais Saied claimed there was a criminal plan to change Tunisia’s demographic makeup through irregular migration, turning it into a purely African country that has no affiliation to the Arab and Islamic nations. His remarks triggered a surge in mob attacks on Black migrants, students and asylum seekers. There was also an increase in arrests, and the police appeared to be targeting Black African foreigners based on their appearance. Those detained included undocumented migrants, registered refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with valid credentials, a stark demonstration of how state practices can shift once xenophobia is given political sanction.</p><p data-start=\"5004\" data-end=\"5625\">Similarly, xenophobia targeting migrants from other African countries has been a constant feature of life and politics in post-apartheid South Africa. According to Xenowatch, a project hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand that tracks xenophobic discrimination and violence, there have been 1,295 recorded incidents since 1994, including displacement, looting of migrant-owned businesses and killings. Deaths peaked in 2008 with 72 fatalities and 150 incidents. In 2025, while 16 people were killed, the overall number of xenophobic incidents again reached 2008 levels, underscoring the persistence of the crisis.</p><p data-start=\"5627\" data-end=\"6366\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government systematically overlooked migrant communities, excluding many from relief programmes and framing protection of South Africans as the priority. The state also constructed a 40-kilometre fence along the border with Zimbabwe to block infected or undocumented persons, despite Zimbabwe having only 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time compared with South Africa’s 1,845. Politicians reinforced existing myths about foreign-owned businesses posing health risks. When announcing that spaza shops could remain open, the then-Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, declared that only South African-owned, managed and run shops would remain open.</p><p data-start=\"6368\" data-end=\"6776\">South Africa has also seen the rise of explicitly anti-immigrant mobilisation. The Put South Africans First movement, a coalition of civil society groups advocating the mass deportation of African migrants, organised a march to the Nigerian and Zimbabwean embassies on September 23, 2020, claiming that foreigners contribute to South Africa’s social ills such as drugs, human trafficking and child abductions.</p><p data-start=\"6778\" data-end=\"7229\">The vigilante group Operation Dudula emerged from this movement in 2021, following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma. Although it claims to address crime and drug use in Gauteng communities, its name, Dudula – meaning “force out” in isiZulu – captures its true focus. The group is better known for calling for mass deportations, blocking migrants from accessing hospitals and clinics, and raiding or shutting down foreign-owned businesses.</p><p data-start=\"7231\" data-end=\"7718\">Of course, I could keep going, from increasing restrictions in countries like Colombia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador aimed at stemming the influx of Venezuelan migrants, to Indian authorities forcibly expelling ethnic Bengali Muslims to Bangladesh without due process, domestic guarantees and international human rights standards, claiming that they are undocumented. Xenophobia is not confined to any region or ideology; it is now woven into the political life of countries across the globe.</p><p data-start=\"7720\" data-end=\"8130\">Why are we so keen to give in to xenophobic narratives and policies? In part because they are convenient. They allow governments and societies to externalise domestic failures, offering an easy explanation for problems that are far more complex and often rooted in political and economic mismanagement at home, in austerity, deepening inequality and precarious work rather than in the arrival of strangers.</p><p data-start=\"8132\" data-end=\"8504\">In this logic, the migrant becomes a ready-made scapegoat, a figure onto whom we project all the ills we believe threaten who we are or what we stand for. It then becomes effortless to claim that migrants subscribe to dangerous ideologies, strain national resources, carry diseases or form part of some insidious plan to alter the country’s demographic or cultural fabric.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\">Perception becomes reality. Blaming those beyond our borders allows us to imagine the threat lies elsewhere, reassuring us that we are not the problem. The tragedy is that the dysfunctions and corruptions embedded in our own systems remain untouched. And scapegoating the supposed outsider does nothing to make our societies fairer, safer or more humane; it merely buys time for leaders unwilling to confront the crises they helped create.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

We can no longer trust federal health authorities when it comes to vaccines,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told the news agency Reuters.</p><p>“In voting to eliminate the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, ACIP ignored decades of evidence confirming its strong safety profile and effectiveness. Its decision will result in more hepatitis B infections and more people with chronic liver disease.”</p><p>He added that, if ACIP continues to ignore the evidence about vaccine efficacy and safety, “parents and clinicians must ignore ACIP”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hepatitis-b\">What is hepatitis B?</h2><p>Each year, around the world, 1.2 million people become newly infected with hepatitis B. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.1 million deaths in 2022 were also linked to the virus.</p><p>Hepatitis B is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and children could potentially acquire the virus through activities as simple as sharing a toothbrush.</p><p>Infections are known to shorten life spans and can potentially lead to fatal conditions like cirrhosis — a kind of tissue scarring that causes liver failure — and liver cancer.</p><p>For most people, the hepatitis B vaccine confers lifelong protection against the virus.</p><p>The first shot in the three-dose regimen is usually given shortly after birth. For a healthy baby, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had previously advised that doctors administer the first dose within 24 hours of birth.</p><p>For a child born to a parent who tests positive for hepatitis B, the first vaccination should be even sooner, 12 hours after birth.</p><p>For children born premature and underweight, the advice was formerly to wait a month before administering the first dose.</p><p>The third and final dose typically comes before the infant reaches 18 months old.</p><p>Prior to Friday’s announcement, health experts in the US government had also recommended vaccination for all infants. Those guidelines had been in place for decades, stretching back to 1991, and the vaccine itself has been available since the 1980s.</p><h2 id=\"changing-health-guidelines\">Changing health guidelines</h2><p>But Kennedy has pushed to review vaccination guidelines since taking office as part of President Donald Trump’s second-term cabinet.</p><p>The son of former Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, the younger Kennedy is an environmental lawyer and former presidential candidate who gained notoriety as a vaccine sceptic.</p><p>While he has repeatedly claimed he is not “anti-vaccine”, he has been accused of spreading vaccine conspiracy theories.</p><p>In 2021, for instance, he told an audience of Louisiana politicians that the COVID-19 shot was the “deadliest vaccine ever made”. In 2005, he also published an article linking vaccines to autism and other neurological disorders, promoting a widely discredited theory. That article was later retracted by its publishers.</p><p>In February, Kennedy was confirmed as Trump’s health and human services secretary, despite having no professional medical experience. The position oversees a range of health and welfare agencies, including Medicaid, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Under his leadership, the US government swiftly changed its approach to certain vaccines.</p><p>In August, for example, the FDA limited its guidance for who should take the COVID-19 vaccine. Only people aged 65 and up, or people with health conditions, were recommended for the vaccine.</p><p>Critics warned that change could limit the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine and force younger people to get a prescription and pay out of pocket for the preventive care.</p><p>Last month, the CDC under his leadership also removed assurances that vaccines do not cause autism from its website.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has pulled government funding from research into mRNA vaccines — the technology used for the COVID-19 vaccination — and changed the standards for vaccine development.</p><h2 id=\"shakeup-at-acip\">Shake-up at ACIP</h2><p>One of the most prominent changes Kennedy has made, however, has been at the ACIP, a panel focused on vaccines that has been in existence since 1964.</p><p>In June, Kennedy fired the 17-member committee and replaced them with figures that critics say are largely sceptical of vaccination or have little research background in the area.</p><p>Kennedy defended the mass firing as necessary to maintain the independence of the panel and defend “unbiased science”.</p><p>“Today we are prioritizing the restoration of public trust above any specific pro- or anti-vaccine agenda,” he said in a statement.</p><p>But public health experts expressed outrage that trusted officials were fired and replaced with those who seemed to reflect Kennedy’s own beliefs.</p><p>Despite the shake-up on the panel, its membership was nevertheless split over the issue of changing the recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>A vote on the issue had been delayed twice since September. During Friday’s vote, one ACIP member, paediatrics professor Cody Meissner, cited the medical duty to “do no harm”.</p><p>“We are doing harm by changing this wording. And I vote no,” he said in his vote.</p><p>But the majority of the ACIP panel ultimately decided to back the change, citing the “flexibility” it offered to new parents. The CDC’s guidelines, however, were not previously binding.</p><p>Industry groups responded with grave concerns about the ambiguity the change would create.</p><p>“The science is clear: the hepatitis B birth dose saves lives, and there is no new evidence to justify delaying or removing this critical protection,” the American Pharmacists Association said in a statement.</p><p>A former CDC director, Thomas Frieden, called on the public to stand against the change.</p><p>“Now obstetricians, pediatricians, insurers, state health departments and others should stand up for fact-based care, protect our children, and not mess with success — not accept this misguided and dangerous recommendation,” he wrote.</p><p>The ACIP decision is now set to go before the director of the CDC, Jim O’Neill, for final approval.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It reflected Trump’s disdain for multilateralism and international organisations, saying that the “world’s fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state”.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from the document.</p><h2 id=\"hemispheric-dominance\">Hemispheric dominance</h2><p>The US is seeking to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” by reinforcing the <a href=\"/news/2019/6/19/trump-revives-monroe-doctrine-as-warning-to-china-and-russia\">Monroe Doctrine</a> – a 19th-century US policy in opposition to European colonisation and interference in the Americas.</p><p>Other than deterring foreign influence in the hemisphere, it will push to combat the drug trade and irregular migration while encouraging “private economies”.</p><p>“We will reward and encourage the region’s governments, political parties, and movements broadly aligned with our principles and strategy,” the document reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has already put this approach into action by publicly backing conservative politicians in Latin America and bailing out the Argentinian economy under right-wing President <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/us-buys-argentinian-pesos-finalises-20bn-currency-swap-says-us-treasury\">Javier Melei</a> with $40bn.</p><p>“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere,” the document says.</p><p>“This ‘Trump Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine is a common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities, consistent with American security interests.”</p><p>The NSS also calls for shifting US military assets to the Western Hemisphere, “away from theatres whose relative import to American national security has declined in recent decades”.</p><p>The strategy comes as the US ramps up its deadly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/us-military-kills-four-in-latest-strike-on-boat-in-the-caribbean\">attacks on boats</a> in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean that it says are carrying drugs.</p><p>The Trump administration has also ordered a military buildup around Venezuela, raising speculations that Washington may be looking to topple left-wing President <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/maduro-rejects-a-slaves-peace-for-venezuela-as-us-ramps-up-pressure\">Nicolas Maduro</a> by force.</p><h2 id=\"deterring-conflict-over-taiwan\">Deterring conflict over Taiwan</h2><p>The last two National Security Strategies, including the one released during Trump’s first term in the White House, described the <a href=\"/news/2022/5/26/blinken-lays-out-us-strategy-to-counter-china-as-rivalry-grows\">competition with China</a> as the top priority for the US.</p><p>But the rivalry with Beijing was not put front and centre in this NNS.</p><p>Still, the document highlighted the need to win the economic competition in Asia and to rebalance trade with China. To that end, it stressed the need to work with Asian allies to provide a counterweight to Beijing, singling out India.</p><p>“We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security,” it said.</p><p>The document spelt out the risks of China seizing Taiwan by force, noting that the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own, is a major producer of computer chips.</p><p>It also underscored that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">capturing Taiwan</a> would give China access to the Second Island Chain in the Asia Pacific and bolster its position in the South China Sea, a vital artery for global trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Hence deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority,” the NNS says.</p><p>The strategy called on US partners in the area to increase their military spending to deter conflict.</p><p>“We will build a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in the First Island Chain,” it said.</p><p>“But the American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone. Our allies must step up and spend—and more importantly do—much more for collective defence.”</p><h2 id=\"berating-europe\">Berating Europe</h2><p>Although Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/9/tufts-university-student-rumeysa-ozturk-ordered-released-from-ice-detention\">cracked down on speech</a> critical of Israel in the US and ordered the Department of Justice to target his political rivals, the NNS scorned Europe over what it called “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition”.</p><p>The strategy proclaimed that Europe is facing the “prospect of civilizational erasure” due to migration policies and “failed focus on regulatory suffocation”.</p><p>It also hit out at European officials’ “unrealistic expectations” for the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying that the US has a “core interest” in ending the conflict.</p><p>A US proposal to end the war, which would allow Russia to hold on to large territories in eastern Ukraine, garnered <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">rare criticism</a> from some European leaders last month.</p><p>The NNS blamed, without providing examples, the “subversion of democratic processes” for what it described as some European governments’ unresponsiveness to their people’s desire for peace.</p><p>The document also suggested that the US may withdraw the security umbrella it has long held over the old continent.</p><p>Instead, Washington would prioritise “enabling Europe to stand on its own feet and operate as a group of aligned sovereign nations, including by taking primary responsibility for its own defence, without being dominated by any adversarial power”, the NNS reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"switching-focus-from-the-middle-east\">Switching focus from the Middle East</h2><p>The NSS stresses that the Middle East is no longer the top strategic priority for the US.</p><p>It says that past considerations that made the region so important – namely, energy production and widespread conflict – “no longer hold”.</p><p>With the US ramping up its own energy production, “America’s historic reason for focusing on the Middle East will recede,” the strategy says.</p><p>It goes on to argue that the conflict and violence in the region are also subsiding, citing the ceasefire in Gaza and the US attack on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/trump-says-he-was-very-much-in-charge-of-israels-june-13-attack-on-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iran in June</a>, which it said “significantly degraded” Tehran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>“Conflict remains the Middle East’s most troublesome dynamic, but there is today less to this problem than headlines might lead one to believe,” it reads.</p><p>The US administration envisioned a rosy future for the region, saying that instead of dominating Washington’s interests, the Middle East  “will increasingly become a source and destination of international investment”, including in artificial intelligence.</p><p>It describes the region as an “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship, and investment”.</p><p>But in reality, the Middle East continues to be beset by crises and violence. Despite the truce in Gaza, near-daily Israeli attacks have continued as deadly <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/family-of-american-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settlers-demands-us-probe\">raids by settlers</a> and soldiers against Palestinians escalate in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Israel has also been stepping up its air strikes in Lebanon, augmenting fears of another all-out assault against the country to disarm a weakened Hezbollah by force.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Syria, a year into the fall of the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, Israel has pushed on with incursions <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/israel-attacks-on-syria-what-happened-who-did-israel-claim-it-was-after\">and strikes</a> in an effort to militarily dominate the south of the country beyond the occupied Golan Heights.</p><p>And with its uncompromising commitment to Israel’s security, the US remains deeply entrenched in the region with continuing military presence in Syria, Iraq and the Gulf area.</p><p>The NSS acknowledges that the US continues to have key interests in the Middle East, including ensuring “that Israel remains secure” and protecting energy supplies and shipping lanes.</p><p>“But the days in which the Middle East dominated American foreign policy in both long-term planning and day-to-day execution are thankfully over – not because the Middle East no longer matters, but because it is no longer the constant irritant, and potential source of imminent catastrophe, that it once was,” it says.</p><h2 id=\"flexible-realism\">‘Flexible realism’</h2><p>The US will pursue its own interests in dealing with other countries, the document says, suggesting that Washington will not push for the spread of democracy and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/2/restricted-nearly-7-billion-people-worldwide-lack-full-civil-rights\">human rights</a>.</p><p>“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories,” it said.</p><p>“We recognise and affirm that there is nothing inconsistent or hypocritical in acting according to such a realistic assessment or in maintaining good relations with countries whose governing systems and societies differ from ours even as we push like-minded friends to uphold our shared norms, furthering our interests as we do so.”</p><p>However, the strategy suggests the US will still press some countries – namely Western partners – over what it sees as important values.</p><p>“We will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies,” it said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The streaming giant offered $28 per share, while Paramount offered $30 per share, according to CNBC, which cited sources familiar with the matter.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Under the Netflix deal, each Warner Bros Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and about $4.50 in Netflix stock per share, valuing Warner at $27.75 a share, or about $72bn in equity and $82.7bn with debt.</p><p>Netflix has offered Warner Bros Discovery a $5.8bn breakup fee, while Warner Bros Discovery would pay Netflix $2.8bn if the deal collapses.</p><p>Netflix said it expects to generate at least $2bn to $3bn in annual cost savings by the third year, after the deal closes. Warner CEO David Zazlav will also step down following the completion of the merger.</p><p>The deal would give Netflix ownership of iconic franchises such as “Game of Thrones”, “DC Comics” and “Harry Potter”. It is also expected to raise antitrust concerns in Europe and the United States that the purchase would greatly increase the buying power of Netflix, which is already a dominant force in Hollywood.</p><p>Netflix has said that the deal would create more jobs and opportunities for talent. Representatives for the company were unable to provide details to Al Jazeera on how that would happen.</p><p>“If I was tasked with doing so, I could not think of a more effective way to reduce competition in Hollywood than selling WBD to Netflix,” Jason Kilar, the former CEO of Warner Media, <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonkilar/status/1996704106489205074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>“The potential Netflix/Warner Bros transaction is a consolidation that may serve the financial interests of shareholders of both companies, but which raises many serious questions about its impact on the future of the entertainment industry, and especially the human creative talent whose livelihoods and careers depend on it,” the Screen Actor’s Guild (SAG-AFTRA) said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Al Jazeera also reached out to the Writer’s Guild but the group did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>The merger, if approved, will add HBO Max’s 128 million subscribers to Netflix’s more than 300 million, creating a formidable player.</p><p>Cinema United, a global exhibition trade association, has said the deal poses an “unprecedented threat” to movie theatres worldwide.</p><p>“In light of the current regulatory environment, this will raise eyebrows and concerns. The combined dominant streaming player will be heavily scrutinised,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"scrutiny-from-washington\">Scrutiny from Washington</h2><p>Even before the bids were in, some members of Congress said a Netflix–Warner Bros Discovery deal could harm consumers and Hollywood. The White House also weighed in, with the administration viewing it with “heavy scepticism”, according to CNBC, which cited an unnamed senior administration official.</p><p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said the move will be an “anti-trust nightmare” and stressed that the merger would limit choice for consumers.</p><p>“A Netflix-Warner Bros would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.</p><p>US Representative Pramila Jayapal, who co-chairs the House Monopoly Busters Caucus, also called the deal a “nightmare”.</p><p>“It would mean more price hikes, ads, &amp; cookie cutter content, less creative control for artists, and lower pay for workers,” Jayapal said in a post on the social media site X. “The media industry is already controlled by a few corporations with too much power to censor free speech. The gov’t must step in,” she added.</p><p>Republicans, too, said the deal would reduce choice for consumers and give Netflix an unacceptably high share of the streaming industry.</p><p>The proposed merger is underscored by US President Donald Trump’s view of the news organisations that cover his administration. CBS News, which is owned by Paramount-Skydance, has close ties to the Trump administration.</p><p>Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison’s son, David Ellison, leads Paramount-Skydance. The elder Ellison is considered to be close to Trump. Paramount-Skydance has been accused of making choices that align with the White House’s wishes, including the cancellation of The Late Show with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger\">Stephen Colbert,</a> as host Stephen Colbert was critical of the president. The network has said that the decision was not political in nature.</p><p>In September, the network appointed Kenneth Weinstein as ombudsman and to review allegations of bias, even though Weinstein has no background in journalism, has been a Trump donor and had earlier headed a conservative think tank. In October, the network appointed conservative opinion writer Bari Weiss, who previously had no experience in television, to lead the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/conservative-writer-bari-weiss-named-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legacy broadcaster’s news division.</a></p><p>Warner Bros Discovery owns news network CNN, and there were concerns that, should Paramount own it, it could bring in leadership that is aligned with Trump and the Republican Party, as have been the concerns about CBS.</p><p>On Wall Street, Netflix is down 0.8 percent in midday trading while Warner Bros Discovery is up 3.5 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"
