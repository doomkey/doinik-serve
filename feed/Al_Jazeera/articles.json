But authorities in Myanmar rejected the report, saying its military offensive was a legitimate counterterrorism campaign in response to attacks by alleged Rohingya armed groups.</p><p>“The case is likely to ‍set critical precedents for how genocide is defined and how it can be proven, and how violations can be remedied,” Nicholas Koumjian, head of the UN’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"renewed-hope\">‘Renewed hope’</h2><p>In Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, Rohingya refugees said they hoped the genocide case would help bring justice.</p><p>“We want justice and peace,” said 37-year-old Janifa Begum, a mother of two. “Our women lost their dignity when the military junta launched the eviction. They burned villages, killed men, and women became victims of widespread violence.”</p><p>Others said they hoped the case would bring them real change, even though the ICJ has no way to enforce any judgement it might make.</p><p>“I hope the ICJ will bring some solace to the deep wounds we are still carrying,” said Mohammad Sayed Ullah, 33, a former teacher and now a member of the United Council of Rohingya, a refugee organisation.</p><p>“The perpetrators must be held accountable and punished,” he said. “The sooner and fairer the trial is, the better the outcome will be… then the repatriation process may begin.”</p><p>Wai Wai Nu, the head of Myanmar’s Women’s Peace Network, said the start of the trial “delivers renewed hope to Rohingya that our decades-long suffering may finally end”.</p><p>“Amid ongoing violations against the Rohingya, the world must stand firm in the pursuit of justice and a path toward ending impunity in Myanmar and restoring our rights.”</p><p>The hearings at the ICJ will mark the first time that Rohingya victims of the alleged atrocities will be heard by an international court, although those sessions will be closed to the public and the media for sensitivity and privacy reasons.</p><p>“If the ICJ finds Myanmar responsible under the Genocide Convention, it would mark a historic step in holding a state legally accountable for genocide,” said Legal Action Worldwide (LAW), a group that advocates for Rohingya rights.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"separate-icc-case\">Separate ICC case</h2><p>During the preliminary hearings in the ICJ case in 2019, Myanmar’s then-leader, <a href=\"/news/2019/12/11/aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-myanmar-against-genocide-allegations\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, rejected The Gambia’s accusations of genocide as “incomplete and misleading”. She was later toppled by the military in a coup in 2021.</p><p>The power grab plunged Myanmar into chaos, with the military’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.</p><p>While Myanmar’s military continues to deny the accusations of genocide, the opposition National Unity Government (NUG), established by elected lawmakers after the 2021 coup, said it has “accepted and welcomed” the jurisdiction of the ICJ, adding that it has “withdrawn all preliminary objections” previously submitted on the case.</p><p>In a statement ahead of the hearing, the NUG acknowledged the government’s failures, which it said “enabled grave atrocities” to take place against minority groups. It also acknowledged the name Rohingya, which the previous elected government, including Aung San Suu Kyi, had refused to do.</p><p>“We are committed to ensuring such crimes are never repeated,” the NUG said.</p><p>Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, is facing a separate arrest warrant before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his role in the persecution of the Rohingya.</p><p>The ICC prosecution said the general “bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh.”</p><p>Additionally, the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) has accused the military government of <a href=\"/news/2024/6/26/rohingya-genocide-intensifying-as-war-rages-in-myanmars-rakhine-brouk\">“intensifying genocide”</a> against the Rohingya since taking power in 2021.</p><p>Myanmar is currently holding <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/myanmars-military-holds-second-phase-of-elections-amid-civil-war\">phased elections</a> that have been criticised by the UN, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make a determination,” he told reporters on board Air Force One late on Sunday.</p><p>He said Iran’s leadership had called, seeking “to negotiate” after his threats of military action, and that a “meeting is being set up”.</p><p>But he added that “we may have to act before a meeting”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Tehran.</p><p>Iranian leaders earlier on Sunday issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/irans-pezeshkian-pledges-economic-overhaul-amid-spiralling-protests\">stark warning</a> against military intervention, with Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf saying: “In the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories [Israel] as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target.”</p><p>The protests in Iran began on December 28, when merchants at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar closed their shops over the Iranian rial’s plummeting value. The demonstrations quickly spread nationwide, with grievances evolving from concerns over soaring living costs to broader opposition against Iran’s clerical establishment, who have governed the country since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.</p><p>According to Iranian state media, at least <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/iran-says-dozens-of-officers-killed-as-protesters-defy-government-crackdown\">109 security personnel have been killed</a> in the unrest, but opposition activists based outside the country say the death toll is higher and includes hundreds of protesters.</p><p>A nationwide internet blackout has also persisted for more than 72 hours, according to monitoring groups.</p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday that his government was “ready to listen to” protesters, but urged the public to prevent “rioters” and “terrorist elements” from wreaking havoc.</p><p>He told the IRIB broadcaster that that Israel and the US, which waged a 12-day war against Iran in June of last year, were masterminding the unrest in the country, saying that “the same people that struck this country” were “trying to escalate these unrests with regard to the economic discussion”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/10/why-the-once-loyal-bazaar-merchants-are-now-protesting-in-iran\">unrest in Iran</a> is unfolding as Trump pursues an assertive foreign policy, having abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and discussing acquiring Greenland by purchase or force.</p><p>Trump was scheduled to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a ⁠US official told the Reuters news agency. The Wall Street Journal reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyberweapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.</p><p>Trump said on Sunday that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran.</p><p>“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response ⁠to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite ​internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.</p><p>The US leader also spoke on his plans for Venezuela and Greenland.</p><p>Trump confirmed he would be meeting with Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado on Tuesday or Wednesday. He said global oil companies will also be “safe” if they invest in Venezuela, repeating a pledge made last week during a White House meeting with oil executives.</p><p>“There are guarantees they’re going to be safe,” he said. “They had problems in the past because they didn’t have Trump as president. They had stupid people.”</p><p>On Greenland, Trump called for the Danish Arctic territory to “make a deal”, and said “we are talking about acquiring it, not making a short term deal”.</p><p>Trump repeated his previous – and unproven – claims that China and Russia had deployed “destroyers and submarines all over the place” in the waters around Greenland. The territory’s defence force, he said, was made up of “two dogsleds”.</p><p>Trump, who has previously said that <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/8/why-trump-says-getting-greenland-is-about-defence\">US annexation of Greenland</a> is necessary for Washington’s self-defence, said Russia and China will take Greenland if the US does not.</p><p>“I’m not letting that happen,” he told reporters. “I would love to make a deal with them. It’s easier, but one way or another <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/what-are-potential-hard-ways-trump-could-try-to-take-greenland\">we’re going to have Greenland</a>.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, analysts debate the extent to which such moves can have an impact on the ground in Iran.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-behind-the-protests\">What’s behind the protests?</h2><p>Protests in Iran began on December 28 amid soaring inflation in the country. They’ve since spread to more than 100 cities and towns, and are now reportedly taking place in every province in the country.</p><p>“The focus of the protests is on the core of the state and governance of the country because political, economic, social, cultural, or even environmental policies have not worked for [protesters],” Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, told Al Jazeera. “Economics, though, was the start of it.”</p><p>Many of the protesters are calling for an end to the rule of the country’s ayatollahs who, along with their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), took over after the 1979 revolution.</p><p>Khamenei, the current supreme leader, has led the country since 1989. And while his rule has survived a number of waves of unrest, including the mass “Women, Life, Freedom” protests of 2022, some analysts believe that the latest demonstrations are among the biggest challenges his regime has faced.</p><p>“The Trump administration’s decision to quit the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimpose sanctions – and its failure to reach a new deal with Iran last year – have crippled the economy and increased corruption, benefitting a small sanctions-busting elite,” said Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and a lecturer in international affairs at George Washington University.</p><p>“Add to that the severe blows inflicted on Iran’s regional allies since October 7, 2023, the Israeli and US strikes last summer, and it is hard to see a way out [for the regime].”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>The Iranian regime has enforced an internet blackout in the country since Thursday, though some videos have still managed to circulate online of masked protesters clashing with security forces in Iranian cities.</p><p>The semiofficial news agency Tasnim reported on Sunday that the number of security personnel killed has reached 109. Opposition activists say the death toll is higher and includes dozens of protesters.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the figures coming out of Iran.</p><p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene if the authorities kill more protesters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"enter-elon\">Enter Elon</h2><p>Musk, a longtime tech mogul heading US government-supported companies including Tesla and SpaceX, <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/why-has-elon-musk-quit-donald-trumps-administration\">left a role</a> with the Trump administration, where he led the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in late May.</p><p>Musk’s work with DOGE was widely criticised, though his purchase of social media platform X and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/24/this-guy-is-dangerous-british-pakistanis-fear-musk-is-stoking\">vocal support for racist policies</a> have also attracted widespread condemnation in recent years.</p><p>Today, Musk is more focused on his private businesses, though he still wades into politics from time to time, particularly to push right-wing conspiracy theories about “<a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/kill-the-boer-the-anti-apartheid-song-musk-ties-to-white-genocide\">white genocide”</a> and immigration.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>As for Iran, during the 2022 “Women, Life, Freedom” protests and again in 2025’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-Day War</a> – which killed more than 610 people in Iran and 28 in Israel – Musk provided internet access to people inside the country through his satellite service Starlink.</p><p>Iran has reportedly jammed Starlink signals during the latest protests.</p><p>“The state uses internet disruption and shutdown to prevent more mobilisation of protesters and communication between protest groups and also to prevent news of it spreading,” Mortazavi said.</p><p>“It still happens with a delay when the internet comes back on, but what it does is hamper mobilisation and slows down the process of the protests. That’s the first goal of a comms shutdown.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This is where Starlink can be particularly useful. But analysts say Musk responding to Khamenei’s post and changing the flag on X are not likely driven by ideology.</p><p>“I doubt he cares about Iran per se,” said Slavin. “But he wants to gin up more traffic for X, and this is one way to do it.”</p><h2 id=\"how-useful-are-musk-s-latest-interventions\">How useful are Musk’s latest interventions?</h2><p>The change of Iran’s flag on X came amid the internet blackout, so many protesters on the ground were likely unable to see it. Some Iranian officials, however, were briefly viewed by those outside the country with the pre-Islamic Republic flags in their account profiles.</p><p>“It’s a digital version of conquering a building and pulling down the old flag, and trying to put a new flag, that was essentially the symbolising they were going for,” historian Reza H Akbari, who is also an analyst on Iran at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The power of these types of moves are quite readily contested in mid- and long-term effects,” said Akbari. “But it could provide momentary excitement [for protesters on the ground if they can see it] though it’s very hard to gauge the amount of popular support.”</p><p>Slavin told Al Jazeera that “what is happening outside Iran is not that relevant” to what is taking place inside the country.</p><p>“The real struggle for freedom is among Iranians is still in Iran, not the diaspora or others interested in the topic,” she said.</p><p>“They can amplify developments within Iran and express support for human rights, but we cannot determine the outcome of the struggle.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-contentious-flag\">A ‘contentious’ flag</h2><p>Meanwhile, Akbari says the pre-1979 flag “has always been contentious, essentially as a symbol for opposition both inside the country and abroad”.</p><p>He added that while the flag may mean different things to different critics of the current Iranian government, it is often associated with “the opposition that identifies as monarchist or wants the return of the shah”, who was deposed in 1979.</p><p>During recent protests, the ousted shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, called on demonstrators to take to the streets and occupy Iranian cities.</p><p>Some protesters, including those outside Iran, have called for a return to rule by the shah, <a href=\"/features/2025/7/3/son-of-former-shah-loses-credibility-after-justifying-israels-war-on-iran\">despite his questionable popularity</a>. Akbari said that Pahlavi himself has offered to act as a transitional leader but is not looking to move permanently to Iran to rule the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Analysts agree that Pahlavi would not be the man to lead the country forward, should Iran’s Islamic Republic fall after 47 years in power.</p><p>“Today, there are many decent and capable people in Iran who could replace those in power. Unfortunately, most of them are in prison,” Slavin said.</p><p>“The son of the shah, meanwhile, lives comfortably in a mansion in Potomac [in the US state of Maryland]. It’s hard to see what he offers in the way of practical change.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,” Trump added.</p><p>Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal, but US officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks.</p><p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump also reposted a message on Truth Social suggesting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could become the president of communist-governed Cuba.</p><p>Trump shared the post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump’s threats in a post on X.</p><p>“Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what we do,” Diaz-Canel said.</p><p>“Cuba does not attack; it has been attacked by the US for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.”</p><p>Earlier, Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez insisted that “right and justice are on Cuba’s side”.</p><p>The US “behaves like an out-of-control criminal hegemon that threatens peace and security, not only in Cuba and this hemisphere, but throughout the entire world”, Rodriguez posted on X.</p><p>Rodriguez also said in a separate post on X that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it. He denied that Cuba had received financial or other “material” compensation in return for security services provided to any country.</p><p>Under a US trade embargo, Havana has since 2000 increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>As its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela’s supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider, with about 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship-tracking data and internal documents of Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA.</p><p>Venezuela’s shipments covered roughly 50 percent of Cuba’s oil deficit. Cuba also relies on imported crude and fuel provided by Mexico in smaller volumes.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her country had not increased supply volumes, but, given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an “important supplier” of crude to Cuba.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti, reporting from Cucuta in Colombia, said that, despite its defiant rhetoric, Cuba may struggle to find alternative sources of fuel.</p><p>“The country is also going through one of the worst economic crises in recent years, probably the worst since the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union. Life has become very hard for regular Cubans on an everyday basis, with rolling blackouts, shortages. Agricultural output has been failing. Tourism is down also,” Rampietti said.</p><p>He added that the US cutting off the supply of Venezuelan oil could worsen an already “difficult situation” in Cuba.</p><p>“We also heard this week that at least two of the warships of the US Navy have moved from the Caribbean to the Atlantic, closer to Cuba. So, a lot of pressure on the country. We’re going to have to see if they will be able to withstand even this latest US threat,” Rampietti said.</p><p>In Cuba, some residents expressed defiance, while others said the country will be affected by the loss of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Maria Elena Sabina said the government of Diaz-Canel needed to make a decision quickly, “because it is the people who are suffering”.</p><p>“There’s no electricity here, there’s no power here, there’s no gas here, no liquefied gas,” she said. “So yes, change is needed, change is needed, but quickly, hopefully tomorrow.”</p><p>Another Havana resident, Luis Alberto Jimenez, said he was not afraid of Trump’s warnings.</p><p>“At no point, at no point does that scare me, because I’m prepared. The Cuban people are prepared for anything, any situation that may arise, for everything. We are prepared for that,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Eli Bremer, a Republican strategist, told Al Jazeera that Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have made it clear they want change in Cuba.</p><p>“Cuba is sort of a thorn in the side of the United States. It’s about 90 miles [145km] off the coast of Florida. It has constantly allied itself with the US’s enemies, [like] it’s the Soviet Union, and they have tighter relationships with China and with Venezuela,” Bremer said.</p><p>“So I think, at a minimum, he expects them not to be partnered up with the US enemies. But despite the fact that Trump said that he will not pursue regime change, I think it is abundantly clear that he would like to see a free Cuba that could become a trading partner and ally of the United States,” he added.</p><p>In Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said that despite Trump’s threats to Cuba, Americans generally want the US president to focus on the domestic economy.</p><p>“There is an affordability crisis in this country: groceries are expensive, housing is expensive, health insurance has gone up,” she said, reporting from Washington, DC.</p><p>“This is a president who has said he will focus on America First. We have now seen him bomb seven countries… so within [Trump’s] base, they are starting to see cracks, because this is not what he promised on his campaign trail,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A third prisoner, Lewie Chiaramello, is also refusing food on alternating days due to type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Five of the eight people who took part in the protest have ended their hunger strikes due to health concerns.</p><p>They are held in different jails over their alleged involvement in break-ins at the United Kingdom subsidiary of Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Bristol, where equipment was damaged, and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were sprayed with red paint.</p><p>They deny all charges.</p><p>The group is demanding:</p><ul>\n<li>Bail and the right to a fair trial, and the reversal of the UK government’s July designation of Palestine Action as a “terrorist organisation”, placing it alongside ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda.</li>\n<li>Closure in the UK of all Elbit sites, which are facilities operated by Israel’s largest defence company, manufacturing military technology used by the Israeli armed forces and other governments.</li>\n<li>An end to what they describe as censorship inside prison, including the withholding of mail, phone calls and books.</li>\n</ul><p>All eight will have spent more than a year in custody without trials, exceeding the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-prolonged-hunger-do-to-the-body\">What does prolonged hunger do to the body?</h2><p>In the early stages of starvation, after several days without food, the body begins breaking down muscle to produce energy.</p><p>As the fast continues, metabolism slows down. The body loses its ability to regulate temperature, kidney function deteriorates, and the immune system weakens, reducing the body’s ability to heal from injury.</p><p>Once the body’s reserves are depleted, it can no longer prioritise nutrients for vital organs. The heart and lungs become less efficient, muscles shrink and profound weakness sets in.</p><p>Eventually, as protein stores are depleted, and the body begins to break down its own tissues. At this stage, death may be imminent.</p><p>Scientific research on prolonged starvation is limited due to ethical reasons; however, estimates suggest that a healthy, well-nourished adult could survive without food for between 45 and 61 days, which means the three activists have now reached, or exceeded, that threshold, placing them in extreme, life-threatening danger.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3203875\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Interactive_Gaza_foodprices_2-03-1727339442.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Gaza_What starvation does to the body\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"international-concern\">International concern</h2><p>Hunger strikes have long been used as an extreme, non-violent form of protest, relying on moral pressure to compel those in power to act. Historical records trace the practice to ancient India and Ireland, where people would fast at the doorstep of someone who had wronged them as a form of public shaming.</p><p>In modern times, hunger strikes remain powerful political statements, often drawing international attention to cases of imprisonment, injustice or repression, even at the cost of the striker’s life. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners incarcerated without any charges by Israel have resorted to hunger strikes to bring attention to their cases.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/12/un-experts-urge-uk-protect-lives-and-rights-pro-palestinian-detainees-hunger\">United Nations experts</a> said hunger strikes are “often a measure of last resort by people who believe their rights to protest and effective remedy have been exhausted”. They added that the state’s duty of care towards hunger strikers is heightened, not diminished, and that authorities must ensure timely access to emergency and hospital care, refrain from pressure or retaliation, and respect medical ethics.</p><p>Kerry Moscogiuri, director of campaigns and communications at <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-palestine-action-hunger-strikers-dire-situation-shameful-moment-uk-government\">Amnesty International UK</a>, called the situation alarming.

Iran’s Ministry of Interior claimed the unrest is subsiding as the attorney general warned participants they could face capital punishment.</p><p>A nationwide internet blackout has persisted for more than 72 hours, according to monitoring groups.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday he was “shocked” by reports of violence against protesters in Iran and called on the government to show restraint.</p><p>“The rights to freedom of expression, association &amp; peaceful assembly must be fully respected &amp; protected,” he said on X.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said Iranian officials had spent the past week trying to draw a distinction between protesters and what they described as foreign-trained rioters.</p><p>Asadi added that senior officials had acknowledged public anger as justified, citing “soaring prices, high inflation and the drastic devaluation of the local currency that right now puts a huge amount of pressure on the pockets of local people”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-tensions\">US tensions</h2><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/10/why-the-once-loyal-bazaar-merchants-are-now-protesting-in-iran\">unrest in Iran</a> is unfolding as US President Donald Trump pursues an assertive foreign policy, having abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and discussing acquiring Greenland by purchase or force.</p><p>Trump, who has pledged to “hit Iran where it hurts” if protesters are killed, was scheduled to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a ⁠US official told the Reuters news agency. The Wall Street Journal reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyberweapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to antigovernment sources.</p><p>Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf issued a stark warning.</p><p>“In the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories [Israel] as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” Ghalibaf told lawmakers, some of whom chanted anti-US slogans.</p><p>Iranian authorities also called for nationwide rallies on Monday to condemn “terrorist actions led by the United States and Israel”, according to state media. Pezeshkian urged participation in what state television characterised as a “national resistance march” against violence attributed to “urban terrorist criminals”.</p><p>Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University, said Iran’s leadership genuinely believes “it is deeply penetrated” by foreign-backed elements” that are able to operate in the country at will.</p><p>“Iranian leadership deep down thinks that the protests are part of America and Israel’s efforts to bring regime change in Iran,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is happening in a context of war with Israel and the United States… The Iranian leadership is highly suspicious that the protests are being used by its adversaries to weaken or maybe topple the Islamic Republic. So this is not just a rhetoric that they’re giving to delegitimise the protesters.”</p><p>He added that Iran has no viable path to address the economic or security grievances.</p><p>“I don’t think Iran is going to be free of protests going forward. Blood has been shed. People are very angry. And the Islamic Republic really has no way in which it could either improve the economic situation or their security issues or address their other grievances,” he said. “The key issue is whether the protesters can be in the streets in large enough numbers that can overwhelm the security forces. I don’t know the answer to that, because we’re still early in these protests, and also because it’s very difficult to get credible information out of Iran.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-protests\">Solidarity protests</h2><p>Some US lawmakers meanwhile questioned the wisdom of taking military action against Iran.</p><p>“I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said on ABC News’ This Week.

Appearing on Fox News Sunday, he warned that a strike against Iran could risk uniting Iranians against the US “in a way that the regime has not been able to”.</p><p><a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/11/iran-protests-live-tehran-says-it-will-hit-back-at-us-israel-if-attacked\">Demonstrations supporting Iranian protesters</a> took place in London, Los Angeles, Paris, Berlin, and Istanbul.</p><p>In the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Westwood, a rental truck drove into a crowd of a few hundred people who were holding a rally in support of ‍the Iranian protesters, the KNBC news outlet reported on Sunday. There was no immediate report of casualties.</p><p>Iran also summoned the United Kingdom’s ambassador on Sunday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran over “interventionist comments” attributed to the UK foreign minister, as well as a protester removing the Iranian flag from the London Embassy building and replacing it with a style of ‌flag used prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has imposed 50 percent tariff on Indian goods – the highest in the world. According to media reports, Trump has okayed a new bill that will hike the tariff to up to 500 percent. And last week, the US withdrew from the India-led International Solar Alliance (ISA).</p><p>For New Delhi, opting out of the drills is “about balancing ties with the US”, said Harsh Pant, a geopolitical analyst at the New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. “But these so-called wargames are also not the BRICS mandate.”</p><p>BRICS essentially is not a military alliance but an intergovernmental partnership of developing nations focused on economic cooperation and trade aimed at breaking an overreliance on the West.</p><p>Pant told Al Jazeera that for China, Russia, Iran and to some extent South Africa, the joint military exercise “helps [a narrative] about positioning themselves vis-a-vis the US at this juncture”.</p><p>“India would prefer not to be tagged in the BRICS wargames,” Pant said, adding that New Delhi would also not be comfortable with the gradual evolution of BRICS’s foundational nature. “This is not really something that India can take forward, both pragmatically and normatively.”</p><p>On top of that, Pant argued, there are key differences between countries in BRICS Plus – like the UAE and Iran, or Egypt and Iran – for the bloc to become a formidable military alliance.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4230720\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4230720\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4230720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-09T141858Z_420133245_RC2NXIAOMHQ0_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-BRICS-NAVY-1768122606.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C507&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"simon's town south africa\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4230720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Russian vessel arrives at Naval Base Simon’s Town before the BRICS Plus naval exercises [Esa Alexander/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"when-did-south-africa-last-host-joint-drills\">When did South Africa last host joint drills?</h2><p>South Africa conducted Exercise Mosi, as it was previously called, twice with Russia and China.</p><p>The first Exercise Mosi, which means “smoke” in the Sesotho language, took place in November 2019. The second iteration, Exercise Mosi II, was held in February 2023, coinciding with the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>South Africa had faced heat from the West for hosting the joint drills then.</p><p>A third edition was scheduled for late 2025, but it overlapped with a Group of 20 summit that was held in South Africa in November. Washington did not send any delegates. The ongoing Will for Peace 2026, now rebranded, is the third edition of the drills.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake-for-south-africa\">What’s at stake for South Africa?</h2><p>The exercises in South African waters will likely further raise tensions with Washington.</p><p>Since Trump took office again, South Africa-US ties have deteriorated over a range of issues, and Trump has imposed 30 percent tariffs on South African goods.</p><p>A part of the fallout is also rooted in the South African government’s decision to bring a genocide case against Israel, a top US ally, before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It accuses the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a preliminary ruling, the world court found it plausible that Israeli actions amounted to genocide.</p><p>When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House in May, hoping to mend ties, Trump falsely claimed that white South African farmers were facing systematic killings.</p><p>Ramaphosa rejected the claims. None of South Africa’s political parties says there is a “white genocide” happening in the country as the Trump administration claims.</p><p>Hosting the wargames at a time of global geopolitical upheaval has its own risks, given that the US sees some of the participants as a military threat.</p><p>Ramaphosa’s government also faces criticism from one of its largest coalition partners, the liberal Democratic Alliance (DA). A DA spokesperson, Chris Hattingh, said in a statement that the bloc has no defensive role or shared military plans to warrant such exercises.</p><p>The party said BRICS had “rendered South Africa a pawn in the power games being waged by rogue states on the international stage”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
