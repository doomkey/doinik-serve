It took more than 24 hours to fully extinguish the blaze.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>City authorities said parts of the building have collapsed and debris and poor ventilation are severely hampering rescue efforts.</p><p>Mayor Murtaza Wahab said a formal inquiry would be launched into the fire under the supervision of the city’s commissioner.</p><p>Speaking to a private news channel on Monday night, Wahab confirmed that more than 60 people remained missing and the search operation is ongoing after the firefighting operation has been completed. “Fire flares up again during the cooling process,” he said, describing one of the challenges faced by emergency personnel.</p><p>Wahab also said the government of Sindh, the province where Karachi is located, has announced compensation of 10 million rupees ($35,000) for each family that has lost a loved one in the tragedy.</p><p>The Gul Plaza fire is the latest in a series of major incidents in Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial hub and home to nearly 25 million people.</p><p>Here, we look at what is known about what happened at Gul Plaza, why rescue efforts have been so difficult and what lies behind Karachi’s persistent fire safety challenges.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-at-gul-plaza\">What happened at Gul Plaza?</h2><p>Located in Karachi’s historic Saddar area along one of the city’s main arteries, MA Jinnah Road, Gul Plaza is a well-known business centre. Its shops sell jewellery, household items, carpets, bags, crockery and other goods.</p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the building was packed on Saturday night during the wedding season, a factor that contributed to the high death toll.</p><p>More than 72 hours after the fire broke out, officials have yet to confirm its cause. Police officials said on the night of the blaze that it may have been triggered by a short circuit.</p><p>Sindh Police Inspector General Javed Alam Odho said it appeared the fire was caused by a circuit breaker but stressed that “nothing definitive can be said about this at this time.”</p><p>Namra Khalid, a Karachi-based urban researcher, said a detailed investigation is needed before conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>“However, I think the main concern should be about what allowed the fire to become so big at such a rapid pace,” Khalid told Al Jazeera. “Fires can start anywhere, but what structural, systemic failures allowed it to spread at such scale, and why such failures are allowing repeated fires in the city at an unimaginable scale?”</p><h2 id=\"why-did-rescue-efforts-take-so-long\">Why did rescue efforts take so long?</h2><p>Rescue officials said the operation to recover those still missing is still being conducted because the size of the building and the extent of the damage mean they must proceed cautiously.</p><p>Officials told local media that much of the structure has collapsed and what remains may have to be demolished due to severe structural damage.</p><p>Hassan ul-Haseeb, a spokesperson for the provincial rescue service Rescue 1122, said access to the site was a major challenge on the night of the fire.</p><p>“On the one hand, the road was narrow, and on the other hand, a large number of people were there just to watch the spectacle, due to which the entire road was blocked and water tankers had difficulty finding their way there,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ul-Haseeb added that the materials inside the plaza, including large amounts of plastic, caused the fire to repeatedly flare up despite sustained efforts by firefighters, prolonging the operation.</p><p>He said people on the ground floor were able to escape using the building’s 13 entry and exit points. Many of those trapped on the upper floors, however, were unable to find their way out, leading to multiple deaths.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253761\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253761\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253761\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-19T161448Z_369040929_RC294JAHIQ46_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-FIRE-1768907294.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Emergency personnel survey the damaged portion of the building, following a massive fire that broke out in the Gul Plaza Shopping Mall in Karachi, Pakistan, January 19, 2026.

Officials at the time said the factory was crammed with combustible materials, including piles of clothes and chemicals.</p><p>Eight years later, a Pakistani court ruled that the <a href=\"/news/2020/9/22/pakistan-court-rules-2012-blaze-as-arson-sentences-two-to-death\">Baldia inferno</a> was a case of arson, not an accident. The court issued death sentences to two men who belonged to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a political party that was in power in the city at the time.</p><p>In recent years, fires have continued to break out across Karachi.</p><p>City planners and engineers estimated that about 70 percent of the city’s residential, commercial and industrial buildings lack adequate fire safety systems.</p><p>In both 2023 and 2024, Karachi recorded more than 2,500 fires.</p><p>In August, eight people were killed when a warehouse burned to the ground because of a short circuit. In June, another shopping mall was destroyed and hundreds of shops razed although no casualties were reported.</p><p>Muhammad Toheed, a Karachi-based urban planner and director of the research organisation Urban Lab, said the repeated incidents point to longstanding failures in governance.</p><p>“The government cannot make any excuses at all since the fire brigade and such related rescue work falls under its purview, and it is a clear and simple governance failure over a long period of time,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The building codes, safety mechanisms, routine inspections, ensuring presence of fire extinguishers and necessary training drills, all of these are practically nonexistent,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"chronic-failures\">‘Chronic failures’</h2><p>For a city of more than 20 million people, Karachi is served by just 35 fire stations, according to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, which oversees the fire brigade. According to Rescue 1122’s ul-Haseeb, Karachi has only 57 fire trucks and six ladder trucks.</p><p>Toheed, the urban researcher, said he had visited Gul Plaza frequently and noted that it was relatively better designed than many other buildings in the city with multiple entry and exit points.</p><p>“This was a building with fire extinguishers, reasonably sized stairs where people can move and lots of exit points, yet we have so many casualties. If we use Gul Plaza as a benchmark, then the rest of Karachi is a ticking time bomb,” he warned.</p><p>Khalid agreed, saying the city is weighed down by informal fixes and chronic failures.</p><p>“Lack of regulation, inspection and enforcement have created an environment where safety is optional and accountability is not there, and on top of it, we don’t have the emergency response mechanism,” she said.</p><p>Toheed said city authorities also need to urgently address the lack of capacity and training among rescue officials.</p><p>“We must start from scratch. It is important to find out what training our rescue officials have as this is a very specialised thing,” he said, referring to some ground reports from the rescue efforts at Gul Plaza suggesting shortcomings.</p><p>Khalid said he hoped the Gul Plaza fire would prompt change.</p><p>“We keep reading about such events, but then news fades out. But I really hope that this time people remember what happened and the administration is pushed into action to do something about it, to ensure we don’t have another Gul Plaza-like tragedy in future,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Former musician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, secured 25 percent.</p><p>Bobi Wine’s National Unity Platform (NUP) party and two other presidential candidates have rejected the results, alleging irregularities including ballot stuffing, intimidation, and the blocking of party agents from polling stations. The United Nations also says Thursday’s vote was marred by “widespread repression and intimidation”.</p><p>On the day the country’s Electoral Commission announced Museveni’s win, Bobi Wine appeared in a video on social media, telling supporters that he was forced into <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/ugandas-wine-says-escaped-raid-on-house-amid-disputed-presidential-vote\">hiding</a> after his home was raided by police and other unknown individuals.</p><p>“I know they are looking for me, but even if they succeed and get me, and do whatever, I want to say this to you fellow Ugandans,” he said on <a href=\"https://x.com/HEBobiwine/status/2012486868298846649\">video</a>, “We reject whatever is being declared by Mr Simon Byabakama [the chair of the Electoral Commission] because those so-called results that they are declaring are fake and they don’t in any way reflect what happened at the polling stations.”</p><p>The opposition and its supporters say the government has violently cracked down on dissent, shutting down the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uganda-cuts-internet-days-before-presidential-election\">internet</a> and arresting protesters.</p><p>Museveni has accused Bobi Wine’s party of trying to destabilise the country.</p><p>Ugandan authorities said the four-day internet shutdown was a security measure<strong> </strong>aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation that could cause fear and chaos.</p><p>The government also said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/incumbent-president-museveni-takes-strong-lead-in-uganda-election-count\">seven people</a> were killed in Butambala, with police stating that protesters attempted to attack a polling station and a police post. The NUP disputes this account, saying at least 10 people were killed when police fired at the home of a party official, a claim Al Jazeera could not independently verify.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Speaking with Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi in an exclusive interview while in hiding, Bobi Wine condemned the government’s “crackdown to intimidate, to silence, and to subdue the forces of change”.</p><p>He also alleged he had “evidence” of fraud, videos showing “not the police, not the military, but electoral commission officials” ticking ballot papers in favour of Museveni.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> How are you? How’s your family?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> I’m alive. I don’t know how my family is, but I try to keep in touch with my wife. She’s OK, she’s strong. [The security forces are] still at my home. Nobody’s allowed to access the house.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The police spokesman told us that you are not under arrest, that you are at home; obviously, you’re not. What do you say to them?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> I saw the police spokesperson saying I’m in my house. The same police person said that the people that were shot and killed in the house of my deputy president were actually attacking the police station. And yet they were inside the house. You know, so much goes on, and the shamelessness of the Ugandan regime now is bottomless. You know, they’ll do something glaringly – and they lie about it.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> You’re talking about the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/incumbent-president-museveni-takes-strong-lead-in-uganda-election-count\">incident in Butambala</a>? Tell us about what happened.</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> Ten people were killed in Butambala at the house of my deputy president. They were shot dead. The police shot through the door of a garage, a car storage room and killed 10 people. But scores were also killed in Iganga. Many people were killed in Kawempe and many other places.</p><p>So, one of the reasons why I could not stay home is that, as a leader, I had to keep in touch with these people; I had to give guidance. I had to be in touch and know what is happening. It was extremely dangerous for me. You’ve heard the head of the military, who is General Museveni’s son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, promising to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ugandas-military-head-says-he-wants-behead-opposition-leader-2025-01-06/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cut off my head</a>, and we had earlier information that they were coming to harm me. So, in that fracas when they raided my house, I used a few old skills to get my way out.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4234658\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234658\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4234658\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26012621846736-1768280170.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bobi Wine addresses supporters during a rally.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4234658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Uganda opposition presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known as Bobi Wine, addresses supporters during his final campaign rally at Aga Khan Grounds, in Kampala, Uganda, Monday, January 12, 2026. [File: Samson Otieno/AP]</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The president has called you a traitor and a “terrorist” – you and other officials of your party. What do you have to say to that?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> It should be known that in every dictatorship, especially here in Africa, to run against a dictator means being a terrorist, means being a traitor and everything. I mean, a priest, a Catholic priest called Father [Deusdedit] Ssekabira was arrested and General Museveni was talking about him, saying the Catholic priest was arrested and detained incommunicado for more than two weeks for working with me. But I was not arrested. Young people are in prison for their association with me and the party that I lead. But I, with the secretary-general and many others, are not detained. This is a crackdown to intimidate, to silence and to completely subdue the forces of change; everybody that yearns for change and everybody that does not support General Museveni.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> You have rejected the elections. You said that the election is rigged. What evidence do you have?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> We have evidence before, we have evidence during and after the election.</p><p>A day or two before the election, several of our polling agents were picked up by the military. Some of them are still missing.</p><p>And then you have seen videos. They turned off the internet. And this time, not the police, not the military, but electoral commission officials took part in ticking ballot papers in favour of General Museveni. We have record of them. We have videos of them doing that, and we’ve started uploading them on social media. (Al Jazeera was unable to verify videos on social media purporting to show officials filling in ballot papers. The Electoral Commission spokesperson declined to speak to Al Jazeera about this allegation.)</p><p>The Electoral Commission chairperson … announced results that nobody knows where they come from. They were supposed to pick them from the declaration of results forms and the district tally sheets. Our agents were there; they had different results on the forms. But the Electoral Commission chairperson was declaring something completely different. So, we rejected.</p><p>Like we said to the people before, that this was going to be a protest vote. We encouraged people for more than a hundred days that should the dictatorship try to subvert the voice of the people, the people of Uganda should rise up according to Article 29 of our constitution and reclaim their voice. That is what we encourage them to do.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And what does that mean? Protests?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> That means nonviolent, legally accepted protests. It means protesting, it means rejecting the abuse of democracy, fighting back against any subversion of our democracy. Our constitution, Article 29, provides that the people of Uganda can protest and demonstrate peacefully and unarmed. And that is exactly what we’ve encouraged them and continue to encourage them to do.</p><p>It could be protesting on the streets. Some of us started protesting by holding high the national flag. Others can protest by staying at home. We gave it back to the people of Uganda to find numerous creative ways of protesting … to fight back in the most moral, constitutional and legal way possible.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And going to the Supreme Court is not an option for you?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> The judicial system in Uganda is not independent at all. In the previous presidential election petitions, the Supreme Court has ordered for certain reforms – they’ve been completely ignored. So we don’t have hope in the judicial system of Uganda. That’s why we’ve always encouraged the people of Uganda to be the ones to take back their voice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The government and security forces accused you and your supporters throughout the election of flouting electoral rules, maybe campaigning where campaigns are not supposed to be happening, and that’s why you have been met with this kind of violence and tear gas and blocking rallies. What is your response?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> That’s what they are saying. But the law as it is in Uganda permits a candidate, most importantly a presidential candidate, to campaign everywhere where there are people. And indeed that campaign programme was confirmed and ratified by the Electoral Commission of Uganda. However, I was not allowed to even drive on the main roads. I was not allowed to campaign in cities or populated areas. I was always sent to the bushes, but people came there.</p><p>But also, the Electoral Commission was never in charge of this election; the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/protect-the-vote-bobi-wine-opposition-brace-for-tense-uganda-election\">military took charge</a> of this election. … I mean, if there was anything wrong that I did, if there’s anything that was against the law, I would have been apprehended a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> There are some Ugandans who subscribe to whatever you’re saying, but there’s a lot of fear in the country. And they’re saying, OK, the election is now done, so let’s just move on.</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> Moving on is resigning to slavery. We’ve said it many times that living under a military dictatorship for 40 years is like slavery. Ugandans don’t have a right, they don’t have a voice. Uganda is an extremely young country – the second youngest country in the world [by age], governed by a ruler who is over 80 years old.</p><p>Corruption is the order of the day. The country is in a mess. And we, as a current generation – that are the parents of today, that are going to be starting this country – it is our right and duty to ensure that we take charge of our own destiny.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And finally, you cannot go home?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> My reason for not being home is to be able to speak to the world. If I was in my house, you would not be able to access me.</p><p>I would love to be in my home. I’ve not changed my clothes in days. I want to be home. I want to be free. I want to take care of my people.</p><p>But the military and police have taken over my home. They’ve vandalised my gate. They’ve cut the padlocks. They’ve cut power at my house. So they’ve more or less colonised my home.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s no rule of law in Uganda. I cannot find redress with the courts. I cannot find redress with any institution of state. I just have to fight back in my own crude, non-violent way.</p><p><em>Note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused.”</p><p>Danish and Greenlandic leaders have repeatedly stated that the autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark is not for sale, and recent <a href=\"/gallery/2026/1/18/thousands-march-in-greenland-against-trumps-threats-to-take-it-over\">demonstrations</a> on the island have opposed Trump’s push to acquire it.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-the-us-want-to-buy-greenland\">Why does the US want to buy Greenland?</h2><p>The US interest is longstanding: after buying Alaska in 1867, Secretary of State William Seward unsuccessfully tried to buy Greenland. In 1946, President Harry Truman secretly offered Denmark $100m for Greenland, but Copenhagen refused, and the proposal became public only decades later.</p><p>During World War II, the US occupied the island and built military facilities, maintaining a presence today at Pituffik Space Base.</p><p>Greenland, a sparsely populated Arctic island of 56,000 people – mostly Indigenous Inuit – is geographically in North America but politically part of Denmark, making it part of Europe. Greenland withdrew from the European Community (EC/EU) in 1985 after it gained home rule, but maintains a special association with the EU as an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT), which grants limited internal market access and EU citizenship to Greenland’s residents through Denmark.</p><p>Its position between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans provides the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it crucial for US military operations and early-warning systems, especially around the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap, according to the Trump administration.</p><p>Greenland’s economy relies mainly on fishing, locals oppose large-scale mining, and there is no oil or gas extraction. However, it has large deposits of minerals, including rare-earth metals, which are necessary for the manufacture of technology, including smartphones and fighter planes. The island has therefore drawn increasing interest from leading powers as climate change opens up new shipping lanes in the Arctic.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-europe-responded-to-trump-s-tariff-threat\">How has Europe responded to Trump’s tariff threat?</h2><p>Many nations in Europe want to pursue diplomatic options with the US before retaliating with tariffs of their own, but have not ruled it out.</p><p>“Our priority is to engage, not escalate. Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint,” European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.</p><p>However, Gill warned that “the EU has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond should the threatened tariffs be imposed”.</p><p>The 27 members of the EU convened for an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss their response to Trump’s threat.</p><p>In a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/dangerous-downward-spiral-european-leaders-slam-trumps-tariff-threat\">joint statement</a> on the same day, the eight countries targeted by Trump with new tariffs said they “stand in full solidarity” with Denmark and the people of Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p><p>“Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,” Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK said in the statement.</p><p>“Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.”</p><p>During an address to the nation on Monday, Prime Minister <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/19/keir-starmer-says-trumps-tariffs-over-greenland-are-completely\">Keir Starmer</a> said the UK believes Greenland is part of Denmark and its future must be determined by Greenland and Denmark only.</p><p>“Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration,” Starmer said. However, he stated repeatedly during his address and questions from the media afterwards that, for now, he is not in favour of launching retaliatory tariffs against the US. “A tariff war is not in anyone’s interests.”</p><p>This week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also urged dialogue, warning that a tariff war would hurt both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>“We want to avoid any escalation in this dispute if at all possible,” Merz said. “We simply want to try to resolve this problem together.” He did not rule out using tariffs if absolutely necessary, however.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa wrote identical, but separate X posts, saying: “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.”</p><p>Some European leaders have been more bullish about how to respond to Trump’s threats, however, and called on the EU to activate a never-before-used economic tool designed to face down coercion from states outside the EU.</p><p>David van Weel, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, said during an interview on Dutch television on January 18: “It’s blackmail what he’s doing … and it’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance [NATO], and it also doesn’t help Greenland.”</p><p>“The Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), designed precisely for such cases, must now be used,” German MEP Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament’s trade committee, said in a post on X.</p><p>“I call on the European Commission to activate it immediately.”</p><p>During the emergency EU meeting on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron also requested that the bloc activate the ACI, also known as a “trade bazooka”, according to news reports.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-aci-or-trade-bazooka\">What is the ACI, or trade bazooka?</h2><p>The trade bazooka is a legal mechanism that the EU proposed late in 2021 and adopted in 2023 to protect European countries from economic pressure by non-EU countries.</p><p>By the end of his first term in January 2021, Trump had launched a trade war against several of Washington’s leading trading partners, including the EU, which faced US tariffs on steel and aluminium exports.</p><p>In December 2021, China blocked Lithuanian goods from entering Chinese ports after Lithuania was deleted from China’s electronic customs declarations system. This was in retaliation for Lithuania’s decision to allow Taiwan, which China considers its territory, to open a de facto embassy in Vilnius under the name “Taiwanese Representative Office”. China’s block also applied to exports from other EU member states when the goods contained Lithuanian components or were linked to Lithuania.</p><p>The bazooka idea was proposed in the EU on December 8, 2021, as China was blocking goods.</p><p>It was, therefore, adopted in 2023 with countries like China in mind, rather than allies like the US, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, told US media.</p><p>“The ACI restricts the access of US corporations to sell products in the European market. This is the European Union’s most powerful economic weapon,” Jo Michell, a professor of economics at the University of the West of England in Bristol, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It includes fees and charges on imports of goods and services, restrictions on US investment into the EU and a possible ban on public sector contracts for US companies.”</p><p>Essentially, the trade bazooka involves a series of measures, including steep retaliatory tariffs and increased customs duties. If applied to the US, the EU could limit or block access for US goods, services or companies to its single market.</p><p>It could also place restrictions on exports and imports through quotas or licences. Additionally, the EU could impose measures restricting the US’s use of EU‑based financial infrastructure, increasing funding costs for US banks and firms which depend on doing business in Europe.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-aci-be-implemented\">How would the ACI be implemented?</h2><p>A last‑resort deterrence measure, it has never been implemented before. There are several steps that must be taken before it can be deployed.</p><p>The process begins when a company, another party in the EU or the Commission itself files a complaint alleging economic coercion from a country outside the EU. The European Commission then launches a formal investigation into the allegation, which it is supposed to complete within four months.</p><p>If the commission finds that economic coercion is indeed taking place, it will first try to resolve the issue through diplomacy. If those efforts fail, the EU can move towards activating the ACI.</p><p>To do so, a “qualified majority” – at least 15 of the EU’s 27 countries representing at least 65 percent of the bloc’s population – must support the move. This gives countries with larger populations, such as Germany, France and Italy, significant influence.</p><p>Once a proposal to trigger the bazooka is on the table, member states have up to 10 weeks to say yes or no. In total, the entire process can take up to a year before the bazooka fully comes into effect.</p><p>“The EC may be able to move relatively quickly given the urgency of the situation, but the implementation vote may be months rather than weeks away,” Michell said.</p><h2 id=\"what-effect-could-the-aci-have-on-the-us-and-europe\">What effect could the ACI have on the US and Europe?</h2><p>The US runs a significant trade deficit with the EU in terms of goods. This means it imports more from the EU than it exports.</p><p>In 2024, the EU exported 531.6 billion euros ($603bn) in goods to the US and imported products worth 333 billion euros ($377.8bn), resulting in a trade surplus for the EU of almost 200 billion euros ($227bn).</p><p>The picture is different for services, however. The US had a surplus of more than 109 billion euros ($124bn) in services as of 2023, with notable IT exports, led by large US tech companies, intellectual property and financial services.</p><p>The bazooka could therefore hit the US where it hurts, allowing Europe to go beyond traditional tariffs on goods and restrict or tax US services instead.</p><p>“Imposing restrictions on the large US tech companies would be particularly painful for the US, and would likely hit share prices. The US is also exposed in areas such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace,” Michell said.</p><p>However, the bazooka would hurt workers and consumers in Europe as well. Restrictions on services would mean limited choices or higher prices for US services. Additionally, retaliatory tariffs on US goods as well would mean increased prices for those, too.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-europe-choose-to-do\">What will Europe choose to do?</h2><p>UK financial media reported this week that the bloc is considering imposing 93 billion euros ($108bn) in tariffs on US goods.</p><p>“Imposing 93 billion of tariffs is the first line of defence,” Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at New York-based investment banking and capital markets firm Jefferies, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Anti-coercion measures need a qualified majority [in the EU]. Germany has already said that it would prefer negotiations. Hence, my base case remains that the bazooka is unlikely to be used,” Kumar said.</p><p>“My base case remains that cooler heads will prevail. A solution where the US gets exclusive mineral rights and increased military presence in Greenland but its sovereignty remaining as is could be a way forward,” Kumar said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thirty-one were from the occupied West Bank, and three were citizens of Israel. The report noted that the numbers were likely to be higher because the organisation listed only the deaths it was able to verify.</p><p>B’Tselem Executive Director Yuli Novak said Israeli authorities had turned the prison system into a network of “torture camps” as part of “a coordinated onslaught on Palestinian society intended to destroy their existence as a collective”.</p><p>“The genocide in Gaza and the ethnic cleansing in the West Bank are the most blatant manifestations of this policy,” Novak said in a statement.</p><p>B’Tselem said its findings were based on the testimonies of 21 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in recent months and on the work of Israeli and international human rights organisations that monitor prisons. About 9,200 Palestinians are estimated to be held in Israeli prisons.</p><p>Several of the interviewees described undergoing or witnessing sexual violence in custody, including sexual assault, forced stripping, severe injuries to genitals through beatings, attacks involving dogs and penetration with various objects.</p><p>Other testimonies highlighted brutality during interrogations, particularly in a room referred to as the “disco room”, where electrical shocks were administered at regular intervals while the prisoner was deprived of food and access to a toilet.</p><p>The findings confirmed a pattern of abuse already highlighted in B’Tselem’s August 2024 <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/publications/202408_welcome_to_hell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report Welcome to Hell</a>. Novak said: “Despite mounting evidence and numerous reports on Israel’s torture camps, the international community continues to grant this regime full immunity – effectively legitimizing the continued torture, oppression and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and abandoning the victims.”</p><p>An overwhelming majority of Palestinian prisoners have been arrested under a quasi-judicial process known as administrative detention, under which Palestinians are initially jailed for six months. Their detentions can then be repeatedly extended for an indefinite period without charge or trial.</p><p>Most Palestinians, including children, are tried in military courts and handed lengthy sentences in what critics call sham military trials because in many cases Palestinians are deprived of defence lawyers and due process. In comparison, Israeli citizens are tried in civil courts, highlighting a two-tier justice system that discriminates against Palestinians.</p><p>Many bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel to Gaza after the October ceasefire have shown signs of torture and execution, and families have been forced to identify their missing loved ones through photographs of decomposed and mutilated remains.</p><p>B’Tselem spokesperson Yair Dvir told Al Jazeera that “the international community must use all the tools at its disposal in the framework of international law to stop Israel from continuing to commit these crimes.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"silencing-released-prisoners\">Silencing released prisoners</h2><p>B’Tselem’s collection of evidence was hampered by Israeli attempts to silence released prisoners through intimidation. “Israeli authorities threatened to re-arrest anyone who shared information about their experiences in prison,” the report said. “The threats were issued both before and after the prisoners were released.”</p><p>It added that such action illustrates “how Israel uses deprivation of liberty as a key means of oppressing Palestinians”.</p><p>Israeli authorities have repeatedly rejected abuse allegations, saying they act in accordance with international law, but these claims contradict evidence presented by the government’s own officials.</p><p>Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir in November bragged about the harsh treatment of Palestinian prisoners in a video filmed next to bound prisoners lying blindfolded on the floor.</p><p>A few days later, Ben-Gvir, who is in charge of the Israeli prison system, was seen carrying sweets in the Knesset chamber after Israel’s parliament advanced a <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/11/israels-parliament-advances-terrorists-death-penalty-bill\">bill</a> that would allow the death penalty for “terrorists” and is seen as targeting Palestinians.</p><p>Dvir, B’Tselem’s spokesperson, said that while Israel tries to deny the abuses, “Ben-Gvir continues to produce public relations pieces and videos from within these torture facilities, proudly showcasing the inhuman conditions and the abuse inflicted on Palestinian detainees.”</p><p>The report’s conclusion was unequivocal. “Israel is continuing its systemic, institutionalised policy of torture and abuse of Palestinian prisoners, approved and backed by the political system, the judicial system, the media and, of course, the prison authorities themselves,” it said.</p><p>“Far from being carried out in the shadows, this systematic abuse is put on public display, with no attempt to conceal or obscure it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/uk-court-temporarily-blocks-deal-to-hand-chagos-islands-to-mauritius\">bilateral deal</a> signed in 2025, the UK retains control of the airbase on a long-term lease.</p><p>Trump, who had previously appeared to back the UK’s attempt to right what is widely perceived as a colonial wrong under the rules-based international order, lashed out at the UK’s “act of total weakness”, which he said would have been noted by China and Russia.</p><p>“These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before,” the US president posted. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”</p><p>A UK government spokesperson said in a statement: “We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future.” The bilateral treaty has yet to be ratified by the UK Parliament.</p><p>Trump’s newly voiced opposition to the transfer of the archipelago will be applauded not only by right-wing opponents of the move in the UK but also by some <a href=\"/features/2025/2/11/tug-of-war-chagos-islands-deal-tearing-families-apart-in-mauritius\">Chagos islanders</a> and their descendants who oppose the transfer of their homeland to Mauritius.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-dark-chapter\">‘A dark chapter’</h2><p>Trump’s fusillade came before his visit to the World Economic Forum on Wednesday as Europe weighs countermeasures after he promised to impose <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/trump-announces-new-tariffs-over-greenland-how-have-eu-allies-responded\">additional tariffs</a> on eight European countries – Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland – in a bid to pressure them over Greenland.</p><p>Under growing pressure from the belligerent Trump, Denmark sent <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/denmark-sends-more-troops-to-greenland-amid-tensions-with-trump\">additional troops</a> to Greenland to bolster defences of the self-governed Danish territory, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen insisting on Tuesday that her country would not negotiate on “sovereignty, identity, borders and democracy”.</p><p>Frederiksen told the Danish Parliament that Trump’s threats to take over Greenland were a “dark chapter”, but vowed that Europe would stand its ground in the face of the US President’s threats to slap tariffs on European countries opposing his territorial ambitions.</p><p>“As Europe, if anyone starts a trade war against us, which I really cannot recommend, we must of course respond. We are compelled to do so,” she said.</p><p>Keeping up the push, Trump posted a screenshot of a message from Macron, who offered to set up a Group of Seven meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon to discuss disagreements over Greenland with the participation of Ukraine, Denmark, Syria and Russia on the sidelines.</p><p>“My friend, we are completely aligned on Syria. We can do great things in Iran. I don’t understand what you are doing in Greenland,” Macron said in his message, which was confirmed as authentic by a source close to Macron on Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Upping the ante, Trump threatened to hit French wine and champagne with 200 percent tariffs in an apparent bid to cajole a reluctant <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/macron-hits-back-at-netanyahu-over-claims-of-feulling-anti-semitism\">Macron</a> into joining his “board of peace” initiative, which is being rolled out in Gaza with a view to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/trumps-board-of-peace-appears-to-seek-wider-mandate-beyond-gaza\">expanding its remit</a> to other conflicts, raising questions over the future role of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"p1\">A source close to Macron said the French president intended to decline the invitation to join.</p><p>When asked about Macron’s stance on Monday, Trump replied: “Did he say that? Well, nobody wants him because he will be out of office very soon.”</p><p>“I’ll put a 200 percent tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he’ll join, but he doesn’t have to join,” Trump was quoted by the news agency AFP as saying.</p><p>A source close to Macron, who must step down as president in 2027 because of term limits, told AFP on Tuesday that Trump’s threats to impose the tariffs were “unacceptable” and “ineffective”.</p><p>Setting the scene for Davos, Trump also reported on social media that he had “a very good telephone call” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and he had agreed to a meeting on Greenland.</p><p>“As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back – On that, everyone agrees!” he posted.</p><p>Later on Tuesday, Trump went on to post a screenshot of what he said was a text message from Rutte, who last year referred to the US president as “daddy”. The screenshot made a flattering offer to “highlight your work” in Syria, Gaza and Ukraine while highlighting NATO’s commitment to “finding a way forward on Greenland”.</p><h2 id=\"we-have-to-have-it\">‘We have to have it’</h2><p>Trump’s posts on Tuesday also included a doctored image of him planting the US flag next to a sign reading “Greenland, US Territory, Est. 2026”.</p><p>Asked by reporters on Monday what he planned to say to European leaders in Davos about his Greenland plan, Trump said: “I don’t think they’re going to push back too much. Look, we have to have it.”</p><p>Earlier, he had linked his aggressive stance to last year’s decision <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-tells-norway-pm-not-bound-to-think-purely-of-peace-after-nobel-snub\">not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize</a> he deeply coveted, telling Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace” in a text message released on Monday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Store said he would change his schedule to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday and Thursday, overlapping with Trump’s planned appearance.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Trump’s planned tariffs over Greenland “a mistake especially between long-standing allies” and vowed that Europe’s response would be “unflinching, united and proportional”.</p><p>“Plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape,” said von der Leyen in a keynote speech at Davos.</p><p>She said that the European Union was working on a “massive European investment surge” in Greenland, pledging to “work with the United States and all partners on wider Arctic security”.</p><p>“This is clearly in our shared interest,” she said.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would try to meet Trump on Wednesday, adding that a trade dispute was not wanted, but “if we are confronted with tariffs that we consider unreasonable, then we are capable of responding.”</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Davos it would be “very unwise” for European governments to retaliate.</p><p>“I think it’s a complete canard that the president will be doing this because of the Nobel Prize. The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States,” he said.</p><p>EU leaders are to convene in Brussels on Thursday evening for an emergency summit after Trump’s threats to impose new tariffs on six of its members.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In early 2014, she advocated against the use of force against tens of thousands of Russian soldiers who swarmed Crimea during an interregnum that followed the toppling of Yanukovych.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010 and orchestrated a trial in which Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for “abuse of power”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After he fled to Russia, she was freed by pro-Western protesters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She said that no soldier should leave the barracks and no tank should leave the box,” Romanenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko has said the current corruption probe against her is aimed at barring her from taking part in a presidential election – even though elections are <a href=\"/features/2025/12/10/could-ukraine-hold-a-presidential-election-right-now-as-trump-demands\">banned during the war</a> against Russia’s invasion, which will enter its fifth year in February.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It looks like the election is closer than it seemed, and someone decided to purge the rivals,” she wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, apparently referring to Zelenskyy. “… I’ve been fearless for a long time as I know I am honest before myself, the people and Ukraine.”</p><h2 id=\"no-competitor-for-zelenskyy\" dir=\"ltr\">‘No competitor for Zelenskyy’</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Analysts ridiculed her claim.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko is “no competitor for Zelenskyy”, Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She has “no chances of even making it to the second round,” he said, citing opinion polls that give Tymoshenko approval ratings of 3 to 4 percent and name her one of the “most hated” politicians in Ukraine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If presidential elections were held now, in the best case scenario, she would be number six, seven or eight,” Fesenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, the investigation and Tymoshenko’s diatribes against Zelenskyy could change the speed and efficiency of wartime decision-making.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Motherland sided with Zelenskyy on most bills, and the rift may jeopardise his control over the Verkhovna Rada.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, despite what Tymoshenko claims about her alleged danger to Zelenskyy during a presumed presidential campaign, the investigation is detrimental to the president and the overall war effort, Fesenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anticorruption investigators are focused on Tymoshenko’s role as one of the Verkhovna Rada’s puppet masters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She is “one of the few influential politicians in the Rada who deal with shadowy financial matters”, Fesenko said. “She’s been doing it her whole life.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In late December, anticorruption bodies charged two dozen lawmakers, including five with the Servant of the People, with corruption and vote rigging.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The scandal is going to boost media attention on the anticorruption bodies even though convictions of the alleged wrongdoers are far from guaranteed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She is going to get away with it,” a former Motherland lawmaker told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he fears “retaliation” from Tymoshenko.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She hates Zelenskyy’s guts. She thinks he stole her presidency” in 2019, he said. “And now she thinks that he [activated anticorruption officials against] her because she could win the vote, which is absurd because her ratings are way below his.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko has posted bail of 33 million hryvnia ($761,000) and is not allowed to leave the Kyiv region.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Tuesday, a court will decide whether her assets should be frozen. Her trial may begin in months.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More Danish soldiers have been deployed to the island while European allies have sent small contingents in a symbolic show of support.</p><p>The language of sovereignty, self-determination and international law has suddenly become urgent. Danish politicians are speaking of principles, borders and the dangers of great power politics.</p><p>What is striking is not that Denmark is panicking but that it appears surprised.</p><p>Greenland is strategic. It always has been. Its location, resources and military value make it a desired prize in an increasingly competitive global order. The renewed American interest in the island is neither an anomaly nor a momentary excess of rhetoric. It is the logical expression of an imperial worldview – one that prioritises power, access and control over the formalities of international norms.</p><p>What makes the Greenland case uncomfortable for Denmark is not merely the threat itself. It is the mirror it holds up.</p><p>For decades, Denmark has been a reliable partner in advancing that very same imperial worldview elsewhere. It aligned itself closely with the US, not only diplomatically but also militarily. Denmark participated in wars that reshaped entire regions under the banner of security, values and alliance loyalty. Now as the same imperial logic is being applied to Danish territory, the abstractions of geopolitics suddenly become tangible.</p><p>This is the irony Denmark must confront.</p><p>The concern over Greenland rests on arguments Denmark knows well. That sovereignty matters. That territories are not commodities. That international law cannot be selectively applied. Yet these principles were notably absent from Denmark’s considerations when it joined the invasion of Iraq, a war launched without a legal mandate and justified by spurious claims that quickly collapsed.</p><p>These arguments were also diluted in Afghanistan, where two decades of war ended not in stability but in exhaustion and the return to the status quo. They disappeared almost entirely in Libya, where Danish aircraft played a decisive role in toppling its leader Muammar Gaddafi. What followed was a shattered state defined by militias, chaos and human trafficking.</p><p>In Syria, Denmark’s involvement, both direct and indirect, formed part of a broader Western intervention. A popular uprising was transformed into a prolonged proxy war with catastrophic consequences for civilians and regional stability.</p><p>Each of these interventions was framed as necessary. Each was presented as a moral obligation. Each was defended as part of a rules-based international order. In practice, each helped erode the very norms Denmark now invokes when Greenland enters the equation.</p><p>Palestine makes this contradiction impossible to ignore.</p><p>Israel is a close Danish ally, yet as Gaza has been reduced to rubble, Denmark’s political leadership has remained strikingly restrained. While international legal experts, humanitarian organisations and United Nations bodies have warned of genocide, Denmark’s response has been cautious to the point of silence. Calls for accountability have been muted. Moral clarity has been deferred.</p><p>At the same time, Danish industry remains entangled in the machinery of war. A Danish defence company continues to supply spare parts for F-35 fighter jets, aircraft that have played a central role in the bombardment of Gaza. When asked whether international arrest obligations would be enforced against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he enter Denmark, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declined to give a clear answer.</p><p>Law is conditional. Principles are flexible. Denmark has long helped normalise a world in which power decides when law applies.</p><p>For years, imperial violence was something that happened elsewhere. To other people, in other regions. The consequences were exported. Destabilised states. Mass displacement. Radicalisation. The steady hollowing-out of international institutions. Europe absorbed some of the fallout but largely refused to connect it to its own political choices. Denmark was no exception.</p><p>Greenland collapses that distance. Gaza exposes the moral architecture beneath it.</p><p>What Denmark is experiencing now is not injustice. It is exposure.</p><p>The same arguments once used to justify intervention in the Middle East are now being repurposed closer to home. Strategic necessity. Security concerns. Global competition. These are not new concepts. They are simply being applied in a direction Denmark did not expect.</p><p>This moment reveals the limits of moral selectivity. International law cannot be defended only when it is convenient. Sovereignty cannot be sacred in the Arctic and disposable elsewhere. Small states cannot rely on principles they helped undermine and expect them to hold when global power dynamics shift.</p><p>For Europe as a whole, the implications are profound. Alignment with empire does not guarantee protection from it. Loyalty does not produce autonomy. A continent that tolerates the erosion of law abroad will eventually face its absence at home.</p><p>Greenland is not just a territorial concern. It is a reckoning.</p><p>The irony is complete. The question is whether Denmark and Europe will finally choose to learn from it.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP), which emerged from the protests that led to the ouster of then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, also accused the BEC of bias and acting in favour of the BNP.</p><p>The competing accusations against the election body underscore a deepening divide over who should be allowed to contest in the elections that threatens to derail the country’s preparations for the elections.</p><p>NCP spokesperson Asif Mahmud Sajib Bhuiyan said at a news conference on Sunday that the party might reconsider its participation in the election.</p><h2 id=\"the-dispute\">The dispute</h2><p>Under Bangladeshi law, foreign citizens are barred from contesting parliamentary elections.</p><p>During scrutiny of nomination papers and a subsequent nine-day appeal process that ended on Sunday, the BEC reviewed dozens of objections related to the alleged dual citizenship of 25 candidates.</p><p>Ultimately, the commission upheld the candidacy of 23 candidates and cancelled the nominations of the remaining two.</p><p>In several instances, the BEC cleared the nominations after candidates submitted documents or affidavits stating that they had renounced, or applied to renounce, foreign citizenship.</p><p>All parties appear to have benefitted from the BEC’s decision to allow these candidatures. Of the 23 that were approved, 10 belong to the BNP. Four candidates of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist group and the NCP’s coalition partner, were also approved, as well as an NCP candidate, despite questions over dual citizenship. Another approved candidate belongs to the Khelafat Majlis, also an alliance partner of the Jamaat and the NCP.</p><p>The remaining seven candidates to be approved by the BEC belong to smaller parties or are contesting as independents, not allied with either of the two leading groups.</p><p>The NCP claims that its candidate, whose nomination was under scrutiny, had not informed it about his dual citizenship, and the party has decided to withdraw his candidacy in the election.</p><p>Mahabub Alam, an NCP leader who attended the BEC hearings where the complaints were heard, told Al Jazeera: “Requiring candidates to prove they have renounced foreign citizenship while accepting only future commitments constitutes selective and unconstitutional treatment.”</p><p>He claimed that the approach “favours certain parties”, alluding to the BNP, whose candidates are the largest beneficiaries of the BEC move to allow some dual citizens to contest. Alam pointed out that candidates who had submitted applications to renounce foreign citizenships could also withdraw those pleas before a final decision, without Bangladeshi authorities necessarily getting to know.</p><p>Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin rejected the allegations of bias, saying the decisions were guided by a desire to ensure participation.</p><p>“We want an election with participation from all sides,” he told candidates and their representatives after the hearings. “We have not delivered any judgement with bias.”</p><h2 id=\"past-track-record\">Past track record</h2><p>Bangladesh currently allows its citizens to obtain a second citizenship from a list of 103 countries.</p><p>However, Article 66(2) of its Constitution disqualifies a person if they acquire the citizenship of a foreign state.</p><p>The current battle lines are drawn over interpretations of what the Constitution says. Does a candidate need to complete the formal renunciation of foreign citizenship before submitting nomination papers? Or is applying to relinquish that citizenship sufficient to avoid disqualification?</p><p>Critics argue that accepting affidavits or verbal assurances weakens constitutional safeguards and allows selective enforcement.</p><p>Under United Kingdom procedures, for instance, a declaration of renunciation must be registered by the Home Office before it takes effect; until then, the applicant remains a British citizen.</p><p>The BEC has not publicly issued detailed legal reasoning for individual decisions so far.</p><p>The commission has, however, previously cancelled candidacies over dual citizenship. In January 2024, Shammi Ahmed, a nominee of Hasina’s Awami League party for Barishal-4 constituency, had her candidacy cancelled by the BEC over dual citizenship allegations — a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court’s Appellate Division.</p><h2 id=\"political-pressure-intensifies\">Political pressure intensifies</h2><p>The dispute moved beyond the Election Commission on Sunday evening when a Jamaat-e-Islami delegation, led by party chief Shafiqur Rahman, met interim government head Muhammad Yunus.</p><p>After the meeting, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher, Jamaat’s deputy chief, also accused the BEC of bias in decisions on candidate nominations, including on questions of dual citizenship.</p><p>Without naming any party, Taher said Jamaat had heard that pressure was being exerted on the commission to prevent the cancellation of nominations that should otherwise have been declared invalid due to legal flaws.</p><p>“We want to state clearly that the Election Commission must not bow to any pressure — whoever the party may be, even if it is Jamaat-e-Islami,” he said.</p><p>A day later, on Monday afternoon, an NCP delegation led by party convener Nahid Islam also met Yunus, accusing the BEC of acting under pressure from the BNP in allowing candidates accused of holding foreign citizenship to contest.</p><p>Speaking to journalists afterwards, Nahid said the commission had deviated from its legal position.</p><p>“There are candidates with dual citizenship in the BNP, and there are candidates with dual citizenship in Jamaat,” he said. “Which party they belong to is not the issue. The issue is whether the law is being applied equally to everyone.”</p><p>“It is clear that the commission has moved away from the legal position under pressure from one party and is using a flawed interpretation of the law to give these candidates an opportunity,” he added.</p><p>“If the Election Commission cannot maintain neutrality, how can we expect a fair election?” Nahid said, warning that continued bias would raise doubts about the credibility of the vote.</p><p>Nahid said the party would challenge the decisions in court and could take to the streets if necessary.</p><h2 id=\"ethically-problematic-too\">‘Ethically problematic too’</h2><p>Political analyst Mohiuddin Ahmad said allowing dual citizens to run was not only unconstitutional but also “ethically problematic”.</p><p>He questioned whether allegiance to another state could be reconciled with representing Bangladeshi voters.</p><p>“If the commission knowingly overlooks constitutional requirements, it undermines its mandate and risks invalidating the election itself,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Dilara Choudhury, a political analyst, said affidavits alone were insufficient to meet legal requirements and warned that the BEC risked losing moral authority if it failed to adhere strictly to procedure.</p><p>“If the Election Commission’s image as neutral is damaged, how can it deliver a credible election?” she said. “If the election becomes questionable and citizens lose trust, it will be a futile exercise — and the government formed through it will also face questions of legitimacy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
