Popular apps and websites such as Roblox, Pinterest and WhatsApp are currently exempt – but the government has stressed that the list remains under review.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meta, YouTube and other social media giants have already condemned the ban.</p><p>YouTube, in particular, has attacked the law, describing it as “rushed” and saying it would only push children into deeper, darker corners of the internet.</p><p>While most platforms have begrudgingly agreed to comply, for now, legal challenges are in the wind.</p><p>Online discussion site Reddit said Tuesday it could not confirm local media reports that said it would seek to overturn the ban in Australia’s High Court.</p><p>The Sydney-based internet rights group Digital Freedom Project has already launched its own bid to have teenagers reinstated to social media.</p><p>Some parents, tired of seeing children stuck to their phones, see the ban as a relief.</p><p>Father-of-five Dany Elachi said the restrictions were a long-overdue “line in the sand”.</p><p>“We need to err on the side of caution before putting anything addictive in the hands of children,” he told the AFP news agency.</p><p>The Australian government concedes the ban will be far from perfect at the outset, and canny teenagers will find ways to circumvent it.</p><p>Social media companies bear the sole responsibility for checking users are 16 or older.</p><p>Some platforms say they will use AI tools to estimate ages based on photos, while young users may also choose to prove their age by uploading a government ID.</p><p>There is keen interest in whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work as regulators around the globe wrestle with the potential dangers of social media.</p><p>Malaysia indicated it was <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/24/malaysia-says-it-will-ban-social-media-for-under-16s-from-next-year\">planning to introduce a similar ban</a> next year.</p><p>Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells said <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/meta-starts-blocking-teens-in-australia-under-social-media-ban\">last week</a> that the European Commission, France, Denmark, Greece, Romania and New Zealand were also interested in setting a minimum age for social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A total of 22 declared strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean, even though they are widely considered illegal under both international and US law, since drug trafficking is a criminal activity.</p><p>The press statement by the groups says that they hope to force a disclosure from an OLC that “apparently blesses the ongoing strikes as lawful acts in an alleged ‘armed conflict’ with unspecified ‘drug cartels’”.</p><p>Legal experts roundly reject the administration’s claim that drug trafficking constitutes an attack on the US and that alleged traffickers are therefore unlawful combatants who can be killed with military force. But despite their likely illegality, the Trump administration has pressed forward with <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/us-military-kills-four-in-latest-strike-on-boat-in-the-caribbean\">more strikes</a> and has stated that they will continue, sharing videos of small boats exploding after being struck on social media.</p><p>“If the OLC opinion seeks to dress up legalese in order to provide cover for the obvious illegality of these serial homicides, the public needs to see this analysis and ultimately hold accountable all those who facilitate murder in the United States’ name,” said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.</p><p>Some have also cast doubt on the administration’s stated aim of combating <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">drug trafficking</a>, noting that the strikes have a minuscule impact on drug flows.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The campaign also comes during a period of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/opening-pandoras-box-what-happens-if-the-us-attacks-venezuela\">heightened US threats</a> against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the Trump administration has accused of coordinating the activities of criminal groups despite internal US intelligence assessments that undercut that claim.</p><p>The US has deployed a large contingent of forces to the region, including an aircraft carrier and thousands of troops, prompting speculation about a possible attack on Venezuela to topple Maduro.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If that keeps going the way it’s going, in my opinion, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer,” Trump said. “Their immigration policy is a disaster.”</p><p>Trump’s comments come less than a week after his administration released a National Security Strategy <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">berating Europe</a> and warning of “civilisational erasure” on the continent.</p><p>The document called for “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Asked about the possibility of interfering in Europe’s internal affairs, Trump said he is focused on governing the US. However, he did not rule out endorsing candidates and parties in European elections, akin to his support for right-wing politicians in Latin America.</p><p>Trump also confirmed that his Hungarian ally, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is seeking a US bailout, similar to the $40bn aid package that Washington handed to the government of Argentinian President <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/27/argentine-assets-cheer-milei-partys-election-victory-with-massive-rally\">Javier Milei</a>.</p><p>But the US president denied Orban’s claim that an assistance deal <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">has been secured</a>.</p><p>It may be difficult for the US to empower allies beyond Hungary. Many European far-right parties that echo Trump’s rhetoric have been shunned in their own countries.</p><p>In Germany, for example, groups across the political spectrum have vowed not to include the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/german-security-service-designates-far-right-afd-as-extremist\">hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party</a> in any governing coalition.</p><p>In 2017, during his first term, Trump sparked a diplomatic crisis with the United Kingdom when he shared fake videos from a British far-right leader that purported to paint Muslim immigrants as violent.</p><p>Then-UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2017/11/30/trump-attacks-may-defends-britain-first-tweets\">Theresa May</a> called the posts “wrong”, and several politicians condemned the US president.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump renewed his attacks on one of his most frequent political targets – London’s Mayor <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/9/23/un-general-assembly-2025-live-day-one\">Sadiq Khan</a>.</p><p>The US president questioned Khan’s ideology and suggested that the mayor, a Muslim, was elected by immigrants, echoing the “great replacement” <a href=\"/news/2022/5/18/great-replacement-the-conspiracy-theory-stoking-racist-violence\">conspiracy theory</a> that alleges an unfounded plot to replace white voters with newcomers.</p><p>“If you take a look at London, you have a mayor named Khan. He’s a horrible mayor. He’s an incompetent mayor, but he’s a horrible, vicious, disgusting mayor,” Trump said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Although the UK has been adopting restrictive immigration laws, Trump claimed that it is “allowing people just to come in, unchecked, unvetted”.</p><p>“Look at the mayor of London. He’s a disaster. He’s a disaster,” Trump said. “He’s got a totally different ideology of what he’s supposed to have. And he gets elected because so many people have come in, and they vote for him.”</p><p>Trump also attacked Khan during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September, suggesting that the London mayor adopted Islamic law in the city.</p><p>The US president’s rhetoric against Khan and Europe has been met with a muted response over the past weeks.</p><p>UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/is-keir-starmer-facing-a-plot-to-depose-him-as-uk-prime-minister\">Keir Starmer</a> has only defended and voiced support for Khan – his Labour Party ally – without condemning or directly criticising Trump.</p><p>In his Politico interview, Trump also decried the state of Paris – a major destination for US tourists – as well as Sweden, saying that the Nordic country is now “very unsafe”.</p><p>Sweden, home to around 10.6 million people, had 92 homicides last year – far less than half of the 250 murders recorded in the US city of Memphis, which has a population of less than 630,000 people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its brutality has deepened the conflict and destabilized the region, creating the conditions for terrorist groups to grow,” Treasury official John K Hurley said in a statement.</p><p>The conflict, the Treasury added, “has provoked the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian crisis”.</p><p>Fighting has raged in Sudan since the outbreak of war in April 2023, and more than 12.4 million people have been forced from their homes, contributing to displacement both within the country’s borders and in surrounding areas. More than 3.3 million people have fled Sudan as refugees.</p><p>Just this week, a United Nations committee called for an end to the hostilities, citing a long list of human rights abuses committed by the RSF and its allies.</p><p>They include ethnically motivated killings, torture, the targeting of humanitarian workers and the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.</p><p>On January 7, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/genocide-determination-in-sudan-and-imposing-accountability-measures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it had determined the RSF had committed genocide against ethnic groups in Sudan as part of its armed campaign, though it also highlighted abuses on both sides of the conflict.</p><p>Tuesday’s Treasury statement references that genocide determination and adds that the fighting threatens US interests in Africa.</p><p>“The civil war in Sudan risks destabilizing the region and making the country a safe haven for those who threaten the United States,” the statement reads.</p><h2 id=\"more-than-300-colombian-recruits\">More than 300 Colombian recruits</h2><p>While the Treasury has sanctioned RSF leaders and organisations in the past, Tuesday’s economic penalties shine a spotlight on the role Colombian nationals have played in the fighting.</p><p>According to the US government, hundreds of Colombian military veterans have flown to Sudan since September 2024, in order to intervene on the RSF’s behalf.</p><p>Many start by training RSF fighters, including child soldiers. They also provide RSF forces with information about operating drones, artillery and military-style vehicles.</p><p>In addition, the US Treasury has accused Colombian nationals of engaging in the fighting firsthand, including during the 18-month siege on <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/29/satellite-images-reveal-mass-killing-sites-in-sudans-el-fasher-city\">el-Fasher</a>, the capital of the North Sudan state and a city the RSF seized in October.</p><p>“Colombian fighters have participated in numerous battles across Sudan, including in its capital, Khartoum, as well as Omdurman, Kordofan, and El Fasher,” the Treasury’s statement reads.</p><p>“The presence of Colombian fighters in Sudan would not be possible without the assistance of numerous individuals and companies, mostly from Colombia.”</p><p>In a September letter to the UN Security Council, a representative of Sudan’s government estimated that between 350 to 380 Colombian mercenaries have arrived in the African country to participate in the fighting. Most of them, he said, were “retired soldiers and officers of the Colombian Army”.</p><p>Colombia has gained a reputation as an international marketplace for mercenaries.</p><p>Experts often point to the role of Colombia’s own internal conflict in producing out-of-work fighters. Since 1964, Colombia has been mired in fighting between multiple armed forces, including right-wing paramilitary groups, left-wing rebels, criminal networks and the country’s own military.</p><p>Accusations of human rights abuses have been rampant in that conflict as well, and at least 450,000 people have been killed, according to a government truth commission.</p><p>According to Tuesday’s statement from the US Treasury, two of the sanctioned individuals, Quijano Becerra and his wife, Oliveros Forero, run a Bogota-based employment firm called International Services Agency.</p><p>That firm, the Treasury says, holds “group chats” and “town halls” to recruit Colombian fighters for Sudan, “including drone operators, snipers, and translators”.</p><p>The organisation allegedly obscures its actions through a Panama-based company called Global Staffing, also known as Talent Bridge.</p><p>The Treasury also sanctioned Duque Botero and Muñoz Ucros for running another Bogota-based employment company with similar aims.</p><p>That company, called Maine Global Corp, allegedly hires Colombians and works with Global Staffing to convert currency in order to ensure the fighters’ payments. A fourth company, Comercializadora San Bendito, was accused of facilitating the wire transfers.</p><p>From 2024 to 2025, the Treasury estimated the payments processed amounted to “millions of US dollars”. All four companies mentioned in the Treasury’s statement faced sanctions, alongside their leaders.</p><p>Sanctions freeze any assets individuals or groups may have in the US. They also make it illegal for US-based entities to do business with the designated individuals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The court’s conservative members have argued that political spending is a constitutionally protected form of free speech.</p><p>In 2010, the court reshaped the country’s campaign finance landscape with the landmark ruling Citizens United v Federal Election Commission that struck down previous limits on individual expenditures. Corporations and donors rushed to take advantage, leading to a considerable increase in campaign spending.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the transparency watchdog Open Secrets, spending by super PACS, or a kind of political action committee that can raise unlimited funds from donors, corporations, and other groups, rose from $62.6m in 2010, the year of the ruling, to $622.7m two years later. By 2024, the figure had exploded to $4.1bn.</p><p>The court has continued to chip away at limits in a series of additional rulings since Citizens United.</p><p>“The coordinated party spending limits are at war with this court’s recent First Amendment cases,” Noel Francisco, a lawyer for the Republican challengers, told the justices.</p><p>Some of the court’s liberal justices noted the surge in <a href=\"/news/2024/10/9/harris-campaign-hits-1bn-in-fundraising-reports\">political spending</a> that has accompanied previous decisions on campaign finance.</p><p>“Once we take off coordinated expenditure limits, then what’s left?” asked Justice Sonya Sotomayor. “What’s left is nothing. No control whatsoever.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case before the court was brought by two Republican committees for House and Senate candidates, and was first filed in Ohio in 2022 when a pair of Ohio Republicans, Steve Chabot and current Vice President <a href=\"/news/2024/7/15/who-is-jd-vance-trumps-pick-for-us-vice-president\">JD Vance</a>, were running for Senate.</p><p>The Trump administration has joined the request to strike down a prior federal election law intended to prevent arrangements in which wealthy donors circumvent limits on individual spending by directing those sums to a party, with the understanding that it will be spent in support of a particular candidate.</p><p>“More speech,” Francisco told Sotomayor in response to her concerns, “is always better than less.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

An ally quoted by the FT rejected claims that opposition from regional governments had forced him out of Trump’s planned “peace board”, insisting discussions were ongoing.</p><p>Another source said Blair could still return in “a different capacity”, noting he is favoured by both Washington and Tel Aviv.</p><p>Trump’s Gaza plan led to a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with Israeli forces continuing attacks across the besieged territory. At least 377 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire took effect in October, according to Gaza authorities. More than 70,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its genocidal war against the Palestinian people in Gaza in October 2023, according to Gaza health authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Arrests were made without warrants, over a neighbour’s grudge, a relative’s rumour, or a bribe.</p><p>In the days after the regime’s collapse, some Syrians celebrated. Others ran to the prisons. At Sednaya Prison, people grabbed whatever documents they could, as papers were trampled into the ground and crucial evidence disappeared underfoot. Families searched for loved ones, even beneath the floors - what they found were ropes, chains, and electric cables.</p><p>Only a few families were reunited after al-Assad’s fall.</p><p>For the rest, grief and hope coexist as the whereabouts of the disappeared remain unknown.</p><p>The new government, led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has pledged to uncover the truth. In May 2025, decrees created the National Commission for the Missing and the National Commission for Transitional Justice. Advisory boards have been appointed, and legislation is being drafted.</p><p>But progress is slow in a nation stripped of laboratories, specialists, and funds.

Each set of remains is boxed and sent to an identification centre. There, the process stops. The boxes of bones stay sealed. According to the White Helmets, no family has been reunited with the remains of the disappeared.</p><p>Officials and humanitarian workers say that without DNA laboratories, forensic specialists, or a functioning identification system, the bones can only be stored, even when families are sure they know who they are.</p><p>On November 5, the National Commission for the Missing signed a cooperation agreement with the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria (IIMP), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p><p>Officials say these institutions will investigate past crimes, build a national database of the missing, support families, and, eventually, identify and return remains.</p><p>The cooperation agreement was billed as the start of a comprehensive national process for truth and justice, committing all parties to share expertise and help build the backbone of an identification system.</p><p>The task is vast. There are no reliable official figures; estimates of the disappeared range from 120,000 to 300,000 people, numbers compiled from various sources without a unified database.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Before anyone can be identified, the state must gather what already exists – detention registers, civil documents, military files, and lists held by opposition groups and by survivor associations like the Caesar Families, Families for Freedom and the Sednaya Association.</p><p>Then they must collect testimonies from survivors and families, and coax information from former officials and guards who may know where people were taken or buried. All this must be uploaded into a central database that has not yet been built.</p><p>“You cannot start immediately searching, looking for answers,” says Zeina Shahla, a member of the government’s National Commission for the Missing. “You need to set up the ground.”</p><p>Right now, Syria has only a single identification centre in Damascus, set up with the ICRC, but no dedicated DNA laboratory. Offices in other cities are promised, but not yet open.</p><p>“We have huge needs – technical needs, financial needs, human resources,” Shahla says.</p><p>“Most of them are not available in Syria, especially the … scientific resources. We don't have DNA labs. We don't have the forensic labs. We don't have the doctors. So we need a lot of resources.</p><p>“And of course, this fight is too complicated because it's affecting millions of people.

Earlier this year, the administration of US President Donald Trump doubled trade tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, in part because of this issue, Trump said at the time.</p><p>Here is what we know about India’s imports of Russian oil, and how New Delhi has managed to keep its petroleum purchases from Moscow afloat in spite of sanctions and pressure.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-india-become-such-a-big-consumer-of-russian-oil\">How did India become such a big consumer of Russian oil?</h2><p>In 2021, prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian oil constituted around 2.5 percent of India’s total oil imports, according to figures from the US Energy Information Administration published in February this year.</p><p>After the war began, Europe and the US began placing sanctions on Russian companies to economically isolate Moscow.</p><p>Overall, since the beginning of the war, the US and its allies have imposed more than 21,000 <a href=\"/program/money-works/2024/7/11/are-russian-sanctions-working\">sanctions on Russia</a>, targeting individuals, media organisations, the military, and sectors that include energy, aviation, shipbuilding and telecommunications.</p><p>Crucially, however, in December 2022, the Group of Seven (G7), the European Union and Australia placed a <a href=\"/news/2022/12/5/eu-ban-on-russian-oil-imports-and-g7-price-cap-comes-into-effect\">cap on the price</a> of Russian oil at $60 per barrel, ostensibly to reduce Russia’s ability to fund its war in Ukraine. The cap was later reduced to around $48 by the EU and the United Kingdom. This made Russian oil more attractive to purchasers, particularly India and China. Russia has sold crude oil to India at steeply discounted rates, dropping as low as $35 per barrel in March 2022.</p><p>By contrast, Brent crude oil is currently trading at around $62.50 per barrel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-is-india-buying-from-russia\">How much oil is India buying from Russia?</h2><p>In October 2024, India’s purchases of Russian crude petroleum reached a historic high of $5.8bn.</p><p>At the end of that month, the US imposed new sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities. These include Russian shipowners, vessels and traders involved in shipping Russian crude.</p><p>In November 2024, India’s crude petroleum imports from Russia dropped to $3.9bn and by December 2024, India was importing even less oil from Russia, worth $3.2bn.</p><p>However, in January 2025, Indian imports of Russian oil from Russia bounced back up to $3.6bn. Since then, volumes of imports have fluctuated.</p><h2 id=\"what-pressure-is-india-facing-to-stop-buying-russian-oil\">What pressure is India facing to stop buying Russian oil?</h2><p>In August this year, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said India’s purchases of Russian crude oil were <a href=\"/news/2025/8/18/us-adviser-navarro-pushes-india-to-end-its-purchase-of-russian-crude\">funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine</a> and must stop.</p><p>“India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,” Navarro wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times.</p><p>In August, Washington also doubled trade tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent as a punishment for India buying Russian oil.</p><p>In October, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-says-modi-has-assured-him-india-will-not-buy-russian-oil\">Trump claimed</a> that Modi had pledged to stop buying oil from Russia.</p><p>“So I was not happy that India was buying oil, and he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia,” Trump told reporters during a White House event.</p><p>“That’s a big step. Now we’re going to get China to do the same thing.”</p><p>But during an interview with Indian broadcasters during the Russia-India annual <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/uninterrupted-oil-shipments-key-takeaways-from-putin-modi-talks-in-delhi\">bilateral summit</a> on December 4, Putin scoffed at Trump’s claim. “The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants,” he said. In 2023, US imports of enriched uranium from Russia hit a record high in over a decade, worth about $1.2bn.</p><p>If the US has the right to buy Russian fuel, he added, India should enjoy “the same privilege”.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated this sentiment during a call with reporters on Monday this week, when he said: “India, as a sovereign state, conducts foreign trade operations and purchases energy resources where it is beneficial for India, and as far as we understand, our Indian partners will continue this policy to ensure their economic interests.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-have-sanctions-on-russian-oil-caused-a-spike-in-indian-imports\">Why have sanctions on Russian oil caused a spike in Indian imports?</h2><p>On October 22 this year, Trump imposed <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/will-trumps-sanctions-against-russian-oil-giants-hurt-putin\">US sanctions</a> on two of Russia’s largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil. It was the first time during his second term as US president that Washington had imposed sanctions related to Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>The US sanctions came the same day that the EU approved its own 19th package of sanctions on Russia, and one week after the UK also sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil.</p><p>The US sanctions were set to come into effect on November 21, after which purchases from US-sanctioned entities Rosneft and Lukoil would be restricted, giving Indian importers a window to ramp up purchases ahead of the deadline.</p><p>One day after the US sanctions were announced, state refiners in India, including Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp, began reviewing their Russian oil purchases, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p><p>In October, India imported $3.55bn worth of crude petroleum from Russia, according to figures from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, reported in Indian media. While this was not as high as the $5.8bn value of crude petroleum India purchased from Russia in October 2024, it showed that India was still buying more oil than it was before the war in Ukraine broke out.</p><p>In early November, however, India ramped up its imports of Russian oil. India’s crude oil imports increased by 220,000 barrels per day, reaching 5 million barrels per day, according to energy market intelligence firm Vortexa. This was a seasonal peak, nearly matching the record high of 5.05 million barrels per day set in March 2025.</p><p>India’s refining sector consists of three main categories of operators: National Oil Companies (NOCs), which are state‑owned, public sector refiners; Reliance Industries, which is privately owned, with a diverse crude sourcing strategy; and Nayara Energy, a Russian‑majority‑owned private refiner.</p><p>The EU sanctioned Nayara in July 2025 over its links to Russia. Since then, however, it has doubled down on buying exclusively Russian crude, significantly increasing its intake.</p><p>With sanctions already in place, the company appears to see little downside in deepening its reliance on Russian oil. By late October, Nayara had ramped up crude processing at its Vadinar Refinery in Gujarat to 90-93 percent of capacity, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. That fell to 70 to 80 percent of capacity in July following the EU sanctions.</p><p>Overall, however, it is clear that India is continuing to import Russian oil. While sanctions have led to India scaling back on Russian oil purchases to some degree, New Delhi is still projected to buy 600,000 barrels of oil per day in January. This may be well below the 1.6 million to 1.8 million barrels it has been importing in recent months, but not zero, Bloomberg reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-india-continue-to-import-russian-oil\">How will India continue to import Russian oil?</h2><p>Rosneft and Lukoil account for around 60 percent of the Russian oil purchased by India, Reuters reported in October, citing Prashant Vashisht, vice president at ICRA Ltd, an Indian credit rating agency. Citing Russian government agencies, S&amp;P Global said Rosneft accounts for almost half of all Russian oil production and 6 percent of global output.</p><p>India, therefore, will have to turn to other sources for its Russian oil imports. This is likely to include companies such as Surgutneftegaz, which was never fully affected by sanctions.</p><p>India has also purchased oil from Gazprom Neft, which faces sectoral sanctions rather than being fully sanctioned. This means that the US has put limits on some activities, but has not completely banned doing business with the company.</p><p>India could also purchase Russian oil via a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russian-tanker-struck-off-turkiye-as-ukraine-targets-shadow-fleet\">shadow fleet</a> of older tankers using non-Western insurance and flags, which can often bypass sanctions.</p><p>Between January and September this year, India imported 5.4 million tonnes of Russian oil carried by 30 vessels sailing under false flags, according to a report published in November by the European think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

That brought the country’s trade surplus to about $1 trillion, China’s General Administration of Customs said on Monday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Shipments overseas from China have boomed despite US President Donald Trump’s global trade war, largely consisting of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries, which were <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">launched earlier this year</a> in a bid to reduce US trade deficits.</p><p>But China, which was initially hit with US tariffs of 145 percent before they were lowered to allow for trade talks, has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff by stepping up shipments to markets outside the US.</p><p>Following Trump’s 2024 election win, China began diversifying its export market away from the US in exchange for closer ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union. It also established new production hubs, outside of China, for low-tariff access.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-china-have-such-a-large-trade-surplus\">Why does China have such a large trade surplus?</h2><p>China’s exports returned to growth last month following an unexpected dip in October, rising to 5.9 percent more than one year earlier and far outpacing a 1.9 percent rise in imports, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.</p><p>China’s goods surplus for the first 11 months of 2025 was up 21.7 percent from the same period last year. Most of the surge was driven by strong growth in high-tech goods, which outpaced the increase in overall exports by 5.4 percent.</p><p>Auto exports, especially for electric vehicles, rallied as Chinese firms muscled in on Japanese and German market share. Total car shipments jumped by more than one million to approximately 6.5 million units this year, according to data from China-based consultancy Automobility.</p><p>And although China still trails US leaders like Nvidia in advanced chips, it is becoming dominant in the production of semiconductors (used in everything from electric cars to medical devices). Semiconductor exports rose by 24.7 percent over the period.</p><p>China’s technological advances have also boosted shipbuilding, where exports rose 26.8 percent compared with the same period in 2024.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>So, given the hostile global trade backdrop, how has China achieved this?</p><h3>Rerouting and diversifying</h3><p>Though Washington has <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/trump-xi-meeting-live-china-and-us-to-negotiate-rare-earths-tariffs\">lowered tariffs</a> on Chinese imports in recent months, they remain high. Average import duties on Chinese goods currently stand at 37 percent. For this reason, Chinese shipments to the US have dropped by 29 percent year-on-year to November.</p><p>Some Chinese companies have shifted their production facilities to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, enabling them to bypass Trump’s tariffs on goods arriving directly from China. Despite this, overall trade between the two countries remains down.</p><p>In the first eight months of this year, for instance, the US imported roughly $23bn in goods from Indonesia, an increase of nearly one-third on the same period in 2024. It is widely understood that the rise is down to Chinese goods being redirected via Indonesia.</p><p>“The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from US tariffs still appears to be increasing,” Zichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Huang added that “exports to Vietnam, the top [Chinese] rerouting hub, continued to grow rapidly.”</p><p>As trade with the US has slackened, China has doubled down on developing ties with other major trading partners. That includes a 15 percent surge in Chinese shipments to the EU, compared with the year before, and an 8.2 percent rise in exports to countries in Southeast Asia.</p><h3>Weaker currency</h3><p>Another reason for China’s trading success is that its currency has been cheap, compared with others, in recent years. A lower renminbi makes exports relatively inexpensive to produce, and imports relatively expensive to consume.</p><p>China maintains a “managed float” of the renminbi – meaning the central bank intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain its value against other currencies – with the aim of keeping the price stable.</p><p>For years, many economists have argued that China’s currency is undervalued. In their view, that gives exporters a competitive edge by boosting the appeal of cheap Chinese products at the expense of other countries, leading to large imbalances in trade.</p><p>Indeed, taking into account global inflationary dynamics, the real effective exchange rate – a measure of the competitiveness of Chinese goods – is actually at its weakest level since 2012.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-china-got-here\">How has China got here?</h2><p>China’s eye-watering $1 trillion trade surplus – never before recorded in economic history – is the culmination of decades of industrial policies that have enabled China to emerge from a low-income agrarian society in the 1970s to become the world’s second-largest economy today.</p><p>China established itself as a dependable producer of low-cost manufactured goods, like T-shirts and shoes, in the 1980s. Since then, it has climbed the industrial ladder to higher-value goods, such as <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/chinas-evs-dominate-the-world-why-not-in-the-us-and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electric vehicles and solar panels</a>.</p><p>By far its largest sector in terms of exports is electronics. China exported a total of more than $1 trillion-worth of electronic goods around the world in 2024. This follows the pattern of other industrialised countries by starting with simple, labour-intensive goods and then moving into more complex sectors. However, China has done so with unusual scale and speed to cement its dominance across numerous global supply chains.</p><p>It also dominates trade in <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/21/despite-us-push-china-poised-to-dominate-rare-earths-for-years\">rare-earth metals</a>, which are crucial for the manufacture of a wide range of goods from smartphones to fighter jets.</p><p>Twelve of the 17 rare earth metals on the periodic table can be found in China, and it mines between 60 percent and 70 percent of the world’s rare-earth resources. It also carries out 90 percent of the processing of these metals for commercial use.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4162289\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4162289\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4162289\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-What-are-China-biggest-exports-trade-2024-world-1765285569.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE- What are China biggest exports trade 2024 world-1765285569\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4162289\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>For historical context, China’s trade surplus in factory goods is larger as a share of its economy than the US ran in the years after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were emerging from the ruins of war.</p><h2 id=\"how-are-other-countries-responding-to-china-s-expanding-dominance\">How are other countries responding to China’s expanding dominance?</h2><p>Many are looking for ways to redress the balance.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/macron-tells-xi-that-china-france-must-overcome-differences\">who visited China last week</a>, warned the EU may take “strong measures”, including imposing higher tariffs, should Beijing fail to address the imbalance.</p><p>The EU already imposes additional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs), which range from 17 percent to 35.3 percent, for example, on top of its existing 10 percent import duty.<br>\nGermany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, arrived in China for a two-day trip on Monday this week, becoming the latest senior European official to visit for talks amid the country’s rapidly expanding goods trade with Europe.</p><p>Before his trip, Wadephul said he planned to raise the issue of tariffs with his Chinese counterparts, particularly those involving rare earths, in addition to concerns about industrial “overcapacities”, which he said are distorting global prices for industrial goods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-china-s-exports-continue-to-grow\">Will China’s exports continue to grow?</h2><p>Despite efforts by the US and other wealthy countries to diversify away from China, few economists expect the country’s broad-based trade momentum to slow anytime soon.</p><p>Economists at Morgan Stanley predict China’s share of global goods exports will reach 16.5 percent by the end of the decade, up from 15 percent now, reflecting China’s ability to adapt quickly to shifting global demand.</p><p>More immediately, China’s strong trade performance means the annual growth target – set by Beijing to guide economic policy and to align regional governments – of about 5 percent is likely to be met.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
