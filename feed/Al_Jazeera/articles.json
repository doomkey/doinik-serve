Let’s hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.”</p><p>Early on Saturday morning, Republican Senator Mike Lee questioned the legality of the attack. “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorisation for the use of military force,” he wrote on X.</p><p>Lee later said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him that US troops were executing a legal arrest warrant against Maduro.</p><p>“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” the senator said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dissent\">Dissent</h2><p>Republican Congresswoman <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/trump-ally-marjorie-taylor-greene-decries-genocide-in-gaza\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> was one of the few dissenting voices.</p><p>“Americans’ disgust with our own government’s never-ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,”  Greene wrote on X.</p><p>Greene, a former Trump ally who fell out with the US president and is leaving Congress next week, rejected the argument that Trump ordered Maduro’s “capture” because of the Venezuelan president’s alleged involvement in the drug trade.</p><p>She noted that Venezuela is not a major exporter of fentanyl, the leading cause of overdose deaths in the US.</p><p><span>She also underscored that, last month, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/juan-orlando-hernandez-freed-after-trumps-full-and-complete-pardon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump pardoned</a> former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a convicted drug trafficker who was serving a 45-year sentence in a US jail.</span></p><p>“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s [sic] tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene said.</p><p>Congressman Tomas Massie, another Republican, shared a speech he delivered in the House of Representatives earlier this month, warning that attacking Venezuela is about “oil and regime change”.</p><p>“Are we prepared to receive swarms of the 25 million Venezuelans, who will likely become refugees, and billions in American treasure that will be used to destroy and inevitably rebuild that nation? Do we want a miniature Afghanistan in the Western Hemisphere?” Massie said in the remarks.</p><p>“If that cost is acceptable to this Congress, then we should vote on it as a voice of the people and in accordance with our Constitution.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Massie and Greene are outliers in their party, Trump’s risky moves in Venezuela were a success in the short term: Maduro is in US custody at a minimal cost to Washington.</p><p>Similarly, few Republicans opposed the US war in Iraq when then-President George W Bush <a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">stood under</a> the “mission accomplished” sign on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln after toppling Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, in 2003.</p><p>But there is now a near consensus across the political spectrum that the Iraq invasion was a geopolitical disaster.</p><p>The fog of war continues to hang over Venezuela, and it is unclear who is in charge of the country, or how Trump will “run” it.</p><p>The US president has not ruled out deploying “boots on the ground” to Venezuela, raising the prospect of a US occupation and the possibility of another Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan.</p><p>“Do we truly believe that <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2026/1/3/what-are-the-implications-of-the-us-capture-of-nicolas-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a> will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in… Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie warned in his Congress speech.</p><p>“Previous presidents told us to go to war over WMDs, weapons of mass destruction, that did not exist. Now, it’s the same playbook, except we’re told that drugs are the WMDs.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US president said Rodríguez had talked to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”.</p><p>However, Rodríguez criticised the US military action as “brutal aggression” on state television and called for Maduro’s immediate release.</p><p>Maduro has led Venezuela since 2013, succeeding an ideological ally, Hugo Chavez, who had been in office since 1999. Under both men, US relations with Venezuela frayed over foreign policy, oil and human rights.</p><p>In July 2024, Maduro declared victory after an election that international observers described as fraudulent. The country’s opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, reportedly received about 70 percent of the vote.</p><p>Tensions between Trump and Maduro escalated in September after the US government began attacking vessels off the coast of Venezuela, killing more than 100 people, in what Trump described as an effort to thwart drug smuggling.</p><p>When a reporter asked Trump during the Mar-a-Lago media event whether he had spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado “doesn’t have the support or the respect within the country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy in Venezuela, had a 72 percent approval rating from Venezuelans in a March 2025 poll by ClearPath Strategies.</p><p>Trump said, without evidence, that the US’s role in <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/3/live-loud-noises-heard-in-venezuelas-capital-amid-us-tensions\">governing Venezuela</a> “won’t cost us anything” because US oil companies would invest in new infrastructure in the oil-rich country. “It’s going to make a lot of money,” he said.</p><p>PolitiFact fact-checked Trump’s and Rubio’s statements from the news conference.</p><h2 id=\"rubio-it-s-just-not-the-kind-of-mission-that-you-can-pre-notify-congress-about-because-it-endangers-the-mission\">Rubio: “It’s just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify [Congress about] because it endangers the mission.”</h2><p><em>The Trump administration’s lack of warning to Congress bucks laws and precedents. </em></p><p>Rubio said that members of Congress were not notified in advance of the US actions on Venezuela. Trump said the administration was concerned about Congress potentially leaking news of the administration’s decision to capture Maduro.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, praised the operation as a “decisive action”.</p><p>But Congressional Democrats said that Congress should have been notified in advance. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, said, “Maduro is terrible. But Trump put American servicemembers at risk with this unauthorised attack.”</p><p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said Trump and his cabinet were not forthcoming about their intentions for regime change in Venezuela, so “we are left with no understanding of how the administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the US, and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation”.</p><p>The US Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time this happened was during World War II.</p><p>Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander-in-chief without an official declaration of war.</p><p>Since Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Resolution, the president has had to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing the US military into hostilities, and terminate the use of the military within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are granted for ending operations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In recent decades, congressional consent has usually been granted through an authorisation for the use of military force. But such an authorisation has not been passed for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/colombia-braces-with-alarm-after-maduros-removal-in-venezuela-by-us\">operations in Venezuela</a>. Kaine and other lawmakers have pursued legislation – so far fruitlessly –  to prohibit the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against Venezuela without congressional authorisation.</p><p>The Trump administration has whittled away at prior notification requirements. Under federal law, eight bipartisan senior members of Congress must receive prior notice of particularly sensitive covert actions. In June 2025, the administration told Republicans, but not Democrats, about a forthcoming US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. For the Venezuela operation, it appears no lawmakers were notified in advance.</p><h2 id=\"trump-each-us-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-saves-25-000-people\">Trump: Each US boat strike off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 people</h2><p>The Trump administration has struck at least 32 vessels, killing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/us-kills-three-in-attack-on-alleged-drug-boats-searches-for-survivors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 115 people,</a> in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean since September. Trump said previously that the boats were carrying drugs en route to the US, and during the news conference, he said the drugs on each boat would kill “on average, 25,000 people”.</p><p>However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact that the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the US. And the administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 73,000 US drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. This means that the drugs on 32 boats, which would have killed 800,000 people based on Trump’s claim, would be responsible for nearly 11 times the number of US overdose deaths in one year.</p><h2 id=\"trump-maduro-sent-savage-and-murderous-gangs-including-the-bloodthirsty-prison-gang-tren-de-aragua-to-terrorise-american-communities-nationwide\">Trump: “Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang Tren de Aragua, to terrorise American communities nationwide.”</h2><p>There is no evidence that Maduro sent members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua to the US.</p><p>The US Justice Department indictment against Maduro does not mention Trump’s statement.</p><p>An April report from the US National Intelligence Council contradicted Trump’s statements about links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua.</p><p>“While Venezuela’s permissive environment enables [Tren de Aragua, or TDA] to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” the report said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-venezuela-stole-us-oil-in-the-past\">Trump: Venezuela ‘stole’ US oil in the past.</h2><p>In the early 20th century, Venezuela’s long-serving hardline leader, Juan Vicente Gomez, allowed foreign companies almost exclusive access to the country’s oil resources.</p><p>In 1975, after decades of seeking greater control of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">its oil resources</a>, Venezuela nationalised its oil industry.</p><p>“Trump’s claim that Venezuela has stolen oil and land from the US is baseless,” Francisco Rodríguez, a Venezuelan economist at the University of Denver, told The Washington Post. “The US was much more interested in having Venezuela be a provider of oil — relatively cheap oil — than to have a production collapse in Venezuela,” Rodríguez added.</p><p>As a result, the change was “relatively uncontroversial” at the time, he said.</p><p>US oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil as well as Gulf, now Chevron, lost about $5bn each in assets, and were compensated $1bn each, according to news reports, The Washington Post reported.</p><p>But Rodríguez said the companies did not push for additional compensation at the time, in part because no forum existed to do so.</p><p>In general, experts have told PolitiFact that invading a country to take its oil would be both illegal and unethical. In 2016, Trump mused about how the US should have taken Iraq’s oil when it invaded to remove its then-leader, Saddam Hussein.</p><p>Experts pointed to the annex to The Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War, which says that “private property … must be respected [and] cannot be confiscated”. It also says that “pillage is formally forbidden”.</p><p>“If ‘to the victors go the spoils’ was legal doctrine, then we would have believed that [Saddam Hussein] should have been able to keep Kuwait City after he invaded [Kuwait]” in 1990, terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross told PolitiFact in 2016. “But we viewed that — quite rightly — as an act of aggression under the UN Charter.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The fact is that Brazilians are allowed to leave, while Venezuelans face restrictions. But this could change at any time,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak on the matter.</p><p>The head of Brazil’s Federal Police also announced the temporary closure, and the governor of the state of Roraima told Reuters that the border had been reopened after the brief closure.</p><p>Brazil’s government said it is monitoring the border and has sent military personnel to the region to bolster security.</p><p>“The Minister of Defense indicated that there is no abnormal activity on the border between Brazil and Venezuela, which will continue to be monitored, and that he is in contact with the Governor of Roraima,” read a statement from Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Venezuelans make up <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/brazil-venezuelan-migrants-find-refuge-in-forest-shantytown\">Brazil’s largest foreign population</a>, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The state of Roraima alone is home to 77,563 immigrants from the country. In all, some 8 million Venezuelans have fled their homes in the past decade, with more than 6 million resettling in other Latin American countries.</p><p>“I think it’s very possible that there will be an exodus of Venezuelans to Brazil, and, in fact, we are already seeing concrete signs of it,” Jessica Leon Cedeno, a Venezuelan journalist who lives in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Millions of people have left the country in search of better living conditions and opportunities.”</p><h2 id=\"lula-says-us-attacks-could-destabilise-the-region\">Lula says US attacks could ‘destabilise’ the region</h2><p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump’s actions <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-bombs-venezuela-us-captures-maduro-all-that-we-know\">inside Venezuela</a> were “unacceptable”.</p><p>“The bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” wrote Lula on X. “These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela’s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”</p><p>Brazil’s leader has urged restraint for months amid an increased US <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">military buildup</a> off Venezuela’s coast.</p><p>Analysts worry that Maduro’s removal could plunge Venezuela into chaos, potentially resulting in another wave of <a href=\"/news/2022/8/31/over-6-8-million-have-left-venezuela-since-2014-and-exodus-grows\">mass migration</a>, as it witnessed in 2019 after a failed attempt to remove Maduro.</p><p>Joao Carlos Jarochinski Silva, a professor of international relations at the Federal University of Roraima, said that a potential wave of migration would depend on multiple factors, including whether Washington continues its military campaign inside the country and whether what remains of Maduro’s regime will put up a fight.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What is the resilience capacity of Chavismo within Venezuela?” Jarochinski Silva said, referring to the political movement named after former President Hugo Chavez. “This could have consequences that are truly worrying, but given the current scenario, there is no context of fear.”</p><p>He added that Trump has so far focused on applauding his military’s action inside Venezuela and has not addressed key humanitarian concerns. Earlier this year, the Trump administration cut funding to the US government’s main agency for foreign aid, USAID, which heavily affected Venezuela’s neighbours, Brazil and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/colombia-braces-with-alarm-after-maduros-removal-in-venezuela-by-us\">Colombia</a>.</p><p>“The United States has been cutting humanitarian resources lately,” he said, adding that there will be consequences to the US military actions inside the country. “For example, refugees, other people who may be affected by this.

We are ready to defend our natural resources, which should be for national development,” she added.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Latin America editor Lucia Newman, reporting from Chile, said that, if Rodriguez is “on board” with the US plan for Venezuela, as Trump and Rubio have suggested, “she certainly didn’t sound like it” during her address.</p><p>“She sounded like her typical, fiery self, very much on the side of… Maduro, demanding that he be released and saying that Venezuela would not be a colony of the United States,” Newman said.</p><p>The events of the day have brought “a rollercoaster of emotions” to “Venezuelans both inside and outside of the country”, said Caracas-based journalist Sissi de Flaviis.</p><p>“When we first heard that Maduro was taken out of the country, there was a mix of reactions,” she said. “A lot of people couldn’t believe it. Other people were pretty much celebrating. Other people were kind of on standby, waiting.”</p><p>After Trump’s news conference announcing US plans to run Venezuela, “there’s been a shock”, de Flaviis added.</p><p>“People are a bit concerned about what this will actually mean for us, what this will mean for the government and who is going to lead us in the next few days, months and years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Harlan Ullman, a former US naval officer, told Al Jazeera that “the notion of America taking over Venezuela is going to explode in our faces”.</p><p>“When Trump says, ‘We’re going to run the country’: We’re not capable of running America, how are we going to be able to run Venezuela?” Ullman said.</p><p>“I do not believe that we have a plan for dealing with Venezuela,” he added. “A country is extraordinarily complex. We lack the knowledge, understanding and all the logistics to do this.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism,” Cotton wrote on X.</p><p>He said he spoke with Rubio, the US secretary of state, who confirmed that Maduro was in US custody and “will face justice for his crimes against our citizens”.</p><p>Cotton then appeared to threaten the interim government in Venezuela, saying it needed to “decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world”.</p><p>“I urge them to choose wisely,” Cotton wrote.</p><h2 id=\"republican-senator-mike-lee\">Republican Senator Mike Lee</h2><p>Lee, who had been critical of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Venezuela, said Rubio told him that Maduro had been arrested “to stand trial on criminal charges” in the US.</p><p>Lee also wrote on social media that Rubio told him the US military action in Venezuela “was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant”.</p><p>“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” Lee said in a post on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"republican-senator-rick-scott\">Republican Senator Rick Scott</h2><p>The Florida senator said “the strikes against and capture of narco-terrorist Nicolas Maduro” were conducted “with a level of professionalism and precision”.</p><p>He said they also send a message to the world that Trump “is a man of his word, and the United States will not tolerate terrorists.”</p><p>“Maduro was indicted in a U.S. Court and was told to stop sending drugs into our country to kill our kids and grandkids, but he refused.

In December, it ordered Colombians to stay home and bombed state installations across the country, an action it described as a response to US aggression.</p><p>The Colombian government has ramped up security measures in anticipation of possible retaliatory action by the ELN following Maduro’s removal.</p><p>“All capabilities of the security forces have been activated to protect the population, strategic assets, embassies, military and police units, among others, as well as to prevent any attempted terrorist action by transnational criminal organisations, such as the ELN cartel,” read a statement on Saturday morning issued by Colombia’s Ministry of Defence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mass-influx-of-refugees\">‘Mass influx of refugees’</h2><p>In addition to fears of increased violence, Colombia also stands to bear the brunt of any migration crisis initiated by a conflict in Venezuela.</p><p>In an X post on Saturday morning, Petro said the government had bolstered humanitarian provisions on its eastern border, writing, “all the assistance resources at our disposal have been deployed in case of a mass influx of refugees.”</p><p>To date, Colombia has received the highest number of Venezuelan refugees worldwide, with nearly 3 million of the approximately 8 million people who have left the country settling in Colombia.</p><p>The previous wave of mass migration in 2019 – which followed opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/venezuelan-opposition-leader-guaido-expelled-from-colombia\">Juan Guaido’s failed attempt to overthrow Maduro</a> – required a massive humanitarian operation to house, feed, and provide medical attention to refugees.</p><p>Such an operation is likely to prove even more challenging now, with Colombia losing roughly 70 percent of all humanitarian funds after the Trump administration shuttered its USAID programmes in the country last year.</p><p>“There is a real possibility of short-term population movement, both precautionary and forced, especially if instability, reprisals, or power vacuums emerge,” said Juan Carlos Viloria, a leader of the Venezuelan diaspora in Colombia.</p><p>“Colombia must prepare proactively by activating protection mechanisms, humanitarian corridors, and asylum systems, not only to respond to potential arrivals, but to prevent chaos and human rights violations at the border,” added Viloria.</p><h2 id=\"a-further-collapse-in-us-colombia-relations\">A further collapse in US-Colombia relations</h2><p>Analysts say Maduro’s removal raises difficult questions for Petro, who has been engaged in a war of words with Trump since the US president assumed office last year.</p><p>The Colombian leader drew Trump’s ire in recent months when he condemned Washington’s military buildup in the Caribbean and alleged a Colombian fisherman had been killed in territorial waters. In response, the White House sanctioned Petro, with Trump calling him a “thug” and “an illegal drug dealer”.</p><p>“Petro is irascible at the moment because he sees Trump and his threats no longer as empty, but as real possibilities,” said Sergio Guzman, Director at Colombia Risk Analysis, a Bogota-based security consultancy.</p><p>Indeed, Trump has on multiple occasions floated military strikes against drug production sites in Colombia. However, experts say it is unlikely the White House would take unilateral action given their historic cooperation with Colombian security forces.</p><p>Despite Petro condemning Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, he previously called Maduro a “dictator” and joined the US and other nations in refusing to recognise the strongman’s fraudulent re-election as president in 2024.</p><p>Rather than supporting Maduro, the Colombian leader has positioned himself as a defender of national sovereignty and international law.</p><p>On Saturday, Petro called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which Colombia joined as a temporary member just days ago.</p><p>“Colombia reaffirms its unconditional commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,” wrote the president in an X post.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><em>This story has been published in conjunction with Latin America Reports.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But, hey, it’s all in a day’s work for an administration that couldn’t care less about legal justification for its behaviour, much less human rights and other such silly concepts.</p><p>The US has also hijacked various oil tankers, with Trump unleashing blissfully ludicrous <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/20/venezuela-oil-nationalization-expropriation/\">allegations</a> that Venezuela is guilty of stealing US oil, land and assets.</p><p>This latest bout of US aggression comes on the heels of decades of US sanctions, which have crippled the Venezuelan economy and which have constituted a <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/12/the-us-is-already-at-war-with-venezuela\">form of warfare</a> unto themselves. As of 2020, former UN special rapporteur Alfred de Zayas <a href=\"https://venezuelanalysis.com/sanctions-kill/\">calculated</a> that 100,000 Venezuelans had already perished as a direct result of coercive economic measures.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/2007396201600258094\">According to</a> a post earlier today on X by US Senator Mike Lee of Utah, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed him that Maduro has been arrested to stand trial in the United States on criminal charges, and that the air strikes on Venezuela were necessary to protect the US military personnel who were carrying out the arrest warrant.</p><p>And while the Trump administration has converted Maduro into the latest international bogeyman and existential menace, this narrative leaves much to be desired. Objectively speaking, the US itself is guilty of far more extensive and comprehensively criminal behaviour than the bumbling Maduro.</p><p>Ditto for top US ally Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been repeatedly feted by US presidents over the past two-plus years of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/two-years-of-israels-genocide-in-gaza-by-the-numbers\">Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip</a>.</p><p>Of course, no one in Washington would ever suggest that Netanyahu be bundled off to stand trial in the US, which prefers instead to fling billions of dollars at the Israeli military in order to aid in the mass slaughter.</p><p>Oil-rich Venezuela, on the other hand, has long been a thorn in the side of the US empire, starting with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, who propagated such <a href=\"/opinions/2019/1/2/how-capitalism-is-killing-us\">dangerous anti-capitalist ideas</a> as universal healthcare.</p><p>Now, the Trump administration accuses Maduro of serving as a ringleader for “narcoterrorism”, which would be laughable if it didn’t result in such large-scale destruction and the flagrant violation of international law.</p><p>Obviously, Trump is hardly the only US president in recent history to engage in blatantly illegal action abroad – although he does manage to add a certain dramatic layer of dementedness to everything he does.</p><p>One recalls the case of the late Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, who remained on the CIA payroll for years, despite the US government’s full knowledge of his drug trafficking activities.</p><p>When Noriega ceased to be regarded as a valuable anti-communist ally in the 1980s, the US turned on him, spontaneously converting him into the face of evil.</p><p>In December 1989, President George H W Bush launched a <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/24/letter-from-panamas-little-hiroshima\">patently insane attack</a> on Panama, where up to several thousand civilians were killed in the impoverished Panama City neighbourhood of El Chorrillo.</p><p>Noriega was eventually captured by US forces in 1990, after his brief stay at the Vatican embassy in the Panamanian capital was rendered unsustainable by the US tanks parked outside. The armoured vehicles’ speakers subjected him to a continuous playlist of musical torture, including singer Jon Bon Jovi’s song Wanted Dead or Alive and Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA.</p><p>The Panamanian was carted off to stand trial in – where else? – the United States, where the government apparently detected zero hypocrisy in holding its former buddy to judicial account for activities it had previously signed off on.</p><p>There was also the war on Iraq in 2003, which was waged on the basis of lies fabricated by Bush’s son President George W Bush and his administration. The US invaded the country, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction. Those were naturally nowhere to be found, but the US army nonetheless pulverised various parts of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.</p><p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured, tried and summarily executed by the US-appointed interim Iraqi government.</p><p>Indeed, wherever the US has intervened militarily, nothing good has tended to follow. This latest attack on Venezuela will hardly be the end of the story, contrary to Senator Lee’s contention that Rubio anticipates “no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.</p><p>Rest assured that, as US impunity rages on, the deadly spectacle is far from over.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
