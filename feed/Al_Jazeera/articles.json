But just metres (yards) away from where Gvili’s remains were carefully extracted, a very different, gruesome reality persists.</p><p>According to the National Committee for Missing Persons, more than 10,000 Palestinians remain entombed under the rubble of Gaza, decomposing in silence, lost and without identity.</p><p>Families grieve without closure for their missing, presumed dead loved ones.</p><p>There are no explosive robots clearing the way for them, no forensic teams flying in to identify them, and no global outcry demanding their recovery.</p><p>International media do not rush to break news about them.</p><p>The digging up of the al-Batsh cemetery in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood has become a visceral symbol of a deadly double standard: A world where one Israeli corpse commands the attention of an army, while thousands of Palestinian bodies are treated as part of the decimated, apocalyptic landscape.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267334\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267334\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267334\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Death-toll-tracker-1769440823.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-jan 26, 2026_Death toll tracker-1765554400\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4267334\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-kill-zone-around-the-graves\">A ‘kill zone’ around the graves</h2><p>Khamis al-Rifi, a journalist in Gaza who reported from the vicinity of the incursion, detailed the sheer scale of force used to isolate the area.</p><p>“It started with <a href=\"/features/2025/10/16/israels-exploding-robots-still-terrorise-gaza-neighbourhoods\">exploding robots</a> and air strikes … clearing the path for the tanks,” al-Rifi told Al Jazeera. He explained that approaching the cemetery was impossible, as tanks enforced a deadly perimeter, firing at anything that moved.</p><p>From his position near the “Yellow Line”, Israel’s self-proclaimed buffer zone inside Gaza, al-Rifi described a “wall of fire” created by artillery and helicopters to protect the engineering units. Inside this sealed zone, witnesses and video footage obtained later revealed that the forces spent two days churning up the earth.</p><p>“They dug up about 200 graves,” al-Rifi said. “They pulled the martyrs out, tested them one by one until they found the [Israeli] body.”</p><p>The disparity was most evident in the aftermath. Gvili’s remains were airlifted for dignified burial in Israel. The Palestinian bodies, however, were left to the mercy of bulldozers.</p><p>“When citizens went to the area [after the withdrawal], they found the martyrs put back randomly … covered with sand by the bulldozers,” al-Rifi said. “Some bodies were still visible on the surface.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-world-s-largest-graveyard\">‘The world’s largest graveyard’</h2><p>While Israel used satellite technology and DNA labs to close the chapter on its missing policeman, Palestinian families are denied even the basic machinery to dig.</p><p>Alaa al-Din al-Aklouk, spokesperson for the National Committee for Missing Persons, stated last November that Gaza has become “the world’s largest graveyard”.</p><p>“These martyrs are buried under the rubble of their homes … without their last dignity being preserved,” al-Aklouk said. He highlighted the “fatal injustice” of an international community that mobilised resources for Israeli captives while blocking the entry of heavy civil defence equipment needed to recover Palestinian victims.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera on Monday that while he respects the right of any family to bury their dead, the contrast is inescapable. “The lack of equal treatment, the lack of respect to Palestinians as equal human beings, is really astonishing,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"a-cost-paid-in-blood\">A cost paid in blood</h2><p>The dark irony of this Israeli mission is that it created new victims. On Tuesday morning, as residents approached the desecrated cemetery to check on the graves of their loved ones, Israeli fire struck again.</p><p>“Four martyrs fell in the area this morning,” al-Rifi said, noting that one of them, his relative Youssef al-Rifi, had simply gone to inspect the destruction left behind.</p><p>In its quest to close a raw chapter that has shaken its national psyche since October 2023, Israel opened new graves in 2026. The operation serves as a grim microcosm of the entire war: The sanctity of one side’s life and death is upheld at the absolute expense of the other’s.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS,” ICE said in a January 9 statement.</p><p>The agency repeatedly highlighted Lunas Campos’s criminal record.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The authorities later changed their own story, claiming that Lunas Campos tried to kill himself.</p><p>“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS’s McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”</p><p>But an autopsy report found that Linas Campos was killed by someone.</p><p>“Based on the investigative and examination findings, it is my opinion that the cause of death is asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,” Adam Gonzalez, deputy medical examiner for El Paso County, said in the report, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>“The manner of death is homicide.”</p><p>Lunas Campos’ three children have filed a legal petition aiming to block the deportation of any detainees who may have witnessed the incident, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit.</p><p>“According to an eyewitness to Mr Lunas Campos’s death, guards at the facility choked him to death,” the petition said.</p><h2 id=\"victor-manuel-diaz\">Victor Manuel Diaz</h2><p>Immigration authorities arrested Nicaraguan immigrant Victor Manuel Diaz on January 6 in Minneapolis as part of their <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/who-is-greg-bovino-the-face-of-trumps-minneapolis-crackdown\">immigration crackdown</a> in Minnesota. Eight days later, he died in ICE custody at Camp East Montana in Texas.</p><p>“Contract security staff found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room,” ICE said in a statement. “He died of a presumed suicide; however, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.”</p><p>But Diaz’s family is questioning the government’s story.</p><p>“I don’t believe he took his life,” Diaz’s brother Yorlan told ABC News. “He was not a criminal; he was looking for a better life and he wanted to help our mother.”</p><p>The family has also raised concerns over how the authorities are handling the investigation.</p><p>According to several US media reports, Diaz’s body was transferred to William Beaumont Army Medical Center for an autopsy, instead of the county medical examiner.</p><p>“This, taking of the body and doing the autopsy report and not letting the medical examiner do it? You’re then having the fox guarding the henhouse,” Randall Kallinen, the family’s lawyer, told the local outlet KTSM.</p><p>“It was with the federal government where the individual was staying and where he was killed. And now it’s the federal government who is controlling the investigation and the information included in the autopsy report.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"parady-la\">Parady La</h2><p>Cambodian immigrant Parady La, 46, had been in the US since 1981. He had come to the US legally as a child but lost his Green Card due to criminal convictions.</p><p>Immigration authorities arrested him on January 6 and sent him to the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Philadelphia, where he started experiencing “severe drug withdrawal” symptoms, according to ICE.</p><p>“The next day, La was found unresponsive in his cell. FDC officers immediately administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance,” the US agency said.</p><p>NARCAN is a drug used for people experiencing a drug overdose, not withdrawals.</p><p>La was transferred to a hospital and diagnosed with “anoxic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, shock and multiple organ failures” before he died, ICE said.</p><p>But La’s family is voicing scepticism about the level of care he received.</p><p>His nephew, Michael La, said ICE’s version of the events leading to his uncle’s death “didn’t add up”.</p><p>“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” Michael La told local public radio WHYY. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”</p><h2 id=\"luis-beltran-yanez-cruz\">Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz</h2><p>A father of three, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, had been in the US for more than 20 years when ICE picked him up in New Jersey in November and transferred him to a detention centre in California.</p><p>He died on January 6 of “heart-related health issues” after being transferred to a hospital.</p><p>But his family has said that he was feeling ill for weeks and was only given pain medication.</p><p>“As a father, he was an excellent dad,” his daughter, Josselyn Yanez, told the news website northjersey.com. “As a grandfather, the best grandfather of all.

The conclusion of his protest brings an end to a rolling hunger strike that began in November.</p><p>Khalid is among eight remand prisoners affiliated with Palestine Action who participated in the action, which is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in UK history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands. Khalid was the last to keep refusing food after the others <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/prison-rights-elbits-loss-how-the-palestine-action-hunger-strike-won\">ended</a> their protest earlier this month, one of whom had refused food for 73 days.</p><p>“At the hospital, in the afternoon, I was given a choice between treatment and likely death within the next 24 hours due to kidney failure, acute liver failure, and potential cardiac arrest,” said Khalid, in a statement shared by the Prisoners for Palestine group, which is supporting the collective.</p><p>He said that he decided to end his protest because, “I am too strong, too loud, too powerful … and there is so much we can do to affect change.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244170\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244170\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244170\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/s2-1768556877.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Jon Cink, Kamran Ahmed, Qesser Zuhrah, Lewie, Teuta Hoxha and Umer Khalid\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244170\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Top row from left: Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Jon Cink and Kamran Ahmed.

They deny the charges against them.</p><p>The incident, which was claimed by Palestine Action, caused millions of pounds worth of damage, according to the British government, which later proscribed the protest group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Khalid had called for immediate bail; an end to alleged censorship in prison, with the authorities accused of withholding mails, calls and books and denying visitation rights; an inquiry into alleged involvement of the UK in Israeli military operations in Gaza; and the release of surveillance footage from Royal Air Force (RAF) spy flights that flew over Gaza on April 1, 2024, when British aid workers were killed in an Israeli attack.</p><p>A Prison Service spokesperson told Al Jazeera, “We do not recognise these claims. All prisoners are subject to the same national rules on post and communications, and legal visits and access to legal paperwork are never withheld from prisoners.”</p><p>John McDonnell, a Labour MP, said the end of Khalid’s strike brought a sense of relief.</p><p class=\"p2\">“We were fearful for Umer’s health and life,” he said. “It demonstrated to me the absolute courage that he’s displayed along with others, based upon a commitment to the principles that he’s advocated in terms of peace and justice to the Palestinian people.</p><p class=\"p2\">“I pay tribute to them, but I fear for their ongoing health – being on hunger strike for this long can have permanent features.”</p><p>In recent days, dozens of demonstrators have gathered at the gates of Wormwood Scrubs, calling on the government to engage with Khalid’s demands.</p><p>On Saturday, police arrested 86 protesters, saying they allegedly blocked prison staff from entering and leaving the facility. Some “managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building”, the police said.</p><p>Described by friends and family as gentle, determined and a devout Muslim, Khalid told Al Jazeera last week that his strike “reflects the severity of my demands”.</p><p>Khalid’s trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he would have spent a year and a half in prison – far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

NABU does not report anything to the public because it says it needs time to work on charges against top-level people allegedly involved in the corruption scheme.</p><p>From the investigation’s perspective, this is the correct method because they don’t want to be accused of politicising this. They want to get this evidence, and this is not a very easy process.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Have you seen any concrete legal or institutional developments?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> Unfortunately not a lot.</p><p>There were primary charges made against the people allegedly involved in the scheme.</p><p>We know that Mindich, for instance, was charged in absentia because he’s not in the country. [Timur Mindich is the suspected mastermind of the Energoatom scheme.]</p><p>Most of the hearings were public, … so everything we know about this theme comes from these court hearings. Nothing else has happened.</p><p>So we anticipate in a few weeks there will be a renewal of this court hearing.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Who, if anyone, is now facing real legal jeopardy rather than just political consequences?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> We think the former minister of justice, German Galushchenko, could still be charged as he appears on recordings and there are indications he is part of this.</p><p>We expect he will be charged in the next few months or that the courts will find nothing against him.</p><p>We understand that it usually takes time to obtain all the testimonies and bank records.</p><p>For instance, just to compare, Rostyslav Shurma, former deputy chief of staff in the Presidential Office, was charged with involvement in a corruption scheme in the energy sector.</p><p>This process began in 2022, and we knew he had been dismissed from his position because of rumours of his involvement in 2024. Only now has he been charged because investigators gathered enough evidence. So we understand it takes a long time to get formal charges against people of such power.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: So this could take years?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> At least months.</p><p>On the other hand, there is significant pressure on the NABU to complete its work more quickly due to public interest.</p><p>There is this investigative logic, of course, because it wants to gather as much as possible, yeah, but there is a lot of pressure not just from politicians but from the general public.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: How independent are the NABU and SAPO in practice today?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> They really show they don’t have any party allegiance and are independent. I think, at least at the moment, that is for sure.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Has President Zelenskyy demonstrated political will beyond personnel changes?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> I think he wanted to show that he’s doing everything he can from his side.</p><p>He has also tried to distance himself from the scandal, saying he is independent and not involved.</p><p>He wants to show that he lets the agencies do their work.</p><p>This is his message. Otherwise, he’s busy with everything related to [US President Donald] Trump, the war and negotiations.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Does the removal of senior figures risk that it becomes a politically closed chapter even if the cases remain unresolved?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> I think the bigger question is for Ukrainians. OK, we just stopped one scheme involving an energy company, but if you change the people [from those implicated in the corruption scandal], and new people come, will those schemes just return?</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What message do you feel that the current situation sends to Western partners and donors?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> First of all, despite the war, corruption-related schemes remain in Ukraine. Unfortunately, even in the event of a war, the country can’t stop bad actors from benefitting from it.</p><p>But it also shows that systematic changes are happening in Ukraine at the same time, that change is possible. There are people and groups who are acting in good faith and capable of prosecuting and preventing corruption.</p><p>There is a huge push from people across Ukraine that actually generates the political will to do something and create change.</p><p>Criminal justice is a slow process.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: The energy sector is being targeted by Russia and people are suffering from a lack of heating. Does the corruption scandal, therefore, anger Ukrainians further?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> We are mad at Russia because we don’t have heating or electricity right now, but people are also asking questions about what the people in charge of our energy sector were busy with. It looks like they are not doing what they were mandated to do.</p><p>They didn’t act or consider the public benefit because they were busy stealing money.</p><p>So it’s beyond the term of political responsibility, which would mean firing someone from their position of power. Now people demand justice.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Where does the money seized in these anticorruption cases eventually end up?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> It goes to the state budget, but it also goes directly to the military.</p><p>In recent years, the state developed a scheme that collected money through plea bargaining, where the convict pays a certain amount to the state budget, showing goodwill by paying Ukrainian charity funds working directly with the military.</p><p>In recent years, a few hundred million dollars have been sent to the Ukrainian armed forces this way.</p><p><em><strong>Note: This interview was edited for clarity and brevity. </strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Over the past year, United States President Donald Trump has pursued “peace-making” all across the world. A prominent feature of his efforts has been the belief that economic threats or rewards can resolve conflicts. Most recently, his administration has put forward economic development plans as part of peace mediation for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Syria.</p><p>While some may see Trump’s “business” approach to “peace-making” as unique, it is not. The flawed conviction that economic development can resolve conflicts has been a regular feature of Western neoliberal peace initiatives in the Global South for the past few decades.</p><p>Occupied Palestine is a good example.</p><p>In the early 1990s, when the “peace process” was initiated, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres started advocating for “economic peace” as part of it. He sold his vision of the “New Middle East” as a new regional order that would guarantee security and economic development for all.</p><p>The project aimed to place Israel at the economic centre of the Arab world through regional infrastructure — transport, energy and industrial zones. Peres’s solution for the “Israeli-Palestinian conflict” was Palestinian economic integration. The Palestinians were promised jobs, investment, and improved living standards.</p><p>His argument was that economic development and cooperation would foster stability and mutual interest between Israelis and Palestinians. But that did not happen. Instead, as the occupation continued to entrench itself after the US-brokered Oslo Accords and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA), anger in the Palestinian streets grew and eventually led to the outbreak of the second Intifada.</p><p>This neoliberal approach was tested again by the Quartet – consisting of the United Nations, the European Union, the US and Russia – and its envoy Tony Blair in 2007. By then, the Palestinian economy had collapsed, losing 40 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in eight years and plunging 65 percent of the population into poverty.</p><p>Blair’s “solution” was to propose 10 “quick impact” economic projects and fundraise for them in the West. This went hand-in-hand with the policies of then-Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, in what came to be known as “Fayyadism”.</p><p>Fayyadism was sold to Palestinians as a pathway to statehood through institution-building and economic growth. Fayyad focused on generating short-term economic gains in the occupied West Bank while simultaneously rebuilding the Palestinian security apparatus to meet Israeli security demands.</p><p>This model of economic peace never addressed the root cause of Palestinian economic stagnation: the Israeli occupation. Even the World Bank warned that investment without a political settlement ending Israeli control would fail in the medium and long term. Yet the approach persisted.</p><p>There were Palestinians who benefitted from it, but they were not common Palestinians. They were a narrow elite: security officials who gained privileged access to financial institutions, contractors tied to Israeli markets, and a handful of large investors. For the wider population, living standards remained precarious.</p><p>Rather than preparing Palestinians for statehood, Fayyadism replaced liberation with management, sovereignty with security coordination, and collective rights with individual consumption.</p><p>This economic approach to conflict resolution merely gave Israel time to entrench its colonial enterprise by expanding its settlements on Palestinian land.</p><p>The latest economic plan for Gaza, presented by Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, is unlikely to bring economic prosperity to the Palestinians either. The project reflects two deeply contradictory dynamics: it foregrounds opportunities for investment and profit for global and regional oligarchies while systematically ignoring the fundamental national and human rights of the Palestinian people.</p><p>Security is framed exclusively around the needs of the occupying power, while Palestinians are compartmentalised, securitised, and surveilled — reduced to a depoliticised labour force stripped of social and national identity.</p><p>This approach views people as individuals rather than as nations or historically established communities. Under this logic, individuals are expected to acquiesce to oppression and dispossession once they obtain jobs and improve their living standards.</p><p>These strategies are failing to build peace not just in Palestine.</p><p>In the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the US has proposed expanding the demilitarised zone and converting it into a joint economic zone, featuring a ski resort. The US approach seems designed not only to pressure Syria to relinquish its sovereign rights over the territory, but also to recast it as a security project in ways that primarily benefit Israel. Under this framework, the US would act as the security guarantor. Its close alliance with Israel, however, puts its impartiality and true intentions in doubt.</p><p>In Ukraine, the US has proposed a free economic zone in parts of the Donbas region, from which the Ukrainian army would have to withdraw. This would allow Moscow to expand its influence without direct military confrontation, creating a buffer zone favourable to Russian security interests.</p><p>The Donbas has historically been one of Ukraine’s industrial bases, and transforming it into a free economic zone would deprive Ukraine of a critical economic resource. There are also no guarantees that the Russian army would not simply advance after the Ukrainian withdrawal and take the whole region.</p><p>These neoliberal “solutions” to the conflicts in Gaza, the Donbas and the Golan Heights are doomed to fail just like the economically-driven peace initiatives of the 1990s and 2000s in occupied Palestine.</p><p>The main problem is that the US cannot really provide credible guarantees that the areas would remain stable, so investors can secure returns on their investments. That is because no solid political settlement would be in place, given the fact that these proposals ignore the political, cultural and most importantly, national interests of the people living in these regions. As a result, no serious or independent investor would commit capital to such an arrangement.</p><p>Nations are not made up of consumers or labourers; they are made up of people with a common identity and national aspirations.</p><p>Economic incentives should follow, not precede, a political resolution that secures the self-determination of indigenous peoples. Any conflict-resolution framework that ignores collective rights and international law is therefore bound to fail. Political settlements must prioritise these rights, a requirement that stands in direct opposition to the logic of neoliberalism.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

If they’re lucky.”</p><p>In his X post, Blatter, quoting Pieth, added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”</p><p>The 89-year-old was president of the football governing body from 1998 to 2015, when he resigned following a corruption investigation.</p><p>The international football community’s concerns about the US stem from Trump’s expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protesters in US cities, particularly Minneapolis.</p><p>Two weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top football countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and the Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas.

We need to have this discussion.”</p><p>Gottlich, who has called for the defence of values, is likely to meet resistance to calls for a boycott from German federation chief Bernd Neuendorf and FIFA President Gianni Infantino.</p><p>“Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we’re completely apolitical? That’s something that really, really, really bothers me,” Gottlich said of the German federation’s opposition to the 2022 World Cup host.</p><p>Germany flopped at that tournament, and the coach who took over afterwards said he wanted no more political distractions.</p><p>“As organisations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Gottlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks, when people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”</p><p>Hamburg-based football club St Pauli is near the city’s red-light district and known for mixing sport with politics, particularly its left-wing stance. The club’s famous pirate skull-and-crossbones symbol was first carried by squatters who lived nearby and later popularised by fans who identified as punks.</p><p>Gottlich dismissed the suggestion that a boycott would hurt St Pauli’s national team players, Australia’s Jackson Irvine and Connor Metcalfe, and Japan’s Joel Chima Fujita.</p><p>“The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"boycott-calls-grow-from-europe-to-africa\">Boycott calls grow from Europe to Africa</h2><p>South Africa’s main opposition leader, Julius Malema, has echoed calls for the boycott, calling on the South African Football Association (SAFA) and the national football team to withdraw from the tournament.</p><p>“Bafana Bafana must withdraw, SAFA must take a decision to withdraw from anything to do with the World Cup that is taking place in America,” Malema said in an interview last week.</p><p>He drew parallels between the Trump administration and the decades of apartheid in South Africa, saying the US is “disrespecting international law” as South Africa was during the apartheid era.</p><p>“A lot of countries refused to trade with South Africa because it was violating human rights and international law, so we must boycott the World Cup in America and anything that has got to do with America,” he said.</p><p>“We cannot sit back and allow a person to destabilise the world, and it becomes business as usual. That is an act of cowardice.”</p><p>British lawmakers in the House of Commons have also called on England and Scotland to pull out of the tournament after Trump’s recent threats to annex Greenland.</p><p>They urged the United Kingdom’s leadership to “embarrass Trump” by boycotting the World Cup.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, more than 100,000 fans have signed an online petition urging the national team to boycott the tournament.

When he expressed his reluctance to kill, the recruiter said his skills as an electrician made him an ideal candidate for an electronic warfare or drone unit and not combat.</p><p>Miajee was taken in January 2025 to a military camp in the captured city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine. He showed the camp commander documents describing his experience and explained that his recruiter had instructed him to ask for “electrical work”.</p><p>“The commander told me, ‘You have been made to sign a contract to join the battalion. You cannot do any other work here. You have been deceived,'” he said after returning to his village of Munshiganj.</p><p>Miajee said he was beaten with shovels, handcuffed and tortured in a cramped basement cell and held there every time he refused to carry out an order or made a mistake. Because of language barriers, for example, “if they told us to go to the right and we went to the left, they would beat us severely,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268402\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268402\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268402\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26026620526228-1769504088.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Russia war\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mohammed Siraj holds a photograph of his 20-year-old son, Sajjad, who was killed after being taken to fight in Russia, at his home in Lakshmipur, Bangladesh [Rajib Dhar/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Neither the Russian Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs nor the Bangladeshi government responded to a list of questions, the AP report said.</p><p>The families of some of these men filed a complaint with police in Bangladesh and travelled on three occasions to the capital, Dhaka, to pressure the government to investigate.</p><p>Salma Akdar has not heard from her husband since March 26.

We have never done this before,'” his wife said.</p><p>For two months after that, he was offline. He reappeared briefly to explain they were being forced to fight in the war. Russian commanders “told him that if he did not go, they would detain him, shoot him, stop providing food”, she said.</p><p>Families in the village confronted the recruiting agent, demanding to know why their loved ones were being trained for war.

In an interview last year, Bovino’s sister, Natalie, recalled how strongly he reacted to the television series The Border, which focused on the US Border Patrol.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">“Greg was so psyched because he loved the toughness and the values of all these old-timers,” she said, according to a report by the British outlet The Times of London.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">“Then he watched it, and the Border Patrol person was a criminal. Greg came home totally pissed about it. Since then, he was like, ‘Dude, I want to do Border Patrol.’”</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">According to a report by the Chicago Sun-Times, Bovino’s father, Mike Bovino, was involved in a fatal crash in 1981, killing a young woman after “drunkenly crashing his truck head-on into her car.”</p><p>Court records show the judge ordered Mike Bovino to serve time in state prison “for treatment of his alcoholism”. He was jailed for four months, and according to the report, the lawsuit forced the sale of the family’s bar and the property it sat on. Greg’s mother, Betty Bovino, later filed for divorce, gaining custody of the couple’s three children as part of the settlement.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Bovino joined the US Border Patrol in 1996, beginning his career in El Paso, Texas, a key hub for border enforcement.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Over the next decade, he moved into senior leadership roles across the southwest, including Arizona and California, and New Orleans in the southeast.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">More recently, Bovino has become one of the most recognisable faces of US immigration enforcement, following Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"was-bovino-fired\" data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Was Bovino fired?</h2><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied rumours that Bovino had been fired<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-ylk=\"slk:,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">,</a>  saying in a post on X that: “Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-is-tom-homan-trump-s-border-czar-heading-to-minneapolis\" data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Who is Tom Homan, Trump’s border tsar heading to Minneapolis?</h2><p>Nevertheless, Bovino is now no longer leading ICE’s activities in Minnesota.</p><p>Instead, US President Donald Trump has deputed Tom Homan, his so-called “border czar”, to take charge of the crackdown on immigrants in the midwestern state.</p><p>A longtime US immigration official with more than four decades of experience in border and immigration enforcement, the 64-year-old Homan became a key figure during the Barack Obama administration, leading ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations unit. That branch of ICE is responsible for finding people with deportation orders and removing them from the country.</p><p>In 2015, when Obama was president, Homan received a Presidential Rank Award, one of the highest honours for senior civil servants.</p><p>According to reports, he was at his retirement party in January 2017 when Trump’s then-choice for homeland security secretary, John Kelly, asked him to stay at ICE. Homan accepted, after taking a weekend to think about the offer, and became a leading figure in the first Trump administration through four tumultuous years.</p><p>Under Obama, the US carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept – until 2025. Deportations under the first Trump administration never topped 350,000. But in December 2025, the DHS announced that the Trump administration had deported more than 600,000 people in his first 11 months back in office, while another 2.5 million people had “self-deported” – voluntarily fled the country. As a result, the US, for the first time in decades, had net negative immigration in 2025.</p><p>Homan, who Trump hired to oversee border security in his second term, has been central to the administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Now, with the Minnesota appointment, the ambit of his role has been widened – to controversial ICE actions far from the southern border.</p><p>“I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” Trump wrote on Monday on Truth Social. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” the president added.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-is-homan-s-stance-on-immigration\">What is Homan’s stance on immigration?</h2><p data-start=\"81\" data-end=\"282\">When he was appointed border tsar, Homan was widely viewed as a figure who not only shared Trump’s hardline views but also brought extensive hands-on experience in immigration enforcement and policy.</p><p data-start=\"81\" data-end=\"282\">Homan portrays undocumented immigration as black and white and has made no apologies for Trump’s policy of targeting everyone in the country without proper documentation.</p><p>“If you’re in the country illegally, you should be concerned,” he said in a 2018 interview with The Associated Press news agency. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be. Just like if I go speeding down the highway, are you worried about getting a ticket? If you lie on your taxes, are you worried about an audit?”</p><p>But Homan himself has been accused of illegalities – in September 2024, he was reportedly recorded accepting a bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. Homan and the Trump White House have denied the accusations, but the administration has so far not explained what happened to the cash.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
