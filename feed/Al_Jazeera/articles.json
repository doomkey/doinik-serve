He required surgery and spent days in hospital. “I stood in front of the mob believing they knew me and would not attack me,” he said. “They broke my hand – but more than that, they broke my heart and my trust. I had never experienced anything like this before.”</p><h2 id=\"no-proper-justice\">‘No proper justice’</h2><p>Hindus form about 8 percent of the population in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, with Christians, Buddhists and other minorities present in much smaller numbers.</p><p>Through Bangladesh’s history, say experts and minority leaders, political actors and their supporters have at times exploited religious identities to intimidate voters or settle local disputes, leading to targeted attacks on minority homes, places of worship and individuals.</p><p>“If you look at elections in the past – even during the Awami League’s tenure – oppression and persecution of minorities never truly stopped,” Manindra Kumar Nath, acting general secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), an umbrella group representing these minority communities, told Al Jazeera. “It happened before elections and after elections.” But what made things worse, he said, was that “there has been no proper justice”.</p><p>Not after Hindus were attacked following the 2001 election that former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won, and not after later attacks against Hindus in subsequent years.</p><p>Now, sporadic attacks in recent months ahead of the election have revived those fears. According to the BHBCUC, at least 522 communal attacks were recorded in 2025, including 61 killings. The group says 2,184 incidents took place in 2024 following Hasina’s removal in August that year.</p><p>Minorities are now “deeply insecure” ahead of the election, Nath said. “There is fear among everyone,” he added.</p><p>The Bangladesh government disputes claims of widespread communal violence. According to official <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17sKwyFY7i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data</a>, in 2025, authorities recorded 645 incidents involving members of minority communities. Of these, the government says, only 71 had “communal elements”, while the remainder were classified as general criminal acts. Officials argue the figures show that most incidents involving minorities were not driven by religious hostility, stressing the need to distinguish communal violence from broader law-and-order crimes.</p><p>At a national level, Bangladesh faces persistent law-and-order challenges, with an average of 3,000 to 3,500 violent crime deaths each year, according to official figures.</p><p>The government has also suggested that the issue has been politicised internationally, particularly by the Indian media and officials, since the fall of Hasina’s government.</p><p>Rights groups, however, present different data. Ain o Salish Kendra, a prominent human rights organisation, documented 221 incidents of communal violence in 2025, including one death and 17 injuries — lower than the BHBCUC’s count, but higher than the government’s data.</p><p>And the differing numbers notwithstanding, interviews with minority communities point to deep anxiety shaped by recent lived experience.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"not-another-mental-trauma\">‘Not another mental trauma’</h2><p>Shefali Sarkar, a homemaker in Bidyadharpur in Rajshahi, saw her life turn upside down on the afternoon of August 5, 2024 — the day Hasina fled, seeking exile in India.</p><p>As fears of an attack spread, most men in the community fled, leaving the women behind in their homes. Mobs primarily targeted men in the aftermath of Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>“They started vandalising our house. I thought this was it – that we were going to die,” Shefali said, still visibly shaken when recalling the day. “It left a deep scar in my mind, and I have needed mental health treatment after this.”</p><p>With elections approaching, Shefali said her anxiety has returned, fearing that any fresh unrest could once again make her community a target. “I cannot go through another mental trauma,” she said.</p><p>Her husband, Narayan Sarkar, said the area has remained calm since the attack and that local Muslim residents and political leaders have assured them of protection. “But the fear always remains – peace can be taken away at any time,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"unrest-might-spread\">‘Unrest might spread’</h2><p>Not everyone is as worried.</p><p>Shaymol Karmokar, from central Bangladesh’s Faridpur district, is the secretary of the local Durga Puja celebration committee. Durga Puja is a major Hindu Bengali festival, celebrated in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.</p><p>“We have traditionally maintained strong communal harmony here over the years,” Karmokar said. “Many areas reported attacks during the uprising, but nothing happened in our locality.”</p><p>He added that political leaders had actively sought minority votes and promised to ensure their safety. “We will vote and expect a peaceful election,” he said.</p><p>Indeed, BNP leader Tarique Rahman — former PM Khaleda Zia’s son — has spoken of his desire to build an inclusive Bangladesh where all communities, irrespective of faith, feel safe and secure.</p><p>And the Jamaat-e-Islami, the BNP’s principal challenger in the elections, has for the first time nominated a Hindu candidate, from the city of Khulna, as part of its outreach to the community.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, in Gopalganj, where about a quarter of voters are Hindu, worries about election violence are high.</p><p>In one heavily Hindu-populated constituency of the district — which is also Hasina’s birthplace — Govinda Pramanik, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote [Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance] and an independent candidate, said he was scared that “unrest might spread around this election”, he said.</p><p>BHBCUC’s Nath said the government and election authorities could have done more to assuage concerns of minorities. “Even now, as the Election Commission operates, it has not once asked religious minorities what problems they are facing or what support they need,” he said.</p><p>Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh’s interim government, however, said authorities have taken steps to protect minorities and ensure a safe election. “We have taken adequate measures so that people of all communities – minorities and majorities, followers of all faiths and identities – can vote in a festive atmosphere,” Alam told Al Jazeera. “They could not vote freely under Sheikh Hasina over the last 15 years, as the elections were rigged.”</p><p>“Our priority is to ensure that everyone can vote this time,” he added, insisting that the government had consulted minority communities and addressed their concerns.</p><p>Back in Bidyadharpur village in Rajshahi, Sukumar Pramanik said he was weighing these assurances carefully. “If we come under attack again,” he said, “this will be the last time I place my trust in them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Robles, meanwhile, is in fourth place with 3.8 percent support.</p><p>About 26 percent of respondents said they had not decided on who they would vote for, down from 32 percent the week before.</p><p>Fernandez appears well-positioned to secure a first-round win, something uncommon in the country’s recent history. But analysts say that another candidate could still outperform expectations, given the collapse of traditional political blocs and the large number of undecided voters.</p><p>Upsets are not uncommon in Costa Rica’s presidential elections.

She has also advocated for mandatory prison labour and stricter criminal sentencing.</p><p>While Costa Rica was once known for its relative stability, homicides and organised crime have risen in the country.</p><p>Preliminary government figures for 2025 show that 873 homicides were reported in the country, down slightly from a high of 907 in 2023 and on par with 2024.</p><p>Right-wing candidates have successfully capitalised on similar concerns in other Latin American countries such as El Salvador, Ecuador and Chile.</p><p>In the final weeks before Sunday’s vote, Chaves invited El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele – known for “mano dura” or “iron-fisted” approach to security – to tour the new mega-prison site. His government also accused a human rights activist of seeking his assassination.</p><p>The activist has denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated.

But it is an acknowledgement they also admit has come quite late.</p><p>“The family is happy about it. And we’re excited that he’s finally being recognised,” Yeni Kuti, Fela’s daughter, told Al Jazeera before the ceremony. “But Fela was never nominated [for a Grammy] in his lifetime,” she lamented.</p><p>The recognition is “better late than never”, she said, but “we still have a way to go” in fairly recognising musicians and artists from across the African continent.</p><p>Lemi Ghariokwu, a renowned Nigerian artist and the designer behind 26 of Fela’s iconic album covers, says the fact that this is the first time an African musician gets this honour “just shows that whatever we as Africans need to do, we need to do it five times more.”</p><p>Ghariokwu said he feels “privileged” to witness this moment for Fela. “It’s good to have one of us represented in that category, at that level. So, I’m excited. I’m happy about it,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But he admits he was also “surprised” when he first heard the news.</p><p>“Fela was totally <a href=\"/opinions/2018/7/15/how-fela-kuti-came-to-be-celebrated-by-those-he-sang-against\">anti-establishment</a>.

He didn’t even think about it,” she said. “He played music because he loved music. It was to be acknowledged by his people – by human beings, by fellow artists – that made him happy.”</p><p>Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela’s cousin and head of the Kuti family, agrees. “Knowing him, he might have said, you know, thanks but no thanks or something like that.” She laughs.</p><p>“He really wasn’t interested in the popular view. He wasn’t driven by what others thought of him or his music. He was more focused on his own understanding of how he should impact his profession, his community, his continent.”</p><p>Though she believes the award may not have meant much to him personally, she told Al Jazeera that he would have recognised its overall value.</p><p>“He would recognise the fact that it’s a good thing for such establishments to begin the process of giving honour where it’s due across the continent,” Ransome-Kuti said.</p><p>“There are many great philosophers, musicians, historians – African ones – that haven’t been brought into the forefront, into the limelight as they should be. So I think he would have said, ‘OK, good, but what happens next?’”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275569\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275569\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP8103161140-1769761121.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela Kuti\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fela Kuti performs on March 16, 1981, with his band “Africa 70” at the Hippodrome in Paris, France [File: Herve Merliac/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fela-s-influence-spans-generations\">‘Fela’s influence spans generations’</h2><p>Fela was born in Nigeria’s Ogun State in 1938 as Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti (later renaming himself to Fela Anikulapo Kuti), to an Anglican minister and school principal father and an <a href=\"/features/2020/10/1/the-lioness-of-lisabi-who-ended-unfair-taxes-for-nigerian-women\">activist mother</a>.</p><p>In 1958, he went to London to study medicine, but instead enrolled at Trinity College of Music, where he formed a band that played a blend of jazz and highlife.</p><p>After returning to Nigeria in the 1960s, he went on to create the Afrobeat genre that fused highlife and Yoruba music with American jazz, funk, and soul. That has laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop.</p><p>“Fela’s influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats,” reads the <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/news/special-merit-awards-2026-grammys-honorees-recording-academy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">citation</a> on the Grammys list of this year’s Special Merit Award Honorees.</p><p>But beyond music, he was also a “political radical [and] outlaw”, the citation adds.</p><p>By the 1970s, Fela’s music had become a vehicle for fierce criticism of military rule, corruption, and social injustice in Nigeria. He declared his Lagos commune, the Kalakuta Republic, independent from the state – symbolically rejecting Nigerian authority – and in 1977 released the scathing album, Zombie, with lyrics that painted soldiers as mindless zombies with no free will. In the aftermath, troops raided Kalakuta, brutally assaulting its residents and causing injuries that led to Fela’s mother’s death.</p><p>Frequently arrested and harassed during his life, Fela became an international symbol of artistic resistance, with Amnesty International later recognising him as a prisoner of conscience after a politically motivated imprisonment. When he died in 1997 at age 58 from an illness, an estimated one million people attended his funeral in Lagos.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275575\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275575\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP179924952246-1769761145.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portraits of Late Afrobeat Legend Fela Kuti, on display at Kalakuta Museum in Lagos, Nigeria [File: Sunday Alamba/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Yeni – together with her siblings – is now custodian of her father’s work and legacy. She runs Afrobeat hub,</p><p>the New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja, Lagos and hosts an annual celebration in Fela’s honour called “Felabration”.</p><p>She remembers growing up with her larger-than-life father as something that felt “normal”, as it was all she knew. But “I was in awe of him”, she also says – as an artist and a thinker.</p><p>“I really, really admired his ideologies. The most important one for me was African unity … He totally worshipped and admired [former Ghanaian President] Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who was fighting for African unity. And I always think to myself, can you imagine if Africa was united? How far we would be; how progressive we would be.”</p><p>Reflecting on Fela’s legacy, artist Ghariokwu says most big Afrobeats musicians today have been influenced and inspired by Fela’s music and fashion.</p><p>But he laments that most have “never really sat down with the ideological part of Fela – the pan-Africanism – they never really checked it out”.</p><p>For him, Fela’s Grammy recognition should say to young artists, “If someone [like Fela] who was totally anti-establishment can be recognised this way, maybe I can express myself too without too much fear.”</p><p>Yeni says that through Fela’s work and life philosophy, he wanted to pass a message of African unity and political consciousness on to young people.</p><p>“So maybe with this award, more young people will be drawn to talk more about that,” she said. “Hopefully, they will be more exposed to Fela and want to talk about the progress of Africa.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nicolas Maduro, from the presidential palace in Caracas, on the orders of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>Maduro was then taken to a prison in New York, and is facing drug trafficking and narcoterrorism conspiracy charges.</p><p>The move has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">widely criticised</a> as a violation of international law.</p><p>Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs Yvan Gil wrote on Telegram that he had received Dogu, and that talks would centre on creating a “roadmap on matters of bilateral interest” as well as “addressing and resolving existing differences through diplomatic dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect and international law”.</p><p>Dogu, who previously served as US ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, was appointed to the role of charge d’affaires to the Venezuela Affairs Unit, based out of the US Embassy in Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>Venezuela and the US broke off diplomatic relations in February 2019, in a decision by Maduro after Trump gave public support to Venezuelan lawmaker Juan Guaido, who claimed to be the nation’s interim president in January that year.</p><p>Minister of the Popular Power for Interior Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela’s most powerful politicians and a Maduro loyalist, said earlier in January that reopening the US embassy in Caracas would give the Venezuelan government a way to oversee the treatment of the deposed president.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/rubio-testifies-before-us-senate-on-abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro\">claimed</a> that Maduro’s abduction was necessary for security reasons, officials have also <a

href=\"/news/2026/1/8/what-resources-does-venezuela-have-apart-from-the-worlds-most\">largest</a> in the world.</p><p>Since the abduction, Trump has pressured Interim President Delcy Rodriguez to open the country’s nationalised oil sector to US firms.</p><p>The two countries have reached ‌a deal to export up ⁠to $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the US, and on Thursday, Rodriguez <a

legislation gives private firms control over the sale and production of Venezuelan oil, and requires legal disputes to be resolved outside of Venezuelan courts, a change long sought by foreign companies, which argue that the judicial system in the country is dominated by the governing socialist party.</p><p>The bill would also cap royalties collected by the government at 30 percent.</p><p>The Trump administration said on the same day that it would loosen some sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector, and allow limited transactions by the country’s government and the state oil company PDVSA that were necessary for a laundry list of export-related activities involving an “established US entity”.</p><p>Trump has announced that he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/trump-says-that-he-will-allow-reopening-of-venezuelan-airspace\">ordered the reopening</a> of Venezuela’s commercial airspace and “informed” Rodriguez that US oil companies

href=\"/news/2026/1/31/venezuelas-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez-announces-prisoner-amnesty\">announced</a> an amnesty bill aimed at releasing hundreds of prisoners in the country, and said she would shut down El Helicoide, an infamous secret service prison in Caracas, to be replaced with a sports and cultural centre.</p><p>That move was one of the key demands of the Venezuelan opposition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But that result should occur through a more orderly ‌and humane policy than currently in place.”</p><p>The judge did not specify the deportation quota he was referring to, but Stephen Miller, the White House chief of staff for policy, has previously said there was a target of 3,000 immigration arrests a day.</p><p>The ongoing crackdown in the state of Minnesota is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to federal officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The surge has prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-governor\">led to the killings</a> of two American citizens by federal agents.</p><p>The deadly operation has sparked <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-protesters-begin-nationwide-strike-as-doj-launches-pretti-killing-probe\">nationwide protests</a> as well as mass <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/29/the-take-they-picked-the-wrong-state-how-minneapolis-is-fighting-back\">mobilisation efforts</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/thousands-in-minneapolis-brave-bitter-cold-to-protest-ice-crackdown\">demonstrations</a> in Minnesota.</p><p>According to the Columbia Heights Public School District in Minneapolis, Liam was one of at least four students detained by immigration officials in the suburb this month.</p><p>Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik said ICE agents took the child from a running car in the family’s driveway on January 20, and told him to knock on the door of his home, a tactic that she said amounted to using him as “bait” for other family members.</p><p>The government has denied that account, with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claiming that an ICE officer remained with Liam “for the child’s safety” while other officers apprehended his father.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance, who has vigorously defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, told a news conference that although such arrests were “traumatic” for children, “just because you’re a parent, doesn’t mean that you get complete immunity from law enforcement”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has said that Conejo Arias arrived in the US illegally in December 2024 from Ecuador, but the family’s lawyer says they have an active asylum claim that allows them to remain in the country legally.</p><p>Following their detention, the boy and his father were sent to a facility in Dilley in Texas, where advocacy groups and politicians have reported deplorable conditions, including illnesses, malnourishment and a fast-growing number of detained children.</p><p>Texas Representatives Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett visited the site earlier this week. Liam slept throughout the 30-minute visit, Castro said, and his father reported that he was “depressed and sad”.</p><p>Biery’s ruling on Saturday included a photo of the boy, as well as several Bible quotes: “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these’,” and “Jesus wept”.</p><p>The episode, Biery wrote, made apparent “the government’s ignorance of an American historical document called the Declaration of Independence”. Biery drew a comparison between Trump’s administration and the wrongdoings that then-author, future President Thomas Jefferson, mounted against England’s King George, including sending “Swarms of Officers to harass our People” and creating “domestic Insurrection”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Department of Justice and DHS.</p><p>The Law Firm of Jennifer Scarborough, which is representing Liam and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, said in a statement that the pair will soon be able to reunite with the rest of their family.</p><p>“We are pleased that the family will now be able to focus on being together and finding some peace after this traumatic ordeal,” the statement said.</p><p>Minnesota officials have been calling on the Trump administration to end its immigration ‍crackdown in the state. But a federal judge on Saturday <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">denied a request</a> from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and other officials to issue a preliminary injunction that would have halted the federal operation.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/trump-orders-federal-agents-to-stay-away-from-protests-in-democrat-cities\">ordered DHS</a> to, “under no circumstances”, get involved with protests in Democratic-led cities unless they ask for federal help, or federal property is threatened.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.</p><p>The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and led to the killings of Alex Pretti on January 14 and Renee Good on January 7 by federal agents, who said they were reacting to threats.</p><p>Bystander videos and witness accounts contradict those claims, however.</p><p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Minneapolis and other US cities on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota.</p><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and others also challenged the immigration enforcement surge in the state, arguing that DHS is violating constitutional protections.</p><p>But a federal judge has said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">she will not halt</a> enforcement operations as the lawsuit proceeds.

Trump repeatedly threatening to attack Iran over a crackdown on recent antigovernment protests, and his push to curtail Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump said the US vessels being sent to Iran were ready to use “violence, if necessary”, if Iran refused to sit down for talks on its nuclear programme.</p><p>The US Central Command (CENTCOM) also warned Iran’s <a

leaders have said they are <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-says-ready-for-fair-talks-with-us-but-not-under-shadow-of-threats\">open to negotiations with Washington</a>, but only once Trump stops threatening to attack the country.</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also hit back on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the US military, operating off Iran’s shores, “is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice on their own turf”.</p><p>“CENTCOM is also requesting ‘professionalism’ from a national military the U.S. Government has listed as a ‘terrorist organization’, all while recognizing the right of that same ‘terrorist organization’ to conduct military drills!” Araghchi wrote.</p><p>The US <a href=\"/news/2019/4/8/us-labels-irans-elite-revolutionary-guard-corps-a-terror-group\">designated the IRGC</a>, an elite branch of the Iranian military, as a “terrorist” organisation in 2019, during Trump’s first term in office.</p><p>Araghchi added, “The presence of outside forces in our region has always caused the exact opposite of what is declared: promoting escalation instead of de-escalation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from the Iranian capital, said the situation remains “quite fragile and delicate”.</p><p>Still, he said, Larijani’s statement on Saturday about progress being made on efforts to hold negotiations was a “positive” sign.</p><p>“Diplomatic [efforts] are [on]going,” Asadi said, noting that senior Iranian officials have held talks with allies in recent days amid a push to prevent a confrontation between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani met Larijani in Tehran on Saturday to discuss “efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region”.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed reiterated Qatar’s “support for all efforts aimed at reducing tensions and achieving peaceful solutions that enhance security and stability in the region”, the ministry said of the talks in a <a

region the consequences of escalation and to continue coordination with brotherly and friendly countries to address differences through diplomatic means,” the statement added.</p><p>Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have also been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Turkiye, which is a member of NATO, shares a border with Iran and opposes any foreign intervention there. It has called for US-Iran dialogue to avoid further destabilisation and has been in touch with both sides to seek a solution.</p><p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday that Riyadh would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, according to the SPA state news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
