seven others over the past day, the region’s military administration said on the Telegram messaging platform.</li>\n<li>The attacks involved 448 drones as well as 163 artillery strikes, causing damage to 136 homes, cars and other structures, the military administration said.</li>\n<li>Russian forces also continued shelling Ukraine’s Donetsk region, forcing 173 people, including 135 children, to evacuate front-line areas over the past day, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>A 54-year-old man was killed in a Russian attack in the Nikopol district of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Oleksandr Hanzha said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian attacks also left many people without electricity across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Energy, including more than 99,000 households in the Odesa region.</li>\n<li>In Russia, one person was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the village of Aleynikovo in the country’s Bryansk region, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian forces seized the village of Kharkivka in Ukraine’s Sumy region and Krynychne in the Zaporizhia region, according to Russia’s state news agency TASS.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian battlefield monitoring site DeepState said that Russian forces advanced in Nykyforivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.</li>\n<li>Russian forces shot down 155 Ukrainian drones, 11 rocket launchers, and two guided aerial bombs in a 24-hour period, Russia’s Defence Ministry said, according to TASS.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"peace-talks\">Peace talks</h2><ul

“difficult”.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that although “progress has been made … for now, positions differ because the negotiations were difficult”.</li>\n<li>President Zelenskyy later told the Piers Morgan Uncensored current affairs show that Russia and Ukraine were close to defining terms for how a potential ceasefire would be monitored, but progress on “political” issues had been slower, including on the most divisive issue of control of territory.</li>\n<li>In Washington, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said there was “meaningful progress made” with pledges “to continue to work towards a peace deal together”, and more talks are expected in the near future.</li>\n<li>Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s top negotiator, said the two days of talks in Geneva were “difficult but businesslike,” telling reporters that further negotiations would be held soon, without specifying when.</li>\n<li>Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv’s negotiating team, said that the second day had been “intensive and substantive” and that both sides were working towards decisions that can be sent to their presidents, he said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3

that we would see a stronger effort and some real work when we get back to put pressure on Putin”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sport</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a post on Telegram that “allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the Milano-Cortina Paralympics while Russia continues its full-scale war against Ukraine is a

Iranian officials said both parties had agreed on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had yet to respond to all of Washington’s “red lines”.</p><p>During a news conference on Wednesday, Leavitt articulated the Trump administration’s position that Iran needs to accede to US demands.</p><p>“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” she told reporters.</p><p>Trump, who has repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/trump-threatens-iran-with-something-very-tough-if-us-demands-are-not-met\">threatened</a> Iran with military action in response to its crackdown on protests last month, also referenced a possible escalation in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday.</p><p>The post warned Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom against a deal <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/trump-says-uks-starmer-big-mistake-diego-garcia-lease\">agreed to last year</a> that would see London cede control of the Chagos Islands, strategically located in the centre of the Indian Ocean.</p><p>The deal nevertheless allows the UK and US to continue to lease and operate a joint airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia.</p><p>“Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116093101641103750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries.”</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking from the sidelines of an International Energy Agency (IAE) meeting in Paris, France, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”.</p><p>“They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons. It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"military-buildup\">Military buildup</h2><p>The threats come as the US appears to be surging more military assets to the Middle East, raising the spectre of escalation.</p><p>As of Wednesday, the Pentagon had one aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships in the region, with an anonymous US official telling the AFP news agency more were on the way.</p><p>That includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which is en route from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>The US has also sent a large fleet of aircraft to the Middle East, according to open-source intelligence accounts on X and flight-tracking website Flightradar24.</p><p>That deployment appears to include F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes, and the KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft that are needed to sustain their operations, according to the trackers.</p><p>The US had previously surged aircraft and naval vessels to the region ahead of strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites in June of last year, which came at the end of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-does-not-want-war\">Iran does ‘not want war’</h2><p>For his part, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday that the country did “not want war” but would not give in to US demands.</p><p>“From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside. But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?” he asked.</p><p>Pezeshkian spoke shortly after Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched exercises on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, in a show of military might.</p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any new US strikes would lead to wider regional escalation.</p><p>Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Wednesday that its top diplomat Abbas Araghchi had spoken by phone with the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Grossi “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks” on its nuclear programme, according to the statement.</p><p>Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which saw Iran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, during his first term in 2018. In the years since, he has imposed a “maximum pressure” campaign that includes new sanctions.</p><p>Efforts to strike a new nuclear deal have repeatedly stalled since Trump’s first term.</p><p>Tehran has called for the latest round of talks to focus solely on its nuclear programme, which it maintains is used only for civilian purposes. It has also indicated it is willing to make concessions in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>Washington has pushed for wider demands that are considered non-starters for Iran, including limits on its ballistic missile programme, although its demands during the latest round of talks were not immediately clear.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of those, 488 people have been killed since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on October 10, 2025.</p><p>Israel has consistently questioned the ministry’s figures, but an Israeli army official told journalists in the country in January that the army accepted that about 70,000 people had been killed in Gaza during the war.</p><p>Despite the higher figure, researchers noted that the demographic composition of casualties – where women, children, and the elderly comprise 56.2 percent of those killed – remains remarkably consistent with official Palestinian reporting.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321770\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-death-toll-exceeds-75000-Lancet-study-1771400778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza death toll exceeds 75000 Lancet study-1771400778\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"scientific-validation-of-the-toll\">Scientific validation of the toll</h2><p>The GMS, which interviewed 2,000 households representing 9,729 individuals, provides a rigorous empirical foundation for a death toll.</p><p>Michael Spagat, a professor of economics at Royal Holloway University of London and the study’s lead author, found that while MoH reporting remains reliable, it is inherently conservative due to the collapse of the very infrastructure required to document death.</p><p>Notably, this research advances upon findings <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/deaths-from-israeli-attacks-in-gaza-undercounted-by-41-percent-study-finds\">published</a> in The Lancet in January 2025, which used statistical “capture-recapture” modelling to estimate 64,260 deaths during the war’s first nine months.</p><p>While that earlier study relied on probability to flag undercounts, this report shifts from mathematical estimation to empirical verification through direct household interviews. It extends the timeline through January 2025, confirming a violent toll exceeding 75,000 and quantifying, for the first time, the burden of “non-violent excess mortality”.</p><p>According to a separate commentary in the same publication, the systematic destruction of hospitals and administrative centres has created a “central paradox” where the more devastating the harm to the health system, the more difficult it becomes to analyse the total death toll.</p><p>Verification is further hindered by thousands of bodies still buried under rubble or mutilated beyond recognition. Beyond direct violence, the survey estimated 16,300 “non-violent deaths”, including 8,540 “excess” deaths caused directly by the deterioration of living conditions and the blockade-induced collapse of the medical sector.</p><p>Researchers highlighted that the MoH figures appear to be conservative and reliable, dispelling misinformation campaigns aimed at discrediting Palestinian casualty data. “The validation of MoH reporting through multiple independent methodologies supports the reliability of its administrative casualty recording systems even under extreme conditions,” the study concluded.</p><h2 id=\"a-decade-of-reconstructive-backlogs\">A decade of reconstructive backlogs</h2><p>While the death toll continues to mount, survivors face an unprecedented burden of complex injury that Gaza’s decimated healthcare system is no longer equipped to manage. A predictive, multi-source model published in eClinicalMedicine quantified 116,020 cumulative injuries as of April 30, 2025.</p><p>The study, led by researchers from Duke University and Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital, estimated that between 29,000 and 46,000 of these injuries require complex reconstructive surgery. More than 80 percent of these injuries resulted from explosions, primarily air attacks and shelling in densely populated urban zones.</p><p>The scale of the backlog is staggering. Ash Patel, a surgeon and co-author of the study, noted that even if surgical capacity were miraculously restored to pre-war levels, it would take approximately another decade to work through the estimated backlog of predicted reconstructive cases. Before the escalation, Gaza had only eight board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons for a population exceeding 2.2 million people.</p><h2 id=\"the-collapse-of-the-health-system\">The collapse of the health system</h2><p>The disparity between reconstructive need and capacity is exacerbated by what researchers describe as the “systematic destruction” of medical infrastructure. By May 2025, only 12 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remained capable of providing care beyond basic emergency triage, with approximately 2,000 hospital beds available for the entire population, down from more than 3,000 beds before the war.</p><p>“There is little to no reconstructive surgery capacity left within Gaza,” the research concluded, warning that specialised expertise like microsurgery is almost absent. The clinical challenge is further compounded by Israel’s use of incendiary weapons, which produce severe burns alongside blast-related fractures.</p><p>The long-term effect of these injuries is often irreversible. Without prompt medical treatment, patients face high risks of wound infection, sepsis, and permanent disability. The data indicate that tens of thousands of Palestinians will remain with surgically addressable disabilities for life unless there is a huge international increase in reconstructive capacity and aid.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4013406\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_2-05-1759764785.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_HOSPITALS_DESTROYED_DAMAGED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"the-grey-zone-of-mortality\">The ‘grey zone’ of mortality</h2><p>Writing in The Lancet Global Health, authors Belal Aldabbour and Bilal Irfan observed a growing “grey zone” in mortality where the distinction between direct and indirect death becomes blurred. Patients who die of sepsis months after a blast, or from renal failure after a crushing injury because they cannot access clean water or surgery, occupy a space that risks understating the true lethality of military attacks.</p><p>Conditions have only deteriorated since the data collection periods. By late 2025, forced evacuations covered more than 80 percent of Gaza’s area, with northern Gaza and Rafah governorates facing full razing by Israeli forces. Famine was declared in northern Gaza in August 2025, further reducing the physiological reserve of injured survivors and complicating any surgical recovery.</p><p>This series of independent studies serves as an urgent call for accountability and an immediate cessation of hostilities. “The healthcare infrastructure in Gaza is being repeatedly decimated by attacks despite protection by international humanitarian law,” researchers stated. They underscored that the only way to prevent the reconstructive burden from growing further is an immediate end to attacks against civilians and vital infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She alleges that those apps fueled suicidal thoughts and depression.</p><p>Lanier alleged that Zuckerberg misled Congress about the design of its social media platforms.</p><p>Zuckerberg was questioned on his statements to the US Congress in 2024, during a hearing in which he said the company did not give its teams the goal of maximising time spent on its apps.</p><p>Lanier showed jurors emails from 2014 and 2015 in which Zuckerberg laid out aims to increase time spent on the app by double-digit percentage points. Zuckerberg said that while Meta previously had goals related to the amount of time users spent on the app, it has since changed its approach.</p><p>“If you are trying to say my testimony was not accurate, I strongly disagree with that,” Zuckerberg said.</p><h2 id=\"high-stakes\">High stakes</h2><p>The stakes are higher at the jury trial. Meta may have to pay damages if it loses the case, and the verdict could erode Big Tech’s longstanding legal defence against claims of user harm that liability is on the user and not the platform.</p><p>TikTok and Snap, who were previously named in the case, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached a settlement.</a> TikTok settled the same day the case began for undisclosed terms. Snap settled a week before, also for undisclosed terms.</p><p>The case is the first among a slew of similar ones that allege that social media platforms designed features that the companies knew would addict young consumers and affect their mental health. Families, school districts and states around the US have filed roughly 1,600 lawsuits against various social media giants, including Meta, TikTok, Google and Snap.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The outcome will help determine how to handle the remaining cases. The jury’s decisions will provide guidance,” Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based media law and entertainment lawyer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If the plaintiffs lose and the defendants successfully argue that the platforms are not products, that there is no causation, or that the algorithms had nothing to do with the alleged harm, and that the plaintiffs’ own circumstances are responsible, then Meta and Google’s YouTube will likely take a firmer stance in the remaining cases.”</p><p>Meta has denied the allegations made by KGM.</p><p>“We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most.”</p><p>Meta introduced new safety features in 2025, including, in April, blocking teens under 16 from going live on Instagram. In September, the company launched a school partnership programme that gives educators expedited review of complaints, such as cyberbullying.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s testimony follows Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who appeared in front of the court last week. He said he was unaware of an internal Meta study that showed that there is no link between parental supervision and teens’ attentiveness to their own social media use.</p><p>Teens with difficult life circumstances more often said they used Instagram habitually or unintentionally, according to the document shown at trial.</p><p>Paul Schmidt, one of Meta’s lawyers, did not dispute KGM’s mental health challenges, but argued that Instagram was not a substantial factor in her struggles. He attributed her difficulties to problems at home and said she used social media as a coping mechanism for deeper personal issues.</p><p id=\"the-question-for-the-jury-in-los-angeles-is-whether-instagram-was-a-substantial-factor-in-the-plaintiff-s-mental-health-struggles-the-evidence-will-show-she-faced-many-significant-difficult-challenges-well-before-she-ever-used-social-media-a-meta-spokesperson-added\">“The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles. The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,” a Meta spokesperson added.</p><h2 id=\"wide-ramifications\">Wide ramifications</h2><p>The case itself is seen as one that could fundamentally change social media, with legal experts likening it to lawsuits that faced the tobacco industry decades ago.</p><p>Social media platforms have largely been protected by Section 230, a provision added in 1996 to the Communications Act of 1934. The law protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But this latest case emboldens critics calling for reforms, according to Lovell.</p><p>“Lawmakers may need to carve out greater obligations and duties for internet and social media companies rather than maintain blanket immunity,” Lovell said.</p><p>“With the rise of artificial intelligence and ongoing online abuse, Section 230 has become an enabler for those who want to harm others. Guardrails are needed.”</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock ended the day up 0.61 percent, but is down in after-hours trading at the time of publishing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly 200,000 recipients could now lose their coverage due to the increased paperwork, said Suzanne Jiminez, chief of staff at the SEIU-UHW.</p><p>Darien Shanske, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, said it was the “moment of crisis” created by the OBBBA that had pushed him and others to draft the tax on the state’s estimated 200 billionaires. In exploring the various alternatives to make up for the lost funds due to Trump’s bill, he had thought about “the failure of income tax to reach the ultra wealthy”.</p><p>But critics of a billionaire tax, such as the California Policy Center’s Joffe, say that the estimates of those who would lose cover may be overblown.</p><p>For instance, he said, those who can work could be asked to work, get involved in the community or go to college in exchange for their coverage. New undocumented migrants will not be enrolled from this year, and they will have to pay $30 from next year onwards for their coverage.</p><p>“It’s not as big a deal as the unions say,” Joffe told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Most of all, it is the taxing of intangible assets, including equity shares, that has raised hackles. Successful startup founders often have their wealth in the form of equity in their companies, making them billionaires. But imposing a tax on this “punishes people for being innovative”, Joffe said. “There is the emotional aspect of it, the perceived injustice.”</p><p>This sentiment could be at the heart of the flurry of moves out of the state. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is in talks to buy a $200m home in Miami, possibly becoming the latest of several billionaires to move out of California as the prospect of the billionaire tax looms, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Days before the January 1, 2026, applicable date for the tax, should it come into place, Google cofounders terminated or moved 15 related companies from the state, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Billionaires are also funding opposition to the tax. Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, who has also reportedly moved out of the state, donated $3m to a political committee of the California Round Table to oppose the measure. More such donations are expected to flow in.</p><p>But Jiminez of the SEIU-UHW said the idea of a flight of capital and talent “is a scare tactic that will not play out”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A banner bearing portraits of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg with a slogan is seen during a demonstration against the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the eve of the WEF annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2026.

They are also strong sources of employment in these communities.</p><p>Sanchez spent Valentine’s Day evening and most evenings this month at a brewery near her house collecting signatures for the ballot measure from customers, while her kids did homework on a table nearby.</p><p>Daniel Schnur, a political analyst who also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Government Studies, said that “it would be surprising if [the measure] didn’t qualify” for the November ballots. “The timing of it may be very effective.”</p><p>While many voters who have aspired to be wealthy may looked up to Silicon Valley billionaires, they have become more disenchanted, he said.</p><p>A 2025 Harris poll found that 94 percent of respondents said that a wealth gap exists, with corporate tax loopholes being a top driver behind the disparity. Some 71 percent of the respondents said they supported a wealth tax.</p><p>California’s billionaire tax proposal also found support in a poll conducted in January by the Mellman Group for a Republican strategist, with 48 percent respondents saying they supported it and 38 percent saying they did not.</p><p>With opinion deeply divided between the state’s unions on one side and its top taxpayers on the other, Newsom, who is in his final term as governor, could face a difficult balancing act ahead.</p><p>“What is the governor’s plan?” Sanchez asked about the increased paperwork and possible loss of Medi-Cal coverage for many residents.</p><p>Given that the loss of taxpayers due to the proposed billionaire’s tax could have a detrimental impact on the state’s already precarious budget, getting signatures for the measure could be just the beginning of a rocky path ahead.</p><p>“It is likely that Governor Newsom will try to find a legislative solution to this. Legislators could seek to modify the bill if it is acceptable to the movers,” Schnur said.</p><p>California Policy Center’s Joffe said that if the measure gets voted on in November, it could also face legal challenges, and “will be litigated up to the Supreme Court”.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and conservative commentator, has said that with the billionaires moving their homes, the prospect of the tax has already <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/california-billionaire-tax-proposal-hemorrhages-1-trillion-billionaires-flee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led to $1 trillion</a> leaving the state. It is not clear how he arrived at that figure.</p><p>But “this is paper mobility”, said Shanske, the bill’s co-author.</p><p>“People club where there is talent and amenities, and gutting healthcare will make the state less attractive.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The segment in question involves an appearance from Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democrat who is vying for the US Senate.</p><p>The confirmation comes as Carr attempted to shut down claims that the government censored an interview between Talarico and late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert.</p><p>“There was no censorship here at all,” Carr said.</p><p>“Every single broadcaster in this country has an obligation to be responsible for the programming that they choose to air, and they’re responsible whether it complies with FCC rules or not, and it doesn’t, and those individual broadcasters are also going to have a potential liability.”</p><p>The controversy with Colbert likewise stems from the Trump administration’s decision to shift definitions under the “equal time” rule.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-equal-time-rule\">What is the ‘equal time’ rule?</h2><p>The rule is part of section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act. Under that law, if a broadcaster allows one candidate for public office to use its facilities, it is required to “afford equal opportunities” to all other candidates in the same race.</p><p>But the law includes exceptions for “bona fide newscasts” and “bona fide news interviews”.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, talk shows and late-night comedy programmes <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/us-fcc-notice-to-broadcasters-prompts-concerns-on-curtailing-free-speech\">were included</a> in those categories.</p><p>In January, however, the FCC issued new guidance (<a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-68A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) that significantly narrows how it interprets the “bona fide news” exemption. In a memo, it described daytime talk shows and late-night comedy as “entertainment programs” that fall outside the exception.</p><p>“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the memo reads.</p><p>The commission also suggested that many such programmes are “motivated by partisan purposes” and are therefore not “bona fide” news.</p><p>The new interpretation of the “equal time” rule, the FCC argued, is designed to “ensure that no legally qualified candidate for office is unfairly given less access to the public airwaves than their opponent.”</p><h2 id=\"controversy-with-colbert\">Controversy with Colbert</h2><p>That new interpretation came roaring into the spotlight on Monday, after a broadcast of the CBS comedy programme The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p>In one of his opening segments, Colbert alleged that the network lawyers barred him from airing a planned interview that night with Talarico.</p><p>“Let’s just call it what it is,” Colbert told his audience. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time.”</p><p>Trump has previously criticised both Colbert’s show and The View for what he considers a left-wing slant.</p><p>Instead of broadcasting his interview with Talarico on network television, Colbert instead posted the segment on the programme’s YouTube page, where it has gained more than 6 million views as of 3:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday.</p><p>According to Carr, Colbert’s show could have aired the Talarico interview if it had complied with the equal time rule.</p><p>That would have involved allowing other candidates in Texas vying for the Senate seat to come on the show. Carr also suggested that another solution could have been to restrict the broadcast in Texas.</p><p>But the FCC has continued to face criticisms for its actions. In Tuesday’s broadcast, Colbert addressed the issue a second time.</p><p>He read aloud a statement from his broadcast channel that read, in part, that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview” and that it was instead “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule”.</p><p>CBS added, in the statement, that Colbert could have invited onto the show Talarico’s rivals, including fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett.</p><p>“I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert responded. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents.”</p><p>Colbert has been a vocal critic of CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, particularly after it settled a lawsuit last year with the Trump administration for $16m in the run-up to a critical merger for which it needed government approval.</p><p>Talarico, meanwhile, accused the FCC of censoring his interviews. Nevertheless, on Wednesday, he noted that the uptick in media attention from the scandal has helped him gather donations.</p><p>“Our campaign raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the FCC banned our Colbert interview,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2024124888391287234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"

came into effect in the enclave in October, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.</p><p>Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said during the council meeting that the “ceasefire” has reduced hostilities while “the scope and the scale of humanitarian assistance” is growing daily.</p><p>While aspects of the Trump-backed plan for Gaza have moved forward, including Hamas releasing all the Israeli captives it was holding and increased amounts of humanitarian supplies getting into the territory, the UN says the level of aid remains insufficient.</p><p>A new technocratic committee has also been appointed to administer Gaza’s daily affairs.</p><p>But the most challenging steps lie ahead, including the deployment of an international security force, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">the disarmament of Hamas</a> and rebuilding Gaza.</p><p>Trump said this week that the Board of Peace members have pledged $5bn towards Gaza reconstruction and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilisation and police forces for the territory.</p><p>Indonesia’s military says up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.</p><p>“We call on all parties to support the Board of Peace,” Waltz said at the UN meeting on Wednesday. “Tomorrow, the Board of Peace will host its inaugural meeting in Washington, with a focus on bringing peace and security.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said “many” minors have been released without saying how many were arrested.</p><p>Ehsan Azimirad, the spokesman of the parliament’s education commission, said that 17 percent of the participants in the nationwide protests were teenagers, many of them students.</p><p>“I have even heard that in some schools, an entire class had participated in the riots,” he said, adding that in some provinces, up to 45 percent of protesters were under 20 years old. Officials have previously said that most of the protesters across the country were in their 20s.</p><p>This comes amid widespread reports, also disseminated by some local media outlets, of a heavy presence of security forces near or inside schools in the aftermath of the protests. Some families have been concerned about sending their children to school.</p><p>Universities and dormitories have also become focus points for security forces, with reports indicating that some people have had their phones searched while others have been summoned for questioning. University students have also been among the large number of people arrested from their homes since last month. Iranian authorities have not released overall arrest figures.</p><p>A number of Tehran University students peacefully demonstrated on campus on Wednesday to observe the 40th day since the height of the protest killings.</p><p>Last month, members of the Basij – an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary force – hung up a banner reading “Either death or Khamenei” at one of the entrances of the university, in support of 86-year-old Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">Ali Khamenei</a>. Iranian authorities have also displayed a vehicle burned by “rioters” near another entrance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"clashing-versions-of-events\">Clashing versions of events</h2><p>The Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">claims 3,117 people were killed</a> during the unrest, saying that “terrorists” and “rioters” were behind the violence, and were armed and funded by the United States and Israel, which organised an ultimately failed “coup”.</p><p>A list of victims published by the government last month said 690 of those killed were “terrorists”, with others either civilians or security forces. But it did not say who was classified under which category, or exactly where, how, when or by whom they were killed.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for the widespread use of lethal force against protesters, and have called for the release of those arrested, including doctors and nurses who tried to help wounded protesters. The UN Human Rights Council adopted a censure resolution against Iran’s establishment last month.</p><p>The US-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency</a> says it has verified 7,015 deaths during the unrest and is investigating more than 11,700 other cases. Mai Sato, the UN special rapporteur on Iran, said last month that more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed as information remains limited amid access constraints.</p><p>The Iranian government on Tuesday and Wednesday held its own version of the 40th day ceremonies at the Grand Mosalla of Tehran, a huge mosque in the downtown part of the capital. A number of officials, including government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, were in attendance.</p><p>On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader outlined his classification of the thousands killed during the nationwide protests, and divided them into several groups.</p><p>According to Khamenei, the first group are security forces, recognised as “the greatest of martyrs”.</p><p>The second were “passerby” civilians, he said. “Wherever this bullet [that killed them] may have come from, this incident occurred in the enemy’s sedition, and they are martyrs”.</p><p>“The third group are those who were deceived, who acted naively, who were inexperienced and went along with the seditionists,” Khamenei said, adding, “We ask forgiveness for them; they made mistakes”.</p><p>Outside of those three groups, however, were “corrupt individuals, seditionists, and coup plotters”, who Khamenei said “were consigned to hell”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
