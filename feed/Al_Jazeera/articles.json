            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Kenya prepares for its next general election, due in less than 20 months’ time, 2026 will prove to be a critical year. With local and global restraints on political violence being hollowed out at the very time when trust in the credibility of the election system is at an all-time low, serious trouble beckons unless urgent steps are taken.</p><p>Violence in Kenyan elections is rarely the product of that perennial bogeyman, tribalism. It is almost exclusively a state-generated phenomenon that requires a particular alignment of circumstances. Two matter above all else: first, whether the election itself is credible; second, whether the incumbent is running for re-election.</p><p>Since the reintroduction of multiparty politics in 1991, Kenya has had seven competitive presidential elections. It was only in four of them that significant violence was witnessed; in all four, the inevitably unpopular incumbent was running. In 2002, 2013 and 2022, when no incumbent was on the ballot, violence was comparatively muted, even where the credibility of the election itself was contested.</p><p>The lesson is clear. It is the efforts to improve the credibility of the election and to enforce institutional restraints on state actors that are the best safeguard.</p><p>Kenya has come some way in this regard since the conflagration that followed the disputed 2007 election. The 2010 constitution introduced checks on the wanton exercise of state power, most importantly an independent judiciary, which has proven a credible venue for settling election disputes. Reforms to the election system to enhance transparency, most evident in the 2022 elections, have also taken some of the sting out of the polls.</p><p>Today, however, that progress is at risk. And President William Ruto is running for re-election.</p><p>Following a long delay, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) was reconstituted in July last year, albeit not without controversy following the <a href=\"https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/ruto-ignores-court-order-appoints-iebc-officials-5077924#story\">president’s initial decision to ignore a court order</a> stopping the appointment of commissioners following a legal challenge to their suitability.</p><p>That stained the commission’s credibility from the very start. The shambolic and violent by-elections for dozens of empty seats of senators and national assembly members, which took place in November, further damaged public confidence in the commission as an independent referee. This needs urgent addressing.</p><p>But the credibility of the election is down to more than just the IEBC. The Kenyan media has an especially important role to play. For years, out of fear of antagonising those in power, major media houses have treated the announcement of vote tallies as an official function best left to electoral bodies. That timidity has repeatedly undermined public confidence in election outcomes.</p><p>The 2022 election was a missed opportunity. Even with polling-station results publicly available, Kenyan media appeared unable – or unwilling – to independently aggregate figures and explain what the numbers were saying in real time. In 2027, the media cannot continue to ignore its responsibilities. There is time to collaborate, rebuild capacity and invest in data journalism. They should prepare to independently verify results and call the election, even when that makes power uncomfortable.</p><p>Media weakness is also increasingly being exploited through online disinformation. And the tools are becoming far more powerful. Kenya is no stranger to election manipulation in the digital age. It was one of the testing grounds for Cambridge Analytica, whose microtargeting operations during the 2013 election helped normalise data-driven psychological campaigning long before the scandal broke globally.</p><p>Today, artificial intelligence raises the stakes dramatically. AI-driven disinformation can flood platforms with synthetic content, fabricate audio and video, impersonate trusted voices, and target communities with tailored narratives at speed and scale.</p><p>In environments where trust in institutions is already thin, disinformation does not merely mislead. It can destabilise. It can delegitimise results before votes are cast, provoke panic or mobilisation based on false claims, and provide justification for repression in the name of preserving public order. A strong, capable, reliable and effective media will be crucial in mitigating such impacts.</p><p>Regional and international institutions and pressures have also been critical in containing the violent appetites of Kenyan elites, but these are now in decay. Today’s global environment makes such restraint far less likely. Across East Africa, governments are normalising repression as elections approach. In neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda, authorities have acted with impunity to suppress dissent and election protests.</p><p>And this regional shift is occurring alongside a broader collapse in global accountability. Western backing for Israel’s genocide in Gaza has accelerated the erosion of international norms, undermined institutions such as the International Criminal Court, and created a permissive environment for malevolent actors.</p><p>Given these circumstances, Kenya must focus on shoring up its internal defences. Time is running out to insist on reforms to insulate independent state institutions from political interference. Though the Kriegler Commission, set up in the aftermath of the 2007/8 election, recommended that any changes to election rules should be concluded at least two years before the polls, we are already past that deadline.</p><p>Still, 2026 presents an opportunity to rebuild the coalitions that can mobilise citizen action as a bulwark against state repression. In the 1990s, these included civil society organisations, the church and the media.</p><p>The Gen Z protests showed that Kenyan youth can also be a potent political force and it is likely that we will see them out on the streets yet again this year. The question is whether their elders will join them in standing up against state machinations.</p><p>Violence next year is not inevitable. But preventing it requires urgent action to protect the gains in electoral transparency and mobilise popular action as a shield against abuse of state power.</p><p>The clock is ticking.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

US-based human rights activists say that more than 4,500 people have been killed. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the figures.</p><h2 id=\"economic-crisis\">Economic crisis</h2><p>Protests in past years, such as the unrest sparked by a fuel price hike in 2019 or the women-led demonstrations in 2022, were followed by the state dispensing subsidies and loosening up on social restrictions. But this time around, it has limited options for addressing the distress that sparked the recent demonstrations.</p><p>Due to decades of international sanctions, as well as mismanagement and corruption, the Iranian rial’s value has nose-dived, and oil revenues have shrunk. Inflation last year peaked at more than 42 percent, according to International Monetary Fund data. By comparison, the rate was at 6.8 in 2016 – a year after Iran and world powers signed a deal that curbed Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 – during his first term in office – and reimposed sanctions.</p><p>On top of that, Iran suffers from electricity outages and chronic water shortages, making life increasingly difficult for the average citizen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244210\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244210\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244210\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260115__92RT8F4__v1__HighRes__IranProtestRights-1768557870.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A wreckage of a burned bus is seen on a street.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A photograph shows the wreckage of a burned bus bearing a banner that reads ‘This was one of Tehran’s new buses that was paid for with the money of the people’s taxes’, in Tehran [File: Atta Kenare/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>To get some sanctions relief, Iran needs to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration. But that would require Khamenei making concessions on what have been Iran’s core foreign policy pillars, namely its nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and supporting a network of allies across the region.</p><p>They have been key components of Iran’s “forward defence” strategy – a military doctrine aimed at preventing fighting from reaching Iranian territory. Changes to any of these elements would represent a profound shift in the security architecture built up by Khamenei. While in the past, the supreme leader has shown openness to partially curbing the nuclear programme, concessions over missiles and the so-called <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">axis of resistance</a> have been non-negotiable.</p><p>“It is unclear whether Iran is willing to formally accept restrictions” on these three elements, said Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran analyst and editor of news site Amwaj.media. “As Trump has threatened a renewed bombing campaign if Iran resumes enrichment, Khamenei seems paralysed in his decision-making,” he added.</p><p>Trump has said that he wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, an option that Iran has ruled out, insisting that its enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p><p>Concerning support for non-state actors in the region, Iran has been working on reconfiguring that network following the war last June with Israel, said Halireza Azizi, visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.</p><p>Israel has, in the past few years, degraded the arsenal and decapitated the leadership of what was Iran’s strongest ally in the region, Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Non-state actors in Iraq have become more involved in that country’s political system and, therefore, more cautious, and the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria has collapsed. And finally, Iran itself was directly attacked by Israel, the first time it has faced a full-scale attack from its chief regional enemy.</p><p>After that war, a heated debate on the actual benefit of working with non-state actors ensued in Iran, Azizi said. The argument that prevailed was that Iranian soil had been struck only after regional allies were weakened, and not before.</p><p>“So the policy [now] is to double down and try to revive that network” with some modification, Azizi said.</p><p>The focus, he said, has shifted to working with smaller groups in Iraq, find new ways to transfer weapons to Hezbollah and rely more on the Houthis in Yemen. It is too soon, and information is too limited, to assess whether the protests and the threat of a US strike have changed that calculus, but official channels indicate that there have been no modifications.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4236041\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4236041\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4236041\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12T165753Z_831722910_RC2AXIABFPBF_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-1768318787.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C500&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iranian demonstrators gather in a street during a protest over the collapse of the currency's value, in Tehran, Iran, January 8, 2026.

At the height of the protests, tensions soared after Trump hinted that he was about to strike Iran over what he said was Iran’s brutal crackdown. But he toned down the rhetoric after <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">Gulf Arab nations</a> pushed him to refrain from attacking Iran – a move they fear would plunge the region into chaos.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump signalled that channels between Washington and Tehran were open. “Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk,” he said during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>But his remarks came as the US moves military assets to the Middle East, likely an attempt to strong-arm Iran into a deal. “We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use them,” Trump said on Friday.</p><p>Still, should Iran end up making major concessions, the perception of security and legitimacy may be hard to restore. For years, the implicit social contract between the Iranian people and the system has been based on the guarantee of security at the expense of social and political freedom. But that pillar of legitimacy was shattered by last year’s war with Israel, when at least 610 people were killed in Iran over 12 days.</p><p>“The social contract between state and society in Iran has withered over the decades, and with the disruptions to basic services over the past year amid electricity and water crises, the provision of security is now also under question,” Shabani said. “To ensure its longevity, the Islamic Republic is thus faced with the broader challenge of having to explain to the public what it can provide, and why it must continue to exist”.</p><p>According to Azizi, a transformation has already started with the political system moving from a clerical into a military leadership as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – an elite force established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – has grown into the country’s most powerful economic and political actor.</p><p>“After the death or removal of Khamenei, we are not going to see the Islamic Republic as we know it,” Azizi said.</p><p>“Whether that it’s gonna give more impetus to the people to come to the streets to initiate regime change, or it’s going to result in a Soviet-style scenario of regime transformation with the security establishment reemerging in a different form, that is an open question, but change is inevitable.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

An estimated 125 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, including the two latest casualties.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>US Southern Command, the military unit that oversees operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean Sea, reported that one survivor had yet to be recovered. It added that the US Coast Guard had been notified to activate its search-and-rescue operations.</p><p>“On Jan. 23, at the direction of [Secretary of Defense] Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” the command wrote in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/Southcom/status/2014825085425877224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.”</p><p>The deadly strike is the first such attack to take place in 2026: The last one took place on <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369758/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-31-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 31</a>.</p><p>And it is also the first to unfold since the US launched a full-scale military operation on January 3 in Venezuela to remove the country’s then-president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife Cilia Flores. The couple is now being held in a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, on charges of narcotics trafficking.</p><p>Trump’s increasingly aggressive actions in the Latin American region have sparked alarm among world leaders and human rights advocates, who have compared the boat bombings to extrajudicial killings.</p><h2 id=\"unknown-fate-for-survivors\">Unknown fate for survivors</h2><p>The treatment of survivors during such strikes has also elicited alarm.</p><p>One survivor from an October 27 attack went missing in the waves and is presumed dead. And during a December 30 <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369710/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-30-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attack</a>, Southern Command reported that eight survivors “abandoned their vessels” and jumped overboard before their boats could be sunk in a second strike.</p><p>Despite efforts by the US Coast Guard, the men were never found.</p><p>One of the biggest controversies came in late November, when The Washington Post revealed that the very first strike in the series, on September 2, resulted in two previously unknown survivors.</p><p>Those survivors were then killed in a follow-up “double-tap” strike as they clung to the wreckage of their boat.</p><p>Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle denounced the “double tap” as a possible crime, and pressure has mounted for the Trump administration to release video to the public depicting the second strike.</p><p>Only on one rare occasion have survivors been recovered from the Trump administration’s lethal boat strikes.</p><p>On October 16, the US military targeted a submersible vessel for bombing. Two men survived, one from Ecuador and one from Colombia, and they were repatriated to their home countries. Both men were reportedly released from custody without charges, as officials cited a lack of evidence to detain them.</p><h2 id=\"questionable-legal-justification\">Questionable legal justification</h2><p>The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the people on board the boats of being drug traffickers, though it has never offered any evidence to justify that claim.</p><p>In October, media reports emerged that the White House had issued a notice to Congress saying that the president had determined that the US was locked in an “armed conflict” with drug traffickers, whom it described as “unlawful combatants”.</p><p>Drug trafficking is a crime under international law, but not an act of armed aggression.</p><p>Without a forum in which to weigh evidence and ascertain guilt, experts at the United Nations and elsewhere have warned the killings could amount to international crimes.</p><p>“These attacks appear to be unlawful killings carried out by order of a Government, without judicial or legal process allowing due process of law,” a group of UN experts said in a statement in November.</p><p>They added that the bombing campaign violates “fundamental international human rights law prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of life”, since the attacks were not carried out “within the context of national self-defence” nor against “individuals posing an imminent threat”.</p><p>US groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, have sued the Trump administration to release a secret opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel that it uses to justify the attacks. But that legal case remains ongoing.</p><p>The US also faces questions about the manner in which it conducts the strikes, after a report in The New York Times this month claimed it had disguised the aircraft in the September 2 attack as a civilian plane.</p><p>That could explain why survivors appeared to wave at it for help before being killed in the “double tap”, according to the report. Under international law, such deception can be considered “perfidy”, a serious war crime.</p><p>No victims have ever been publicly identified by the US, raising additional concerns.</p><p>Families from countries including Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have claimed that their loved ones were among those killed, and many insist the deceased were merely fishermen, not drug traffickers.</p><p>In December, the family of missing fisherman Alejandro Carranza <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/1/16/inevitably-difficult-inside-a-familys-fight-against-the-us-boat-strikes\">was the first to file</a> an international complaint against the US for its boat strikes.</p><p>It appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to stop the bombings, investigate the circumstances and seek compensation on the family’s behalf.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the vote had yet to be ​published in the country’s official gazette as of late Friday, a necessary step before ‌the decision becomes legally valid.</p><p>The TPC was established in 2024 as the country’s top executive body, a response to a political crisis stretching back to the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. It quickly devolved into infighting, questions over its membership and allegations of corruption.</p><p>The council ousted Prime Minister Garry Conille just six months after being formed, selecting Fils-Aime as his replacement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite being tasked with developing a framework for federal elections, the council ended up postponing a planned series of votes that would have selected a new president by February.</p><p>Instead, tiered federal elections are now expected to start in August. Meanwhile, the council’s mandate is set to dissolve on February 7.</p><p>On Friday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he had spoken to Fils-Aime and “emphasised the importance of his continued tenure as Haiti’s Prime Minister to combat terrorist gangs and stabilise the island”.</p><p>Rubio added that the TPC “must be dissolved by February 7 without corrupt actors seeking to interfere in Haiti’s path to elected governance for their own gains”.</p><p>In addition, on social media, the US embassy in Haiti <a href=\"https://x.com/USEmbassyHaiti/status/2014683729713627188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> several statements in both French and Haitian Creole, warning that the politicians could face a steep cost.</p><p>“To the corrupt politicians who support gangs and sow trouble in the country: the United States will ensure they pay a heavy price,” the statement said, though some social media users interpreted the Creole phrase “pri final” or “final price” to imply even more dire consequences.</p><p>The volley of stark statements is being seen as a reflection of US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">increasingly aggressive</a> actions in Latin America.</p><p>The heightened tensions come one day after the US embassy in Haiti <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/will-act-accordingly-us-threatens-action-against-haitian-council\">warned</a> that Washington would “regard any effort to change the composition of the government by the non-elected Transitional Presidential Council” as an “effort to undermine” Haiti’s security.</p><p>The US has not clearly articulated its issues with the council, but it had previously imposed visa restrictions on an unnamed Haitian official for “supporting gangs and other criminal organizations, and obstructing the government of Haiti’s fight against terrorist gangs designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>TPC member and economist Fritz Alphonse Jean later <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-imposes-visa-sanctions-against-haitian-official-on-governing-council\">revealed</a> he had been the one targeted with the visa restrictions.</p><p>Jean, however, denied the US allegations and claimed the council was being pressured to acquiesce to the wishes of both the US and Canada.</p><p>The latest back-and-forth comes as more than 1.4 million Haitians remain internally displaced due to gang violence, with millions suffering from a lack of access to sufficient food as transport routes remain constricted.</p><p>Earlier this week, a United Nations report said that an estimated 8,100 people were killed in violence in the country between January and November of last year, a major uptick from 5,600 killed overall in 2024.</p><p>In a statement, Carlos Ruiz-Massieu, who leads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), said the country had entered a “critical phase” in the push to restore democratic institutions that can properly respond to the nation’s woes.</p><p>“Let us be clear: The country no longer has time to waste on prolonged internal struggles,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
