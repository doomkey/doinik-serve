The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,” Starmer’s top aide Morgan McSweeney said in a statement on Sunday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,” he added.</p><p>Labour members of parliament had called for McSweeney’s resignation after new <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/how-epstein-mandelson-files-rocked-the-uk-government\">evidence</a> about Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein was revealed in the latest tranche of documents and photos from the investigation into the American financier were released by the US Department of Justice. The lawmakers blamed McSweeney for the appointment of Mandelson and the damage caused by the publication of the crude exchanges between him and Epstein.</p><p>McSweeney, 48, who was a protege and friend of Mandelson, was accused by some Labour lawmakers and his political opponents of failing to ensure that there were proper background checks when the ambassador was appointed.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, Starmer said it had been “an honour” to work with McSweeney, who had held the role of chief of staff since October 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mandelson-s-payout\">Mandelson’s payout</h2><p>Mandelson was sacked by Starmer in September over his friendship with Epstein and last week also quit the Labour Party and House of Lords, the upper chamber of the UK Parliament. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is reviewing an exit payment made to him after he was fired.</p><p>Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics and the Labour Party for decades, received an estimated payout of between 38,750 pounds and 55,000 pounds ($52,000 to $74,000) after only seven months in the job, according to a report in the Sunday Times newspaper.</p><p>Documents released on January 30 by the US Justice Department appeared to show that Mandelson had also allegedly leaked confidential UK government information to Epstein when he was a British minister, including during the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>The Foreign Office said in a statement that it has launched a review into Mandelson’s severance payment “in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation”.</p><p>Mandelson’s lawyers have said he “regrets, and will regret until his dying day, that he believed Epstein’s lies about his criminality”.</p><p>“Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019,” said a spokesperson for the law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represents Mandelson.</p><p>“He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved,” the law firm added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"starmer-s-political-future-in-peril\">Starmer’s political future in peril?</h2><p>The departure of McSweeney has thrown the future direction of the government into doubt, less than two years after the Labour Party won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history.</p><p>With polls showing Starmer is already hugely unpopular with voters, some in his own party are openly questioning his judgement and future, and it remains to be seen whether McSweeney’s exit will be enough to silence his critics.</p><p>Cabinet minister Pat McFadden earlier insisted Starmer should remain in office despite his “terrible mistake” in appointing Mandelson.</p><p>The close Starmer ally told broadcasters the party should stick with the prime minister.</p><p>“He [Starmer] should be realistic and accept that this has been a terrible story, that this appointment was a terrible mistake,” McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, told BBC television.</p><p>He said the real blame lay “squarely with Peter Mandelson”, who put himself forward for the job despite knowing the extent of his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>But according to a report by the Sunday Telegraph, Starmer’s deputy, David Lammy, has become the first cabinet minister to appear to distance himself from Starmer.</p><p>The deputy prime minister had not been in favour of appointing Mandelson due to his known links to Epstein, the report quoted friends of Lammy as saying.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She arrived on a visitor’s visa, staying with her mother, a US citizen, in Paterson, New Jersey, home to one of the largest Arab communities in the country.</p><p>She later transitioned from a tourist visa to a student visa, according to her habeas corpus petition.</p><p>After her mother applied for Kordia to remain in the US as the relative of a citizen, her green card application was approved in 2021. However, she received incorrect advice from a teacher that led to her student visa expiring in 2022, according to her lawyers.</p><p>Before her arrest, Kordia worked as a server at a Middle Eastern restaurant on Palestine Way in New Jersey and helped to care for her autistic half-brother.</p><p>Kordia was moved to protest against Israel’s war due to personal loss. Since the start of the war in October 2023, Kordia said, more than 200 of her relatives have been killed.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 170,000 in a war that human rights groups, a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars said amounts to genocide. Since a “ceasefire” began in October, Israel has killed more than 500 Palestinians and continues to impose curbs on the entry of aid into Gaza.</p><p>If deported, Kordia would be handed over to the Israeli government.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3852409\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852409\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-05-07T232621Z_1067079386_RC28DEAXD5K3_RTRMADP_3_USA-COLUMBIA-PROTESTS-1753273385.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pro-Palestinian protesters take over Butler Library on the campus of Columbia University on May 7, 2025 [Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-kordia-arrested\">Why was Kordia arrested?</h2><p>She was first arrested in April 2024 during a protest outside the gates of Columbia University, but the case was soon dropped.</p><p>On March 13, 2025, Kordia showed up at the ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what she believed to be routine immigration questions. She was detained there, “thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles [more than 2,400km] away”, Kordia wrote in the USA Today newspaper last month.</p><p>Kordia was neither a student at Columbia University nor a part of political circles.</p><p>“Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives,” she wrote in USA Today.</p><p>Today, Kordia is the only person who remains in detention from the Columbia campus demonstrations. She has been held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.</p><p>A leader of the protests, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student with Algerian citizenship and a US green card, and others have been released. Khalil, however, is still in a legal battle to remain in the US with his American wife and child. Last month, an appeals court panel <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-court-hands-trump-victory-against-pro-palestine-activist-mahmoud-khalil\">dismissed</a> a lawsuit Khalil filed challenging his detention and deportation order.

I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking,” Kordia wrote. “Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.”</p><p>An immigration judge has called for Kordia’s release twice. However, it has been repeatedly blocked through a series of procedural and administrative moves.</p><p>“[The] Trump administration has exploited rarely used procedural loopholes to keep me confined, a practice now being challenged in federal district courts across the country, with many finding the practice unconstitutional,” Kordia wrote.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3572245\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3572245\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3572245\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10T213424Z_864996646_RC2LADATKEHN_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-COLUMBIA-1741720849.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold banners as they march during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia University, in New York City, U.S., March 10, 2025.

That really resonates with me,” Kazushige Cho, 54, told Reuters news agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, Niigata resident Mineko Mori, 74, padding through the snow with her dog, said she worried that Takaichi’s tax cuts could saddle future generations with ‌an even bigger burden.</p><h2 id=\"she-can-push-any-legislation\">‘She can push any legislation’</h2><p>Craig Mark, a lecturer at Hosei University, says Takaichi’s apparent success in early election results likely gives the LDP the ability to “override the opposition parties”.</p><p>“Essentially, she can push through any legislation she wants, whether it’s <a href=\"/news/2022/12/16/pacifist-japan-unveils-unprecedented-320bn-military-build-up\">the record budget</a> that was recently approved or defence spending,” Mark told Al Jazeera from the capital Tokyo.</p><p>It is also the “greatest chance” for Takaichi to change the country’s image as a pacifist nation, he added. Japan’s post-World War II constitution does not officially recognise the military, and limits it to nominally self-defensive capabilities.</p><p>The head of Japan’s top business lobby, Keidanren, welcomed the result as restoring political stability.</p><p>“Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” Yoshinobu Tsutsui said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-tensions\">China tensions</h2><p>China will also be keeping a close eye on ‌the results.</p><p>Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.</p><p>A strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster military defence, which Beijing has cast as an attempt to revive Japan’s militaristic past.</p><p>“Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk.</p><p>“China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place – and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

One troy ounce is equal to 31.1035 grammes.</p><p>At $5,000 per troy ounce, 1 gramme of gold is worth about $160, and a standard 400-troy-ounce (12.44kg) gold bar costs $2m.</p><p>Troy ounces are different from regular ounces, which weigh 28.35 grammes and are used to measure everyday items including foods.</p><h3>Purity (in karats)</h3><p>Karat or carat (abbreviated as “K” or “ct”) measures the purity of a gold item. Pure gold is 24 karats, while lower karats such as 22, 18, and 9 indicate that the gold is mixed with less expensive metals like silver, copper, or zinc.</p><p>To determine the purity of gold, jewellers are required to stamp a number onto the item, such as 24K or a numeric value like 999, which indicates it is 99.9 percent pure. For example, 18K gold will typically have a stamp of 750, signifying that it is 75 percent pure.</p><p>Some typical values include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>24 karat – 99.9% purity</strong> – A deep orange colour, is very soft, never tarnishes and is most commonly used for investment coins or bars</li>\n<li><strong>22 karat  – 91.6% purity</strong> – A rich orange colour, moderate durability, resists tarnishing and most often used for luxury jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>18 karat – 75% purity</strong> – A warm yellow colour, high durability, will have some dulling over time and most often used in fine jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>9 karat – 37.5%</strong> <strong>purity</strong> – A pale yellow colour, has the highest durability, dulls over time, used in affordable jewellery</li>\n</ul><p>Other karat amounts such as 14k (58.3% purity) and 10k (41.7% purity) are often sold in different markets around the world.</p><p>When you buy jewellery, the price usually depends on the day’s gold spot price, how much it costs to make, and any taxes.</p><p>If you know the item’s exact weight in grammes and the gold’s purity in karats, you can calculate the craftsmanship cost on top of that.</p><p>You typically cannot negotiate the spot gold price, but you can often haggle over the craftsmanship costs.</p><h2 id=\"the-price-of-gold-has-quadrupled-over-the-past-10-years\">The price of gold has quadrupled over the past 10 years</h2><p>Gold has been valued for thousands of years, serving various functions, from currency to jewellery. The precious metal is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or market volatility.</p><p>Up until 1971, the United States dollar was physically defined by a specific weight of gold. Under the classical gold standard, for nearly a century, from 1834 until 1933, you could walk into a bank and exchange $20 for an ounce of gold.</p><p>In 1933, amid the Great Depression, the price was raised to $35 per ounce to stimulate the economy.</p><p>In 1971, under President Richard Nixon, gold was decoupled from the dollar, and its price began to be determined by market forces.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, the price of gold has quadrupled from $1,250 in 2016 to around $5,000 today.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Timeline-of-price-of-gold-1770547790.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Timeline of price of gold-1770547790\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-price-of-gold-determined-in-different-countries\">How is the price of gold determined in different countries?</h2><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Gold is priced globally based on the spot market, where one troy ounce is traded in US dollars on exchanges such as London and New York.

A United Nations Development Programme report released in November painted a grim picture: The debris generated by the war creates an “unprecedented obstacle” that could take seven years to clear – and that is only under “ideal conditions”.</p><p>“Gaza stands as one of the most devastated places on earth,” the report said.</p><p>Faced with this reality, Palestinian experts rejected the top-down models for reconstruction proposed in Davos. Abdel Rahman Kitana, professor of architecture at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, pointed to the <a href=\"https://gaza-city.org/media-center/war_details/59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Phoenix Plan”</a>, a framework developed by the Union of Gaza Strip Municipalities, as a viable local alternative.</p><p>“Reconstruction is not just about restoring what was destroyed. It is about reshaping life,” Kitana told Al Jazeera Arabic as he warned against disconnected solutions for Gaza. He instead advocated for an “integrated approach” rooted in the Phoenix Plan, under which rubble is not treated as waste but as a resource that could be recycled for land reclamation.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"خبير هندسة معمارية يوضح للجزيرة سبل إعادة إعمار غزة والاستفادة من الركام\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW2WYUrAbLg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Kitana insisted that any successful plan for Gaza’s reconstruction must be bottom-up. “We cannot succeed without the people themselves. … They know their needs and their dreams,” he said, warning that ignoring local agencies will lead to a “fragile, alienating environment”.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-dual-use-rule\">Israel’s ‘dual use’ rule</h2><p>However, both the UN’s seven-year reconstruction timeline and the “Phoenix Plan” face a critical hurdle: Israel’s “<a href=\"/news/2025/2/3/gaza-authorities-plead-for-tents-accuse-israel-of-obstructing-aid\">dual use</a>” list.</p><p>Historically, Israel has banned items such as fertilisers and steel pipes under the pretext that they could be used for military purposes. Today, that list has expanded to include more essential items, including oxygen cylinders, cancer medicines and water filters.</p><p>Jabareen says the blockade is no longer a pretext for security but a “philosophy of governance”.</p><p>“Israel has turned the ‘dual use’ excuse into a mechanism of indefinite delay,” he said.</p><p>By requiring project-by-project approval for every sack of cement, Israel ensures that reconstruction remains a perpetual “project” that keeps donor countries and agencies exhausted and the Palestinian administration in “a state of constant begging”, Jabareen said.</p><h2 id=\"silent-demographic-engineering\">‘Silent demographic engineering’</h2><p>While Israel blocks key materials on the ground, the Trump administration is creating a “political fantasy” abroad, experts said. Gaza’s Board of Peace, pushed by Trump, promises a $10bn gross domestic product boost to Gaza and a “New Rafah” with 100,000 housing units.</p><p>Jabareen viewed the plans, which include “waterfront properties” and “industrial zones”, as a form of “silent demographic engineering”.</p><p>“They are trying to shift the Palestinian cause from a national rights issue to a real estate problem,” he said. The goal, he argues, is to design a Gaza that is “economically useful” to the region but “nationally hollowed out”.</p><p>By focusing on “investments” and “tourism” while ignoring the rubble and the mass graves, the plan seeks to “legitimise a political fantasy”, Jabareen said. “If you can’t displace the Palestinian by force, you displace his idea of home by re-engineering his space.”</p><p>So who will eventually build this “New Gaza”? Jabareen warned of a “privatisation of occupation” even if Israeli companies do not enter Gaza directly.</p><p>“Reconstruction is a chain of indirect profits,” he noted, adding that the logistics of inspection, the security firms managing the crossings and the insurance companies covering the risks will all generate revenue for Israeli or allied firms.</p><p>The contracts for reconstruction themselves become a political filter. “This creates an international ‘market of obedience’,” Jabareen said. “The donor who objects is excluded, and the contractor who asks questions on sovereignty is replaced.”</p><h2 id=\"silent-transfer\">‘Silent transfer’</h2><p>Jabareen said the most dangerous aspect of such a policy is the “weaponisation of time itself”.</p><p>With UN assessments indicating that removing debris alone could last until 2032 and a full reconstruction of Gaza stretching to 2040, the “wait” becomes a policy of displacement.</p><p>“Time decomposes societies,” Jabareen said.</p><p>He said Israel is betting on “rational emigration” – after living for years in tents, Palestinians will leave, not because they were forced by tanks, but because they were exhausted by fears over their future.</p><p>“The long wait is not condemned by the international community. Israel realises that bombing brings condemnation, but bureaucratic delay brings only silence,” Jabareen said. “If the fighter jets failed to displace them, the waiting might succeed.”</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who pays to rebuild Gaza after Israel's devastating war? | Counting the Cost\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXYBb_7_Esk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p></div></div></body></html>"

We are not going to collapse.”</p><p>The government says it will prioritise available fuel for essential services – public health, food production and defence – and push the installation of solar-based renewable energy sector and incentives therein.

Cuba relied on foreign allies for oil shipments, such as Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela.</p><p>However, after the US forces abducted Venezuelan President Maduro, Washington blocked any Venezuelan oil from going to Cuba. Trump now says the Cuban government is ready to fall.</p><p>Under Trump, Washington has pivoted to the Western Hemisphere, which it wants to dominate. The military actions in Venezuela, the pledge to take over Greenland and changing the government in Cuba are part of the new policy.</p><p>Last month, Trump signed an executive order – labelling Cuba a threat to national security – imposing tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to the island nation. Further pressure on the Mexican government reportedly led to oil stocks reaching a record low in Cuba.</p><p>“It looks like it’s something that’s just not going to be able to survive,” Trump told reporters last month, when questioned about the Cuban economy. “It is a failed nation.”</p><p>Havana has rejected accusations that it poses a threat to US security. Last week, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling for dialogue.</p><p>“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence. Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law,” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/cuba-denies-security-threat-accusations-as-us-raises-pressure\">a statement from the ministry said</a> on February 2.</p><p>Trump’s goals in Cuba remain unclear; however, US officials have noted on multiple occasions that they would like to see the government change.</p><p>Responding to a question during a US Senate hearing on Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We would like to see the regime there change. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to make a change, but we would love to see a change.”</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, is one of the most powerful figures in Trump’s administration.</p><p>“The Cuban-American lobby, which Rubio represents, is one of the most powerful foreign policy lobbies in the United States today,” Ed Augustin, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera’s <em>The Take</em>.</p><p>“In the new Trump administration, [with] an unprecedented number of Cuban Americans, the lobbyists have become the policymakers,” he said, adding that Rubio has built firm control over the lobby.</p><p>On January 31, Trump told reporters, “It doesn’t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal. So Cuba would be free again.”</p><p>He said Washington would make a deal with Cuba, but offered no clarity on what that means.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-28T185841Z_1827449538_RC2FKHAQKB6K_RTRMADP_3_STORM-MELISSA-CUBA-1770541565.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"castro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman walks past a building with an image of former President Fidel Castro as people prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Melissa in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, October 27, 2025 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"history-of-us-cuba-relations\">History of US-Cuba relations</h2><p>Since Fidel Castro overthrew the pro-US regime in the Cuban revolution in 1959, the country has been under US embargo. Decades of sanctions have denied Cuba access to global markets, making even supply medicines difficult.</p><p>Castro nationalised US-owned properties, mainly the oil sector, and Washington responded with trade restrictions that soon became a full economic embargo that continues to this day, undermining Cuba’s economy.</p><p>The US also cut diplomatic ties with Havana, and three years later, a missile crisis almost brought Washington and the erstwhile USSR, an ally of Cuba, to the brink of nuclear war.</p><p>In 2014, Washington and Havana restored ties after 50 years. Two years later, US President Barack Obama travelled to Havana to meet Raul Castro.</p><p>However, during his first term as president, Trump reversed the historic move in 2017. Since then, the US has reimposed a raft of sanctions against Cuba, especially economic restrictions, leading to one of the worst economic crises in the island nation’s history.

This is a logical approach, and Hamas — through mediators Qatar, Turkiye and Egypt, and through indirect dialogues with the Americans via the mediators — has reached, or there has been, an understanding of Hamas’s vision on that. Yes, this is something that requires great effort, not an approach of disarmament.”</p><p>United States President Donald Trump last month sought to achieve a “comprehensive” demilitarisation of Hamas, threatening the Palestinian group with repercussions if it fails to do so.

The UAE-backed southern separatists briefly took over two Yemeni provinces bordering Saudi Arabia, drawing military action from Riyadh. The events have strained ties between the two regional powers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The cabinet announcement has triggered mixed reactions and a war of words with some seeing a glimmer of hope and a step towards establishing government authority while others view it as a redistribution of power and wealth among the country’s rival elites.</p><p>The 35-member cabinet, which has 10 more members compared with the previous cabinet, has representations from diverse professional backgrounds, including administration, economics, law and academia.</p><p>Yaseen Al-Tamimi, a Yemeni political researcher, said the large size of the government represents a forced return to the era of what she called an “appeasement” policy, which attempts to placate different groups and regions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4243579\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4243579\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696997f8-1768527864.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yemeni Foreign Minister Shaya Mohsin Zindani attends a news conference.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani says the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens [File: Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Although such a large number of ministries places a heavy burden on the budget, the current phase in the country necessitates this type of appeasement, Al-Tamimi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The different political groups in the country need to feel that they have been given a share of power to push them to act in line with the government’s agenda, according to Al-Tamimi.</p><p>“I see this formation of the new cabinet as satisfactory. It reflected the amount of effort that was made over the past weeks to appear with this composition of competent people with a certain amount of political and national responsibility.”</p><p>In a statement on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani said the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens, combating corruption and developing institutional performance to contribute to ending Houthi control of large parts of the country, restoring state institutions and consolidating stability.</p><p>The PLC took control of southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia last month while northern Yemen, where most of the population is located, is under the control of the Iran-backed Houthi group.</p><p>The Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and toppled the UN-recognised government in February 2015. The PLC governs from the southern port of Aden.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-needed-for-the-new-cabinet-to-succeed\">What is needed for the new cabinet to succeed</h2><p>Mohammed Al-Samei, a Taiz-based political journalist, expressed hope after the new ministers were appointed. He described them as competent and deserving of their posts and said their success will depend on how united they are.</p><p>“The success of this government remains contingent on the existence of a firm political will from the prime minister, the Presidential Leadership Council and the various political forces. The new cabinet will not achieve true success unless these parties unite to serve the nation, away from side conflicts,” Al-Samei told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Beyond the cabinet’s domestic political will, Al-Samei indicated that continued Saudi financial support will be indispensable.</p><p>“Today, the new government faces serious challenges, including providing services and improving the livelihoods of citizens. Overcoming these challenges will be possible with the support of Yemen’s political process sponsors, particularly Saudi Arabia,” Al-Samei added.</p><p>A day before the announcement of the new cabinet, Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani noted that Saudi Arabia had expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in Yemen’s south, including the salaries of soldiers.</p><p>Al-Eryani said the move aims to restructure the military forces, make them subordinate to the state and receive their instructions from the supreme commander of the armed forces, Rashad Al-Alimi, who is the chairman of the PLC.</p><p>Vice Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman, who is in Doha to attend the Al Jazeera Forum, also pointed to the role Saudi Arabia is playing in providing financial help to the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The Saudi government has taken the responsibility for one year. This is not going to be enough unless we have regular functioning of infrastructure operations and security,” Noman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said the biggest challenge the government is going to face in the coming days is to restructure the security forces, which he added needed to be brought under the Ministries of Interior and Defence.</p><p>Without stability, the government cannot work smoothly, Noman said, adding that only after security is established can infrastructure and services work and government functions resume.</p><p>The diplomat said the government has to be resolute to do its job or it will face a great failure, which would create a vacuum. “And the vacuum will be filled by AQ [al-Qaeda] and ISIS [ISIL] and other nonstate actors operating in Yemen.”</p><p>The new government has to also address the mounting humanitarian challenges facing Yemen, where about 18 million Yemenis – about half the population – face acute food shortages while tens of thousands are facing famine-like conditions.</p><h2 id=\"women-s-representation\">Women’s representation</h2><p>Unlike the previous cabinets, the new cabinet includes three women, sparking positive reactions from activists and civil society members.</p><p>Afrah Al-Zuba has been named the minister of planning and international cooperation. Ishraq Al-Maqatri is the new minister of legal affairs, and Ahed Jaasous has been appointed minister of state for women’s affairs.</p><p>“Today is a significant political moment. The newly formed cabinet includes women in key and influential positions,” Najiba Al-Naggar, a Yemeni community and human rights activist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not a minor detail. It is a political indicator and a clear message about the direction of this phase. It signifies recognition of women’s competence and indicates that the state has begun to treat women’s participation as a constitutional right, not as temporary appeasement.”</p><p>Fatima Saleh, a university graduate in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that the war has marginalised women’s political role.</p><p>“I have not heard a woman minister for years. The announcement of three women ministers in this new cabinet is a proud moment for girls and women in Yemen,” Saleh said.</p><p>She acknowledged that she and millions of women in northern Yemen are unlikely to get a direct benefit, but the move is an indicator that the leadership of the UN-recognised government does not “underestimate women as other radical groups” do in Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-public-divide-in-the-south\">The public divide in the south</h2><p>In southern Yemen, where the public remains sharply divided over Saudi Arabia’s role, sentiments about the new cabinet have been mixed. Southern separatists, led by STC, have been seeking sovereignty for the south.</p><p>Ahmed Maher, a journalist from Aden, said it is too early to judge the government, indicating its performance will determine its credibility.</p><p>“The formation of the government is a new beginning, not the end,” he said. “Those who work for Yemen and its citizens will remain while those who persist in their racism and mistakes will depart.”</p><p>On Saturday, the Hadramout Tribal Confederation and the Inclusive Hadramout Conference – two tribal blocs in Hadramout governorate, which PLC forces retook from the STC in early January – expressed in a statement their disapproval of the formation of the new government, saying the cabinet formation mechanism has “failed to bring about any fundamental change to the existing reality, given the absence of a just and comprehensive political solution that addresses all pending issues”.</p><p>The two tribal groups reaffirm “their unwavering commitment to the Hadramout self-governance vision as the strategic option that establishes lasting stability and sustainable peace”.</p><p>This statement was issued after southern separatists protested on Friday in Seyoun, a city in Hadramout, calling for independence and pledging to continue their struggle against Yemen’s UN-recognised government and Saudi intervention in southern Yemen.</p><p>In December, southern separatists backed by the UAE took over the Hadramout and al-Mahra governorates, reaching the Saudi border. The kingdom considered such a move a threat to its national security. Saudi-backed fighters have ‌since largely retaken those areas.</p><p>Abdulkareem Nasser, a southern separatist in Seyoun, said the new cabinet does not represent the southern people, who have their own flag, vision and identity.</p><p>“We [southern separatists] will continue our struggle and will not accept the agenda of this government and its sponsor [Saudi Arabia],” he said.</p><p>“Our demand is clear: an independent state. We cannot abandon an independent state for water and electricity services. No government can persuade or force us to give up on our aspirations,” Nasser said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reviving-unity\">Reviving unity</h2><p>Although the members of the new cabinet belong to different regions and political groups, Al-Samei maintained that healing Yemen’s damaged unity remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>“The war has eroded the country’s unity. The status quo separation between the south and the north has been ongoing for years, and the southerners are not fully united. It is a massive mission for the new government to tackle these challenges,” Al-Samei said.</p><p>“If the new government is capable of stabilising the south and pushing into the north to recapture it from the Houthis, that could mean Yemen’s unity will be revived.”</p><p>Houthis have not recognised the authority of the PLC, saying they are the legitimate government in the country. In the Houthis’ eyes, the Saudi-backed government officials are “mercenaries”.</p><p>Abdullah Ali, a Houthi fighter in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that it is the people who grant the leaders legitimacy, not the UN or Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“Our leaders live among their people, lead from inside and bear all the hardships, so their leadership is legitimate. Any government imposed on the people by foreign players is illegitimate, and fighting it is a duty,” Ali said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
