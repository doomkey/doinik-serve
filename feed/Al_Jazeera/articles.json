            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>United States President Donald Trump’s second administration has introduced a bold and unconventional strategy for the Middle East. The administration intends to recalibrate US influence in a region historically scarred by conflict, prioritising regional stability through economic strength and military consolidation by asserting a stronger, business-minded US presence.</p><p>At the centre of Trump’s ambitious goal is what the new US envoy to Iraq, Mark Savaya, described as his goal to “make Iraq great again”. This approach moves away from traditional endless war tactics towards a transactional, results-oriented diplomacy that aims to restore Iraqi sovereignty and economic vitality. It could be the “great gamble” for Trump, who seeks an Iraq that serves as a stable, sovereign regional hub rather than a battleground for foreign interests.</p><p>Trump’s primary plans and wishes for Iraq involve a twofold mission: consolidating all armed forces under the command of the legitimate state and drastically reducing the influence of malign foreign players, most notably Iran. The administration seeks to open Iraqi markets to international investment, upgrade the country’s infrastructure, and secure the independence of its energy sector. Hence, the plan is to ground a genuine partnership that respects Iraq’s unity while ensuring that it is no longer a central node for militia activity or external interference.</p><h2 id=\"militias-and-political-gridlock\">Militias and political gridlock</h2><p>This assertive US strategy lands directly in a highly contested and fractured political environment in Iraq, which is less a single state than a patchwork of competing powers. The heart of the problem lies not just in parliament, but also in the persistent shadow influence of armed factions and militias that often operate outside the formal chain of state command. Those groups were among the biggest winners in the November 2025 elections.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Now the ongoing government negotiations have thrown a stark light on these non-state actors.</p><p>Their power raises crucial concerns for the future: How can Iraq enforce the law and, crucially, attract the foreign investment needed for revival if armed groups challenge state authority? The consolidation of the country’s armed forces under complete state control is an urgent necessity, underscored by rising regional tensions and security threats.</p><p>Moreover, the path to achieving genuine stability is severely obstructed by entrenched political interests.</p><p>For Iraq to achieve stability, it must urgently strengthen its institutional frameworks and clearly establish a separation of powers. Yet, many political parties seem more focused on maintaining control over lucrative state resources than on implementing the meaningful reforms the country desperately needs. The result is a governance model struggling to stand firm amid the crosscurrents of competing loyalties and power grabs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"washington-s-play\">Washington’s play</h2><p>To achieve these high-stakes goals, Trump has bypassed traditional diplomatic channels by appointing Mark Savaya as the US special envoy to Iraq on October 19. Such an appointment signals a shift towards “deal-making” diplomacy. Savaya’s mission is to navigate the complex political turmoil following Iraq’s parliamentary elections to steer the country towards a stable transition. His job is to bridge the gap between institutional support and massive financial investment, acting as a direct representative of Trump’s business-centric foreign policy.</p><p>Savaya is an Iraqi-born, Detroit-based businessman lacking the traditional diplomatic background; his experience is rooted in the private sector in the cannabis industry, but he gained political prominence as an active supporter of Trump’s campaign in Michigan.</p><p>He played a key role in the delicate negotiations that secured the release of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-russian-captive-in-iraq-tsurkov-was-freed-in-exchange-deal-report\">Elizabeth Tsurkov</a>, the Israeli-Russian academic and Princeton University student who had been kidnapped by an Iraqi militia for more than two years.</p><p>Savaya’s communal and ethnic ties have given him significant access to Iraqi power centres that traditional diplomats often lack.</p><h2 id=\"the-iran-factor\">The Iran factor</h2><p>Iraq’s position in a geopolitical tug-of-war is compounding the internal struggles, forced to balance its critical relationships with two giants: the US and <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/31/us-pressure-may-break-iranian-influence-in-iraq\">Iran</a>. On the one hand, Washington’s objective is clear: it wants to bolster Iraq’s sovereignty while simultaneously pushing back against the dominance of powerful, often Iran-backed, militias. The US believes that allowing these armed groups too much sway could leave the nation isolated and wreck its fragile economic stability.</p><p>But Iranian influence remains a formidable and enduring force. Tehran views Iraq not just as a neighbour but also as a crucial strategic ally for projecting its power across the entire region. <a href=\"/news/2019/4/6/us-to-label-irans-revolutionary-guard-corps-a-terrorist-group\">The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)</a> has been actively working to maintain unity among key Shia factions in Baghdad. This move clearly signals Iran’s deep and enduring interest in shaping Iraq’s political alignment and its future path. Iraq must therefore navigate this high-stakes balancing act to survive.</p><p>Savaya’s mission unfolds at a time when Iran’s regional “<a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">axis of resistance</a>” is under unprecedented pressure. Having already lost their primary foothold in Syria after the fall of the Assad regime in late 2024, and seeing Hezbollah’s political and military standing in Lebanon severely decimated by the 2025 conflict with Israel, Iranian proxies now face the very real prospect of losing their grip on Iraq too.</p><p>In Lebanon, a new government is committed to regaining the state’s monopoly on the use of force, leaving Hezbollah increasingly isolated. This regional retreat means that for Tehran, maintaining influence in Baghdad is a final, desperate stand to remain a relevant regional power.</p><h2 id=\"other-regional-actors\">Other regional actors</h2><p>The success of Trump’s gamble also depends on the roles of other regional players. Turkiye has recently recalibrated its strategy to integrate Iraq into ad hoc regional trade and security frameworks, effectively diluting Iran’s centrality. Simultaneously, Gulf monarchies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are emerging as key economic and security partners for Baghdad, offering an alternative to reliance on Iran.</p><p>However, these regional actors also bring their own agendas — such as Turkiye’s focus on containing Kurdish movements — which may conflict with US objectives. If Savaya can successfully align these diverse regional interests with Trump’s plan, he may fundamentally rewrite Iraq’s turbulent future.</p><h2 id=\"a-realist-pragmatism\">A realist pragmatism</h2><p>The “Make Iraq Great Again” strategy reflects a pragmatic reassertion of US interests within the anarchic international system, prioritising Washington’s security and economic power over idealistic goals.</p><p>By appointing Savaya — an unconventional, business-oriented envoy — the Trump administration is employing “transactional realism”, utilising economic diplomacy and personal ties as strategic tools to pull Iraq away from Iran’s orbit. This approach views the US-Iran rivalry as a zero-sum game of power politics, where integrating Iraq’s armed forces under centralised state control is fundamental to restoring a state-centric order and sidelining non-state militias that currently feed Tehran’s regional influence.</p><p>The new US envoy to Iraq has made clear that “there is no place for armed groups in a fully sovereign Iraq”. His calls resonated with Iraqi officials and militia leaders alike – now at least three militias close to Iran have publicly agreed to disarm. However, other groups have yet to do the same, while rejecting the call from the outset.</p><p>However, this high-stakes attempt to shift the regional balance of power faces a significant “security dilemma”, as aggressive moves to diminish Iranian influence may trigger a violent defensive response from Tehran to protect its remaining strategic assets. While the strategy seeks to exploit a regional shift – leveraging the weakened state of Iranian proxies in Syria and Lebanon – it must contend with the “hybrid” power of Iraqi militias and the narrow self-interests of neighbouring players like Turkiye and the Gulf states.</p><p>The success of this gamble depends on whether the US can dismantle the shadow economies that facilitate foreign interference and establish a stable, autonomous Iraqi state capable of navigating the intense geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"the-stakes-for-iraq-s-future\">The stakes for Iraq’s future</h2><p>Ultimately, the appointment of Savaya serves as the definitive stress test for Iraqi sovereignty, marking a high-stakes transition towards a transactional “America First” strategy aimed at “Making Iraq Great Again”. By attempting to consolidate military command under the state and dismantle the shadow economies fuelling Iranian influence, Savaya’s mission seeks to exploit the current regional weakening of Tehran’s proxies to transform Iraq into a stable, autonomous hub.</p><p>However, the success of this “Great Gamble” hinges on Savaya’s ability to overcome entrenched political opposition and reconcile the presence of US forces with the demand for national unity. If this unconventional diplomatic push can bridge internal divides — particularly between Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in the north — Iraq may finally secure a path towards economic independence; otherwise, the nation risks remaining a perpetual battleground caught in the geopolitical crossfire between Washington and Tehran.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

society organisations, and prominent political figures signed a nine-point political roadmap in Nairobi, presenting it as a civilian-led initiative aimed at ending Sudan’s war and restoring a democratic transition.</p><p>Framed as an antiwar, pro-peace platform, it seeks to position civilians as a “third pole” against the two military actors in Sudan’s conflict: the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p><p>Its authors say it represents an attempt to reclaim political agency for civilians after months of marginalisation by armed actors and foreign mediators, even though the declaration does not outline any concrete steps towards military reform.</p><p>The roadmap reignited longstanding debates within Sudanese political and civic circles about representation, legitimacy, and the persistent dominance of elite-driven civilian politics.</p><h2 id=\"the-roadmap\">The roadmap</h2><p>The Nairobi declaration emerged after a statement released by the Quad – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United States – in September.</p><p>The Quad statement called for an immediate three-month truce to lead to a permanent ceasefire, humanitarian access to help civilians, and the creation of a political process for a civilian transition.</p><p>It also emphasised excluding remnants of former President Omar al-Bashir’s regime and reforming Sudan’s security forces under civilian oversight, all points that the Nairobi declaration echoed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Nairobi signatories included the National Umma Party, the Sudanese Congress Party, civil society organisations – including the Darfur Lawyers Association and the Coordination of Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees – and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdelwahid al-Nur.</p><p>Former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who led Sudan’s transitional civilian government from al-Bashir’s overthrow in 2019 until the October 2021 military coup by the SAF and the RSF working in concert, also signed the declaration.</p><p>It was likewise endorsed by al-Nur, longtime leader of the SLM-AW armed group that controls Jebel Marra in Darfur and has historically rejected what he describes as “elite-driven” political settlements.</p><h2 id=\"falling-short\">Falling short</h2><p>Sudanese researcher Hamid Khalafallah told Al Jazeera that despite the intent to present a civilian leadership, the declaration falls short of reflecting Sudan’s broader civic movement.</p><p>The Nairobi coalition, he argued, mirrors earlier civilian formations that failed to connect with Sudanese citizens, particularly those most affected by the war.</p><p>“It’s in many ways a reproduction of former groups that have … struggled to represent the Sudanese people,” he said. “It’s still very much an elite group that does politics in the same way they always have.”</p><p>Although resistance committees – neighbourhood groups that emerged from Sudan’s protest movement and helped topple al-Bashir in 2019 – were referenced in the declaration, no committees formally endorsed or signed it.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4187744\"

al-Nur met in 2019 in Khartoum [File: Embassy of France in Sudan/Facebook]</figcaption></figure><p>Drafts were reportedly shared with some grassroots groups, but the process advanced without waiting for collective deliberation – reinforcing concerns that civilians on the ground remain politically instrumentalised rather than empowered.</p><p>While al-Nur’s participation was hailed by some as a breakthrough, Khalafallah questioned the underlying motivation, arguing that his inclusion was intended to counterbalance rival military-aligned forces rather than transform civilian politics.</p><p>Before the Nairobi declaration, there were three main civilian coalitions in Sudan, each aligned with a warring party or accused of such an alliance.</p><p>Tasis is the coalition of political parties and armed movements that was founded in February 2025, before forming the RSF’s parallel government in July 2025, while the Democratic Bloc is a grouping of parties and armed groups aligned with the SAF.</p><p>Finally comes Hamdok’s Sumoud, comprising political parties and civil society organisations and accused by SAF of supporting the RSF.</p><h2 id=\"europe-s-one-track-civilian-strategy\">Europe’s one-track civilian strategy</h2><p>European officials have distanced themselves from the Nairobi initiative.</p><p>A senior European Union diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that Brussels does not see the Nairobi roadmap as the foundation for a unified civilian process.</p><p>“We would like to see only one civilian process, that’s why we are helping the African Union [AU],” the source said. “Everything else is a distraction, like this Nairobi one.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the EU official, the priority is not multiplying civilian platforms but consolidating them under a single credible framework, led by the AU and broadly accepted by Sudanese society.</p><p>“Our aim is to create a credible third pole – versus RSF and SAF,” the source said. “An inclusive one, supported by most Sudanese citizens.”</p><p>The EU plans to build a broad coalition that can take the lead after the Quad’s humanitarian truce and ceasefire proposals are accepted by the SAF and the RSF, including reforms placing security forces under civilian-led oversight.</p><p>The EU’s language reflects growing frustration among international actors with Sudan’s fragmented civilian landscape, while insisting that abandoning it would legitimise military rule by default.</p><p>“Of course, we are not naive that civilians will take over tomorrow,” the source said. “But we have to stand for our values.”</p><p>The EU official was blunt in assessing the conduct of Sudan’s warring parties, rejecting narratives that frame either side as a governing authority.</p><p>“I would not call what RSF does in Darfur ‘governing’, SAF is a bit better – but not much,” the source said.</p><p>“Look at the oil deal they did,” the official added. “Money is important; people are not.”</p><p>They referred to the latest agreement between the SAF and the RSF – under South Sudanese mediation – that both would withdraw from the Heglig oil facility, with <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/south-sudan-army-to-secure-critical-heglig-oilfield-in-sudan-war-spillover\">South Sudanese troops deployed to secure</a> the refinery following SAF’s pullout and the RSF’s capture of the site.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"warring-parties-as-spoilers\">Warring parties as spoilers?</h2><p>US-Africa policy expert Cameron Hudson told Al Jazeera that the Nairobi declaration appears to mimic the Quad’s recent statement, effectively presenting to the international community a roadmap that aligns with pre-existing objectives to gain Quad support.</p><p>“My sense is that the Nairobi declaration reverse engineers what the Quad has said,” Hudson said, suggesting that the initiative is designed more to attract international endorsement than to build genuine domestic consensus.</p><p>Hudson warned that this approach mishandles the sequencing of Sudan’s political transition, “prematurely” linking ceasefire efforts with reforms of the army or other political changes, arguing that these should remain on separate tracks until violence subsides.</p><p>“If what the Quad wants is an unconditional ceasefire, then it needs to pursue that, not create opportunities to trade a ceasefire for political assurances during a transition,” he said.</p><p>“For that reason, it is premature to be talking about reforming the army or other political reforms. These should remain in separate tracks for now.”</p><p>The tension is stark. The Quad and the European Union increasingly state that neither the SAF nor the RSF should have a political future and that remnants of the Bashir regime must be excluded entirely.</p><p>Yet both armed forces remain indispensable to any cessation of hostilities, creating an unresolved contradiction at the heart of international strategy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

announcement that 130 were rescued.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>However, a UN source told the AFP news agency that all those taken appeared to have been released, as dozens thought to have been kidnapped had managed to run off during the attack and make their way home.</p><p>The accounting has been complicated because the children’s homes are scattered across swaths of rural Nigeria, sometimes requiring three or four hours of travel by motorbike to reach their remote villages, the source said.</p><p>The source told the AFP that “the remaining set of girls/secondary school students will be taken to Minna”, the capital of Niger State, on Monday.</p><p>“We’ll have to still do final verification,” Daniel Atori, a spokesman for CAN in Niger State, told the AFP.</p><h2 id=\"mass-kidnappings\">Mass kidnappings</h2><p>It has not been made public who seized the children from their boarding school, or how the government secured their release.</p><p>Kidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make quick cash in Nigeria.</p><p>But a spate of mass abductions in November put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country’s already grim security situation.</p><p>Assailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers, and a bride and her bridesmaids, with farmers, women and children also taken hostage.</p><p>The kidnappings also come as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that there have been mass killings of Christians in Nigeria that amounted to a “genocide”, and he threatened military intervention.</p><p>Nigeria’s government and independent analysts <a href=\"/news/2025/11/2/nigeria-welcomes-us-assistance-to-fight-terrorism-after-trumps-threats\">reject that framing</a>, which has long been used by the Christian right in the US and Europe.</p><p>One of the first mass kidnappings that drew international attention was in 2014, when nearly 300 girls were seized from their boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok by the Boko Haram armed group.</p><p>A decade later, Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis has “consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry” that raised some $1.66m between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The official told the agency that interceptions can take different forms, including sailing or flying close to vessels of concern.</p><p>The official did not give a specific location for the operation or name the vessel being pursued.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The British maritime risk management group Vanguard identified the vessel as Bella 1, a very large crude oil carrier that was added last year to the sanctions ‍list of the US ⁠Treasury Department, which said the vessel has links to Iran.</p><p>Bella 1 was empty when it was approaching Venezuela on Sunday, according to TankerTrackers.com.</p><p>Reuters, citing internal documents from Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA, reported that the vessel had, in 2021, provided transportation for Venezuela’s oil to China. The agency, citing a vessel monitoring service, also reported that the vessel had previously carried Iranian crude.</p><h2 id=\"international-piracy\">‘International piracy’</h2><p>The campaign targeting Venezuela’s oil sector comes amid a large US military buildup in the region with a stated mission of combating drug trafficking, as well as more than two dozen strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation.</p><p>Critics have questioned the legality of the attacks, which have killed more than 100 people.</p><p>Venezuela denies any involvement in drug trafficking and insists that Washington is seeking to overthrow Maduro to seize the country’s oil reserves, which are the world’s largest.</p><p>It has condemned the US’s vessel seizures as acts of “international piracy”.</p><p>The White House said on Sunday that the first two oil tankers seized by the US were operating on the black market and were providing oil to countries under sanctions.</p><p>“And so, I don’t think that people need to be worried here in the US ‌that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council ⁠said on CBS’s Face the Nation programme.</p><p>“There’s just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The second ship, which was seized on Saturday and identified as the Panama-flagged Centuries, was carrying some 1.8 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China.</p><p>Al Jazeera Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, noted that Trump’s “total and complete blockade” applied to sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, and said the US has not sanctioned the Centuries.</p><p>“The US also did not have a warrant for that ship, though a White House spokeswoman said the oil it was carrying is sanctioned because it comes from the Venezuelan state-owned oil company,” said Zhou-Castro.</p><p>“As for the first ship that was seized, the Skipper, it is now docked off the shore of Texas, where its cargo of 1.9 million barrels of crude is being offloaded to be refined in the US. Now, this feeds into those accusations from the Venezuelan government that the US is stealing its oil.”</p><h2 id=\"prelude-to-war\">‘Prelude to war’</h2><p>The US operation has prompted criticism even within Trump’s Republican Party.</p><p>Senator Rand Paul told ABC’s This Week that the moves were a “provocation and a prelude to war”.</p><p>“And I hope we don’t go to war with Venezuela. Look, at any point in time, there are 20, 30, governments around the world that we don’t like that are either socialist or communist or have human rights violations. We could really, literally, go through a couple dozen, but it isn’t the job of the American soldier to be the policeman of the world,” he said.</p><p>“So, I’m not for confiscating these liners. I’m not for blowing up these boats of unarmed people that are suspected of being drug dealers,” he added.</p><p>Analysts expressed concern over the rising tensions and the potential for rights violations in the US.</p><p>“The US is not under real threat from Venezuela in any way, not even from drug trafficking. But a lot of people in the White House think that it will be convenient for the US to declare war,” said Ernesto Castaneda, an expert on Latin American affairs at the American University in Washington, DC.</p><p>Such a move would allow the US to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, paving the way for mass deportations and even quell opposition from US citizens, he said.</p><p>The White House also believes that if the US were to go to war, there would be less attention to the ongoing furore over the government’s partial release of the files late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as the state of the economy.</p><p>“But I think those calculations are wrong,” he said.</p><p>Castaneda also noted that the US and Venezuela continue to trade, despite the tensions.</p><p>“Venezuelan economy depends to a large degree on the export of oil, most of it going to China. And these [seized] oil tankers, even though they indeed carry a lot of oil, there’s a lot of trade that is happening,” he said.</p><p>“And, funnily enough, the trade with the US, though the agreement with the [US oil company] Chevron continues. So, even though we have the third oil tanker that has been stopped, most of the tankers are regulated with permission to go into the US, and they continue to do so.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
