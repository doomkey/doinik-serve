            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Ever since the crackdown on protests in Iran between January 8 and 10, there has been contention on what the true death toll of those bloody events is. According to figures provided by the Iranian government, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">3,117 people were killed</a>, including civilians and security forces. Yet estimates from outside the country have put the number at anywhere between 5,000 and a staggering 36,500.</p><p>This wide range not only reflects the fact that it has been extremely difficult to verify these reports, but also that there has been a concerted effort to use the death count to manufacture global consent for an attack on Iran and, in a deceitful rhetoric, downplay the official death toll of the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>Since the outbreak of the protests, there has been a race to estimate and report on the casualties – something I call a “Death Toll Olympics”.</p><p>Iran-focused human rights organisations led by dissident activists have been going through all sorts of evidence and testimonies to verify the number of the dead. As of writing this piece, the US-based organisation HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) has cited more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">6,000 deaths</a> and a further 17,000-plus cases under examination.</p><p>However, there are valid doubts about the speed of the activist-led verification process.</p><p>For every reported death, multiple accounts have to be examined, possible duplications must be identified and eliminated; and dates, locations and specific circumstances must be cross-checked against the timeline of events.</p><p>Furthermore, any visual evidence has to be localised and authenticated based on open-source data or corroborated by the accounts of multiple witnesses. From an investigative standpoint, the reliability and quality of activist-led counts that increase rapidly on a daily basis, therefore warrants caution.</p><p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, has cited a conservative estimate of <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">around 5,000 deaths</a>. At the same time, she has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-20/united-nations-iran-deaths-investigation-crimes-against-humanity/106238634\">mentioned</a> that unverified numbers of up to 20,000 have been reported to her by medical sources.</p><p>The described obstacles, and difficulties of verification over the past weeks, have been further exacerbated by Iran’s severely restricted internet access. Despite this, major media outlets have begun distributing much higher figures, solely based on vague anonymous sources who claim privileged access within Iran’s government or health sector.</p><p>On January 25, for example, UK-based TV network Iran International <a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198\">published</a> a report claiming 36,500 were killed, citing “extensive reports” allegedly obtained from the Iranian security apparatus – reports it has neither published nor otherwise made transparent.</p><p>The same day, United States news magazine Time <a href=\"https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/\">published</a> an article titled “Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30,000, According to Local Health Officials”. It claimed that “as many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone” based on the accounts of two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health, whose identities were not revealed for security reasons. Notably, the magazine admitted in the text that it did not possess any means to independently confirm that number.</p><p>Two days later, British newspaper The Guardian followed the same trend with an article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">titled</a> “Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?” The piece introduced the figure of 30,000 based on estimates of an anonymous doctor, who spoke to the newspaper. He and his colleagues in Iran, the outlet admitted, were actually hesitant to provide a concrete figure.</p><p>Other media – from the Sunday Times to the Pierce Morgan Uncensored show – have cited papers circulated by Germany-based ophthalmologist Amir Parasta claiming death toll numbers between <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/iran-young-protesters-news-nsdztp5t2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">16,500</a> and 33,000. However, the latest available version of the paper, dating back to January 23 uses disputable extrapolation methods to reach its figures. Strikingly, Parasta does not make any secret of his affiliation with Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s ousted Shah</p><p>The exiled crown prince and his team, whose extensive social media manipulation and disinformation efforts have been exposed by <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-10-03/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-israeli-influence-operation-in-iran-pushing-to-reinstate-the-shah-monarchy/00000199-9f12-df33-a5dd-9f770d7a0000\">recent investigations</a> by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab, have been key actors in inciting and escalating the recent protests towards confrontation. Accordingly, the fatality numbers disseminated by Mr Parasta cannot be perceived as neutral and constitute partisan estimates at best.</p><p>Despite acknowledging their own inability to verify these estimates, the media in question nevertheless put these extreme figures in titles and subheadings. It didn’t take long for other outlets to report on these inflated numbers, referring to these major publications as primary sources. Activists and Western politicians have also used them to push their respective agendas, thereby further fuelling a spiral of disinformation campaigns on social media. – In other words, a “death toll olympics” was born.</p><p>All of this has served two ends.</p><p>First, it has supported efforts to manufacture consent for foreign military intervention and malicious political action. While the protests were still ongoing, US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran in the event of a deadly crackdown. As of writing these lines, there has been a significant US military build-up around Iran, effectively thickening the war cloud.</p><p>Second, the speculation about the Iranian death toll has helped pro-Israel politicians and commentators in the West to downplay the casualties of the Israeli war on Gaza. In this way, it has become a utilitarian tool for relativising the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p><p>Confronted with mounting pressure regarding the death toll, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the authorities to “publicly publish the names and personal data of those deceased during the recent bitter incidents”. His director of communication has even promised that a procedure has been set up to examine and verify any conflicting claims.</p><p>It remains to be seen how effective and transparent the promised procedure will turn out. It is undeniable that thousands have been killed in Iran, mostly by Iranian security forces, amid a multi-day brutal crowd and riot control effort.</p><p>Structural obscurity and the restricted access to Iran for independent experts will likely mean that the exact death toll will never be determined. However, the more transparency can be established regarding the scale of the killings, the more likely it is that the perpetrators can be held accountable.</p><p>An arduous verification process of the recent deaths is crucial not only for the sake of accountability, but also to expose the media manipulation that is once again preparing the ground for a unilateral US-led act of aggression in the Middle East. In light of this, the “Death Toll Olympics” remains an ignominious disservice to the wretched of the Earth from Palestine to Iran.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The protest was as much against the news that agents from a division of ICE <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/29/italys-winter-olympics-security-plan-keeps-ice-in-advisory-role\">would participate in security</a> for the US delegation as against what many saw as creeping fascism in the United States.</p><p>“No thank you, from Minnesota to the world, at the side of anyone who fights for human rights,’’ read one banner. “Never again means never again for anyone,’’ read another, and “Ice only in Spritz,’’ a reference to a popular aperitif, read yet another.</p><p>News of the deployment of ICE agents has provoked a backlash in Italy. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala has said <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/27/ice-winter-olympics-move-sparks-anger-including-host-city-mayor-in-milan\">they were not welcome</a>. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has been called to Parliament to testify about the deployment this week.</p><p>Protester Silvana Grassi held a sign that read “Ice = Gestapo.” She said the scenes of ICE agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing protesters and detaining children were deeply upsetting.</p><p>“It makes me want to cry to think of it,’’ Grassi said. “It’s too terrible. How did they elect such a terrible, evil man?’’</p><p>The ICE agents to be deployed to Milan are not from the same unit as the immigration agents cracking down in Minnesota and other US cities.</p><p>Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.</p><p>“Even if it’s not the same ones, we don’t want them here,’’ Grassi said.</p><p>Paolo Bortoletto, also holding a banner, was aware that the officers would have an investigative and not a street role.</p><p>Still, he said, “We don’t want them in our country. We are a peaceful country. We don’t want fascists. It’s their ideas that bother us.”</p><p>The Olympics begin February 6 with an opening ceremony that will be attended by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The order alleged that the government of communist-run Cuba was an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trump-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-end-of-the-year-us-media-report\">“unusual and extraordinary threat”</a> to US national security.</p><p>In a social media post on Friday, Diaz-Canel said that under “a false and baseless pretext”, Trump plans “to suffocate” Cuba’s economy by slapping tariffs “on countries that sovereignly trade oil” with it.</p><p>“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal and genocidal nature of a clique that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal ends,” he said, in an apparent allusion to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American and a known anti-Cuban government hawk.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cuba, which is suffering rolling electricity blackouts blamed on fuel shortages, was cut off from critical supplies of Venezuelan oil after the US abducted Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a bloody military night raid on the capital, Caracas, earlier this month. At least 32 members of Cuba’s armed forces and intelligence agencies <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/cuba-pays-tribute-to-soldiers-killed-in-us-attack-on-venezuela\">were killed</a> in the January 3 attack.</p><p>The US has since taken effective control of Venezuela’s oil sector, and Trump, a Republican, has issued threats against other left-wing governments in the region, promising to stop oil shipments previously sent to Cuba.</p><p>Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Friday declared an “international emergency” in response to Trump’s move, which he said constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat”.</p><p>Venezuela’s government also condemned the measure in a statement on Friday, saying it violates international law and the principles of global commerce.</p><p>Reporting from Cuba’s capital, Al Jazeera’s Ed Augustin said Trump’s announcement “is a massive psychological blow”, noting that analysts describe it as the “most powerful economic blow the United States has ever dealt the island”.</p><p>Days after Maduro’s abduction and transfer to the US, Trump urged Cuba to make a deal “before it is too late,” without specifying what kind of agreement he was referring to.</p><p>In a post on social media, Trump suggested Rubio could become the president of Cuba. “Sounds good to me!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-no-solution\">‘There’s no solution’</h2><p>In Havana, residents expressed anger at Trump’s tariff threat, which will only make life harder for Cubans already struggling with an increase in US sanctions.</p><p>“My food is going bad.

She did not say whether Mexico would cut shipments of oil or refined products to Cuba, which ‌she said accounted for 1 percent of Mexico’s production.</p><p>“Our interest is that the Cuban people don’t suffer,” Sheinbaum said, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to contact the US ‌State Department to better understand the scope of the executive order.</p><p>Mexico supplied 44 percent of Cuban oil imports and Venezuela exported 33 percent until last month, while some 10 percent of Cuban oil is sourced from Russia.

Castro himself was the target of numerous assassination attempts by the US’s Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA.</p><p>Alena Douhan, special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, said the “extensive regime of economic, trade and financial restrictions” against Cuba marks the longest-running unilateral sanctions policy in US history.</p><p>She noted that there are shortages of food, medicine, electricity, water, essential machinery and spare parts in Cuba, while a growing emigration of skilled workers, including medical staff, engineers and teachers, is further straining the country.</p><p>The accumulative effect has “severe consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, food, health and development”, Douhan said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

States.</p><p>Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued the order on Friday, delaying a February 13 deadline that would have <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/trump-strips-legal-protections-from-ethiopian-refugees-in-latest-crackdown\">forced</a> more than 5,000 Ethiopians to leave the country or face arrest.</p><section

ruling represents the latest legal setback to the administration’s broader push to end temporary protections for more than one million people across multiple countries.</p><p>Murphy’s decision came during a virtual hearing, where he said the delay would provide time for the Department of Homeland Security to produce records explaining its decision-making process before he considers blocking the move for longer.</p><p>“I want to do everything I can to keep this case going,” the judge said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case was brought by three Ethiopian nationals and the advocacy group African Communities Together, who filed suit after the DHS announced in December it was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/trump-strips-legal-protections-from-ethiopian-refugees-in-latest-crackdown\">terminating</a> the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) first granted to Ethiopia in 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit argues the administration unlawfully ended the protections with just 60 days’ notice despite ongoing armed conflict in the African nation.</p><p>Plaintiffs also claim Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted based on an “unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants”.</p><p>The move came even as the State Department continues urging Americans to <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ethiopia-travel-advisory.html\">reconsider travel</a> to Ethiopia due to “sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping”.</p><p>The DHS defended the termination by pointing to recent peace agreements, including a 2022 ceasefire in Tigray, despite <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/clashes-between-government-troops-and-tigrayan-forces-erupt-in-ethiopia\">renewed</a> fighting in the region this month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said TPS “was never intended to be a de facto amnesty programme, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades”.</p><p>The ruling follows a similar decision a day earlier when a federal appeals court found the administration unlawfully ended protections for 600,000 Venezuelans.</p><p>That three-judge panel said Noem’s actions were based on “racist stereotyping” and left people “in a constant state of fear that they will be deported, detained, separated from their families”.</p><p>About a dozen countries now face TPS terminations as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>Some 350,000 Haitians are set to lose protections on February 3, while Somalis face a March 17 <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/us-to-end-deportation-protections-for-somalis\">deadline,</a> despite the State Department maintaining a “Do Not Travel” warning for Somalia.</p><p>The legal battles come as protests rock the US against the Trump administration’s deportation drive, following the killing of two American citizens by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota this month.</p></div></div></body></html>"
