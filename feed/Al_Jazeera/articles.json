When he joined the government army in 2016 – aged only 19 – he thought that the Yemeni government’s war against the Houthi rebel group would be brief.  A decade has elapsed, and the conflict remains unsettled, with the Houthis remaining in Sanaa.</p><p>Naef was clear as to the reason for the government’s failure – a lack of unity and clear command structure. For years, government soldiers and other anti-Houthi fighters have adhered to conflicting agendas across the country, with many of the fighters in the south supporting the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). A solution to that division, Naef thought, was far-fetched.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>However, more recently, things have changed. The STC’s decision to attempt to seize all of southern and eastern Yemen backfired, and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/saudi-says-it-will-militarily-back-yemens-government-against-separatists\">Saudi Arabia backed</a> pro-government troops in pushing the group back. The STC is now divided, with one leader on the run, and others declaring that the group had been dissolved.</p><p>The Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), Yemen’s UN-recognised authority led by President Rashad al-Alimi, has seized the initiative and, on January 10, established the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/yemens-saudi-backed-government-retakes-southern-areas-from-stc-what-next\">Supreme Military Committee (SMC)</a>, with the goal of overseeing all anti-Houthi military units, and integrating them into the official Yemeni military, under one command.</p><p>Al-Alimi said that the SMC would ultimately be a vehicle to defeat the Houthis, and reclaim all of Yemen.</p><p>The SMC announcement marks a dramatic twist in the decade-long war, and Naef is now – finally – hopeful.</p><p>“I am optimistic today as the government has revived some of its power in southern Yemen,” he told Al Jazeera. “The formation of an inclusive military committee is a boost to our morale and a prelude to a powerful government comeback.”</p><p>The soldier believes that, after years of inertia, the tide has finally turned for the government. After nine years of experience on multiple frontlines, Naef now thinks that the government – with the backing of Saudi Arabia – is capable of pushing into Houthi-controlled northwestern Yemen, should negotiations fail.</p><p>“The PLC has achieved remarkable success in the south over the past few weeks with support from the Saudi leadership. It has once again proven to be an indispensable party to the conflict. Whether this success will be short-lived or lasting remains to be seen,” said Naef.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4238467\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4238467\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Yemen_afterSTC_Jan13_2026-01-1768404152.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Yemen_Control_Map_Jan14_2026_REVISED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"concerns-and-defiance\">Concerns and defiance</h2><p>The formation of the SMC has unleashed a sense of concern among Houthi supporters in northern Yemen.</p><p>Hamza Abdu, a 24-year-old Houthi supporter in Sanaa, describes the new military committee as an “attempt to organise the proxies in the south”.</p><p>“This committee may end the friction between the militant groups in the south, but it will deepen the south’s subjugation to Saudi Arabia,” Hamza said. The Houthis have often framed their opponents as being proxies controlled by foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They themselves are backed by Iran.</p><p>In light of the developments, Hamza shared a concern: the resumption of the war between the Houthis and their opponents, which has largely been frozen since 2022.</p><p>“If this military committee succeeded in uniting the forces in the south, that might entice them to attack the north,” he said. “A new destructive war will begin, and the humanitarian ordeal will magnify.”</p><p>Like many ordinary citizens, Hamza is now fearful that the war will restart. But Houthi leaders – while warning that their forces should stay alert – are still confident, saying that the formation of the SMC will not affect their power or weaken their control.</p><p>Aziz Rashid, a pro-Houthi military expert, believes that the SMC will not alter the status quo, arguing that any future confrontation with the Houthis “will only serve the agendas and plans of the United States-supported Zionist entity [Israel]”.</p><p>Rashid indicated that Houthi forces in Sanaa “confronted international and powerful military forces, including the <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/5/1/animated-maps-show-us-led-attacks-on-yemen\">United States</a>, Britain and Israel, and stood firm against the [Saudi-led Arab] coalition during the past 10 years”.</p><p>The only solution for Yemen, Rashid said, was a political settlement.</p><p>The Iran-backed Houthis took over Sanaa in September 2014 and <a href=\"/news/2015/2/6/yemens-houthis-form-own-government-in-sanaa\">toppled</a> the UN-recognised government in February 2015. They insist they are the only legitimate authority governing Yemen.</p><p>The Houthis have faced attacks from the US, the United Kingdom, and Israel since 2023, when the Yemeni group began attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Israel itself, in what the Houthis declared was solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-terrifying-message\">A terrifying message</h2><p>Defeating the Houthis will be easier said than done, considering the Saudi-backed coalition’s failure to do so with overwhelming air power in the early years of the war, and the group’s now extensive combat experience and possession of advanced weapons, including drones and missiles.</p><p>But if the Yemeni military does truly reorganise itself and integrate the different anti-Houthi forces on the ground, the opportunity may be there.</p><p>Adel Dashela, a Yemeni researcher and non-resident fellow at MESA Global Academy, said that if the SMC is able to provide security and stability in territory under its control, it may also be able to improve the lives of Yemenis living there – and put itself in a stronger position in any negotiations with the Houthis.</p><p>“The next stage is the start of a political process to reach an agreement with the Houthi group. If the peaceful option fails, the military action becomes necessary,” Dashela told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Abdulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, believes that recent events – both inside and outside Yemen – provide the government with a perfect opportunity to confront the Houthis.</p><p>“A limited military operation routed the UAE-backed STC within a few days,” Mohammed said. “What happened to the STC in the south carried a terrifying message to the Houthis in the north. The Houthis are not invincible.”</p><p>According to Mohammed, some factors have magnified the vulnerability of the Houthis at present.</p><p>He explained, “Iran is undergoing a massive crisis, and this can weaken Tehran’s Houthi proxy. The popular silent rage against the group keeps growing, given the economic and governance issues in areas under their control. Moreover, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/30/live-yemens-presidential-council-cancels-uae-defence-deal\">the exit of the UAE</a> from the south will enable the Yemeni government to shift the battle to the Houthis in the north.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperate-for-order\">Desperate for order</h2><p>Armed groups in Yemen have proliferated over the last decade. The outcome has been a weakened government and a prolonged war. Amid the chaos, the population has borne the brunt.</p><p>Fawaz Ahmed, a 33-year-old resident of the southern city of Aden, is hopeful that the establishment of a military committee will end the presence of armed groups in Aden and other southern cities.</p><p>Fawaz expects Aden to get two immediate benefits from the formation of the SMC: an end to unlawful money collection by fighters and the disappearance of infighting between competing armed units.</p><p>He recalled an incident last August in Aden’s Khormaksar district, when two military units clashed at the headquarters of the Immigration and Passports Authority, leading to the closure of the facility for days.</p><p>“The commanders of the armed groups issued conflicting directions, and soldiers opened fire on each other. This clearly points to the absence of a united leadership. So, the declared military committee will prevent such face-offs,” said Fawaz.</p><p>“We are desperate for law and order,” Fawaz said. “Desperate for a city free from an unneeded military presence. This is a collective dream in Aden. Only united military leadership can achieve this.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Alcaraz is chasing his first title at the event to complete his career Grand Slam, while Sinner has his own opportunity to do so later this year at Roland Garros in Paris.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Despite their friendly exchanges in South Korea, the players were mindful of the competitive nature of their relationship.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Today’s game is helpful to see if Jannik changes something in his game,” Alcaraz quipped after the exhibition match. “I wouldn’t say [he did today],” he added, hinting that both are careful not to reveal too much to each other.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“I wouldn’t take anything from today’s match.

So, if we drop [our level] just a little bit, they’re going to take our place,” the defending Australian Open champion said. “So, it’s great to have [Carlos] push me to the limit. Hopefully, I can improve every time when we play.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Only a small group of players have beaten either man in recent years.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The United Kingdom’s No 1, Jack Draper, defeated Alcaraz in the semifinals of Indian Wells – the so-called “fifth grand slam” – last season, while attention in Melbourne will again fall on Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion chasing an 11th Australian Open title.</p><p class=\"pf0\">After flying to Australia together on a private jet, Alcaraz and Sinner were seen high-fiving during practice on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday. The tournament begins Sunday, and – as in the past two years – they start from opposite ends of the draw. Many are already anticipating another “Sincaraz” final.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Federal prosecutors charged dozens of defendants beginning in 2022 – before Trump’s current term – and have filed more charges since Trump took office a year ago.</p><p>So far, the Minnesota fraud charges involve a minimum of hundreds of millions of dollars. Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson, who led Minnesota fraud prosecutions, said in December that Medicaid fraud in the state could reach $9bn although not all of that would be federal money. Thompson resigned on Tuesday.</p><p>But adding the dollars lost to fraud in Minnesota to federal losses elsewhere – which have been estimated as high as $521bn annually – would not bring the total close to the amount of the federal deficit. The fiscal year 2025 deficit – that year’s difference between revenues and spending – was $1.775 trillion.</p><p>“You can’t balance the books on waste, fraud and abuse,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks the federal budget. “It’s important to root it out, but the only way you get anywhere close to a balanced budget is fiscal restraint.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"federal-report-in-2024-found-hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-in-fraud\">Federal report in 2024 found hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud</h2><p>In April 2024, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) produced what it called a “first-of-its-kind, government-wide estimate of federal dollars lost to fraud”.</p><p>The office estimated $233bn to $521bn lost in fraud per year, based on 2018 to 2022 data from agency inspectors general and fraud reports submitted to the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>The GAO’s topline figure included not only official fraud findings from legal proceedings but also estimates based on individual agencies’ findings of fraud. The agency also extrapolated figures it believed represented undetected fraud.</p><p>The estimated annual losses amounted to 3 percent to 7 percent of what the government spent on average in those years.</p><p>Joshua Sewell, director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, previously cautioned that the GAO report is filled with caveats, including its overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increased spending.</p><p>Still, “it’s very, very unlikely that there is enough fraud in the federal government to balance the budget,” said Chris Towner, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group. “For the $1.775 trillion deficit for that year to have been due to fraud, it would mean that one-quarter of federal spending was fraudulent, or some combination of fraudulent lost tax revenue and federal outlays totalled that amount.”</p><p>Another challenge is that fraud is not easy to root out entirely. Historically, “only a small percentage of tax dollars lost to fraud are ever actually recovered by the government,” said Bob Westbrooks, a fraud and corruption risk expert who served as executive director of the federal government’s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-has-sought-to-investigate-fraud-in-blue-states\">Trump administration has sought to investigate fraud in blue states</h2><p>In recent weeks, Trump, a Republican, has spotlighted fraud in blue states, or states that generally vote Democratic, such as Minnesota. But there have been notable high-dollar fraud investigations in other states too.</p><p>In Mississippi, a solidly Republican state, a trial is under way in a welfare scandal that auditors said resulted in the loss of $100m in federal money from 2016 to 2020.</p><p>In 2024, the US Sentencing Commission pointed to the Southern District of Florida as the nation’s top district for fraud, adding that nationwide offences related to government benefits fraud had increased by 242 percent since 2020. Florida is also a red, or Republican, state.</p><p>This month, the US Department of Health and Human Services froze access to certain <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/trump-administration-freezes-minnesota-childcare-funds-over-fraud-claims\">childcare and family assistance funds</a> for California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – all blue states – saying it was related to fraud concerns. A federal judge blocked it temporarily.</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>Trump said: “If we stop this fraud, this massive fraud, we’re going to have a balanced budget.”</p><p>The amount of fraud committed against federal programmes is large, but the dollar amount does not come close to equalling the dollar amount of the federal deficit.</p><p>The highest nationwide fraud estimate puts fraud losses at $521bn. If all of that could be recouped, it would still be less than one-third of the 2025 deficit.</p><p>We rate the statement <strong>false</strong>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The law has provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health, and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.</p><p class=\"p1\">Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2m) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.</p><p class=\"p1\">To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder’s face, or make inferences from data already available, such has how long an account has been held.</p><p class=\"p1\">About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84 percent of eight to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million “deactivated or restricted” was encouraging.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We’re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,” Inman Grant said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia’s regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Australian officials didn’t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect, it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.</p><p class=\"p1\">In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticised the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn’t apply might not prioritise safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms – a concern that led to the ban’s enactment.</p><p class=\"p1\">The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia’s sprawling rural areas.</p><p class=\"p1\">Some said they had managed to fool age-assessing technologies or were helped by parents or older siblings to circumvent the ban.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Since Australia began debating the measures in 2024, other countries have considered following suit. Denmark’s government is among them, saying in November that it had planned to implement a social media ban for children under 15.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The fact that in spite of some scepticism out there, it’s working and being replicated now around the world, is something that is a source of Australian pride,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Opposition politicians have suggested that young people have circumvented the ban easily or are migrating to other apps that are less scrutinised than the largest platforms. Inman Grant said on Friday that data seen by her office showed a spike in downloads of alternative apps when the ban was enacted but not a spike in usage.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There is no real long-term trends yet that we can say but we’re engaging,” she said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, she said, the regulator she heads planned to introduce “world-leading AI companion and chatbot restrictions in March,” although she did not disclose further details.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has shone a spotlight on the type of crude held by the Latin American country.</p><p>Crude oil, which is produced by about 100 countries, comes in hundreds of varieties that differ by viscosity and sulfur content.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While all grades of crude oil are valuable, their differing properties make certain grades more sought after in some markets than others.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-heavy-and-light-grades-of-oil\">What is the difference between ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ grades of oil?</h2><p>Crude oils are rated as “heavy” or “light” based on their viscosities, or “gravities”.</p><p>Crude is also classified by sulfur content, with high-sulfur grades called “sour” and lower-sulfur varieties referred to as “sweet”.</p><p>Heavy, sour grades are more difficult and costly to refine into petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel.</p><p>Generally speaking, lighter and sweeter crude commands higher prices.</p><p>Some countries and regions primarily produce certain grades.</p><p>Canada mainly produces heavy, sour crude, for example, while African varieties tend to be lighter and sweeter.</p><p>Popular light, sweet varieties include Saudi Arabia’s Arabian Super Light, Iran’s South Pars Condensate, Malaysia’s Tapis Blend, and Australia’s Cossack.</p><p>Among the most traded heavy, sour varieties are China’s Shengli, the United Kingdom’s Kraken, Iraq’s Basra Heavy, and Iran’s Soroosh.</p><h2 id=\"what-type-of-oil-does-venezuela-have\">What type of oil does Venezuela have?</h2><p>Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, at an estimated 303 billion barrels.</p><p>Most of those reserves are made up of heavy, sour crude located in the Orinoco Oil Belt in the centre of the country.</p><p>The basin’s oil is especially dense and vicious, with a tar-like consistency that necessitates specialist methods such as steam injection and diluents for extraction.</p><p>Industry analysts say tapping the basin’s true potential will require huge investment due to the degraded state of the sector’s infrastructure and knowledge base, following late leader Hugo Chavez’s nationalisation of the industry and years of US sanctions that prevented Venezuela from accessing foreign capital and modern technology.</p><p>The Latin American country’s output was estimated at about 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, less than 1 percent of the world’s total, a steep decline from its 1970s peak of about 3.5 million bpd.</p><p>Rystad Energy, a consultancy based in Oslo, Norway, has estimated that about $110bn in capital investment would be needed to return to the country’s late 2000s output of about 2 million bpd.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, whose decision to kidnap Maduro has been widely condemned as a violation of international law, has said US oil companies are prepared to invest billions of dollars to revive production.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-venezuela-s-heavy-crude-particularly-attractive-for-the-us\">Why is Venezuela’s heavy crude particularly attractive for the US?</h2><p>Some industry analysts have expressed scepticism that US oil companies will be drawn to Venezuela – at least not without significant incentives and guarantees.</p><p>They point to the post-Maduro leadership uncertainty, Chavez’s past expropriation of company assets, and the excess supply of oil in the global market as reasons why firms may be hesitant to invest.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, two of the biggest US oil firms, pulled out of the country in 2007 following Chavez’s seizure of their facilities, and the two companies were later awarded large payouts in international arbitration.</p><p>At a meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods described Venezuela as “uninvestable” in its current state and said “significant changes” would need to occur in the country to justify returning.</p><p>As the only major US oil producer in the country at present, Chevron, which operates under special exemption from Washington’s sanctions, is widely viewed as best positioned to profit on Trump’s plans.</p><p>While there are differing views on the business case for the major oil companies in Venezuela, analysts are in agreement that one group in particular stands to gain: US refineries.</p><p>While the US currently pumps more crude than any other country due to an explosion in drilling for lighter shale oil, most of the country’s refineries were built to process heavier grades.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of US refining capacity is designed for heavier crude, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a relic of heavy investment made before the more recent boom in shale drilling.</p><p>“You need what is referred to as a ‘complex’ refinery with deep conversion capacities. The Gulf Coast has multiple refineries like that,” Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The coker units that are key were built to take advantage of heavy crude not just from Venezuela, but also places like Mexico and other South American producers.”</p><p>Shon Hiatt, director of the Zage Business of Energy Initiative at the University of Southern California, said US refineries would benefit “tremendously” from a boost in exports of Venezuelan crude.</p><p>“Many of the US refineries along the coast – Texas and Louisiana – were built and designed to process Venezuela crude,” Hiatt told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Venezuela has a history of exporting its oil to the US due to the fact that US oil companies were the first to go in, discover, pump, process, and export Venezuelan petroleum. Hence, refineries along the coast were built to handle this type of petroleum.”</p><p>While heavy Canadian crude has displaced imports from Venezuela over the years due to sanctions, that could change if Trump has his way, Hiatt said.</p><p>“If the Venezuelan heavy crude exports increase, it will displace the Canadian heavy crude as Venezuelan crude typically is sold at a lower price to these refineries,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United States President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Tehran – a move many Gulf powers fear would plunge the region into chaos.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Saudi Arabia has reportedly been lobbying the US administration to refrain from striking Iran, while Qatar and Oman have been focused on diplomatic outreach between Iranian and American officials. The three countries shifted into high-gear diplomacy to de-escalate tensions after reports on Wednesday suggested that contact between Washington and Tehran had broken down, raising fears that an attack was imminent, observers said.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“They were all concerned because all traditional channels [between the US and Iran] were not being utilised, at least from the US side,” said Anna Jacobs Khalaf, a Gulf analyst and non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute.</p><p>“GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] officials didn’t know what the US intentions were,” said Muhanad Seloom, assistant professor in critical security studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"regional-spillover\">Regional spillover</h2><p>Tensions escalated after Trump repeatedly threatened military action in Iran over the bloodshed taking place there. Authorities in Iran say that more than 100 security force personnel have been killed in clashes with protesters, while opposition activists say the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">real toll</a> includes more than 1,000 protesters, since demonstrations erupted in late December. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify these figures.</p><p>Trump called on Iranians to take over state institutions, promising that “help is on the way”. While it wasn’t clear what kind of attack he was considering, his remarks left the region bracing for an escalation.</p><p>Arab Gulf nations fear that a military strike on Iran could disrupt oil prices, shatter their reputation as safe havens for business, and trigger an Iranian retaliation on their soil.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time. In 2019, Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen struck Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, temporarily reducing Saudi oil production. Last June, Tehran attacked Qatar’s Al Udeid airbase, which hosts American troops, after the US struck a key nuclear facility in Iran.</p><p>Iran gave ample warning that it would carry out the attack, which marked the end of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, yet it created a precedent. And while that conflict weakened Iran’s military capabilities, the Islamic Republic still has an arsenal to hurt US interests in the region.</p><p>“Iran has ballistic missiles, supersonic missiles and militia groups around, so if they are given a reason to hit, they would,” said Seloom.</p><p>On Wednesday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had warned regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to Turkiye, that US bases in those nations would be attacked if the US targets Iran. That was followed by the drawdown of ‍some personnel ‍from the Al Udeid airbase.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the White House later on Wednesday, Trump said he had received information that “the killing in Iran is stopping, is stopped … and there’s no plan for executions”. While some interpreted that as an off-ramp to de-escalation, the US president did not rule out military action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unintended-consequences\">Unintended consequences</h2><p>Each member of the Gulf Cooperation Council has a different history with Iran but they all fear what would happen next and who would fill the vacuum should Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei be replaced or the whole system abruptly collapse, experts say.</p><p>The collapse of Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, and the chaos that followed – including a deadly civil war, the strengthening of al-Qaeda, and the eventual emergence of ISIL (ISIS) – is an experience Arab Gulf countries do not want to see repeated in a country with a population of more than 90 million, an arsenal of weapons at its disposal, and a badly weakened yet existent network of allies in the region.</p><p>“They may like to see the Iranian leadership weakened, but all of them are more concerned about a scenario of chaos and uncertainty and the possibility of more radical elements coming to power there,” said Khalaf.</p><p>Qatar, Kuwait and Oman have found their way to exist with their neighbour on the northern shore of the Gulf – Doha even shares with Tehran the world’s largest natural gas reservoir.</p><p>The UAE’s Dubai is also a key port for trade with Iran and the two countries enjoy a robust economic partnership. The UAE would therefore greatly suffer from unrest in Iran or an attack on its soil. Still, Emirati officials have remained silent in the past week having diverged from other GCC countries by cozying up to Israel and taking different positions in Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been arch-foes, but in recent years the rivalry has morphed into a pragmatic relationship based on keeping channels of communication open and preventing each other from escalation.</p><p>Riyadh is especially wary of regional destabilisation as the Kingdom embarks on a series of ambitious economic reforms to diversify its reliance on oil and boost its tourism sector – goals that require stability at home and in the broader region.</p><p>“Saudi [Arabia] is not comfortable at all with regime change anywhere – it’s radical and extreme and outcomes are uncertain and risky,” Khalaf added.</p><p>“Our goal is to achieve stability and calm so that we can direct our resources toward building a better future for our people,” Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said on Thursday.</p><p>Still, Khaled Batarfi, a Saudi political analyst, said that Riyadh would welcome changes in Iran, especially if they are gradual, bringing about a leadership willing to curtail its nuclear and missile programmes and one that is less opposed to the US.</p><p>“But a sudden change like a regime change with the risk of the country’s disintegration is not going to be good for anyone,” said Batarfi. “The whole region is on fire and we don’t need to add another fire to our doors.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This phase is about “moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”, said US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in a social media post.</p><p>The new phase includes a new Palestinian technocratic administration, overseen by an international “Board of Peace”, chaired by US President Donald Trump.</p><p>But while everything may sound workable on paper, the reaction from Palestinians in Gaza – one that mixes cautious hope and deep scepticism – is shaped by their lived experience since the beginning of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.</p><p>“A lot of political decisions are distant from the reality faced in Gaza… our daily life that is filled with blockades, fear, loss, tents, and a terrible humanitarian situation,” said Arwa Ashour, a freelance journalist and writer based in Gaza City. “Even when decisions are made to ease the suffering, they are obstructed by the Israeli occupation authorities.”</p><p>“People want everything back like it was before the war: schools, hospitals, travel,” Ashour said. “If the Board of Peace is going to resolve all these crises, then we welcome it. But if it’s unable to do so, then what is its benefit?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"palestinians-excluded\">Palestinians excluded?</h2><p>Ashour explained that after two years of war and more than 18 years of governance in the Palestinian enclave by Hamas, there is a desire for change in Gaza.</p><p>“People want to be part of the process of creating the future, not only to accept the implementation of decisions that have already been made,” she said.</p><p>The governance model envisaged in the second phase of the ceasefire plan does have a Palestinian component.</p><p>Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister, will head the Palestinian technocratic committee that will manage daily life. But that committee will be overseen by the Board of Peace, to be led by Bulgaria’s former foreign and defence minister, <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/who-is-nickolay-mladenov-the-diplomat-tasked-with-disarming-gaza\">Nickolay Mladenov</a>.</p><p>Mladenov – who has worked as a United Nations diplomat in the Middle East – is seen as an administrator, but one who may not be capable of pushing back against Israel and representing Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“Decisions made without the meaningful participation of those most affected reproduce the same power structures that enabled this occupation and genocide,” Maha Hussaini, head of media and public engagement at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera. “Excluding Palestinians in Gaza from shaping their future strips them of agency and turns reconstruction and governance into tools of control rather than recovery.”</p><p>For Hussaini, justice after a war in which Israel has killed at least 71,400 Palestinians and destroyed vast swathes of the territory cannot be ignored.</p><p>“Peace does not mean silence after bombardment, nor a pause between wars,” she said. “For Gaza, peace means safety, dignity, and freedom from collective punishment. It also means justice: recognising the harm suffered, restoring the rights of victims, and holding perpetrators accountable. Without justice, what is called ‘peace’ becomes only a temporary arrangement that leaves the genocide intact.”</p><p>Palestinian political analyst Ahmed Fayyad said that ultimately, Palestinians have little choice but to go along with Mladenov and the Board of Peace model, even if there is a sense that they are handing over the administration of Gaza to foreigners.</p><p>“Palestinians don’t have the luxury of choice to accept or refuse Mladenov,” Fayyad said. “No one – the Palestinian Authority and the Arab [countries] – wants to disrupt the agreement.”</p><p>But Fayyad described several potential stumbling blocks, including internal Palestinian divisions between the Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, and its longtime rival Hamas.</p><p>The analyst also believes that the demilitarisation of Hamas – which the US and Israel insist upon, but which Hamas says is an internal Palestinian matter – will also likely cause problems.</p><p>“Israel might attach the demilitarisation to the reconstruction or the opening of [border] crossings, and investments in the education and health sectors,” Fayyad said.</p><p>“It is complicated, and it is all subject to Israeli security conditions,” he continued, adding that the formation of a new Palestinian security force that met Israel’s onerous requirements would take a long time because the process was not spelled out in Trump’s ceasefire plan.</p><p>“This will reflect negatively on the civilians who yearn for an improvement to their daily harsh reality and suffering in tents, amid outbreaks of disease and the collapse of all economic and social life,” Fayyad said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-spoiler\">Israeli spoiler</h2><p>The announcement of the second phase of the ceasefire – a move that should have been seen as a sign of positive improvement – seems disconnected to the reality on the ground for Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“There is more fear than hope,” said Hussaini, from the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. “Not because people in Gaza lack resilience or imagination, but because experience has taught them that moments labelled as ‘turning points’ rarely translate into real protection or accountability. Hope exists, but it is fragile and constantly undermined by the absence of justice and by decisions imposed from outside.”</p><p>And the most influential outside force is Israel – the power that has bombarded Gaza not just in the last two years but in several previous wars, and controls access to Gaza, and the air and sea that surrounds it.</p><p>“I think Israel tries its best to distance Gaza from any political solutions, which would end with Palestine’s right to self-determination,” said the analyst Fayyad. “Israel wants Gaza to be a disarmed zone; its people’s biggest concerns are the daily struggles of life, without caring about any political solutions.”</p><p>“Israel doesn’t want any future political solutions for Gaza. These are the concerns of the Authority and the Palestinians. Israel doesn’t want independence in decision-making in Palestine,” he concluded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reality-of-life-in-gaza\">Reality of life in Gaza</h2><p>The daily struggle of life is all Sami Balousha, a 30-year-old computer programmer from Gaza City, can think about.</p><p>Balousha described peace not as a political agreement, conducted in far-off meeting rooms, but as physical safety and a routine.</p><p>“It is simply to sleep at night assured that I wake up the next morning, not dead, or I won’t get up in the middle of the night because of the sound of bombing,” Balousha said. “It is getting up the next morning and going to work, and being sure that I will be able to get home safely, not suspiciously turning around all the time, afraid of a strike.”</p><p>Balousha said that he had been displaced with his family 17 times – moving from place to place to escape Israeli attacks. The mental turmoil of the past two years means he no longer looks to the future, and instead focuses on the here and now.</p><p>“Tomorrow is far away, and I have no control over it,” Balousha said. “We can’t imagine the near future and plan it. We’ve been stuck in this loop for two years. The reality has always been strangely hard and unexpected.”</p><p>Like many others, Balousha feels disconnected from international decision-making.</p><p>“They don’t have a deep understanding of the Palestinians’ needs in Gaza. I don’t think that we are being listened to seriously,” he said.</p><p>It is why he ultimately does not have much faith in any solutions being cooked up for Gaza, and is instead fearful that his current horror will become a permanent reality.</p><p>“I am afraid that the coming generations accept the new reality of living in an open grave, to accept the tent as a home, to grow up not knowing the great days of Gaza,” Balousha said. “People only want an end to this all, no matter what the solution is, no matter who makes it, all that matters is the end of this misery at any cost. People are tired, so tired of this all, but want to live.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If Saudi Arabia buys JF-17s, it would “enhance interoperability of both the air forces and would be mutually beneficial”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Amir Husain, a Texas-based defence technology analyst, agreed.</p><p>“With the SMDA between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, it makes a lot of sense for there to be a degree of commonality in systems,” he said.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia is helping countries in the region, such as Libya, Somalia and Sudan, attain stability. The JF-17, and the Royal Saudi Air Force’s [RSAF] familiarity with this platform, can achieve these regional stabilisation aims,” Husain added.</p><h2 id=\"the-jf-17-attraction\">The JF-17 attraction</h2><p>Apart from Saudi Arabia, Iraq too has shown interest in the JF-17, according to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) – the military’s media arm.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223728\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026-1767866414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>The JF-17 Thunder is a lightweight, all-weather, multirole fighter jointly produced by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.</p><p>Production is split between the two countries, with 58 percent carried out in Pakistan and 42 percent in China. Pakistan produces the airframe, while China supplies the avionics.</p><p>The latest version, the Block 3 variant, is classified as a 4.5-generation fighter. It features air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities, advanced avionics, an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, electronic warfare systems and the ability to fire beyond-visual-range missiles.</p><p>The AESA radar allows pilots to track multiple targets simultaneously and detect threats at longer distances, though the aircraft lacks the stealth characteristics of fifth-generation fighters.</p><p>According to Pakistan Air Force (PAF) sources, full assembly takes place in Pakistan, and the production line at the Kamra facility can manufacture between 20 and 25 aircraft annually.</p><p>Pakistan has marketed the JF-17 internationally for several years. Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Myanmar are currently among the aircraft’s operators. But analysts say interest in the jet has intensified since the brief but intense military confrontation between Pakistan and India last May.</p><p>During their <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/5/7/operation-sindoor-whats-the-significance-of-indias-pakistan-targets\">four-day air conflict</a>, both launched missiles and drones at each other’s territories, parts of Kashmir they administer, and military bases, after gunmen killed 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>On the first night of fighting, on May 7, Pakistan claimed it had shot down several Indian aircraft using Chinese-made J-10 Vigorous Dragon jets.</p><p>The PAF deployed a 42-aircraft formation that included JF-17 Thunders and US-made F-16 Fighting Falcons against a 72-aircraft formation from the Indian Air Force. Indian officials initially denied any losses but later acknowledged that <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan\">“some” planes</a> had been lost.</p><p>With a relatively low-price tag of $25m to $30m per aircraft, the JF-17 has long been seen as an attractive option for air forces seeking a cost-effective solution – it is much cheaper than comparable aircraft produced by Western manufacturers.</p><p>Analysts say that its recent combat exposure has added to its appeal, as battle-tested performance often carries greater weight than price alone.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent queries to ISPR and the PAF seeking confirmation and details about the negotiations with different countries, but received no response.</p><p>Beyond Saudi Arabia and Iraq, reports suggest that Sudan’s upcoming deal with Pakistan also involves the JF-17. Pakistan, reports in December suggested, was also planning to sell these jets to Libyan rebels. Outside the Arab world, Bangladesh and Indonesia have also shown interest in the jets.</p><h2 id=\"walking-a-tightrope\">Walking a tightrope</h2><p>But Pakistan’s expanding military clientele also means that the country will need to juggle competing interests, say analysts.</p><p>In Sudan, its weapons and jets will go to the armed forces, which are also supported by Saudi Arabia. Sudan, meanwhile, has accused the United Arab Emirates of financing and arming the paramilitary RSF – a charge the UAE has repeatedly rejected.</p><p>In Libya, Pakistan reportedly struck a $4bn deal in December with Khalifa Haftar, the rebel leader whose army controls a major chunk of the country’s north.</p><p>Sudan’s army – which Pakistan’s army is reportedly about to arm – has previously accused Haftar of helping the RSF. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been on opposing sides in Yemen in recent weeks, with Riyadh accusing Abu Dhabi of arming southern separatists. The UAE has denied those allegations.</p><p>Against that backdrop, it will not be easy for Pakistan to sell the same weapons systems to opposing sides, Umer Karim, an associate fellow at the Riyadh-based King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Karim said that he also believed that the Pakistani jets that Saudi Arabia has reportedly shown interest in are also meant for the Sudanese military.</p><p>But Pakistani platforms, and the JF-17 in particular, offer other benefits, even to Sudan’s army and Libyan rebels, said Sultan, the former PAF officer. That the JF-17 is manufactured jointly with China gives it extra geopolitical heft, he pointed out.</p><p>“These countries may buy fewer numbers [than bigger countries] as per their requirement, but Pakistan may be seen as a most reliable source to acquire aircraft due to strong support from China,” he said.</p><p>Unlike Western weapons systems, jets like the JF-17 are also appealing to Global South militaries because of their “robustness, lower lifecycle cost, ease of maintenance, and rapid operationalisation”, another retired PAF official, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera. This official was involved with the JF-17 programme while in service.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223116\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223116\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25323288920911-1767838925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Pakistani Air Force JF-17 Thunder is on display at the Dubai Airshow.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Pakistani Air Force JF-17 Thunder is on display at the Dubai Air Show, United Arab Emirates, on November 19, 2025 [Altaf Qadri/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"pakistan-s-weapons-exports\">Pakistan’s weapons exports</h2><p>The JF-17 is driving a much wider weapons export push from Pakistan, say analysts.</p><p>A recent report by KTrade, a Karachi-based brokerage and research firm, said that Pakistan’s defence exports include not only fighter jets but also tanks, drones, armoured vehicles, naval systems and small arms.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says Pakistan remains one of the world’s largest arms importers, with most of its imports coming from China, while exporting less than $50m worth of arms annually.</p><p>However, data from Pakistan’s central bank shows that arms and ammunition exports jumped massively in the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, rising from $13m to more than $400m.</p><p>While never officially acknowledged, the jump in figures is widely attributed to <a href=\"/news/2024/6/11/russia-test-will-pakistan-attend-the-ukraine-peace-summit\">Pakistan supplying ammunition</a> to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia since February 2022.</p><p>The reports of potential JF-17 sales come as Pakistan seeks to stabilise its economy and rebuild <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">diplomatic momentum</a>.
