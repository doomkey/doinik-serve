Dressed in a black hoodie and blue jeans, Campbell is well-spoken but shows her disdain for Cape Town’s colonial past, often erupting in harsh language for those she blames for its consequences.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“This castle speaks to the first economic explosion in Cape Town,” she says at the beginning of her five-stop tour of the city. “It’s an architectural crime scene.”</p><p>Campbell refuses to enter the 17th-century castle, which she sees as a symbol of the violence and dispossession that the colonial era brought to South Africa’s second biggest city.</p><p>“That is where they used to hang people,” she says, pointing to one of the castle’s five bastions. It was built by the settlers of the Dutch East India Company, commonly known by its Dutch acronym, VOC. The VOC built the fortress as part of its efforts to establish a refreshment post between the Netherlands and other trade destinations in the East. The castle is now run by the South African military.</p><p>Campbell, an accredited tour guide, has been giving privately run tours like this for 17 years, starting at the castle and offering a scathing critique of the city’s monuments and museums for dozens of people each year.</p><p>She says most official tributes, such as the Slave Memorial erected in 2008 in Church Square, fail to do justice to the enslaved people who contributed to the construction of Cape Town and often neglect to acknowledge the Indigenous population that lived here for hundreds of years before the Dutch arrived in 1652, displacing them and introducing slavery to the Cape.</p><p>Campbell can still see clear echoes in the city of the “genocide” and dispossession of the Khoi people, the Indigenous herders who lived on this land for thousands of years. She remembers her mother’s stories about how this history personally affected her family, who are descendants of the famously wealthy Hessequa, a subset of the Khoi. The Hessequa lost their land and livestock to the Dutch.</p><p>Known as “the people of the trees”, the Hessequa lived for centuries in the farming area now known as Swellendam, about 220km (137 miles) east of Cape Town. The arrival of European settlers transformed them from land and cattle owners to peasant workers employed by white people, conditions that in many places persist to this day.</p><p>Land ownership in Cape Town and South Africa as a whole remains overwhelmingly in the hands of the white minority. Rights groups have also accused white farmers of sometimes abusing predominantly mixed-race agricultural workers and evicting them on a whim, a practice that has carried on since the colonial era.</p><p>“Many of them have worked there for <a href=\"/features/2024/5/30/forgotten-citizens-south-africas-farm-workers-threatened-with-eviction\">generations</a>, and they are just being evicted,” Campbell says. “There’s no pension. There’s nothing. So the ailments of the past [continue].”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203679\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203679\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-01T124013Z_2101072344_RC2BKHA45MB3_RTRMADP_3_TRAVEL-CM-CAPE-TOWN-1767093696.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Castle of Good Hope\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visitors enter Cape Town’s Castle of Good Hope, one of South Africa’s oldest surviving colonial buildings [Esa Alexander/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-coloniality-of-the-museum\">The coloniality of the museum</h2><p>With a resume that includes posts ranging from trade union administrator and mechanic’s assistant to historian, Campbell started her tours after working at the Groot Constantia estate of the VOC colonial Governor Simon van der Stel, now a museum. This is where she got her first taste for history.</p><p>When she started working on the estate as an information officer in 1998, she found that the history of enslaved and Indigenous people was largely erased on the property, including the “tot” system, the use of wine as payments to workers that dates back centuries and was still in use on some Cape Town farms years after the fall of apartheid in 1994.</p><p>Alarmed by this erasure of her ancestors at the estate, Campbell resigned and pursued a degree in history. Armed with a postgraduate degree specialising in the history of slavery in the Cape,<strong> </strong>Campbell established Transcending History Tours in 2008.</p><p>Her academic research uncovered the inherently colonial nature of museums globally. She discovered that human remains were held in museums, universities and in private ownership, especially in Europe. The South African Museum, founded in 1825, housed human remains that were used in studies that sought to reinforce racist ideologies, such as seeking to prove that non-Europeans were racially inferior. Even though these studies have been halted, the remains continued to be housed by these institutions.</p><p>Campbell would prefer that the museums she tours be decentralised and relocated to the <a href=\"/features/2024/4/10/thirty-years-waiting-for-a-house-south-africas-backyard-dwellers\">Cape Flats</a>, a mainly nonwhite working-class area where Campbell and most descendants of the Khoi and enslaved people live. She argues this would make the museums more accessible to these communities, bringing them closer to their personal histories and demonstrating that their current difficult living conditions and marginalisation are not natural or inevitable, but rather the result of a cruel past.</p><p>“At night, this place is filled with homeless people,” she says on a sunny morning in September as the tour leaves the castle.</p><p>A few steps away, past two lions perched on pillars at the castle’s entrance and a moat filled with fish and pondweed, a barefoot man is asleep on the sidewalk while a woman in a bra and camouflage pants scrounges for food in the shrubs. Like most of the unhoused on the wealthy city’s streets, they are people of colour.</p><p>The tour passes the Grand Parade, the city’s public square and oldest urban open space, where the mud and wood predecessor to the existing castle stood. For many years, it served as a training ground for the colonial garrison before becoming a marketplace, surrounded by striking buildings, such as the Edwardian City Hall.</p><p>The parade’s most famous moment in modern South African history was as the setting of Nelson Mandela’s first public speech after his release from prison in 1990. Today, traders still gather here to sell everything from brightly coloured dashikis (colourful, traditional garments) to kitchen electronics.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203682\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203682\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203682\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Krotoa-1767093701.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Krotoa, a Khoi Khoi woman who was the first indigenous person in South Africa to have an official interracial marriage\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Krotoa, a Khoi woman, was the first Indigenous person in South Africa to have an official interracial marriage [File: Creative Commons]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-trailblazer\">A ‘trailblazer’</h2><p>A few blocks away, the group stops to look at a plaque in St George’s Mall dedicated to one of Campbell’s heroes, Krotoa, a Khoi woman known as the progenitor of Cape Town’s mixed-race population after her marriage to a Danish surgeon.</p><p>The plaque dedicated to her in this busy modern commercial area feels misplaced and superficial to Campbell, who says it fails to celebrate the woman’s historical significance. Campbell also dislikes the commonly used image of Krotoa on the plaque, which she says is fabricated.</p><p>“The Krotoa that I know, she’s a trailblazer. She’s an interpreter. She’s a negotiator,” Campbell says.</p><p>The niece of the Khoi chief Autshumato, Krotoa joined the household of the first Dutch governor in the Cape, Jan van Riebeeck, at about the age of 12. As one of the first Indigenous interpreters, she became a mediator between the Dutch and the Khoi, playing a key role in the cattle trade, which was vital to the settlers’ survival at the Cape. She also negotiated in the conflict that arose between locals and the settlers.</p><p>Krotoa’s influence in van Riebeeck’s government eventually led to her becoming the first Indigenous person to be baptised as a Christian in 1662 and adopting the name Eva. She married a Danish soldier, who was later appointed as the VOC surgeon, Pieter van Meerhof, in 1664, and the couple became the Cape’s first recorded interracial marriage.</p><p>In the end, though, Krotoa was a controversial figure: Khoi leaders criticised her for adopting colonial ways, and both they and Dutch officials accused her of being a spy for the other side.</p><p>“She went right into the kitchens of the Dutch,” Campbell says. “She used to tell them, ‘I know you. I know who you are. You can’t do anything for yourself. Slaves have to do everything for you.’”</p><p>Campbell says Krotoa was instrumental as a mediator in the first Khoi-Dutch war, which lasted from 1659 to 1660 and was sparked by a campaign led by local Khoi leader Nommoa, or Doman, to reclaim the Cape Peninsula. The Dutch were victorious against the two Khoi groups, the Gorinhaiqua and the Gorachouqua, and expelled them from the peninsula to mountain outposts about 70km (44 miles) away.</p><p>Asked what she would consider a fitting memorial for Krotoa, Campbell says: “Monuments are Eurocentric and hierarchic. Where her memorial should be, I am not sure. What I know is that her story and her memory should be a popular memory and part of our learning in schools and in other tertiary learning. She and her Danish husband van Meerhof were sent to Robben Island. She also spent lots of time at the first castle, which is today’s Golden Acre [shopping mall], and her so-called plaque in Castle Street is a humiliation of the contributions she made in resisting the colony in favour of her people.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203676\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2019-07-25T100739Z_1921176509_RC1D5A69FC80_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-SLAVERY-ARTEFACTS-1767093665.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C571&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town [File: Mike Hutchings/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"profits-over-people\">Profits over people</h2><p>Around the corner from Krotoa’s memorial in Castle Street, Campbell stops at another VOC landmark – the cobbled walkway featuring the VOC’s bronze emblem framed by an outline of the castle’s five ramparts.</p><p>“I want you to see how the VOC is embedded right in the fabric of the city,” she says, pointing to the insignia emblazoned in the street.</p><p>Then she directs her tour’s attention to nearby skyscrapers, which she views as symbols of wealth rooted in VOC exploitation.</p><p>As she speaks, workers on their lunch breaks walk by while others sell beaded jewellery, paintings, leather handbags and other wares in stalls dotted along the mall. Most of these workers live in overcrowded townships far outside the city, which is famed for its French Riviera-like lifestyle and has often been voted one of the world’s top tourist destinations.</p><p>“For me, it’s important to speak of that company, the first company that came here,” Campbell says, explaining the origin of capitalism in the region.</p><p>“It comes from there – profits before people. It comes from history. … The VOC is alive and kicking in the city.”</p><h2 id=\"restoring-memory\">Restoring memory</h2><p>The most haunting stop on the tour comes next: the Slave Lodge. It stands on the doorstep of the parliament precinct and the gardens that the VOC established to provide fresh produce to ships journeying between the East and the Netherlands.</p><p>Thousands of enslaved people from as far away as Angola, Benin, Indonesia, India and Madagascar were housed here from 1679 to 1811. Converted into a museum, it contains artefacts, including shackles and the reconstructed hull of a slave ship as well as a plinth recording the names of the enslaved people – names assigned to them by slave owners when they arrived at the Cape.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203684\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203684\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Slave_Lodge_museum-1767093721.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Slave Lodge museum in Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Slave Lodge in Cape Town housed thousands of enslaved people from 1679 to 1811 [Creative Commons]</figcaption></figure><p>Campbell objects to the pristine exhibits, saying they are in stark contrast to the building’s dark history as a place of suffering and violence. One of the most horrific aspects of life there was the sexual violence inflicted by soldiers on women, including rape and coercion into sex work, often with payments made to the VOC.</p><p>This violent culture has had lasting effects, contributing to today’s high levels of sexual crimes and domestic violence on the Cape Flats, according to Campbell.</p><p>“The Slave Lodge does not get the reflection that it should get,” Campbell tells her tour. “It is very much veneered and made palatable to the visitors. It doesn’t bring the voices of the women in.”</p><p>The tour ends in the street behind the Slave Lodge, where Campbell shows the tourists a macabre landmark they might otherwise miss. On a traffic island in the middle of Spin Street is the spot where the city’s slave auctions were once held. A tree that marked the spot was chopped down in 1916. In its place, a slab of stone was installed in 1953, inscribed with a fading and barely legible message about its historical significance.</p><p>“It looks like a drain,” Campbell says, noting the sharp contrast between this neglected memorial and the bronze statue of Afrikaner leader Jan Smuts, oddly situated in front of the Slave Lodge, where the plaque bearing his name has been restored to a brilliant gleam.</p><p>In 2008, the city tried to rectify this oversight at the auction site, unveiling a commemorative art installation designed by prominent artists Gavin Younge and Wilma Cruise across the street. It consists of 11 granite blocks, roughly at knee height, inscribed with the assigned names of enslaved people and words that recall their tortured reality: “Suicide, infanticide, abscond, escape, flee.”</p><p>Activists have criticised the installation for being too cold and failing to convey the deep wounds left by nearly 200 years of slavery.</p><p>“Birds s*** on it, people sit on it, but they don’t know what it is,” Campbell says. “They have the names of the slaves that were held at the Slave Lodge, but there’s no story. … It’s a monument that only serves the master, at the end of the day, because it doesn’t bring out the pain of the people.</p><p>“I would have loved to see a high rise to bring out the memory of the people, … something more visible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203622\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203622\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250903_140515-1767091018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Lucy Campbell\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Historian Lucy Campbell, third from right, poses with American students at the end of her tour through historic sites that tell the story of slavery and colonialism in Cape Town [Gershwin Wanneburg/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Both countries have also <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/india-pakistan-missile-race-heats-up-but-china-in-crosshairs-too\">tested ballistic missiles</a> and conducted military exercises.</p><p>Against that backdrop, some analysts say the handshake in Dhaka could be significant.</p><p>Sardar Masood Khan, a former Pakistani envoy to the US, described the handshake as a pleasant diplomatic gesture.</p><p>“One can’t imagine that the Indian foreign minister would greet Pakistan’s speaker spontaneously without the explicit permission of the Indian prime minister and senior leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” Khan told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s Hindu-majoritarian ruling party.</p><p>Khan, who has also served as Pakistan’s envoy to the United Nations and China, referred to how the US – while announcing the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad in May – had “nudged” the two sides towards talks in a neutral country.</p><p>India had rejected those calls at the time: New Delhi insists that there is no point in talking to Pakistan until it stops cross-border fighters from entering India for attacks. India has accused Pakistan of sponsoring “terrorism” on its soil for decades – and in recent times, Pakistan has reciprocated those allegations, accusing New Delhi of backing separatists against Islamabad.</p><p>Each side rejects the other’s accusations, though Pakistan has, at times, accepted that the perpetrators of some of the biggest attacks on Indian soil in recent years – such as in Mumbai in 2008 – did come from Pakistan.</p><p>If there were to be any diplomatic breakthrough between India and Pakistan, Bangladesh would be an unlikely setting: Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan as its eastern wing, before it achieved independence in 1971, with India’s help, after Pakistani troops surrendered and thousands of its soldiers were taken as prisoners of war.</p><p>“Whatever prompted it [the handshake] is good for the region, but there are many ifs and buts down the road,” Khan said.</p><p>Rezaul Hasan Laskar, foreign affairs editor at India’s Hindustan Times newspaper, played down the significance of the interaction.</p><p>“The two happened to be in the same room and did what senior leaders of two countries would do when they find themselves in such a situation. They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries,” Laskar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said it was “significant” that all photographs of the encounter emerged from Bangladeshi and Pakistani official social media accounts – rather than from India.</p><p>Laskar noted that India and Pakistan have not held sustained official dialogue since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when gunmen linked to Pakistan killed 166 people.</p><p>“It is hard to see the two sides coming together in any way, given the growing trust deficit,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"hydro-politics\">Hydro politics</h2><p>Arguably, the most consequential fallout of the May conflict was India’s decision to put the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance.</p><p>Pakistan says the move poses an existential threat to its population, which depends heavily on the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, all of which flow from India or Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Khan, the former diplomat, said that if India were to rethink its position and return to the IWT, it would “be a big confidence-building measure and a harbinger for a semblance of rapprochement”.</p><p>But Laskar wasn’t optimistic.</p><p>“For anyone following India-Pakistan tensions in recent years, the suspension of the IWT should not have come as a surprise,” he said.</p><p>“This has the potential for becoming a new permanent hurdle between the two sides, especially since there are virtually no official contacts between them.”</p><h2 id=\"uncertain-thaw\">Uncertain thaw</h2><p>The past year has seen Pakistan’s geopolitical standing rise, with analysts arguing it is the first time in decades the country has been viewed as a major international player.</p><p>In South Asia, following the ouster of Indian ally Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh prime minister, it has <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">revived its ties</a> with Bangladesh as well, with several high-profile visits between the two countries.</p><p>Islamabad has also deepened ties with the US, China and Middle Eastern states. Trump, in fact, has on several occasions publicly praised Pakistani leadership and recently called Pakistan’s army chief Asim Munir his “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">favourite field marshal</a>”.</p><p>Pakistan is expected to be part of a controversial US-led international <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash\">stabilisation force</a> proposed to oversee security in Gaza, and it also signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">defence agreement</a> with Saudi Arabia in September.</p><p>India, meanwhile, has faced diplomatic pressure from Washington. Trump has repeatedly referred to the May conflict and appeared to endorse Pakistani claims of shooting down several Indian fighter jets.</p><p>The US president has also <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/16/how-us-tariffs-are-unraveling-indias-textile-industry\">imposed tariffs</a> of nearly 50 percent on India, while Pakistan received a lower rate of 19 percent.</p><p>With Pakistan seemingly enjoying diplomatic momentum, could 2026 bring a detente between New Delhi and Islamabad?</p><p>Sayed, the foreign policy analyst, said it was in the “national interest” of both countries to maintain at least minimal engagement.</p><p>“They can have a very basic, minimal agenda, in which they should define the rules, red lines and set guardrails. Once that is done, they can have a basic level of dialogue that is agreed upon with consent of both, and bring it to the table,” he said.</p><p>But Khan was sceptical, given the bitterness of the May conflict.</p><p>Laskar said India has steadily escalated its responses to attacks since 2019 and that the May 2025 conflict showed how far both sides were prepared to go.</p><p>As a result, he said, reviving back-channel contacts between India’s national security adviser and Pakistani intelligence officials was essential, as the mechanism had worked in the past.</p><p>“The consolidation of power by Field Marshal Asim Munir, his ability to strike a personal rapport with US President Donald Trump and the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia mutual defence pact are all factors that have implications for the region, which will be factored into New Delhi’s approach,” Laskar said.</p><p>Sayed agreed, saying a “pre-determined and mutually agreed mechanism” to handle incidents of violence, rather than immediate blame, would be a significant step forward.</p><p>“I think India has also understood that it cannot get away with not acknowledging Pakistan’s existence or pretending that it is not there,” he said.</p><p>“Pakistan has emerged as a very important regional player, and India is now compelled to have a bare-minimum level of engagement.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the STC also seeks to carve out a separate nation in southern Yemen, and in December, expanded its military operations in Hadramout and al-Mahra provinces that border Saudi Arabia, setting off a rapid escalation in tensions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has accused the United Arab Emirates – also a part of the anti-Houthi coalition – of arming the STC and of encouraging the separatist group to expand into Hadramout and al-Mahra, which Riyadh has said threatens its national security.

While crowds cheered and horns blasted in solidarity from a distance, a handful of protesters lingered behind police barricades.</p><p>The block party in and of itself was symbolic in its effort to reach more New Yorkers who have normally been left out of the political process, Democratic strategist Nomiki Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was a way of opening up something that hasn’t been accessible for anybody, you know, that wasn’t part of the inner circle of New York politics and media,” Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was an opportunity to give back to the people who helped him get into office.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209134\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4209134 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6332-1767314647.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"New Yorkers gathered in a first of its kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New Yorkers gathered in a first-of-its-kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-message-of-unity-and-affordability\">A message of unity and affordability</h2><p>Mamdani, Williams and Levine spoke about unity for all New Yorkers, delivering remarks in English, Spanish, Hebrew and Greek, and appearing alongside faith leaders of <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/29/zohran-mamdanis-unlikely-coalition-winning-over-nycs-jewish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several different </a>faiths, including Islam, Christianity and Judaism.</p><p>“We have three swearings-in. One by a leader using a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-mayor-with-historic-quran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quran,</a> one by a leader using a Christian Bible, and one using a Hebrew Bible. I am proud to live in a city where this is possible,” Levine said after taking the oath of office.</p><p>Mamdani echoed that sentiment.</p><p>“We will draw this city closer together. We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism. If our campaign demonstrated that the people of New York yearn for solidarity, then let this government foster it,” Mamdani said in his address.</p><p>“We will deliver nothing less as we work each day to make this city belong to more of its people than it did the day before.”</p><p>But the core message, voiced repeatedly by Mamdani, Levine, Williams, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, was the same one that defined the campaign: that the ultra wealthy should pay higher taxes.</p><p>“Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes is not radical. It is exactly the right thing to do,” Sanders said, as supporters chanted, “Tax the rich.”</p><p>One of <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/21/will-zohran-mamdani-help-or-hurt-new-yorks-economy\">Mamdani’s core promises</a> was to raise the corporate tax rate in New York City from 7.25 percent to 11.5 percent, equivalent to that of neighbouring New Jersey, as well as a 2 percent increase in taxes on those who make more than $1m a year. Any tax plan would need the approval of the governor to move forward.</p><p>“This movement came out of eight-and-a-half million somewheres – taxi cab depots and Amazon warehouses, DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] meetings and curbside domino games. The powers that be had looked away from these places for quite some time – if they’d known about them at all – so they dismissed them as nowhere. But in our city, where every corner of these five boroughs holds power, there is no nowhere and there is no no one,” Mamdani said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Housing policy has been central to that affordability message for Mamdani. One of his signature campaign promises was to freeze the rent on the city’s rental stabilised apartments, which represent about half of the city’s rental housing stock.</p><p>“Those in rent-stabilised homes will no longer dread the latest rent hike – because we will freeze the rent,” Mamdani said in his remarks.</p><p>Only hours later, Mamdani introduced a slate of executive orders all aimed at housing.</p><p>“On the first day of this new administration, on the day when so many rent payments are due, we will not wait to deliver action,” Mamdani said at a news conference.</p><p>He announced three executive orders inside a rent-stabilised building in Brooklyn, including the creation of two new city task forces on housing policy: one to take inventory of city-owned land that could be used for housing, and another to identify ways to spur development.</p><p>“The housing crisis is at the centre of our affordability crisis. There are a number of things we are going to be focused on: protecting tenants, going after bad landlords, and building more housing. A huge part of how we get out of our housing crisis is to build more affordable housing across the city,” Leila Bozorg, the Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning, told Al Jazeera on the steps of City Hall hours before announcing the new policies.</p><p>“These are policy decisions we can address if we have the political will and if we put the resources behind it. And that is what he [Mamdani] is committed to doing.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In one instance — Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting — the president’s eyelids appeared to droop, and he slouched forward, as if nodding off.</p><p>But in his Wall Street Journal interview, Trump blamed the media for creating false rumours. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink,” he said of the alleged sleeping incidents.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged to the newspaper that he had asked White House staff to slim down his schedule to focus on more important meetings, though he emphasised the decision had nothing to do with his alertness or stamina.</p><p>“I’ve never been a big sleeper,” Trump said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-02T184316Z_717141069_RC2H8IAHK1PY_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1767297319.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump closes his eyes while attending a cabinet meeting\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump attends a cabinet meeting at the White House on December 2, 2025 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"high-dose-of-aspirin\">High dose of aspirin</h2><p>One of the big revelations from the Journal’s interview was the high volume of aspirin Trump admitted to taking.</p><p>“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.”</p><p>Daily aspirin therapy is sometimes recommended to prevent a heart attack or stroke, particularly in older people.</p><p>But while the typical dosage starts at approximately 75mg, according to the Mayo Clinic, Trump told the Journal he consumes about 325mg per day — on the higher end of the spectrum.</p><p>“They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” Trump said of his doctors. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years.”</p><p>Trump credited the high aspirin regimen for causing easy bruising on his hands, another source of persistent public scrutiny. He explained that he turns to makeup to conceal when he has been “whacked again by someone”.</p><p>“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,” he said, citing a past incident when Attorney General Pam Bondi accidentally cut his hand with her ring.</p><p>Trump, an avid golfer, also confirmed to the Journal that he does not share the enthusiasm for exercise and fitness that cabinet members like Robert F Kennedy Jr or Pete Hegseth share.</p><p>“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump said. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”</p><p>Nevertheless, last August, Trump announced he would be relaunching the Presidential Fitness Test — a nationwide physical fitness test for grade-school students — in public schools. The test had been phased out in 2013 in favour of more inclusive fitness standards.</p><p>Members of Trump’s administration have also been criticised for fatphobic comments, particularly those directed at top military leaders with decorated service.</p><p>At a meeting in Quantico, Virginia, in October, Hegseth told hundreds of military leaders that “it’s tiring to look out at combat formations” and “see fat troops”, or enter the Pentagon and “see fat generals and admirals in the halls”.</p><p>Presidential fitness has been an increasingly pressing concern in the US political sphere, particularly since the tumult of the 2024 presidential election, which saw Biden drop his re-election bid less than four months before the vote due to questions about his age.</p><p>In a particularly disastrous June 2024 presidential debate, the then-81-year-old Biden appeared to struggle to complete his thoughts.</p><p>Trump, who has faced similar criticisms, blasted Biden as “Sleepy Joe” on the campaign trail and continues to invoke his Democratic rival’s competency as a contrast to his own.</p><p>Questions about ageing presidents, though, have long been a concern as older candidates take office.</p><p>Republican Ronald Reagan famously faced rumours about his competency, particularly as he ran for a second term in the 1980s. He was 77 years old when he left office, and by 1994, he announced he had Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>But Trump has consistently denied feeling the ravages of age, and in Thursday’s interview, he once again took the opportunity to credit his genes for his success: “I have very good genetics.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
