United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That is wrong. ICE has authorised its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that needs only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and that’s wrong,” Madel says in the video.</p><p>Madel said the party had made it “nearly impossible” for Republicans like him to win a statewide election in Minnesota, even as the Democratic Party in the state is embroiled in a sweeping corruption scandal.</p><p></p><p>Madel’s decision comes just days after US Border Patrol agents shot dead Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while he was filming an Operation Metro Surge patrol in Minneapolis on Saturday.</p><p>The shooting unleashed a <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/25/outrage-after-us-agents-kill-icu-nurse-alex-pretti-in-minnesota\">wave of outrage across the US,</a> as well as questions about how it was handled by top White House officials such as Kristi Noem, who heads the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>Noem and her department – which oversees ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – were quick to place the blame on Pretti in the aftermath of the shooting, who she accused of “brandishing” a weapon at Border Patrol officers and engaging in “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>Pretti was a licensed gun owner and armed at the time of his killing. Video evidence shows he was not holding his gun at the time he was shot. Instead, CBP agents can be seen disarming Pretti before shooting him multiple times.</p><p>Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, told Al Jazeera that Noem and others had broken with traditional protocol following a civilian shooting.</p><p>“The response of the homeland secretary there was very offensive and off the cuff. When you have a shooting of a civilian by a law enforcement officer, there should not be comment until the facts come out,” said Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W Bush<span>.</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Noem’s remarks and the narrative around the shooting drew rare criticism from Republicans, some of whom took issue with the characterisation of Pretti’s gun at the scene.</p><p>Republicans such as Senators Bill Cassidy and Lisa Murkowski, Representative Thomas Massie, and traditionally conservative organisations like the National Rifle Association, have all pushed back and alluded to Pretti’s right to bear arms under the US Constitution.</p><p>“Lawfully carrying a firearm does not justify federal agents killing an American — especially, as video footage appears to show, after the victim had been disarmed,” Murkowski wrote on X.</p><p>Senator Thom Tillis, another Republican, also appeared to tacitly criticise Trump officials on X, writing that “any administration official who rushes to judgement and tries to shut down an investigation” would do a disservice to the president and the nation.</p><p>Cassidy, Murkowski, and Tillis are among a small group of congressional Republicans who have called for an in-depth investigation into Pretti’s shooting.</p><p>David Smith, an expert in US politics and foreign policy at the University of Sydney in Australia, told Al Jazeera that silence elsewhere in the Republican Party also spoke volumes.</p><p>“The fact that most Republicans are really quiet about it is in itself a very telling sign,” Smith said.</p><p>“Because of the fact the Department of Homeland Security suggested that, because Alex Pretti was carrying a gun, therefore he was a terrorist … A lot of Republicans are really worried about what their pro-gun constituents are going to think,” he said.</p><p>Smith said disquiet had spread beyond the pro-gun lobby, as well, to other corners of the Republican Party that fear government overreach.</p><p>“They’re looking at this situation in American cities where you have armed federal troops wearing masks with no accountability whatsoever using violence in almost a seemingly random way,” he continued.</p><p>“This really looks like the government just throwing its weight around in ways that are dangerous to ordinary people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, disagreements remained over whether SDF fighters would integrate individually or retain their battalions. The SDF also wanted some form of autonomy or political decentralisation for the northeast.</p><p>But <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/syria-designates-aleppos-kurdish-areas-closed-military-zones-as-clashes-persist\">clashes</a> in Aleppo and a rapid government offensive pushed the SDF back. The offensive was bolstered by an alliance of sorts with tribes in Deir Az Zor and Raqqa, and support from the US, which signalled that its yearlong support for the SDF may be ending.</p><p>“…the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps,” US Special Envoy Tom Barrack wrote on social media platform X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s very much clear the US gave the green light for advances from the government in Deir Az Zor,” Thomas McGee, the Max Weber Fellow specialising on Syria at the European University Institute in Florence, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>With this new reality on the ground, a new deal was agreed on January 18 that gave more favourable terms to Damascus.</p><p>“The March agreement has been replaced by the January deal signed under military duress on Damascus’s terms,” Nanar Hawach, International Crisis Group (ICG)’s senior Syria analyst, told Al Jazeera. “Both parties have agreed to individual integration: SDF fighters join the Syrian army as individuals, not preserved units. This was Damascus’s core demand.”</p><p>Mazloum Abdi (also known as Mazloum Kobani), the SDF commander, has also reportedly been offered positions as either deputy defence minister or governor of Hasakah.</p><p>“It seems like the government has all the cards,” Alexander McKeever, author of the newsletter This Week in Northern Syria, told Al Jazeera from Damascus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-fears\">Kurdish fears</h2><p>An extended <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/ceasefire-between-syrian-army-and-kurdish-led-forces-extended-for-15-days\">15-day ceasefire</a> was agreed on Saturday, though analysts and observers said clashes were ongoing. They also said the ceasefire was likely brokered by the US to move ISIL (ISIS) fighters imprisoned in the area to Iraq, before the beginning of a more intense government offensive.</p><p>Many residents of Deir Az Zor and Raqqa celebrated the Syrian government’s entering their areas. Videos spread on social media of locals stomping on yellow SDF flags and waving the green, white and black Syrian flag. On Saturday, the Syrian Ministry of Justice announced it had released 126 juveniles from al-Aqtan, an SDF prison in the Raqqa province.</p><p>But as the Syrian Army continued its offensive, residents of Kurdish-majority areas have expressed fears that massacres inflicted on the coast or in Suwayda last year could repeat in the northeast.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Analysts said recent history has shaken this population to the core. From 2014 to 2017, a <a href=\"/news/2024/5/31/yazidi-survivors-ten-years-on\">genocide of the Yazidi people</a>, a Kurdish-speaking religious minority, was committed by ISIL. Other incidents involved Turkiye or Turkish-backed groups, some of which were incorporated into the Syrian army, including an <a href=\"/news/2018/1/21/turkeys-troops-cross-over-into-syrias-afrin\">invasion in Afrin</a> in 2018. Many families are still displaced from Afrin.</p><p>“Kurdish fear is existential, grounded in what they’ve witnessed over the past year and experienced directly this month,” ICG’s Hawach said. “The Syrian army includes factions that view Kurds as enemies, not fellow citizens. This creates genuine fears about what government control could mean.”</p><p>In Kobane, a Kurdish-majority city on the border with Turkiye that is also known as Ain al-Arab, thousands of families have sought refuge after the fighting. Locals and analysts said the area was overcrowded to the point that some displaced families were sleeping in cars or crowding together in homes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The United Nations says more than 134,000 people have been displaced in the Hasakah province of northeast Syria due to the clashes.</p><p>Locals in Kobane claimed the government had cut off water and electricity since January 17. The Syrian government denied it was besieging the area and that the Tishrin Dam, which provides electricity, had been damaged during the fighting.</p><p>The area is also undergoing an intense cold front of sub-zero temperatures, which locals call the worst in years. The Kurdish Red Crescent reported on Saturday that five children had frozen to death in the last week.</p><p>A UN convoy of 24 trucks arrived in Kobane on Sunday, carrying blankets and basic needs, but a resident, who asked their name be withheld for fear of retribution, told Al Jazeera, “It’s not enough.</p><p>“We don’t have vegetables, we do not have basic items such as sugar or rice,” they said. “There are half a million people, all without electricity and without water … and with major internet problems.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-will-of-the-syrian-government\">‘The will of the Syrian government is not a military takeover’</h2><p>In addition to the hardship, locals expressed fear that after the ceasefire period, government forces may enter Kurdish-dominant towns.</p><p>Musa, the coordinator of the Missing Persons group, said locals feared that sieges and service cuts would turn into policies of collective punishment, that national and religious minorities such as Kurds and Yazidis would be targeted or subjected to arbitrary arrests or enforced disappearances.</p><p>“The military escalation, the imposition of severe restrictions on movement, and the cutting off of basic services have led to widespread displacement and an unprecedented state of collective fear, particularly in predominantly Kurdish cities like Kobane and Hasakah, in addition to the serious repercussions of what happened in the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods of Aleppo,” Musa said.</p><p>Syrian government officials expressed awareness of concerns from locals in northeast Syria.</p><p>“The suspicious emotions are understandable after decades of marginalising discrimination and most recently after the systematic propaganda against the state itself, plus, of course, I will not hide behind my fingers, the violations that took place in Suwayda and on the coast,” Obayda Ghadban, a researcher with the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The will of the Syrian government is not a military takeover; it is an option, but it is directed to a political solution, and we hope it is the one that will prevail. Not the military or security option,” Ghadban emphasised.</p><p>He said President al-Sharaa and the government are committed to ensuring Kurdish rights, including through a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">presidential decree</a> from Friday, January 16.</p><p>But government assurances have done little to ease the angst of many of Syria’s Kurdish community and other minorities in the country’s northeast. Locals said that for goodwill to be gained, the government could reopen roads, restore basic services, give access to humanitarian organisations and ensure civilians are protected.</p><p>“What we are witnessing is a true test for the transitional government: Either it protects civilians and their rights, or the region slides into a deeper humanitarian and human rights catastrophe, the price of which will be paid by future generations,” Musa said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa –</strong> On a late November morning – two days before leaders of the world’s leading economies convened in Johannesburg for the 2025 Group of 20 summit – the governors of the South African and Chinese central banks met just 20 minutes away to inaugurate a system that many hope can help move international trade out of the shadow of dollar dominance.</p><p>At a ceremony at the South African Reserve Bank in Pretoria that day, Standard Bank – Africa’s largest by assets – became the first on the continent to link directly into China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This integration means African businesses can now settle payments with China directly in renminbi without the use of any intermediary currency – notably the United States dollar (USD).</p><p>The USD has been the world’s principal reserve currency since the end of World War II, and is used in more than 80 percent of international trade today.</p><p>But in recent years, talk of alternatives to the greenback has been gaining traction, particularly in the Global South, and spearheaded by the BRICS group of developing economies, of which South Africa is a part, along with Brazil, Russia, India and China as the founding members. Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates have also joined in recent years.</p><p>Like South Africa, Brazil has also integrated into CIPS. At the same time, it has increasingly been using the real and the yuan to settle bilateral trade with China, such as in the sale of soya beans, bypassing the USD.</p><p>Other countries have also been leaning into the use of local currencies. India and the UAE have traded in rupee and dirham, while China and the UAE have settled liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade in yuan. China has traded with others, including Argentina, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, using the yuan. And China and Russia have sharply shifted their bilateral trade settlement into local currencies, partly as a workaround to bypass Western sanctions. China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia has mainly been settled in renminbi. India and Russia have increased the use of roubles and rupees for their bilateral trade.</p><p>As a group, BRICS is also pushing ahead with its Bridge digital currency that, if successful, would allow them to trade bypassing both the USD and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) – a messaging network banks use to facilitate international payments, which is heavily influenced by US and European Union regulations. Although the Bridge system is not yet active, a working model is expected to be presented during this year’s BRICS summit in India.</p><p>For analysts, bilateral trade allowing countries to set their own terms has always been part of international economics. So such endeavours are not new or unexpected.</p><p>However, they are increasing in frequency as there is more incentive to move away from sole dependence on the USD, say analysts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3766309\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3766309\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2015-03-13T120000Z_325275701_GM1EB3D1PDE01_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-CURRENCIES-1749565248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Money\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A currency exchange operator counts US dollars in Abuja, Nigeria [File: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hidden-costs-that-benefit-the-us\">‘Hidden costs’ that benefit the US</h2><p>While the US, as the world’s leading economy, has historically dominated global trade, that influence has waned over the last decade, with China taking the lead, especially in the Global South, which accounts for 85 percent of the world’s population and about 50 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>In Africa, for example, China was the source of most of the continent’s imports in 2024, followed by the EU, India and the US, according to the United Nations Comtrade database. For that reason, bilateral trade in local currencies, or integrating CIPS, makes economic sense, analysts say.</p><p>“For every time you do a transaction in the dollar, there is a hidden cost that goes back to the US,” notes Sanusha Naidu, a foreign policy analyst at South African think tank, the Institute for Global Dialogue.</p><p>Now, according to the analyst, countries around the world have rightly started asking: “Why must we pay the US that cost?”</p><p>Instead of the buyer’s local currency getting converted into USD before being converted into the seller’s currency, with both parties risking losing some revenue in the process, money can now flow directly.</p><p>But for Danny Bradlow, a professor with the Centre for Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria, local currency trade faces challenges; and these are less about what is possible and more about what is practical.</p><p>Although two countries can trade in whatever currency they choose, whether each party would want stores of the other’s currency is unclear, he said.</p><p>For example, if two countries with not many transactions between them – like Botswana and Mexico – want to trade goods, it would be more practical for them to convert pulas and pesos into dollars to trade with the in-demand USD than to keep large amounts of one another’s tender.</p><p>Another challenge in bypassing the USD is that the “infrastructure that supports trade settlement in local currencies must first be in place to ensure the wide adoption of local currency transactions”, said Shirley Yu, managing director of ACME Macro Advisory and director of the China-Africa Initiative at the London School of Economics.</p><p>As well as CIPS, she pointed to BRICS Pay (a decentralised financial messaging and payment system designed for BRICS nations) and Project mBridge (a multi-central bank digital currency platform), which are enabled by blockchain technology. “The technology infrastructure itself enables countries to trade in local currencies without going through SWIFT or using the dollar as the medium of exchange”, but these need to be built up, she said.</p><p>Although the number of local currency transactions is increasing, it is still a fraction of what goes through SWIFT and the USD. The Chinese currency is still involved in less than 10 percent of global trade, for instance. While other currencies, like the European tender, are also in use globally, Yu noted that “the renminbi is a bigger trade settlement currency than the euro”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"incentives-to-change\">‘Incentives’ to change</h2><p>But what has shifted and grown dramatically are “the incentives to change and develop alternatives”, said Bradlow of Pretoria University, “and one of the ways you see that is that the price of gold is going up so much”.</p><p>Countries are no longer treating the USD as a fully stable reserve currency; instead, they are managing and hedging their risk against it, says Naidu. The rise in gold and silver prices signals this declining trust in the dollar, she adds.</p><p>Chris Weafer, an investment analyst with Macro-Advisory, a strategic consultancy that focuses on Eurasia, says political changes in the US have led to this distrust.</p><p>“President [Donald] Trump’s lack of predictability and the huge US debt mean that the US dollar is not as safe or as predictable as it used to be.” The US national debt is currently more than <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/23/us-national-debt-surpasses-a-record-38-trillion\">$38 trillion</a>.</p><p>“But even without Trump, many people around the world – even in the West – would say that the role of the dollar is a problem,” Bradlow argued.</p><p>“Having a system that’s so heavily dependent on the dollar means … vulnerability to US monetary and economic policies. Shifting to a system that is more diversified or more internationalised in some way but not subject to one country’s control would be more acceptable to everyone,” he says.</p><p>But does that mean the end – or even the beginning of the end – for the US dollar?</p><p>Most analysts still say no.</p><p>“The US dollar will remain the global reference currency, for example, pricing oil or materials, and would be the world central banks’ main reserve currency,” Weafer said.</p><p>There are currently “no alternatives to the US dollar in terms of currency”, he said.</p><p>But experts also say a replacement for the USD is not necessarily what the Global South and BRICS countries are seeking. What they want is diversification and alternative or additional trade settlement systems – ways to get around SWIFT or a Western hegemonic system through which the US asserts its dominance.</p><p>However, even these alternatives “will still rely on the US dollar as a reference currency”, Weafer noted.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US will also do all it can to protect the dominance of the dollar, Yu said.</p><p>“President Trump wants to ensure the dollar’s global dominance, through the Genius Act,” she notes, referring to the US law that creates a framework for issuing and supervising US‑dollar stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like the USD.</p><p>“The dollar is fundamental to the US national power, therefore, national security. The global dominance of the dollar will be protected at all costs.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"usd-in-a-slow-burn-decline\">USD in a ‘slow burn’ decline</h2><p>Although the USD faces no real competition and will maintain its position, for international relations expert Naidu, the debate playing out is about more than just the “hard currency” value of the dollar. It is about the rise and fall of nations and how hegemonic power tends to peak and unravel after 70-80 years.</p><p>The USD, like the US empire itself, is a “wounded hegemon”, she said.</p><p>When a hegemon becomes wounded and feels its dominance challenged, “it becomes very dangerous and unpredictable”.</p><p>Naidu said the four pillars of US structural power – security, finance, knowledge and production – have all been anchored in the dollar. As more countries become risk-averse to the dollar, and as alternative payment systems emerge, these pillars weaken.</p><p>So while the USD is not about to be suddenly replaced, it is undergoing a “slow burn” decline, she said, arguing that this is more dangerous and consequential than if it were a rapid collapse.</p><p>Although the world is a long way away from having another currency to rival the dollar, if one were to emerge in the “very long term”, many experts say it might be China that is next in line.</p><p>If countries lose confidence in the US economy, political leadership and dollar, “eventually, it will be the rise and greater use of the Chinese yuan that will break the global dominance of the US dollar,” Weafer said, especially in the Global South.</p><p>Yu said “the scale of dedollarisation will certainly expand among Global South countries”, especially in the light of recent geopolitical events in Venezuela, and US tensions with Iran.</p><p>But “the quantum shift for the global currency architecture will happen when the petroyuan replaces the petrodollar”, she added, referring to a scenario where the yuan becomes the currency used for global oil pricing and settlement – a function currently performed by the USD.</p><p>“This event, if it does happen, will signal the end of the US dollar as the global central reserve currency,” Yu said, noting how China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia over the past few years has already largely been conducted in renminbi.</p><p>The bottom line, according to analysts, is that there is no imminent or even medium-term threat to the USD, but that is less because of anything the greenback is doing right, and more because international trade, for the most part, has few other options at the moment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Shawon had gone to jail with Musabbir four times under the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which was widely accused of brutal crackdowns on the political opposition, including through mass arrests, killings and forced disappearances.</p><p>That era of fear, many Bangladeshis believed, had ended with Hasina’s ouster in the popular student-led uprising, which forced her to flee to India on August 5, 2024.</p><p>But while the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who replaced Hasina, is not accused of orchestrating any such excesses, political violence in Bangladesh is surging again ahead of the upcoming vote.</p><p>“Police say there was no political motive [behind Musabbir’s killing], but fear doesn’t disappear,” said Shawon, a leader of the BNP’s student wing in the capital, Dhaka. “We don’t want killings or confrontation with anyone. But the reality is, during elections, violence feels inevitable.”</p><p>Bangladesh is heading to the polls for the first time since Hasina was removed from power, ending more than 15 years of hardline government. The Yunus interim government is overseeing a vote that coincides with a referendum on state reforms, with about 120 million voters eligible to cast ballots in the South Asian nation of approximately 170 million people.</p><p>Yet, a series of killings, threats and street clashes is reviving fears of a return to past election-season violence, which Bangladesh has routinely grappled with since its 1971 independence from Pakistan.</p><p>Across Bangladesh’s 300 constituencies, the BNP is leading a coalition of 10 like-minded parties. Meanwhile, the Jamaat-e-Islami, also known as the Jamaat, is heading a separate 11-party alliance, which includes the National Citizen Party, a group formed by students who led the anti-Hasina movement.</p><p>Outside these blocs, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh, which broke away from the Jamaat-led alliance, and the Jatiya Party, a longtime ally of Hasina’s Awami League (AL), are contesting independently. The AL itself is absent from the election as Yunus’s administration banned its political activities in May 2025.</p><p>But while these parties represent diverse ideological platforms, a spate of killings and violent attacks across the country is sparing none of them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25198412179733-1769477144.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman mourns the death of her son who died during the previous day's violent clashes between supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and security forces in Gopalganj, Bangladesh, Thursday, July 17, 2025.

He died a day later in a Dhaka hospital, with the motive for the killing unclear.</p><p>Mollah was the 16th political activist killed since the Bangladesh Election Commission announced the election schedule on December 11, according to local media reports.</p><p>Days earlier, a ward-level leader of the Jamaat, 65-year-old Anwarullah, was killed at his residence in Dhaka’s West Rajabazar neighbourhood during what police described as a burglary.</p><p>The deaths followed the December killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a youth leader who emerged as a prominent face of the 2024 protests and was preparing to contest a parliamentary seat in central Dhaka.</p><p>Hadi was shot on December 12, a day after the election schedule was announced, by gunmen on a motorcycle and later died on December 18 in a Singapore hospital, triggering unrest and renewed security concerns nationwide.</p><p>None of the killings has been officially classified as politically motivated. Yet, for party activists, that distinction offers little reassurance.</p><p>Local media and rights groups say BNP leaders and activists account for 13 of the 16 deaths recorded since the election schedule was announced. The others include Hadi, Jamaat leader Anwarullah, and a leader of the banned AL youth wing, Jubo League.</p><p>Seven of the victims were shot dead, underscoring the widespread presence of illegal firearms, reports Prothom Alo, a Bangla daily.</p><p>Government data show that of the 3,619 weapons looted from security forces during the 2024 uprising, about 1,360 remain unaccounted for, along with a large quantity of ammunition, despite security forces recovering more than 60 percent of the stolen arms ahead of the polls.</p><p>Meanwhile, at least 62 election-related clashes have been recorded nationwide since the election schedule was announced, according to a report by the Human Rights Support Society (HRSS).</p><p>For many Bangladeshis, these deaths revive bitter memories of decades of political violence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267848\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267848\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267848\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25198492534838-1769477203.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jamaat-e-Islami activists condemn Wednesday's attack in Gopalganj on National Citizen Party (NCP) leaders by supporters of the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during a protest in front of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Thursday, July 17, 2025.

Khan said the intimidation was aimed at keeping rival supporters away from polling centres on election day.</p><p>Abdul Latif, the local BNP leader accused of issuing the threats, acknowledged confronting Khan, but dismissed the complaint. “He defamed our candidate,” Latif said. “We will not spare anyone who provokes us.”</p><p>According to Prothom Alo, 92 BNP leaders remain in the race as rebel candidates across 79 constituencies.

Since then, residents say fear has lingered as rival activists maintain a visible campaign presence in the locality.</p><p>“This is really a frightening situation for ordinary voters like us,” said Abdullah Al Mamun, who lives about 500 metres (547 yards) from the site of the violence. “We don’t want clashes. We just want to vote peacefully.”</p><p>BNP and Jamaat leaders have accused each other of intimidation, and have both criticised the Election Commission for failing to act decisively.</p><p>“We fear violence as election day approaches,” said Jubaer Ahmed, a Jamaat leader. “Our activists are being intimidated across the country, our campaigns are being obstructed, and in Mirpur, our women activists were attacked.”</p><p>However, from the BNP side, Saimum Parvez, a party leader involved in election coordination, alleged that Jamaat activists were collecting voter information illegally.</p><p>He also said that recent killings of political activists should not be dismissed as internal disputes. “Some of these may be targeted killings meant to disrupt the election,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He accused Jamaat of spreading online disinformation, which is spilling out into offline tensions, and warned that any perception of a “managed election” would only increase the risk of violence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267859\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267859\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-11-17T110918Z_738190056_RC29YHAIQJAF_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-VIOLENCE-1769477460.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Demonstrators throw stones towards police during a protest demanding demolition of the house of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, after the verdict on cases against Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, November 17, 2025 REUTERS/Fatima Tuj Johora\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4267859\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrators throw stones towards police during a protest demanding the demolition of the house of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the removed leader, Sheikh Hasina, and the leader of Bangladesh’s struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971, in Dhaka, on November 17, 2025  [Fatima Tuj Johora/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-festival-yet-harder-to-control\">A festival, yet harder to control</h2><p>Police say that street confrontations are becoming harder to prevent nationwide as political activity expands.</p><p>A police officer in Kurigram, a northern district near the Indian border, said that rival BNP and Jamaat groups came face to face during door-to-door campaigning at two locations following Friday prayers, forcing police to intervene.</p><p>“After many years, elections feel like a festival again,” the officer told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity. “More ordinary people are getting involved, but that also means confrontation risks have increased.

In the following weeks, Hamas releases two Israeli-American captives and two elderly captives, and Israeli forces recover an Israeli soldier taken captive during the attack.</p><p><strong>November:</strong> A deal is reached between Israel and Hamas that will result in the largest release of captives until the 2025 ceasefire deal, with 81 Israeli women and children and 24 foreign captives released. The agreement includes a slight increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza, choked off by Israel in defiance of international law, and the release of 240 Palestinian women and teenage detainees and prisoners held by Israel, many of them being held without charge.</p><p><strong>December:</strong> Israeli forces in Gaza shoot and kill <a href=\"/news/2023/12/16/israeli-hostages-mistakenly-killed-in-gaza-were-had-a-white-flag-official\">three Israeli captives</a> holding a white flag and attempting to be rescued, underscoring the lax rules around the use of force by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip.</p><h2 id=\"2024\">2024</h2><p><strong>February:</strong> Israeli forces recover two captives during a raid in southern Gaza as protesters in Israel call for a deal to bring the remaining captives home.</p><p><strong>June:</strong> Israeli forces conduct a raid in the Nuseirat neighbourhood of central Gaza to recover four captives, accompanied by indiscriminate bombing and attacks in the surrounding area that kill at least 274 Palestinians.</p><p><strong>July:</strong> <a href=\"/news/2024/7/31/israel-subjecting-palestinian-detainees-to-torture-and-abuse-un-report\">A report</a> by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights finds that Israel is holding about 9,400 Palestinians as “security detainees”, often without giving them a reason for their detention, in facilities where abuses such as torture and sexual assault are widespread.</p><p><strong>August:</strong> The discovery of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/new-footage-shows-six-israeli-captives-held-in-gaza-tunnel-prior-to-deaths\">six dead Israeli captives</a> in a Hamas tunnel in southern Gaza sparks anger in Israel and mounting pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives. The Israeli leader is accused of sabotaging negotiations on several occasions in order to continue the war. A video is released of several Israeli security force members gang-raping a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman detention facility in Israel, notorious for abuse and torture.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>December:</strong> United States President-elect Donald Trump says there will be “hell to pay” if remaining captives are not released before his inauguration on January 20, 2025.

His lawyers later say he is tortured in Israeli detention, where he remains despite international calls for his release.</p><h2 id=\"2025\">2025</h2><p><strong>January:</strong> A ceasefire deal is reached for the release of 33 Israeli captives, 25 of them living and eight dead, and hundreds of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Under the deal, a second phase of negotiations is supposed to lead to the release of the remaining captives and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, but Netanyahu unilaterally breaks off the agreement and resumes the war after six weeks. Hamas additionally releases five Thai workers who were among those taken captive by Palestinian fighters on October 7, 2023.</p><p><strong>February:</strong> Israel releases 600 Palestinian detainees after a delay, while Hamas releases Israeli-American Keith Siegel, Israeli-French Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas, along with six other captives. The group later releases six more captives, and returns the bodies of Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were aged four years and nine months respectively when kidnapped, along with their mother, Shiri Bibas, and a man in his 80s named Oded Lifshitz. The fate of the family causes anguish and anger in Israel and the UN condemns the “abhorrent” treatment of captives and their remains by Hamas.</p><p><strong>March:</strong> Israel breaks the ceasefire and <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/israel-launches-gaza-assault-killing-hundreds-and-shattering-ceasefire\">resumes the war</a> with a wave of bombings and attacks across Gaza that kill at least 404 Palestinians in the first day, many of them children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>May:</strong> Hamas hands over Israeli-American Edan Alexander, the last surviving US captive held in Gaza.</p><p><strong>October:</strong> A ceasefire agreement is reached between Hamas and Israel to secure the release of the remaining captives and the remains of the deceased held in Gaza, and Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel.

The Brazilian president had condemned the move as crossing “an unacceptable line”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Lula emphasised to Trump on Monday the need to work for the welfare of ​the Venezuelan people.</p><p>The Brazilian government’s statement did not say whether Lula accepted Trump’s ‍invitation to join the initiative.</p><h2 id=\"board-of-peace\" class=\"p1\">Board of Peace</h2><p class=\"p1\">Lula also ‌requested that Trump’s new proposal for a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/rights-advocates-welcome-canadas-exclusion-from-trump-board-of-peace\">Board of Peace</a> “be limited to the issue of Gaza and include a seat for Palestine”, as global powers worry the initiative launched last ‌Thursday could assume a wider role and rival the United Nations.</p><p class=\"p1\">Lula also urged the “comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including the expansion of the permanent members of the Security Council”.</p><p class=\"p1\">On Friday, Lula, 80, accused Trump, 79, of trying to create “a new UN where only he is the owner”, with his proposed “Board of Peace” following the October 10 ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine war.</p><p class=\"p1\">Although originally intended to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding, the board’s charter does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory and seems to aim to rival the United Nations.</p><p class=\"p1\">Traditional US allies, including France and Britain, have also expressed doubts.</p><h2 id=\"unacceptable-line\">‘Unacceptable line’</h2><p class=\"p1\">Lula and Trump have been in contact several times since their first official meeting in October, which ushered in improved ties after months of animosity between Washington and Brasilia.</p><p class=\"p1\">As a result, Trump’s administration has exempted key Brazilian exports from 40 percent tariffs that had been imposed on Brazil, and lifted sanctions on a top Brazilian judge.</p><p class=\"p1\">Earlier this month, Lula said the US attack on Venezuela to abduct President Maduro crossed “an unacceptable line”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The presidency said the visit would take place after Lula’s trips to India and South Korea in February, and that a date would be set “soon”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The veteran leftist Lula has held phone calls in recent days with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p></div></div></body></html>"
