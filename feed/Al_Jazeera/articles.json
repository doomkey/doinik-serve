His comments came as he has been holding talks with United States and European envoys aimed at ending Ukraine’s war with Russia.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, who has opposed NATO membership for Ukraine, has been pressuring Kyiv to sign a deal with Russia on terms that experts say favour Moscow.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The move marks a big shift for Ukraine. Zelenskyy described the latest proposal as a concession by Kyiv, after years of pressing for NATO membership as the strongest deterrent against future <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">Russian attacks</a>.</p><p>So will Kyiv be able to get security guarantees from its Western allies? And what would be the parameter of the security deal?</p><h2 id=\"what-did-zelenskyy-actually-say\">What did Zelenskyy actually say?</h2><p>In audio messages shared with journalists via a WhatsApp group ahead of the meeting, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv now expects alternative security guarantees comparable to those enjoyed by NATO alliance members.</p><p>“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ukraines-nato-membership-key-question-in-us-talks-says-russia\">NATO</a>; these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” Zelenskyy said.</p><p>“Bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries – Canada, Japan – are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” he said.</p><p>“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he said.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has long said that Ukraine’s NATO aspirations are a threat to Russian security.</p><p>Zelenskyy said that Ukraine, the European Union and the US were reviewing a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point plan</a> that could culminate in a ceasefire, though he reiterated that Kyiv was not holding direct talks with Russia.</p><p>Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Zelenskyy in the German capital city of Berlin on Sunday.</p><p>The Ukrainian president also stressed that new security guarantees must be legally binding and endorsed by the US government. Looking ahead, he said he was expecting feedback following talks between Ukrainian and American officials in Germany.</p><p>For their part, however, many Ukrainians remain sceptical of this latest round of talks. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine said that “it’s been months and months of false hope when it comes to diplomatic discussions. Many of them have historically fizzled out. So … the reality of peace still seems far away.”</p><p>On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “this [NATO] issue is one of the cornerstones and requires special discussion”, and that Moscow is now waiting for Washington “provide us with the concept that is being discussed in Berlin”.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-be-the-likely-contours-of-a-new-security-guarantee\">What will be the likely contours of a new security guarantee?</h2><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"351\">The security guarantees now under discussion would fall short of NATO’s Article 5 – meaning an attack on one is an attack on all. Instead of joining NATO, Ukraine would receive bespoke guarantees from the US and key European powers – set out in bilateral or plurilateral treaties.</p><p data-start=\"353\" data-end=\"782\">These guarantees would likely commit partners to swift and tangible support if Ukraine were attacked again, including military assistance, intelligence sharing, arms supplies, sanctions and financial aid.</p><p data-start=\"353\" data-end=\"782\">Unlike in Article 5, however, the guarantees would not trigger automatic collective defence. Each guarantor’s obligations would be defined separately, potentially with conditions, and without NATO’s integrated command structures.</p><p data-start=\"353\" data-end=\"782\">The final version of the deal, however, would only be known after Kyiv’s Western allies agree on it. It is still unclear how much progress has been made on the issue.</p><h2 id=\"what-obstacles-still-remain\">What obstacles still remain?</h2><p>For months, Washington has tried to balance the competing demands of Russia and Ukraine. Trump has been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/trump-says-close-to-ukraine-deal-kyivs-allies-urge-pressure-on-moscow\">pushing hard for a conclusion to the war</a>, and is said to be growing increasingly frustrated with delays.</p><p>Efforts to find common ground have faced significant hurdles, including the future of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, much of which is under Russian occupation.</p><p>Putin has made it a central condition for peace that Ukraine withdraw its forces from the remaining areas of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control – a demand Ukraine has consistently rejected.</p><p>Zelenskyy said the US had proposed that Ukraine pull out of Donetsk and turn the area into a demilitarised free economic zone, an idea he dismissed as impractical. “I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?” he said.</p><p>“If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact … only a police mission should be there, and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5-10 kilometres [3-6 miles], for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?”</p><p>Calling the matter “very sensitive,” Zelenskyy said a freeze along the existing line of contact would be preferable, adding that “today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand”.</p><p>On the flip side, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business newspaper Kommersant that Russian police and national guard forces would remain in parts of Donetsk even if the region were designated a demilitarised zone under a future peace plan.</p><p>Ushakov cautioned that reaching a compromise could take considerable time, arguing that US proposals reflecting Russian demands had been “worsened” by revisions suggested by Ukraine and its European partners.</p><p>In remarks broadcast Sunday on Russian state television, Ushakov said that “the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive”, warning that Moscow would have “very strong objections”.</p><p>He also said territorial issues were a major topic when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. “The Americans know and understand our position,” Ushakov said.</p><h2 id=\"are-other-discussions-also-taking-place\">Are other discussions also taking place?</h2><p>On Sunday, Zelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron shortly before meeting Trump’s envoys, <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/2000249013564756323\">thanking him</a> on X for his support and noting, “We are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.”</p><p>Macron <a href=\"https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2000238998237630720\">responded</a>, noting that “France is, and will remain, at Ukraine’s side to build a robust and lasting peace – one that can guarantee Ukraine’s security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.”</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has led European support efforts alongside Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said on Saturday that “the decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.”</p><p>However, he warned that Putin’s objective is “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders… If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” Merz said at a party conference in Munich on Saturday.</p><p>Putin has denied any intention to reestablish the Soviet Union, or to attack European allies.</p><p>However, for years, Putin has decried the expansion of NATO around Russia’s borders. On February 24, 2022, the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Putin said in a televised address: “Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance’s infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian territory are unacceptable for us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-happening-on-the-battlefront\">What’s happening on the battlefront?</h2><p>Over the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1388\">weekend</a>, Ukraine’s air force said that Russia had launched ballistic missiles and 138 attack drones overnight. Of those, 110 were intercepted or destroyed, though missile and drone strikes were recorded at six locations.</p><p>Zelenskyy said on Sunday that hundreds of thousands of families in the southern, eastern and northeastern regions of Ukraine remain without electricity, and that officials were working to restore power, heat and water after a large-scale attack the previous night.</p><p>He added that Russia had fired more than 1,500 strike drones, 900 guided aerial bombs and 46 missiles of various types at Ukraine over the past week. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down 235 Ukrainian drones late Saturday and early Sunday.</p><p>In the Krasnodar region, drones struck the town of Afipsky, which houses an oil refinery. Authorities said blasts shattered windows in residential buildings but reported no damage to the refinery.</p><p>Fighting has also intensified in the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russia-damages-turkish-owned-vessels-in-attack-on-ukrainian-ports\">Black Sea</a>. Russian forces recently struck Ukrainian ports, damaging Turkish-owned vessels, including a ship carrying food supplies. An attack on Odesa set grain silos ablaze, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Like his mouth sounds like it’s full.</p><p>She added: “We’re at a point where it’s very dangerous territory.”</p><p>Ahmed, who worked as a car mechanic, was arrested by counterterrorism police in a dawn raid in November 2024, eight months before Palestine Action was proscribed as a “<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/29/i-am-a-terrorist-uk-activists-release-video-to-support-palestine-action\">terrorist organisation</a>“. He is charged with aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder over his alleged involvement in the break-in at the Elbit site months earlier. He will have spent more than 20 months in prison by his trial, which is set for June 2026.</p><p>Palestine Action has accused the UK government of complicity in Israeli war crimes in Gaza and said it is “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.</p><p>On December 9, lawyers of the remand prisoners wrote to David Lammy, the justice secretary, requesting an urgent meeting.</p><p>“There is the real and increasingly likely potential that young British citizens will die in prison, having never even been convicted of an offence,” the law firm Imran Khan &amp; Partners wrote in the letter seen by Al Jazeera. “As the Secretary of State for Justice, you are in the unique position of being able to address their concerns … before it becomes too late to avoid the death of one or more of our clients.”</p><p>Of Ahmed, the firm wrote: “He feels incredibly dizzy, especially when standing. He has suffered from tightness in his chest and shallow breath.”</p><p>Alam accused the Prison Service of failing to update the family on Ahmed’s health condition and is worried that he is not being observed closely enough.</p><p>At the time of publication, the Ministry of Justice had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>The protest is said to be the largest coordinated hunger strike in UK prisons since 1981 when Irish Republican inmates led by Bobby Sands refused food.</p><p>The demands of the pro-Palestine hunger strikers include immediate bail, the right to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action. They are also calling for all Elbit sites to be closed.</p><h2 id=\"crisis-point-for-activists\">‘Crisis point for activists’</h2><p>Qesser Zuhrah, 20, and Amu Gib were the first to go on hunger strike 44 days ago. They are accused of involvement in the Elbit and RAF action, respectively.</p><p>Zuhrah, who has lost 13 percent of her body weight, recently lost consciousness and was hospitalised, according to reports. Her friends and advising doctors told Middle East Eye that prison authorities have refused to provide information regarding her condition.</p><p>Gib has lost more than 10kg and must lie down most of the day because she suffers from exhaustion. She has been offered a wheelchair, her lawyers said, “due to her inability to walk”.</p><p>“Reports that Palestine Action activists on hunger strike have been hospitalised due to seriously deteriorating health send chills down the spine,” Amnesty International UK said. “This is crisis point for these activists – prosecutors must drop the allegations of a ‘terrorism connection’ in these cases and end any excessively lengthy pre-trial detention.”</p><p>Lammy has yet to respond to the lawyers’ requests for a meeting.</p><p>In parliament last week, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told Labour MP John McDonnell, who has written to Lammy about the hunger strikers, that it was “totally unacceptable” of ministers to fail to respond to correspondence.</p><p>Pressure mounted further on Lammy when several days ago, Alam confronted the justice secretary while he was attending a Christmas event in London. Video footage shared on social media shows her presenting a letter to him and explaining her family’s concerns. He can be seen responding, “I don’t know anything about this,” and later asks, “In the UK?”</p><p>Their exchange was “deeply concerning”, Alam said.</p><p>“It made me feel more sick, knowing that the people who are in a position to help end this hunger strike are not engaging.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Bryant received 35 life sentences, but his motive for the shooting, which prompted a raft of new anti-gun legislation, was never made clear.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what took place, despite Australia’s strict gun laws.</p><h2 id=\"who-were-the-shooters\">Who were the shooters?</h2><p>During a news conference on Monday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the suspects were a 50-year-old man, who was shot dead by police at the scene, and his 24-year-old son, who was also shot but remains in hospital in critical, but stable, condition.</p><p>Lanyon said the father “is a licensed firearms holder who had six firearms licensed to him”, emphasising that he “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms licence”.</p><p>The police confirmed that the 50-year-old suspect lived in a Sydney suburb and held a New South Wales firearms licence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><span>How strict are Australia’s gun laws?</span></h2><p>Two weeks after the shooting at Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, the government led by Prime Minister John Howard of the conservative Liberal-National coalition launched<span> the </span><a href=\"https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1399510/17-257.pdf\">National Firearms Agreement</a> (NFA)<span>, which significantly tightened Australia’s gun laws.</span></p><p><span>The new legislation was effectively an agreement drawn up between the Australian government and Australia’s various states and territories, which adopted the new legislation by passing their own corresponding laws. While specific laws do vary from state to state, they are all guided by the NFA and National Handgun Control Agreement measures.</span></p><p><span>The legislation banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles, required gun owners to register their firearms with the police and apply for licences to own them, and initiated a buyback programme that removed some 650,000 assault weapons from public circulation.</span></p><p>It now takes at least 28 days for a gun licence application to be processed.</p><p>Under the law, gun owners are required to provide proof of a valid reason for owning a gun. This could be membership in a recreational hunting club, or being employed as a security guard, for example. Gun owners may own multiple firearms as long as they have specific reasons for requiring them.</p><p>Owning a gun for the purpose of self-defence is not considered a valid reason and is expressly prohibited in Australia.</p><p>Before a gun owner can become fully licensed to own or use a gun, he or she must complete a multi-day safety course, pass a written test, and complete a practical assessment to demonstrate they can safely use and maintain a gun.</p><p>After that, Australia’s National Firearms Register conducts background checks to determine whether the applicant has any criminal record or any court-ordered mental health orders.</p><p>Those who have committed serious crimes linked to sexual assault, violence, drugs, robbery, “terrorism”, organised crime, illegal weapons, or fraud are barred from holding gun licences.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-common-are-shootings-in-australia\">How common are shootings in Australia?</h2><p>Mass shootings are very rare in Australia, which is considered a generally safe country.</p><p>On the Global Peace Index, which is produced by the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the country ranks 18th among 163 countries.</p><p>In the years immediately following the 1996 passage of the National Firearms Agreement, Australia experienced a handful of shooting incidents, each resulting in no more than three fatalities.</p><p>In October 2002, an international student believed to be suffering from paranoid delusions shot and killed two other students on campus at Monash University in Melbourne, Victoria. He injured five others, including a lecturer. After this, handgun laws became even stricter.</p><p>In recent years, however, there has been a rise in the number of guns being sold. It is unclear why this is, but some reports link it to increasing demand for hunting sports.</p><p>But the mass shooting at Bondi Beach comes just two months after a 60-year-old man in the Sydney suburb of Croydon Park shot <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/australian-police-search-for-motive-in-rare-mass-shooting-in-sydney\">up to 50 bullets</a> from his window at cars in a busy street, wounding one person critically, according to police. Fourteen others were treated at the scene for shock or minor injuries, including from glass from shattered car windows, emergency services said.</p><p>The suspect in that case was arrested after police stormed his apartment. However, police said he has no links to organised crime or “terror” organisations and no history of mental ill health. They have not established a clear motive for the shooting.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-the-australian-authorities-responded-to-the-bondi-beach-shooting\">How have the Australian authorities responded to the Bondi Beach shooting?</h2><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday that he will discuss introducing even stronger gun control laws with the National Cabinet.</p><p>Albanese told a news conference that the Australian government “is prepared to take whatever action is necessary” and “included in that is the need for tougher gun laws”.</p><p>He added that this could mean restrictions on the number of firearms each person is allowed to own or be licensed to use, along with more regular reviews of their licences. The authorities in Australia do carry out firearms licence checks currently, but in most states and territories, these are relatively infrequent unless triggered by a specific incident or raised concern.</p><p>“Licences should not be in perpetuity, and checks, of course, making sure that those checks and balances are in place as well,” Albanese said.</p><p>New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference on Monday: “It does require legislation. It means introducing a bill to Parliament, making it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-bondi-shooting-happen-despite-australia-s-strict-gun-laws\">How did the Bondi shooting happen despite Australia’s strict gun laws?</h2><p>“It is very reasonable to ask how another massacre has happened in Australia, given we have extremely strict gun laws,” Samara McPhedran, a principal research fellow at Griffith University in South East Queensland, Australia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>McPhedran, whose research expertise includes gun violence, said that it is too early to know whether there were any failures in the licensing process.</p><p>“This is certainly something that police will look at as part of their investigation, and it is important to gather all the facts before rushing to conclusions. It is crucial that we know the exact circumstances that led up to this event, if we are to identify things that may have gone wrong and ways to fix those.”</p><p>McPhedran said obtaining a gun licence in any state or territory in Australia is not a quick and simple process, and “obtaining a gun licence is subject to an extensive range of controls”.</p><p>She added: “Questions are being asked about the number of firearms – six – that were legally registered to one of the shooters. This number is nothing unusual. Most licence holders own multiple different types of firearms, for different purposes, for example, hunting different types of animals or shooting in different types of competitions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-solution\">What is the solution?</h2><p>“Although it may seem counterintuitive, the number of firearms, what type they were, and whether the perpetrators were licensed, are not the real issue,” McPhedran said.</p><p>In the history of mass shootings in Australia both prior to and after the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, she said, some perpetrators held licences, and some did not. Some perpetrators used semiautomatic firearms; some did not. Most used one or two firearms.</p><p>“However, from 1996 onwards, our reaction to firearm violence has always been the same: swift political announcements of bans, buybacks, more laws. We have done this time and time and time again, and it is very clear that this approach does not work to prevent violence,” McPhedran said.</p><p>She added, “We can keep doing more of the same and hope for a different result. Or we can try a different approach.”</p><p>McPhedran said that for years, politicians have “fostered division and hostility between Australians” based on religious, racial, ethnic, cultural and other identity divisions to win votes, causing lasting harm to communities through increased intolerance and prejudice.</p><p>In recent years, successive governments in Australia have clamped down hard on immigration, with many migrants from some countries held for months on end in offshore detention centres on islands such as Nauru and Manus. This has sparked concerns from human rights activists.</p><p>In January 2025, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said the Australian government had violated a human rights treaty by <a href=\"/news/2023/6/25/last-refugee-held-on-nauru-arrives-in-australia\">detaining a group of asylum seekers, many of them minors</a> on Nauru, despite them being granted refugee status.</p><p>“If we are serious about preventing future violence – whether with a firearm or any other method – we must change how we engage in public debate, stop the short-term political gameplaying, and heal the divisions in our community,” McPhedran said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The statement was, of course, framed as a humanitarian gesture that would allow those in urgent need to travel for medical care, education or family reunification to leave.</p><p>However, Israel’s announcement was met almost immediately with Egypt’s denial, followed by a firm rejection from several Arab and Muslim states.</p><p>To the rest of the world, this response may seem cruel. It may seem like Arab states want to forcibly keep in Gaza Palestinians desperate to evacuate to safety. This fits right into the Israeli narrative that neighbouring Arab countries are responsible for Palestinian suffering because they would not “let them in”.</p><p>This is a falsehood that has unfortunately made its way into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/26/1232826942/rafah-gaza-palestinians-egypt-border\">Western media</a>, even though it is easily disproved.</p><p>Let us be clear: No, Arab states are not keeping us against our will in Gaza, and neither is Hamas.</p><p>They want to make sure that when and if some of us evacuate temporarily, we are able to come back. We want the same – a guarantee of return. Yet, Israel refuses to grant it; it made clear in its December 3 announcement that the Rafah crossing would be open only one way – for Palestinians to leave.</p><p>So this was clearly a move meant to jump-start forced displacement of the Palestinian population from their homeland.</p><p>For Palestinians, this is not a new reality but part of a long and deliberate pattern. Since its inception, the Israeli state has focused on the dispossession, erasure, and forced displacement of the Palestinians. In 1948, 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and were not allowed to return. My 88-year-old grandfather was among them. He still keeps the Tabu (land registry document) for the dunams of land he owns in his village of Barqa, 37km (23 miles) north of Gaza, where we are still not allowed to return.</p><p>In 1967, when Israel occupied Gaza, it forbade Palestinians who were studying or working abroad from returning to their homes. In the occupied West Bank, where colonisation has not stopped for the past 58 years, Palestinians are regularly expelled from their homes and lands.</p><p>In the past two years alone, Israel has seized approximately <a href=\"https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/162049?utm_source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55,000 dunams</a> of Palestinian land, displacing more than 2,800 Palestinians. In Jerusalem, Palestinians whose families had lived in the holy city for centuries risk losing their residency there if they cannot prove it is their “centre of life”. In the past 25 years, more than 10,000 Palestinian residencies have been revoked.</p><p>Since October 2023, Israel has repeatedly attempted to engineer forced mass displacement in Gaza – dividing the Strip into isolated zones separated by military corridors and “safe” axes and launching successive operations to push residents of the north towards the south. Each wave of mass bombing carried the same underlying objective: to uproot the people of Gaza from their homes and push them towards the border with Egypt. The most recent push occurred just before the latest ceasefire took effect.</p><p>According to Diaa Rashwan, chairman of the Egyptian State Information Service, Cairo rejected Israel’s proposal because it was an attempt to shun its commitments outlined in the second phase of the ceasefire. That phase requires Israel to withdraw from Gaza, support the reconstruction process, allow the Strip to be administered by a Palestinian committee, and facilitate the deployment of a security force to stabilise the situation. By announcing Rafah’s reopening, Israel sought to bypass these obligations and redirect the political conversation towards depopulation rather than reconstruction and recovery.</p><p>That Israel wants to create the conditions to make our expulsion inevitable is clear from other policies as well. It continues to bombard the Strip, killing hundreds of civilians and terrorising hundreds of thousands.</p><p>It continues to prevent adequate amounts of food and medicines from getting in. It is allowing no reconstruction materials or temporary housing. It is doing everything to maximise the suffering of the Palestinian people.</p><p>This reality is made even more brutal by the harsh winter. Cold winds tear through overcrowded camps filled with exhausted people who have endured every form of trauma imaginable. Yet despite hunger, exhaustion, and despair, we continue to cling to our land and reject any Israeli efforts to displace and erase us.</p><p>We also reject any form of external guardianship or control over our fate. We demand full Palestinian sovereignty over our land, our resources, and our crossings. Our position is clear: the Rafah crossing must be opened in both directions; not as a tool of displacement, but as a right to free movement.</p><p>Rafah must be accessible for those who wish to return, and for those who need to leave temporarily: students seeking to continue their education abroad, patients in urgent need of medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, and families who have been separated and long to be reunited. Thousands of critically ill Palestinians have been denied life-saving care due to the siege, while hundreds of students holding offers and scholarships from prestigious universities around the world have been unable to travel to pursue their education.</p><p>Rafah should also be open to those who simply need rest after years of trauma – to step outside Gaza briefly and return with dignity. Mobility is not a privilege; it is a basic human right.</p><p>What we demand is simple: the right to determine our future, without coercion, without bargaining over our existence, and without being pushed into forced displacement disguised as a humanitarian project.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The police or security guards were on the way, he wrote, as he begged for a taxi.</p><p>The boy had shot his target, but the man had survived.</p><p>Only 48 hours had passed between the boy being added to the Signal chat and the shooting.</p><p>Police arrested him shortly after, but due to his age, he was not convicted or sentenced.</p><p>He was placed in state care and remains under social services supervision.</p><p>When the recruitment process began remains unclear, but investigators believed it likely started when he responded to an ad - possibly a so-called murder contract - circulating on social media platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram, or on encrypted apps like Telegram, where children are now usually recruited.</p><p>In late 2024, Telegram shut down a channel called Samurai Barnen (Samurai Children), which had amassed about 11,000 members, after Swedish police notified the platform.</p><p>Screenshots later published by local media outlets from the channel show how the “murder contracts” appeared.</p><p><em>Murder:</em></p><p><em>Malmo urgent: 800k-1m ($85,000-107,000)</em></p><p><em>Gothenburg urgent: 300-400k ($32,000-43,000)</em></p><p><em>Stockholm urgent: 500k ($53,000)</em></p><p><em>Denmark: 1 million ($107,000)</em></p><p><em>Throw a grenade:</em></p><p><em>Malmo: 30-50k ($3,100-5-300k)</em></p><p>The attacks are often framed as “challenges” or “missions”, which the police say is a “gamification technique\" to make the posts more engaging and less intimidating for children.</p><p>The timeframe from a child’s initial contact with a recruiter to carrying out a violent act can range from a matter of days to a month, Salman Khan, a project manager of an exit programme for children in gangs at Fryshuset, Sweden's largest youth organisation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Ten years ago, recruiters would have to go to a place where kids are physically, but now social media is the way,” said Khan, who works with a programme called 180 Degrees, which connects children who have been involved in crime with positive adult role models who can help them leave that world behind.</p><p>Khan describes the recruitment process as a form of grooming where boys, and to a lesser extent girls, as young as 12, who he says don’t necessarily know the difference between “play” and the “real life” consequences of carrying out a violent act, are lured into a criminal underworld.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175366\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175366\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-4175366 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-17-130738-1765794304.png?w=566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sweden child gangs\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4175366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A transcript of a recruitment conversation published by the Swedish Police Authority.

Looking for a job in Stockholm, just no murder [screenshot from polisen.se]</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>In his conversations with children in SiS facilities, Khan has observed how the role many aspire to in gangs has been inverted in recent years.</p><p>“It has become a status thing to be the one to throw a grenade or to shoot someone rather than be a gang leader. Ten years ago, everyone wanted to be Tony Montana [the fictional crime boss in the film Scarface],” he explained.</p><p>The shift reflects how social media and the glamourisation of violence in popular culture have made instant notoriety more desirable than lasting authority, Khan added.</p><p>Carrying out an attack can give the child a sense of validation in the gang and access to fast money that can get them the \"clothes, chains, phones, cars and luxury life\" they see on social media and in television series.</p><p>He used the example of the popular Netflix series Snabba Cash (Fast Cash), which portrays Sweden’s criminal underworld as a spectacle of guns, money and fast cars and features teenage characters who act as runners for gangs.</p></div></div></body></html>"
