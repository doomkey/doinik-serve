He has claimed credit for ceasefires between India and Pakistan in May and Israel and Iran in June, and helped mediate truce pacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.

They are typically paid by those who buy the materials they forage, depending on the quality and quantity they can find and sort.</p><p>As a result, they have no stable income and their work is hazardous, particularly in the summer months.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58693-5#Sec17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> published in the scientific journal Nature, the temperature at these landfill sites varies based on the size of the dump. The temperature from dumps exceeding 50 metres (164 feet) in height generally lies between 60 and 70C (158F) in the summer. This “heat-island effect” is caused by the decomposition of organic waste, which not only generates heat but also releases hazardous gases.</p><p>“These landfills are gas chambers in the making,” says Anant Bhan, a public health researcher who has specialised in global health, health policy and bioethics for 20 years. “Waste pickers work in extreme heat, surrounded by toxic gases. This leads to long-term health complications,” he explains.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Additionally, they are exposed to several gases, like the highly flammable methane, which causes irritation to their respiratory system. The rotting waste also leads to skin-related complications among the waste pickers.”</p><p>Ghazipur, which now towers at least 65 metres (213 ft) high – equivalent to a 20-storey building – has become a potent symbol of Delhi’s climate crisis.</p><p>Begum’s eye started swelling up in the intense heat last year. “I went to the doctor and he suggested surgery to treat my eye, which would cost me around 30,000 rupees ($350) but I don’t have that kind of money,” she says.</p><p>Like other waste pickers, Begum says she is reluctant to visit the government hospital, where she could receive free treatment, as it can take six months to receive a diagnosis there. “It is a waste of time to stand in queue for long hours at the cost of work days, and the diagnosis takes months to come through,” she explains. “I prefer going to the Mohalla Clinic; they check the Aadhaar Card [a form of identification] and instantly give medicines.”</p><p>The Mohalla Clinics, an initiative started by former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, offer free primary healthcare, medicines and diagnostic tests to residents in low-income areas.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tanzila-1754650725.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi garbage pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tanzila, 32, who works as a waste picker at the Ghazipur landfill site in New Delhi, fainted in the scorching sun last year, and now works mostly at night [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-ticking-time-bomb\">A ticking time bomb</h2><p>On a blazing summer day in July as temperatures reach 40C (104F), Tanzila, 32, who also lives in the slum next to the landfill site, is preparing for her night shift of waste picking. “It’s just too hot now,” she says. Tanzila, a mother of three children aged eight to 16, who has done this job for 12 years, says she passed out from dehydration while working under the sun last year. “Now I only go at night. During the day, it feels like being baked alive.”</p><p>Slender and dressed in a full-sleeve red, floral kurta with a headscarf, Tanzila appears exhausted and weary. She explains that when she did work during the day. “I would go early in the morning, come back around 9am, then again go around 4pm and come back around 7pm. But for the past two years, I have been going with other women only at night during summers because it has become harder to work during the day in this weather.”</p><p>Sheikh Akbar Ali, cofounder of Basti Suraksha Manch and a former door-to-door waste picker, has been campaigning for the rights of waste pickers across 52 sites in Delhi for the past 20 years. He explains that the conditions can be more dangerous at night than during the day.</p><p>“There are many vehicles like the tractors and JCBs operating on the landfills at night, and the waste pickers who work at night wear torchlights on their head, which indicates their visibility on the landfill. However, waste and gas leaks are more visible during the day.” This is because fires and smoke can more easily be seen in the daylight.</p><p>Despite the government’s repeated <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/govt-plans-to-remove-all-three-landfill-sites-in-delhi-in-next-two-years-minister-gahlot/articleshow/98903415.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assurances</a> that these rubbish mountains will be cleared, little has changed on the ground. In the latest assurance made in May 2025, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Delhi’s environment minister, claimed that the “garbage mountains” would be completely cleared by 2028, contradicting his own statement from April 2025, in which he had said that they would “disappear like dinosaurs” in five years.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878451\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-entrance-of-Ghazipur-landfill-from-where-all-the-trucks-carrying-the-citys-garbage-enter-1754650885-rotated.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The entrance to the Ghazipur landfill, through which all the trucks carrying the city’s waste enter [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As the summer heat accelerates the decomposition of organic waste, the release of hazardous gases has worsened the air quality in Delhi, something environmentalists and public health experts have sounded the alarm over.</p><p>According to a report from AQI, an open-source air quality monitoring platform based in New Delhi, since 2020, satellites have detected 124 significant methane leaks across the city, including a particularly large one in Ghazipur in 2021, which leaked 156 tonnes of methane per hour.</p><p>Even though the same work which puts food on the table also makes them ill, waste pickers like Begum and Tanzila say they have little choice other than to continue with their work. “Garbage is gold to us. We don’t get bothered by the smell of waste. It feeds our families, and why would we leave?” asks Tanzila.</p><p>Their labour, unrecognised as a profession by the government, comes with few protections, no health insurance and no stable income. Rubbish pickers must fashion their own safety gear from whatever they can afford – such as used disposable masks which can be bought in the market for 5 to 10 rupees (6 to 11 cents) – but nothing is particularly effective at keeping workers free from hazards.</p><p>“They don’t wear gloves because the heat makes their hands sweat easily and they aren’t able to hold waste properly. Even the masks are a total waste because all the sweat gets collected in the mask, which makes it difficult for them to breathe,” adds Akbar.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878457\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878457\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shah-Alam2-1754651002.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘The garbage grows, and we keep working.’ Shah Alam, a Delhi waste picker who also drives an electric rickshaw [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"when-climate-change-and-waste-mismanagement-meet\">When climate change and waste mismanagement meet</h2><p>New Delhi’s civic bodies, which are under pressure from environmental and health activists to demonstrate some visible progress in tackling the city’s waste and <a href=\"/features/2024/11/29/death-in-the-air-how-is-life-different-in-worlds-most-polluted-city\">pollution problems</a>, have largely responded with quick fixes, most notably plans to build four incinerator plants in Okhla, Narela, Tenkhand and Ghazipur. But experts warn that such infrastructure-centric solutions only mask deeper problems and could also cause further environmental damage.</p><p>Incinerators often release various harmful pollutants such as dioxins, furans, mercury contamination and particulate matter into the air, which pose serious health risks, they say.</p><p>According to a 2010 report by the World Health Organization, dioxins are “highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer”.</p><p>Furthermore, if incineration plants replace landfill-based recycling, many fear the erasure of their livelihoods altogether.</p><p>“Delhi’s shift to incinerators has completely excluded informal waste pickers, particularly women,” says Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group. “It threatens their livelihoods and pushes them into deeper poverty. It is an environmental disaster in the making. Incinerators emit toxic fumes and undermine recycling efforts.”</p><p>“Beyond just closing landfills or building incinerators, we need to ensure that waste pickers have alternative livelihoods and are part of the formal waste management system,” says Chaturvedi.</p><p>“This is not just about clearing garbage,” she argues. “It’s about including waste pickers in the formal economy. It’s about creating decentralised, community-level waste management systems. And it’s about acknowledging that climate change and poverty are deeply interconnected.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878462\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878462\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-look-at-the-Ghazipur-landfill-from-its-entrance-1754651191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the Ghazipur landfill site from its entrance [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Activists and public health professionals advocate for the creation of a decentralised waste system, one that includes segregating waste into separate places according to type, ward-level composting (processing organic waste locally to avoid transportation), and robust recycling systems.</p><p>Formalising the role of waste pickers by offering legal recognition, fair wages, protective gear and access to welfare schemes would not only empower one of the city’s most vulnerable communities, but it would also help build a climate-resilient waste management model, say environment activists.</p><p>Back at the Ghazipur landfill, the reality remains grim. Fires break out with increasing frequency, and the acrid air clings to nearby homes. For residents and waste pickers, the daily battle against the heat, stench and illness is a matter of survival.</p><p>“Nothing has changed. The garbage grows, and we keep working,” says Shah Alam, Tanzila’s husband, who used to work solely as a waste picker but now also drives an electric rickshaw to earn a living. “During summers, more people fall sick, and we lose workdays. But what other option do we have?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They then overlaid the results with maps of cultural sites to pinpoint which places could be inundated in the coming decades.</p><p>The findings show waves could reach Ahu Tongariki, the largest ceremonial platform on the island, as early as 2080. The site, home to the 15 towering moai, draws tens of thousands of visitors each year and is a cornerstone of the island’s tourism economy.</p><p>Beyond its economic value, the ahu is deeply woven into Rapa Nui’s cultural identity. It lies within Rapa Nui National Park, which encompasses much of the island and is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p>The roughly 900 moai statues across the island were built by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th centuries to honour important ancestors and chiefs.</p><p>The threat isn’t unprecedented. In 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded – a magnitude 9.5 off the coast of Chile – sent a tsunami surging across the Pacific. It struck Rapa Nui and swept the already-toppled moai further inland, which damaged some of their features. The monument was restored in the 1990s.</p><p>While the study focuses on Rapa Nui, its conclusions echo a wider reality: Cultural heritage sites worldwide are increasingly endangered by rising seas. A UNESCO report published last month found that about 50 World Heritage sites are highly exposed to coastal flooding.</p><p>A UNESCO spokesperson told The Associated Press news agency that climate change is the biggest threat to UNESCO’s World Heritage marine sites. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Possible defences for Ahu Tongariki range from armouring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.</p><p>Paoa hopes that the findings will bring these conversations about now, rather than after irreversible damage. “It’s best to look ahead and be proactive instead of reactive to the potential threats.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In cases of severe human rights violations, it ruled that there can be no sweeping amnesty nor age limits for prosecution.</p><p>In 1995, for instance, Peru passed a separate amnesty law that would have prevented the prosecution of security forces for human rights abuses between 1980 and that year. But it was greeted with widespread condemnation, including from United Nations experts, and it was eventually repealed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the case of the current amnesty law, nine UN experts issued <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/07/peru-bill-establishing-amnesty-atrocity-crimes-violates-international\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a joint letter</a> in July condemning its passage as a “clear breach of [Peru’s] obligations under international law”.</p><p>But at Wednesday’s signing ceremony, President Boluarte reiterated her position that such international criticism was a violation of her country’s sovereignty and that she would not adhere to the Inter-American Court’s decision.</p><p>“Peru is honouring its defenders and firmly rejecting any internal or external interference,” Boluarte said.</p><p>“We cannot allow history to be distorted, for perpetrators to pretend to be victims, and for the true defenders of the homeland to be branded as enemies of the nation they swore to protect.”</p><p>Peru’s armed forces, however, have been implicated in a wide range of human rights abuses. Just last year, 10 soldiers were convicted of carrying out the systematic rape of Indigenous and rural women and girls.</p><p>Drawing from Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, the human rights group Amnesty International estimates that the country’s armed forces and police were responsible for 37 percent of the deaths and disappearances that happened during the conflict.</p><p>They were also credited with carrying out 75 percent of the reported instances of torture and 83 percent of sexual violence cases.</p><p>Francisco Ochoa, a victims’ advocate, <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/7/30/dramatic-setback-will-perus-new-amnesty-law-put-justice-out-of-reach\">spoke to Al Jazeera last month</a> about his experiences surviving the 1985 Accomarca massacre as a 14-year-old teenager.</p><p>He had been in the corn fields preparing to sow seeds when soldiers arrived and rounded up the residents of his small Andean village.</p><p>Despite having no evidence linking the villagers to rebel groups, the soldiers locked many of them in their huts, fired into the structures and set them ablaze.</p><p>As many as 62 people were killed, including Ochoa’s mother, eight-year-old brother and six-year-old sister.</p><p>“The first thing I remember from that day is the smell when we arrived,” Ochoa, now 54, told journalist Claudia Rebaza. “It smelled like smouldering flesh, and there was no one around.”</p><p>When asked how he and other survivors felt about the amnesty law, Ochoa responded, “Outraged and betrayed”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In April, car companies, including <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/30/automakers-suspend-financial-guidance-amid-tariff-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stellantis, Ford and Volvo, suspended</a> financial guidance as a result of the uncertainty.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last month Volvo also said that tariffs will cost it $1.2bn in the second quarter. Ford then announced it expects a reduced annual profits to $3bn after taking an $800m hit from tariffs in the second quarter. GM announced that it expects a $5bn hit, and Toyota said it expects $9.5bn in tariff-driven blows to profits for the year.</p><p>In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. Those cars began to reach lots last month.</p><p>As a result, consumers are overwhelmingly opting for used cars that are not subject to tariffs, including foreign-made ones, as they are already on US roads.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Used car sales are up 2.3 percent from this time last year, according to Used Car Index report, an auto industry insight platform by Edmunds.</p><p>In part, this is because of the limited supply of used cars. Edmunds’s report says that buyers, and sellers looking to upgrade but need the money from sale of a current car, are hesitant about undertaking expenses amid economic uncertainty.</p><p>The bigger impact of both those trends is of inventory piling up. On average, dealerships have 82 days worth of cars on the lot, a roughly 14 percent increase between May and June.</p><h2 id=\"an-expensive-escalation\">An expensive escalation</h2><p>Cox forecasts prices could rise anywhere between 4 to 8 percent over the next six months as a result of the tariffs. The group expects new car sales of 13 million to 13.3 million this year.</p><p>“Tariffs will be inflationary on both the new and used vehicle market,” Schirmer said, adding, the main challenge right now is the unsold inventory that’s piling up.</p><p>Analysts believe that prices will continue to rise amid Trump’s tariffs, especially as companies try to move supply chains to the US, as demanded by Trump, an effort that is years in the making.</p><p>“The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the meantime, the cost to import a car is expected to increase by $1,000 this year to $5,700, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>“The US imports a little less than half of the new vehicles sold, but dependence on imports varies substantially by segment. The most dependent segments are at the two ends of the price spectrum – the most affordable vehicles and luxury vehicles. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"evs-hit-hard\">EVs hit hard</h2><p>Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall.</p><p>“Our forecast had been for approximately 10 percent of new vehicle sales this year to be EV. We slightly lowered that to 9 percent,” Schirmer added.</p><p>Volvo reported a 26 percent decline in sales for electric vehicles (12 percent overall). Ford EV sales tumbled by 31 percent. Rivian saw sales decline by 23 percent. Tesla saw a decline of 13.5 percent globally as CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement hindered the brand’s reputation. The cuts to the EV tax credit is expected to cost Tesla $1.2bn every year, JP Morgan forecast.</p><p>“Several dealers have also stated that these [EV tax credits] are the main drivers [for consumers]. So without those incentives, there would definitely be a significant hit through EV sales,” Golara added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>General Motors has been the exception to the rule. The Michigan-based auto giant doubled its <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2025/07/03/gm-tesla-ev-sales-elon-musk/84452115007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EV sales</a> in recent months.</p><p>Despite the dip in sales, Golora believes that the setback in the EV market is temporary.</p><p>“It’s [the EV market] still compelling in the long run because many manufacturers have already reached a decision that this is where the industry is going,” Golara said.</p><p>“Investment [in EV production] doesn’t look like a lost one. The payback period will be longer.”</p><h2 id=\"manufacturing-strains\">Manufacturing strains</h2><p>While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. Production tumbled by 2.6 percent for the month as demand began to slow.</p><p>US auto manufacturing employment is also down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the United Auto Workers for comment about the effect on car manufacturing jobs, but the organisation did not respond.</p><p>“Demand was not growing as fast as needed, and many manufacturers were caught by surprise. That’s a problem, and it is kind of a longer-term, structural issue,” Golara said.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"
