The bid has a total enterprise value of more than $108bn, including debt.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The extension marks the second time Paramount has pushed out the deadline since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this month, Warner’s board rejected an amended Paramount bid that included $40bn in equity personally guaranteed by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. Larry Ellison is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>As of late Wednesday, Paramount said more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. That remains far below the 50 percent threshold needed to gain control of the company, which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in its Series A common stock.</p><p>“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement on Thursday, adding that it is “clear our shareholders agree”, as more than 93 percent have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme”.</p><p>In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72bn. This week, it switched its offer from a cash and stock combination to an <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/netflix-switches-its-warner-bros-offer-to-all-cash-deal-to-quell-paramount\">all-cash deal </a>that the companies say is more straightforward and will speed the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of that deal is about $83bn, or $27.75 per share.</p><p>Paramount, however, argues its offer is better and has accused Warner’s leadership of a lack of transparency with shareholders.</p><p>On Thursday, the company said Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, warning that debt from a previously announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business could reduce the eventual payout to shareholders.</p><p>The battle for Warner is complicated by the fact that Netflix and Paramount are seeking different assets.</p><p>A successful deal would reshape Hollywood by handing control of franchises from Friends to Batman, along with the HBO Max streaming service, to a single buyer.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-deal-lingers\">Netflix deal lingers</h2><p>Netflix’s bid covers only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including HBO Max and its TV and film production arms. Paramount’s offer, by contrast, is for the entire company, including its news and cable operations, potentially putting CNN under the same roof as CBS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Netflix prevails, Warner’s networks would be spun off into a separate company called Discovery Global under a previously announced plan.</p><p>A sale of Warner Bros Discovery <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is expected to be lengthy</a> and face intense antitrust scrutiny. Politics are likely to play a role under Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement in the approval process.</p><p>The Ellisons have argued that their relationship with Trump gives them an easier regulatory path. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday that the company has made progress toward securing the necessary approvals.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance is up 1.9 percent, Warner Bros Discovery is down 0.4 percent. Netflix is tumbling down 2.5 percent in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So were Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, when thousands of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an apparent attempt to disrupt the certification of the election results.</p><p>Smith ultimately determined that Trump had intentionally attempted to subvert the vote. In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the country, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the free exercise of rights under the US Constitution.</p><p>A separate grand jury, this time in the state of Florida, issued a second federal indictment in June 2023, related to another probe Smith led.</p><p>That investigation focused on Trump’s decision to withhold classified documents after leaving office and defy a subpoena for their return. Trump was ultimately charged with 40 counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements, and failing to adhere to standards concerning sensitive documents under the Espionage Act.</p><p>Both federal cases were dropped after Trump was re-elected in 2024. It is Justice Department policy not to investigate or prosecute sitting presidents. Smith himself resigned shortly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.</p><p>Nevertheless, at Thursday’s hearing, Smith defended the indictments and suggested his cases would have been successful had the circumstances been different.</p><p>“I want to be clear: I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump,” Smith told the committee.</p><p>“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”</p><p>He added that the evidence compelled him to move forward with the indictments, regardless of the high-profile defendant.</p><p>“The law required that he be held to account,” Smith said. “So that is what I did. To have done otherwise on the facts of these cases would’ve been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor.”</p><p>Later on in his testimony, he emphasised his stance: “ We were ready, willing and able to go to trial in the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260495\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260495\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022580949846-1769102231.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jim Jordan and Jamie Raskin on the House Judiciary panel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and ranking member Representative Jamie Raskin speak to Jack Smith on January 22 [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"republican-criticisms\">Republican criticisms</h2><p>But Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to portray Smith as a partisan shill whose mission was to take down Biden’s political rival.</p><p>Some of the most aggressive questioning came from Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, who cast doubt on Smith’s independence as special prosecutor.</p><p>“You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. Maybe they’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they?” Issa asked.</p><p>“They were the enemies of the president. And you were their arm, weren’t you?”</p><p>Smith replied to the accusation with a single word: “No.”</p><p>Issa went on to assert that, in spreading false statements denying his 2020 election defeat, Trump was simply expressing his First Amendment right to free speech.</p><p>“ You understand the Constitution? Do you understand the Bill of Rights that someone has the absolute right to believe something, whether it’s true or not, and to advocate for something whether it’s true or not?” Issa said at one point.</p><p>“So if you know that people have a right to opine, lobby for, assert [and] do everything they can legally to ask for people to make different decisions, then why is it you saw criminal conduct on behalf of a president who believed he didn’t win?”</p><p>Smith was not able to respond to that question, but his indictment asserts that Trump went beyond simply voicing his disagreement with the results.</p><p>Rather, it argues that Trump and his allies attempted to recruit “false electors” to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for certification, and it highlights evidence that Trump pressured elected officials to reject unfavourable vote outcomes.</p><p>Another key point of criticism among Republicans was Smith’s decision to seek “limited toll records” from the telephones of nine lawmakers who communicated with Trump during his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was among the Congress members targeted.</p><p>Such toll records do not include the content of the calls in question. Rather, they identify where the call originated from, who it was received by, and how long the connection lasted.</p><p>Republicans argued that subpoenaing the telephone records amounted not only to a violation of privacy but also to an infringement of the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from legal action stemming from their legislative duties.</p><p>Conservative members of the committee also questioned the secrecy of the subpoenas, something Smith argued was necessary.</p><p>“The subpoenas that we secured, we secured with non-disclosure orders from a judge because I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation,” Smith responded.</p><p>“Specifically with regards to Donald Trump, not only did we have the obstruction of justice that we were investigating in the classified documents case, but I was aware during the course of our investigation of the targeting of witnesses.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260513\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022607184489-1769103274.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A photographer snaps a shot of Jack Smith at a committee meeting.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith takes his seat as he prepares to testify [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"smith-defends-team-s-work\">Smith defends team’s work</h2><p>While Republicans blasted Smith for what they perceived to be prosecutorial missteps, Democrats praised him as a paragon of integrity.</p><p>“I want you to lean in today. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You did everything right, sir,” Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told Smith.</p><p>He then proceeded to accuse his Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, particularly after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.</p><p>“These guys are so lucky they’re not under oath because they would have to tell you what they really think of Trump,” Swalwell said, gesturing to the Republicans on the panel. “ They call him crooked. They call him cruel. They call him a scumbag. I’ve heard you all say it.”</p><p>Swalwell invited Smith to reflect on the Capitol attack and how he felt watching Trump supporters break into the legislature while lawmakers fled. At the time, Smith was in Europe on behalf of the State Department, working on the war-crimes tribunal.</p><p>“ I was shocked by it. Being in Europe and not following things as closely, I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it,” Smith replied. “ I just had never seen anything like that happen in our country.”</p><p>Smith also denied that he faced any pressure from the Biden administration to come to any foregone conclusion.</p><p>“ I was given the independence to conduct my investigation,” he said.</p><p>Since being named special prosecutor, Smith has become a frequent target for criticism on the political right. Just this week, Trump himself called Smith a “sick son of a b****” who led a group of “ handpicked radical-left Marxist prosecutors”.</p><p>Over the past year, the Trump administration has largely removed the nonpartisan federal employees who were involved in the two federal investigations Smith led.</p><p>Smith used Thursday’s committee hearing to lash out at those employment decisions, accusing Trump of seeking retribution against government workers who served presidents of both parties.</p><p>“ I’m proud of the work my team did, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to correct false and misleading narratives about our work,” Smith told the panel.</p><p>“President Trump has sought to seek revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff simply for having worked on these cases,” he added. “To vilify and seek retribution against these people is wrong.

In the midst of the committee’s back-and-forth dialogue, the president posted on Truth Social a message applauding Republicans for their takedowns of Smith.</p><p>“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115939889414201547\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”</p><p>Trump also suggested Smith should face professional penalties or even prosecution, in a message seemingly directed at the Justice Department.</p><p>“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done,” Trump continued.</p><p>“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”</p><p>Trump has deployed a similar tactic in the past, using his social media account <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in September</a> to direct the Justice Department to indict <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james\">other critics of his actions</a>, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.</p><p>Smith was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-house-judiciary-committee-subpoenas-former-trump-prosecutor-jack-smith\">subpoenaed</a> by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in early December and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-defends-record-before-republican-lawmakers\">testified</a> later that month in a closed-door hearing, despite his protestations that the proceedings should be public.</p><p>He is currently under a gag order barring him from divulging evidence about the classified documents case, though US District Judge Aileen Cannon indicated she would allow his report to be released on February 24. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.</p><p>As part of his prepared remarks, Smith implored his audience to defend the rule of law, regardless of which party might seek to undermine it.</p><p>“After nearly 30 years of public service, including in international settings, I have seen how the rule of law can erode,” Smith said.</p><p>“My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in our country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted. The rule of law is not self-executing. It depends on our collective commitment to apply it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This time, she was recognised for her work in Song Sung Blue, another musically charged film where she plays one half of a Neil Diamond cover band.</p><p>The competition was no less fierce in the male acting categories, with notable snubs including Paul Mescal, who played William Shakespeare in the historical heartwrencher Hamnet.</p><p>The musical Wicked: For Good, the sequel to last year’s 10-time Oscar nominee, was also completely shut out this year, amid middling reviews.</p><p>But where some performances were overlooked, others were embraced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which holds the Oscars each year.

            "time": "2026-01-22T15:11:07",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_69723dec2de8-1769094636.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"262\" data-end=\"625\">On January 20, a court in Brussels, Belgium, convened a procedural hearing in the long-running case concerning the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The hearing did not revisit the full history of the killing, but was limited to determining whether the case should proceed under Belgian law.</p><p data-start=\"627\" data-end=\"1135\">At the centre of the proceedings stands Etienne Davignon, a 93-year-old former Belgian diplomat and senior state official. Federal prosecutors are seeking to prosecute Davignon on charges linked to Lumumba’s unlawful detention and degrading treatment in the months preceding his execution, allegations he denies. The case follows Belgium’s acknowledgement of moral responsibility for Lumumba’s death, and represents an incomplete, belated attempt to reckon with colonial violence through legal means.</p><p data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1568\">That such a reckoning is taking place at all, however limited, raises a more uncomfortable question. While a former colonial power is revisiting aspects of its role in Lumumba’s killing, much of postcolonial Africa is still failing to confront the political vision for which he was eliminated. Lumumba’s assassination is mourned, but his analysis is rarely taken seriously. His name is invoked, but his demands are quietly set aside.</p><p data-start=\"1570\" data-end=\"1898\">Lumumba is often remembered as an anti-colonial martyr and periodically rediscovered across Africa, but the substance of his political thought is rarely engaged. The questions he raised at the moment of independence, about sovereignty, land and the limits of political freedom in postcolonial Africa, remain largely unresolved.</p><p data-start=\"1900\" data-end=\"1931\">That neglect is not accidental.</p><p data-start=\"1933\" data-end=\"2407\">Many post-colonial African leaders have not honoured Lumumba’s legacy precisely because of the radical clarity of his critique, and what it would demand of those in power today, including governing coalitions that have learned to profit from the systems he sought to dismantle. To understand why his ideas still unsettle so many in Africa and abroad, it is necessary to return to the speech that announced his politics publicly, and to the reactions it provoked at the time.</p><p data-start=\"2409\" data-end=\"2799\">On June 30, 1960, at the Palais de la Nation in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, Lumumba addressed the official independence ceremony in the presence of Belgium’s King Baudouin. The speech has since been recognised as one of the most consequential political interventions of Africa’s decolonisation era. At the time, however, it was treated by much of the Western press as an act of provocation.</p><p data-start=\"2801\" data-end=\"3502\">Writing the next day in The New York Times, foreign correspondent Harry Gilroy described Lumumba’s address as “militant” and claimed it had “marred” an occasion meant to celebrate independence in a spirit of colonial goodwill. Gilroy contrasted Lumumba unfavourably with a conciliatory address by President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, observed that “the Soviet diplomats present seemed to be enjoying the occasion”, and framed the moment through a Cold War lens that cast Lumumba as erratic and ideologically suspect. This framing was not incidental, but part of a broader Western media reflex that treated uncompromising anti-colonial speech as a threat to order rather than an assertion of political agency.</p><p data-start=\"3504\" data-end=\"3893\">A special report by The Guardian on July 1, 1960, was equally revealing, if more detailed. The British paper described Lumumba’s speech as “pugnacious” and disruptive to royal dignity. Much attention was paid to etiquette, to the king’s discomfort, to the delay in the official programme and to the supposed embarrassment caused to Belgium on what was meant to be a ceremonial handover.</p><p data-start=\"3895\" data-end=\"4151\">According to contemporaneous reporting, Baudouin nearly abandoned the independence ceremony altogether as officials scrambled to contain the fallout. What went largely unexamined in the West was the accuracy of Lumumba’s account and how it came into being.</p><p data-start=\"4153\" data-end=\"4380\">Lumumba revised and expanded his remarks while seated inside the Palais de la Nation, after listening to Baudouin’s address, and without having been scheduled to speak at all. His address was not part of the official programme.</p><p data-start=\"4382\" data-end=\"4400\">It was a response.</p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4906\">The gulf between the king’s self-congratulatory narrative and Lumumba’s prophetic speech could not have been clearer. Baudouin praised the “genius” of King Leopold II, under whose personal rule an estimated 10 million or so Congolese died through forced labour, violence and famine in the pursuit of rubber and ivory. He spoke of Belgium’s so-called civilising mission and presented independence as benevolent stewardship, without acknowledging the racial terror, dispossession or mass death it caused.</p><p data-start=\"4908\" data-end=\"4947\">Lumumba rejected that framing outright.</p><p data-start=\"4949\" data-end=\"5421\">“We have known ironies, insults and blows,” he said, speaking of a system that reduced Africans to subjects rather than citizens. He described land seized through racially discriminatory laws, political prisoners exiled within their own country and forced labour paid at wages that could not sustain human life. Independence, he insisted, was not a gift but the outcome of struggle, and it would be meaningless without dignity, equality and control over national wealth.</p><p data-start=\"5423\" data-end=\"5891\">What unsettled Western observers was not that Lumumba was inaccurate. It was that he spoke plainly, in public, and in the presence of European power. Colonial self-vindication was acceptable. Anti-colonial truth-telling was not. Lumumba paid with his life for naming realities that others would later learn to manage, soften and profit from. The fixation on his tone, timing and supposed militancy functioned as an early delegitimisation of African political agency.</p><p data-start=\"5893\" data-end=\"5941\">History would prove Lumumba’s diagnosis correct.</p><p data-start=\"5943\" data-end=\"6054\">One of the central demands of his speech was that “the lands of our native country truly benefit its children”.</p><p data-start=\"6056\" data-end=\"6112\">More than six decades later, the contradiction persists.</p><p data-start=\"6114\" data-end=\"6668\">The DRC holds some of the world’s most strategic mineral reserves, including those essential to global energy transitions. Yet around three-quarters of the population lives in poverty, while mining revenues are dominated by foreign corporations. In the DRC, World Bank-backed reforms and liberalisation programmes, particularly from the 1980s onwards and formalised in the early 2000s, dismantled state control over mining, driving privatisation that returned cobalt and copper to foreign companies and weakened national control over strategic resources.</p><p data-start=\"6670\" data-end=\"6794\">Resource extraction has continued alongside displacement, conflict, and environmental degradation, particularly in the east.</p><p data-start=\"6796\" data-end=\"6834\">The same pattern is visible elsewhere.</p><p data-start=\"6836\" data-end=\"7216\">In Nigeria, crude oil exports have generated hundreds of billions of dollars since the 1970s, yet more than 133 million Nigerians live in multidimensional poverty. Different national contexts, similar outcomes: political independence without economic sovereignty. Communities in the Niger Delta endure chronic pollution, underdevelopment and violence, while wealth flows outward.</p><p data-start=\"7218\" data-end=\"7267\">Lumumba also spoke directly to political freedom.</p><p data-start=\"7269\" data-end=\"7461\">He pledged to “stop the persecution of free thought” and to ensure that “all citizens enjoy to the fullest extent the basic freedoms provided for by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”.</p><p data-start=\"7463\" data-end=\"7501\">This, too, was not lofty speechmaking.</p><p data-start=\"7503\" data-end=\"7520\">It was a warning.</p><p data-start=\"7522\" data-end=\"7723\">Across the continent, elementary democratic commitments have been repeatedly broken through violence, repression and deeply compromised electoral processes, including in Uganda, Tanzania and Eritrea.</p><p data-start=\"7725\" data-end=\"7951\">Militarisation has become a default mode of politics, with wars, coups and power struggles now recurrent features across the continent, from protracted conflicts in the Horn of Africa to repeated military takeovers elsewhere.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8117\">Lumumba cautioned explicitly against rule by force in Africa. “We shall institute in the country a peace resting not on guns and bayonets,” he said, “but on concord and goodwill.”</p><p data-start=\"8119\" data-end=\"8159\">That vision has been steadily abandoned.</p><p data-start=\"8161\" data-end=\"8206\">Africa is independent in form, not substance.</p><p data-start=\"8208\" data-end=\"8283\">Corruption, repression and neocolonial systems continue to hollow it out.</p><p data-start=\"8285\" data-end=\"8686\">The African Union estimates that Africa loses around $89bn annually through illicit financial flows, while CFA franc controls and debt conditionalities continue to impede socioeconomic progress. Courts can examine individual acts, but history judges systems, and the systems Lumumba warned against remain firmly in place. That is why the case unfolding in Belgium matters beyond its legal scope.</p><p data-start=\"8688\" data-end=\"8850\">The Belgian courtroom process revisits the mechanics of Lumumba’s death, but it cannot resolve the deeper historical and political injury his killing represented.</p><p data-start=\"8852\" data-end=\"9014\">Lumumba’s family, the DRC, and the continent are owed full accountability for his assassination, just as Africans deserve reparations for slavery and colonialism.</p><p data-start=\"9016\" data-end=\"9096\">However, justice for the past is inseparable from responsibility in the present.</p><p data-start=\"9098\" data-end=\"9150\">His legacy requires more than statues and memorials.</p><p data-start=\"9152\" data-end=\"9311\">Continued failure to meet the standard Lumumba articulated has produced not stability or dignity, but extraction, inequality and recurring cycles of violence.</p><p data-start=\"9313\" data-end=\"9386\">That remains the unfinished business of Patrice Lumumba’s life and death.</p><p data-start=\"9313\" data-end=\"9386\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Netanyahu faces an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) over alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territory.</p><p>But many analysts believe there’s a thought-out strategy behind what on the surface appear to have been shifting Israeli positions.</p><p>Just days before he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">accepted a seat</a> on the multi-national board, Netanyahu raised opposition to the Gaza “executive board”, saying its composition “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy”.</p><p>Members of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/who-is-part-of-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza\">US-led board</a>, including representatives of nations friendly to Israel, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, “will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success”, the White House has said, including “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization”.</p><p>But at the same time that Netanyahu prepares to sit alongside them on the board, the Israeli army is simultaneously blocking entry to the enclave by the very people tasked with rebuilding it.</p><p>According to analysts, the Israeli government’s decision to join may, therefore, be a calculated strategy to sabotage future efforts for governance of Gaza.</p><p>While all members of the board will be able vote on decisions, Trump, as chairman, will be able to veto them – and could well be drawn into “negotiations” on these decisions by Israel.</p><p>“Israel does not have a veto,” Rami Khouri, a fellow at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera, but added: “Trump has clearly shown that he will make deals … Israel will object, and then ultimately come around to making the deal, as just happened with the Board of Peace.”</p><p>“While Trump is transactional and eager to close the file to focus on Iran, Netanyahu is a ‘long-term Zionist planner’ intent on buying time,” Khouri said.</p><p>Israel has already objected to Trump’s inclusion of Turkiye and Qatar on the board, calling this a “red line”, according to Israeli media reports.</p><p>Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid reportedly told Netanyahu in the Knesset that Trump had announced the board “without your knowledge”. He accused the prime minister of weakness, saying: “The hosts of Hamas in Istanbul and Doha … have been invited to manage Gaza.”</p><p>Netanyahu responded that “there will be no Turkish or Qatari soldiers in Gaza”, acknowledging a “disagreement” with Washington regarding the advisory council.</p><h2 id=\"a-strategy-of-disruption\">A strategy of ‘disruption’</h2><p>While the diplomatic row has so far focused on members of the board, the real deadlock is operational, analysts say.</p><p>Haaretz <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2026-01-20/ty-article/.premium/0000019b-d802-dd98-a7df-fc72a3390000\">reported</a> on Tuesday that Israel is refusing to allow the Palestinian National Committee for the Administration of Gaza – a 15-person committee of politically independent Palestinian experts tasked with rebuilding and overseen by the Board of Peace – to enter the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing. These “technocrats” had been scheduled to take over civil administration of the Strip this week.</p><p>On the surface, therefore, there are differences of opinion between the US and Israel over Gaza and phase two of the ceasefire agreement, which this committee is part of. But analysts say that despite the rhetoric, there is no real rupture between the allies.</p><p>“I do not call it a clash, but a divergence,” Mohannad Mustafa, an expert on Israeli affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Netanyahu cannot say ‘no’ to Trump directly, so Israel will use tools to disrupt the work of the committee … restricting their movement and keeping the Rafah crossing closed.”</p><p>Ultimately, Israel’s goal is to decouple the second “humanitarian phase” of the ceasefire agreement from the first “withdrawal phase”.</p><p>“Israel will tell everyone: continue with your committees, but we will not withdraw,” Mustafa predicted. “They are currently expanding control over 55 to 60 percent of the Gaza Strip.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4021265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4021265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-map-Israels-withdrawal-in-Trumps-20-point-plan-yellow-line-map-1760017243.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza map Israel’s withdrawal in Trump’s 20-point plan yellow line map-1760017243\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"reconstruction-vs-security-the-high-rise-threat\">Reconstruction vs security: The ‘high-rise’ threat</h2><p>While the rebuilding of Gaza is high on the agenda for the peace plan in Gaza, the Israeli military is already raising the alarm over it.</p><p>Haaretz <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2026-01-18/ty-article/.premium/0000019b-d1b5-d54e-a3db-f7b7babc0000\">reported</a> that Israeli military officials are worried about the physical reconstruction plans, specifically the proposed “high-rise towers” in a new Gaza. They argue these buildings would overlook southern Israeli settlements and military bases, and say this is “unacceptable”.</p><p>By citing such security threats, Israel effectively freezes reconstruction before it can begin, by demanding a separate demilitarisation process that no international body is willing or able to enforce.</p><p>This demonstrates the “absurdity of the US vision clashing with Israeli reality”, Mustafa said.</p><p>“Imagine building residential clusters in an area that Israel still controls militarily. The committee might start managing the areas … but with Israeli security clearance.”</p><h2 id=\"a-pattern-of-compliance-for-compensation\">A pattern of compliance for compensation</h2><p>Khouri argues that this game of “brinkmanship” which Israel appears to be playing is a historical pattern dating back 75 years, whereby it concedes to US demands only after extracting a great deal of compensation.</p><p>“It will try to extract, in return, guarantees,” Khouri said, citing the withdrawals from Sinai in 1979 and Lebanon in 2000 as precedents. “It did what the US wanted … but it got guarantees of unprecedented levels of aid, support at the UN, and strategic defence collaborations.”</p><p>By creating a crisis over the inclusion of Turkiye and Qatar – or over the building of high-rise apartment blocks – Netanyahu is likely positioning himself to demand new security guarantees – or perhaps access to advanced weaponry – in exchange for allowing the Board of Peace to function.</p><h2 id=\"a-domestic-pressure-cooker\">A domestic pressure cooker</h2><p>Netanyahu is not just negotiating with Trump, however; he is also fighting for political survival at home.</p><p>A recent Channel 13 poll revealed that 53 percent of Israelis view the Turkish-Qatari involvement in the Board of Peace as an “Israeli failure”. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich rebuked the US plan and <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/19/smotrich-says-trumps-plan-for-gaza-is-bad-for?traffic_source=rss\">called</a> it ”a bad plan for Israel”.</p><p>According to the Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv, Smotrich also claimed countries like the UK and Egypt are hostile to Israel’s security. Smotrich has continued to demand military rule over Gaza and the “voluntary migration” of its population instead of Israel’s withdrawal.</p><p>“Netanyahu is in a political whirlwind,” Mustafa said. “He is being squeezed by the opposition, the settlers who want to return to Gaza, and the Americans.”</p><h2 id=\"the-election-clock-is-ticking\">The election clock is ticking</h2><p>The final variable is the Israeli electoral calendar, with elections likely in October 2026.</p><p>“If Israel withdraws from Gaza without Hamas being disarmed, this will be considered a failure,” Mustafa said. “Netanyahu will prefer his personal electoral interest over pleasing Trump.”</p><p>While the disarmament of Hamas is part of the ceasefire agreement with Israel, no formal agreement on when this will happen has been reached yet, despite Trump’s increasing displeasure. Last week, he said he would push for the “comprehensive” demilitarisation of Hamas, and, in a social media post, wrote: “As I have said before, they can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”</p><p>However, the bottom line, according to Khouri, is that while US public opinion is shifting further to horror at the genocide in Gaza, forcing Washington to take heed, Israel is terrified of losing “sole security control” of the Strip.</p><p>“They are afraid of the same thing happening in Gaza that happened in Lebanon,” Khouri concluded. “Because then the same thing might happen in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. So they will use all the different methods they’ve used for 100 years to stall.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
