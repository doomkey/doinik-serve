They were surprised but told me that they were specifically there to ‘fight and kill the Ukrainians’,” Chege recounted.</p><p>“When I asked some Ugandans and Kenyans that I met later, and seeing what training we were being given, we realised that we had been fooled and we were going to the war front.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331720\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chege-shows-army-boots-that-he-was-given-as-part-of-military-uniform-in-Russia-1771838128.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chege shows army boots that he was given as part of a military uniform in Russia [Dominic Kirui/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-saw-thousands-of-dead-bodies\">‘I saw thousands of dead bodies’</h2><p>In recent months, reports have surfaced from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/did-ex-south-african-president-zumas-daughter-recruit-for-russias-war\">South Africa</a>, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa about young men fraudulently recruited for work abroad, only to end up on the front lines in the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>All in all, nationals from <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/ukraines-fm-says-over-1400-africans-recruited-to-fight-for-russia-in-war\">36 African countries</a> are known to be fighting for Russia in the four-year war, Ukraine’s foreign minister said in November.</p><p>At the base he was sent to in Ukraine, Chege went through a one-month training and was sent to what he called the “yellow zone” before eventually going to the “red zone”.</p><p>“Our trainer there told us that it was going to get tough. He prepared us for the worst and told us that we should be courageous enough to see dead bodies.”</p><p>Soon after, Chege witnessed this firsthand. “I saw thousands of dead bodies that were piled into something like a wall.” That’s when he knew he had to find a way out.</p><p>“I tried to call my agent and went to the commander, asking to leave,” he said, but was told he was in it until the end.</p><p>A week into fighting, Chege thought he would not survive. He called his wife and told her that if he went offline, his family would know that he had died.</p><p>“Three of my friends from the six of us had been killed by a drone,” he lamented.</p><p>With no other options, Chege decided to feign a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I decided to discharge my firearm aimlessly into the woods, and after all 12 magazines were spent, I pretended to be mad, collecting cartridges from the ground and eating them while talking to myself, unbothered by my two friends who rushed to check on me.”</p><p>The other soldiers were ordered to take him back to base, which was “a relief”, he said, as he was afraid they would kill him then and there.</p><p>He was later taken to a military hospital for mental health treatment, where, with the help of a Russian soldier who was a patient, he got access to a phone to contact his family. He asked them to send fake car accident photos from his mother’s phone, explaining that his wife and three children had been killed and he was needed back in Kenya.</p><p>“That made the doctor give me permission to go to the commander,” he said, “and that is how I went to the Kenyan embassy and flew back home.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325308\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325308\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260219__987B8H2__v1__HighRes__KenyaRussiaUkraineConflictWar-1771521865.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Relatives of Kenyan nationals conscripted by the Russian army\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Relatives of Kenyan nationals conscripted by the Russian army in Ukraine pose with their photos during a peaceful demonstration demanding urgent government action to repatriate their kin, in Nairobi, on February 19, 2026 [Simon Maina/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fighting-shoulder-to-shoulder\">Fighting ‘shoulder to shoulder’</h2><p>Chege returned to Kenya last month at a time when more reports were surfacing of Africans trapped or killed on the front lines of the Ukraine war.</p><p>On February 10, Kenya’s Prime Cabinet Secretary (PCS) Musalia Mudavadi announced that the government had repatriated more than two dozen Kenyans from the war zone and that Moscow’s use of its citizens in combat was unacceptable.</p><p>“We have facilitated 27 Kenyans to come back home away from the front line and from what they thought were different jobs but ended up being lured into battle,” he said.</p><p>The PCS also said he would put the issue of fraudulent recruitment of Kenyan civilians into war on the agenda at a planned meeting in Russia.</p><p>“We have seen loss of lives, and I am planning to make a visit to Moscow so that we can emphasise that this is something that needs to be arrested,” he said in a statement to the media.</p><p>In its report last week, the NIS said that to facilitate Kenyans’ travel to the front lines, recruitment agencies had colluded with rogue airport staff and immigration officials of the country, as well as with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and at the Kenyan embassy in Moscow.</p><p>The Russian embassy in Kenya denied wrongdoing, calling the claims a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”.</p><p>“The embassy refutes such allegations in the strongest possible terms,” it said in a statement on <a href=\"https://x.com/russembkenya/status/2024443743966011712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a>, adding that the Russian government had “never engaged in illegal recruitment of Kenyan citizens in the Armed Forces”.</p><p>However, it added that Moscow does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from “voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces” and fighting “shoulder to shoulder” with Russian servicemen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331741\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_699c1b39-1771838265.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C481&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Relatives of Kenyans believed to be fighting for Russia in Ukraine attend a demonstration demanding accountability for all Kenyans in Russia, in downtown Nairobi, Kenya, February 19, 2026.

An analysis by Al Jazeera, based on official data, reveals that skyrocketing prices for basic commodities have made a complete iftar meal to break the daily fast a distant dream for the vast majority of the population.</p><h2 id=\"skyrocketing-costs\">Skyrocketing costs</h2><p>During periods when Israel tightened its siege or completely closed the crossings into Gaza, food prices spiked by more than 700 percent. While prices have retreated slightly since the “ceasefire” began in October, they remain significantly higher than pre-war levels.</p><p>According to Mohammed Barbakh, director general of policy and planning at the Ministry of Economy in Gaza, official data tracking prices from before the war began on October 7, 2023, to the first days of this Ramadan show staggering increases.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s analysis of the ministry’s price data reveals the following hikes:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Prices rose from 14 shekels ($4.49) to 25 shekels ($8.01) per kilogramme (2.2lb), an 80 percent increase.</li>\n<li><strong>Frozen fish:</strong> Prices jumped from 8 shekels ($2.56) to 23 shekels ($7.37) per kilo, a 190 percent increase.</li>\n<li><strong>Frozen red meat:</strong> Prices rose from 23 shekels ($7.37) to 40 shekels ($12.82) per kilo, a 75 percent difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> A tray of 30 eggs now costs 35 shekels ($11.22) compared with 13 shekels ($4.17), a 170 percent increase.</li>\n</ul><p>Vegetables, a staple of the Palestinian diet, have also seen dramatic surges. Tomatoes have doubled in price while cucumbers have jumped by 300 percent, rising from 3 shekels ($0.96) per kilo to 12 shekels ($3.85). Cheese prices have increased by up to 110 percent, directly impacting the cost of suhoor, the predawn meal before the daily fasting during Ramadan begins.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331383\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331383\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-How-much-does-food-cost-in-Gaza-2026-Ramadan-Israel-war-1771823932.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - How much does food cost in Gaza 2026 Ramadan Israel war-1771823932\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-cost-of-a-meal\">The cost of a meal</h2><p>Based on data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Al Jazeera estimated the cost of a basic iftar for a family of six. The meal includes two chickens, rice, salad, appetisers, a soft drink, cooking gas and oil.</p><p>The price of the meal has risen to about 150 shekels ($48), up from 79 shekels ($25.32) before the war, an increase of 90 percent.</p><p>For suhoor, a simple meal of cheese, hummus, falafel and bread now costs 31.5 shekels ($10.10), compared with 18.6 shekels ($5.96) previously.</p><p>The combined daily cost to feed a medium-sized family now stands at 181.5 shekels ($58.17), an 88 percent jump from pre-war figures.</p><h2 id=\"economic-obliteration\">Economic obliteration</h2><p>These price hikes coincide with a collapse in purchasing power. A United Nations report <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166444\">released</a> in late 2025 indicated that the annual per capita income in Gaza plummeted to $161 (503 shekels) in 2024, down from $1,250 (3,900 shekels) in 2022.</p><p>The labour market has essentially vanished. In a statement issued in October, Sami al-Amsi, head of the General Federation of Palestinian Trade Unions, said unemployment stood then at more than 95 percent as workshops, farmland and fishing fleets were destroyed.</p><p>“The worker is no longer looking for a job because there is no work at all,” al-Amsi said. “Today, the Palestinian worker is looking for a food parcel to survive.”</p><h2 id=\"blockade-and-monopoly\">Blockade and monopoly</h2><p>Economic researcher Ahmed Abu Qamar attributed the inflation to Israel’s restrictive entry policies and “coordination fees” imposed on trucks.</p><p>“The humanitarian protocol stipulates the entry of 600 trucks daily, yet the Israeli occupation effectively allows only between 200 and 250 trucks,” Abu Qamar told Al Jazeera, noting that the Strip actually requires 1,000 trucks daily to meet minimum demand.</p><p>He also highlighted a monopoly system under which only about 10 merchants are authorised to import goods through four Israeli companies, restricting competition and keeping prices artificially high. He called for a return to a free market system and the full opening of crossings to alleviate the burden on a population already crushed by conflict.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have a series of state and local elections that are held more or less on the same day,” Traugott explained.</p><p>The president, meanwhile, has no constitutional role in how elections are administered, beyond signing any legislation Congress passes.</p><p>Still, it is possible for a president to leverage executive branch agencies that interact with state election administration. Trump too has explicitly blurred the lines between federal and state power.</p><p>In the Oval Office on February 3, he told reporters, “A state is an agent for the federal government in elections. I don’t know why the federal government doesn’t do them anyway.”</p><p>His statements were swiftly condemned by voting rights groups.</p><p>The League of Women Voters, a voting rights group founded in 1920, called Trump’s remarks a “calculated effort to dismantle the integrity of the electoral system as we know it”.</p><p>“Time and again, the President’s claims of widespread fraud have been disproven by nonpartisan election officials, the courts, and the Department of Justice,” it added.</p><p>Despite Trump’s claims, voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the US, and any isolated instances typically have little effect on election outcomes.</p><p>Even the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind the Trump-aligned Project 2025, has documented an inconsequential rate of voter fraud in its catalogue of cases running back to 1982.</p><p>An analysis from the centre-left Brookings Institution found that fraudulent votes failed to amount to one ten-thousandth of a percentage point of the ballots cast in states where elections tend to be the closest.</p><p>For example, Arizona is a perennial battleground in presidential elections, but it has seen just 36 reported cases of voter fraud since 1982, out of more than 42 million ballots cast. That put the percentage of fraud at 0.0000845, according to the analysis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"department-of-justice-pushes-boundaries\">Department of Justice pushes boundaries</h2><p>Nevertheless, the Trump administration has heaped pressure on the Department of Justice to increase its probes into alleged voter fraud.</p><p>The attorney general has demanded that 47 states and Washington, DC, a federal district, hand over their complete voter registration lists, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy group.</p><p>Eleven states have complied or agreed to comply. The Trump administration has launched lawsuits against the 20 others that refused.</p><p>The Department of Justice has also stepped up its cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security to identify non-citizen voters.</p><p>Some critics have even accused the Justice Department of deploying coercive tactics to fulfil its demands for state voter information.</p><p>On January 24, for instance, US Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote a letter to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz suggesting three “common sense solutions” to “restore the rule of law” in the state.</p><p>One of those proposals was to allow the Justice Department to “access voter rolls”.</p><p>Bondi’s remarks came after a federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota had turned deadly, resulting in two on-camera shootings of US citizens.</p><p>While her letter did not directly offer a quid pro quo – access to the rolls in exchange for ending the crackdown – critics said the message it sent was clear. Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, for instance, called the letter tantamount to “blackmail”.</p><p>But four days later, on January 28, the Justice Department went even further, seizing voting records and ballots in a raid on an election facility in Fulton County, Georgia.</p><p>The state has been a sore point for Trump: Georgia voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in more than two decades during the 2020 race.</p><p>At the time, Trump infamously pressured Georgia’s secretary of state to “find more votes” following his loss. He has spread rumours about fraud in Georgia’s election system ever since.</p><p>Local officials condemned the January raid as a “flagrant constitutional violation”, saying in a lawsuit that an affidavit submitted by the FBI to obtain a search warrant relied on hypotheticals.</p><p>In other words, it failed to establish probable cause that any crime had occurred, Fulton County officials argued.</p><p>That affidavit also revealed the investigation was the direct result of a referral from Kurt Olsen, who was appointed to a White House role as Trump’s head of election security in October.</p><p>Before entering the White House, Olsen led unsuccessful legal challenges to the 2020 election results, in what Trump dubbed the “Stop the Steal” campaign.</p><p>Fulton County officials noted “multiple courts have sanctioned Olsen for his unsubstantiated, speculative claims about elections”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-tulsi-gabbard-s-role\">What is Tulsi Gabbard’s role?</h2><p>The apparent role of Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, in the election investigations has also raised questions.</p><p>Gabbard was present at the Fulton County raid, with Trump later telling reporters that she was “working very hard on trying to keep the election safe”.</p><p>Who authorised her presence, however, was the subject of contradictory statements from the Trump administration.</p><p>Gabbard said she had been sent on behalf of Trump, even though the president attempted to distance himself from the raid. The Justice Department later said Bondi had requested Gabbard’s presence. Gabbard finally said both Trump and Bondi had asked her to attend.</p><p>Whatever the case, Traugott, the political scientist, said that her presence at the scene was highly unusual.</p><p>“The director of national intelligence has been associated with observation and information gathering from foreign countries, not from domestic entities,” Traugott explained. “So historically, this is without precedent”.</p><p>In a statement, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was concerned that Gabbard had exceeded the powers of her office. He said the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where he is vice chairman, had <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2026/1/warner-why-is-tulsi-gabbard-in-fulton-county?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">not been briefed</a> on any “foreign intelligence nexus” related to the Fulton County raid.</p><p>Either Gabbard was flouting her responsibility to keep the committee informed, Warner said, or she is “injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy”.</p><p>Gabbard, who is expected to testify before the Senate committee in March, responded in early February that she had been acting under her “broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyse intelligence related to election security”.</p><p>She maintained her office would “not irresponsibly share incomplete intelligence assessments concerning foreign or other malign interference in US elections”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"voter-id-law\">Voter ID law</h2><p>But it’s not just executive agencies like the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence pushing Trump’s agenda for the midterm races.</p><p>Experts say Trump has been angling to use the Republican majorities in Congress to pass restrictive voter laws ahead of November’s election.</p><p>Trump has supported a bill, dubbed the SAVE Act, which would require citizens to provide more documentation – such as a passport or a birth certificate – when registering to vote, as well as photo identification when casting a ballot.</p><p>Rights groups have long argued that such requirements would disenfranchise some voters who lack access to such materials. As of 2023, the US State Department reported that only 48 percent of US citizens had a valid passport.</p><p>The bill would also require states to provide voter lists to the Department of Homeland Security to identify and remove non-citizens, raising concerns about voter privacy.</p><p>The legislation, which has been passed by the House, is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate. It is already illegal for non-citizens to vote.</p><p>Even without the legislation, though, Trump has threatened to sign an executive order requiring local election organisers to require voter identification before distributing ballots.</p><p>Trump already signed a similar <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">order</a> last March seeking to impose new rules on elections, including voter ID requirements, reviews of electronic voting machines and restrictions on how long votes can be counted.</p><p>Nearly all of the provisions have since been blocked by federal judges. The most recent ruling by US District Judge John Chun related to restrictions like tying federal election funding to “proof of citizenship” requirements.</p><p>“In granting this relief,” Chun wrote in his decision, “the Court seeks to restore the proper balance of power among the Executive Branch, the states, and Congress envisioned by the Framers.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukraine estimated an additional 31,680 Russian casualties in January 2026.</p><p>“These numbers are extraordinary. No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II,” said the CSIS in its report.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/55000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-battlefield-zelenskiy-tells-french-tv-2026-02-04/\">Zelenskyy</a> earlier this month said 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the entire war.</p><p>The CSIS estimated Ukraine had suffered up to 600,000 casualties, with as many as 140,000 deaths.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot confirm casualty estimates from either side.</p><p>Ukraine believes Russian mortality rates on the front lines are rising to levels that cannot be sustained by the current method of voluntary recruitment.</p><p>“In December, 35,000 occupiers were eliminated – and this has been confirmed with video footage,” <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/russian-war-fatalities-are-rising-to-unsustainable-levels-says-ukraine\">Zelenskyy said in</a> early January, comparing this to 30,000 deaths in November, and 26,000 in October.</p><p>The CSIS agrees that Russian casualties have been rising throughout the war.</p><p>“Why are Russian casualties and fatalities so high?” the CSIS asked. “There are several possible explanations, such as Russia’s failure to effectively conduct combined arms and joint warfare, poor tactics and training, corruption, low morale, and Ukraine’s effective defence-in-depth strategy in a war that favors the defense.”</p><p>Ukraine has additionally suffered significant civilian deaths.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/2025-deadliest-year-for-civilians-in-Ukraine-since-2022-UN-human-rights-monitors-find\">United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine</a> (HRMMU) believes 15,168 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 41,534 wounded during four years of full-scale war.</p><p>It also believes the war is becoming more dangerous for civilians, with 2025 the deadliest year so far.</p><p>The open-source project <a href=\"https://notes.citeam.org/strikes-2026-en\">Conflict Intelligence Team</a> (CIT) said that at least 2,919 Ukrainian civilians had been killed and 17,775 injured in 2025, mostly from Russian drone strikes in Ukraine but also from activities in Russian-occupied areas. The figures represented an increase from 2024.</p><p>In addition to military and civilian casualties, Ukraine has lost about a quarter of its pre-war population of 42 million.</p><p>Some five million people were living under Russian occupation, <a href=\"https://voxukraine.org/en/false-the-same-number-of-ukrainians-live-in-russia-as-in-ukraine\">estimated</a> the government in 2023.</p><p>Another 5.9 million Ukrainians have left the country, 5.4 million of them for Europe, <a href=\"https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine\">estimates</a> the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p><p>Finally, Ukraine says thousands of children were abducted from occupied territories to be raised in Russia and re-educated as Russians. The <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/fact-sheet-russias-kidnapping-and-re-education-of-ukraines-children/\">Yale School of Medicine</a> estimates there are more than 19,000 abductees. Despite persistent pleas, Ukraine says, only 1,238 have been returned.</p><h2 id=\"territory\">Territory</h2><p>At its zenith in March 2022, Russia’s invasion held 26 percent of Ukraine, <a href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-15-2026/\">according to geolocated footage</a> catalogued by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. That included Crimea, which Russia had seized in January 2014, and large parts of the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, where pro-Russian separatist forces had fought Kyiv’s forces since February 2014.</p><p>The following month, Ukraine pushed Russia back from a string of northern cities – Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv – leaving Russia in possession of 20 percent of the country.</p><p>In August and September of 2022, Ukraine’s then-ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskii masterminded a campaign to push Russia east of the Oskil River in the northern Kharkiv region, and Russia itself withdrew east of the Dnipro River in the southern region of Kherson, leaving it with 17.8 percent of the country.</p><p>In the last three years, the war has been mostly frozen: Russia has struggled to make any meaningful territorial gains. During this time, Russian troops have inched forward while they suffered staggering losses to raise the territory under occupation to 19.3 percent of Ukraine by December 2025 – approximately 116,000sq km (44,800 sq miles).</p><h2 id=\"money\">Money</h2><p>Russia’s military spending surged from just under $66bn in 2021 to $102bn in 2022, the first year of its full-scale invasion, and then up to $109bn in 2023, according to the <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex\">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> (SIPRI). Then, in 2024, defence spending surged to $149bn, said SIPRI.</p><p>Estimates vary for Russia’s defence spending in 2025. According to <a href=\"https://united24media.com/latest-news/russia-sets-new-military-spending-record-at-14225b-as-war-costs-climb-to-209m-per-hour-for-moscow-14199\">Janis Kluge</a>, a researcher with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, it went up again, to $142bn for just the first nine months of the year — which, extrapolated for the whole year, would have surpassed 2024’s $149bn spending.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://united24media.com/latest-news/russia-sets-new-military-spending-record-at-14225b-as-war-costs-climb-to-209m-per-hour-for-moscow-14199\">according to Craig Kennedy</a>, an economist at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, actual Russian defence spending was on track to fall by 15 percent overall last year because of last-quarter budget cuts following an out-of-control deficit, and because of a drop in bank lending to the defence industrial base.</p><p>“Funding for the war in 2025, including state-directed lending to arms manufacturers, is on track to contract by 15 percent this year,” he told Al Jazeera last October.</p><p>According to documents seen by Reuters news agency, Moscow is on track to cut defence spending by at least 7 percent in 2026 as well.</p><p>Ukraine’s defence spending has also shot up, from $6.9bn in 2021 to $41bn in the first year of the full-scale invasion, and $65bn for each of 2023 and 2024, according to SIPRI. Its 2025 defence budget <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-parliament-amends-2025-budget-raises-defence-spending-wartime-record-2025-10-21/\">was raised</a> last October to a record $71bn.</p><p>These increases have been funded by Ukraine’s allies, mainly the European Union and the United States, which have together contributed more than $300bn to Ukraine in military and budgetary support since 2022.</p><p>After Donald Trump was sworn in as US president in January 2025, the US withdrew 99 percent of its support, shifting the financial burden onto Europe.</p><p>Yet according to the Kiel Institute’s <a href=\"https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-after-4-years-of-war-europe-steps-up/\">Ukraine Support Tracker</a>, support to Ukraine remained stable after the US withdrawal because Europe increased its contribution by about two-thirds. Last year, Europe contributed about $70bn in military and financial aid to Ukraine, while the US contribution fell to $0.4bn.</p><p>Russia has an additional financial cost. Half of its central bank’s gold and foreign exchange reserves – <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2025/754487/EXPO_STU(2025)754487_EN.pdf\">some $300bn</a> – are held in Western financial institutions, including $230bn in Belgium. These have been immobilised, meaning that Russia cannot access the funds or earn proceeds from them. In May 2024, the EU decided to award those proceeds to Ukraine, allocating 90 percent to military needs and 10 percent for reconstruction.</p><p>The EU has immobilised an additional $33bn in Russian private wealth belonging to sanctioned individuals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Speaking at the airport, Modi said his visit was a “path-breaking journey” – it was the first time an Indian prime minister had visited Israel. Netanyahu recalled their first meeting in New York in 2014, where, he said, “we agreed to break down the remaining walls between India and Israel”.</p><p>Nine years later, as Modi prepares to fly to Israel on February 25 for his second visit, he can largely claim to have accomplished that mission, analysts say. A relationship that was once frowned upon in India, and then carried out clandestinely, is now one of New Delhi’s most public friendships. Modi has frequently described Netanyahu as a “dear friend”, despite the International Criminal Court having issued an arrest warrant in late 2024 for the Israeli premier over alleged war crimes carried out during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Indian diplomats and officials have justified the country’s pivot towards Israel as a “pragmatic approach” – Israel, with its tech and military expertise, has too much to offer to be ignored, they argue – balanced by efforts from New Delhi to strengthen ties with its Arab allies.</p><p>Yet, it has come at a cost, analysts say: to Palestine, and India’s relationship with it, and, according to some experts, to India’s moral credibility.</p><p>“The so-called realist turn of India has cost its moral power, which it used to enjoy in the Global South,” said Anwar Alam, a senior fellow with the Policy Perspectives Foundation think tank in New Delhi.</p><p>Amid an ongoing war in the Palestinian territory, Modi’s visit “amounts to legitimising the apartheid Israeli state”, Alam told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4328326\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4328326\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4328326 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-15T072243Z_712583578_RC1A37723FE0_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771696568.jpg?resize=770%2C536&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4328326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extends his hand for a handshake with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, during a photo opportunity ahead of their meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on January 15, 2018 [Adnan Abi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"an-ideological-alliance\">An ideological alliance</h2><p>India was a staunch advocate for Palestine in the post-colonial world order, with major leaders backing Palestinian independence. In 1947, India opposed the United Nations plan to partition Palestine. And four decades later, in 1988, India became one of the first non-Arab states to recognise Palestine.</p><p>The end of the Cold War – India leaned towards the Soviet Union despite officially being non-aligned – forced a change in New Delhi’s calculations. Alongside an outreach to the United States, India also established diplomatic relations with Israel in January 1992.</p><p>Since then, defence ties have anchored the relationship, which has also expanded on other fronts in recent years.</p><p>Modi’s rise to power in India in 2014 proved to be the catalyst for the biggest shift in relations. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has an ideology rooted in the vision of making India a Hindu nation, a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – an approach that mirrors, in many ways, Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland. Both Modi and Israel view “Islamic terrorism”, which critics say is also shorthand for justifications needed to pursue broader anti-Muslim policies, as major threats.</p><p>Under Modi, India has become Israel’s largest weapons buyer. And in 2024, as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.</p><p>Ahead of Modi’s upcoming visit, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding that aims to further deepen defence ties, with India exploring the joint development of anti-ballistic missile defence with Israel. In Jerusalem, Modi is scheduled to address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.</p><p>“Modi’s address is special because of how it underlines the scale of the shift in relations under the Bharatiya Janata Party towards an overtly pro-Israel policy,” Max Rodenbeck, project director at the Washington-based Crisis Group’s Israel-Palestine department, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But Modi’s visit is also personal for Netanyahu, Rodenbeck said. Israel is months away from a national election that is, in effect, a referendum on Netanyahu’s government – from the intelligence failures that enabled the October 7 attack by Palestinian groups to the war on Gaza that followed, as well as his attempts to weaken judicial independence through reforms.</p><p>The visit appears “as almost a personal favour to Netanyahu by boosting his image as an international statesman just as Israeli election campaigning is getting underway”, Rodenbeck said.</p><p>While several Western leaders have visited Israel since it began its genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, few leaders from the Global South have made the trip.</p><p>At a time when the Gaza war has shrunk the set of countries willing to be seen as Israel’s friends, especially among emerging economies, Modi’s visit is significant.</p><p>Israel does not “have many friends” globally at the moment, said Kabir Taneja, the executive director of the Middle East office at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “So India is playing that role,” he added. “[Modi’s visit] sort of shows that Israel is not fully isolated.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283295\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283295\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4283295 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2017-07-06T123333Z_1290474066_RC152665C200_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-INDIA-MODI-1770028791.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend an Innovation conference with Israeli and Indian CEOs in Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 6, 2017 [Oded Balilty/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-july-2017-visit\">The July 2017 visit</h2><p>In many ways, Modi’s visit to Israel this week will look to build on his July 2017 trip, which was a watershed moment in the bilateral ties, analysts note.</p><p>No Indian Prime Minister had previously visited Israel, but even lower-level diplomats would, until then, pair their Israel visits with parallel engagements in the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Modi broke with that policy. He did not visit Palestine in 2017, only making a trip there in 2018, by which time he had already also hosted Netanyahu in New Delhi. It had also been the first visit by an Israeli premier to India.</p><p>The 2017 Modi visit has been under scrutiny recently. An email released by the US Justice Department as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files showed that the late disgraced financier had advised a billionaire close to Modi during his trip.</p><p>After the visit on July 6, Epstein, a convicted sex offender, had emailed an unidentified individual he referred to as “Jabor Y”, saying: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago.. IT WORKED. !”</p><p>India’s Ministry of External Affairs has dismissed these claims as the “trashy ruminations” of a convicted criminal.</p><p>Nonetheless, Modi’s visit to Israel solidified the bilateral relationship. Trade between the two nations has grown from $200m in 1992 to more than $6bn in 2024.</p><p>India is still Israel’s second-largest Asian trading partner after China in goods, dominated by diamonds, petroleum, and chemicals. India and Israel signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) in September last year and have both been looking to close negotiations on a free trade deal.</p><p>At the same time, people-to-people ties have grown as well. After Israel banned Palestinians from working in the country following the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, thousands of Indians lined up to work in Israeli construction companies.</p><p>“India and Israel have a fairly deep strategic and economic relationship that has been flourishing since Prime Minister Modi came to office,” said the Observer Research Foundation’s Taneja.</p><p>Modi was also among the first world leaders to condemn the Hamas-led attack and throw India’s support behind Israel.</p><p>“It really, really feeds into India’s posture against terrorism,” Taneja said about the India-Israel ties. “Israel is a country that India sees facing similar crisis when it comes to terrorism.”</p><p>India accuses Pakistan of sponsoring armed attacks on its territory and in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has accepted that its nationals have, in some instances, been behind these attacks, but has rejected accusations that it has trained or financed the attackers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4328328\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4328328\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4328328 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-17T084710Z_1793531265_RC16D84BE4F0_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771696577.jpg?resize=770%2C572&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4328328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, tie a garland made of cotton threads to the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands next to them, at Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, on January 17, 2018 [Amit Dave/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"over-the-horizon-a-different-middle-east\">Over the horizon, a different Middle East?</h2><p>Despite its close ties with Israel, New Delhi under Modi has not completely abandoned its position on the Palestinian cause, calling for a two-state solution and peace through dialogue. But it has been increasingly hesitant to criticise Israel over its war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.</p><p>India’s historical support for the Palestinian cause is rooted in its pivotal role in the non-alignment movement, the Cold War-era neutrality posture adopted by several developing nations. Even before India gained independence, the leader of its freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, decried the “imposition of Jews over Arabs” through the creation of Israel.</p><p>India now no longer calls its approach non-alignment, instead referring to it as “strategic autonomy”.</p><p>“The Middle East is the only geography where this policy actually functions, and also provide[s] dividend[s],” Taneja told Al Jazeera. “India has good relations with Israel, Arab powers and Iran alike. One of the reasons [it works is] because India does not step into regional conflicts and confrontations.”</p><p>But under pressure from US President Donald Trump, India has stopped buying oil from Iran and taken steps to end its work on developing the strategically significant Chabahar port, which New Delhi viewed as a gateway into landlocked Central Asia and Afghanistan.</p><p>Now, Trump is threatening to attack Iran. The US has amassed warships and jets near Iran, even as Washington and Tehran continue to engage in diplomatic talks.</p><p>“I suspect India may be looking over the horizon to a Middle East where Iran has suffered heavy attack from the US and Israel, and no longer projects power in the region. In these circumstances, Israel will emerge as something of a regional hegemon,” said the Crisis Group’s Rodenbeck.</p><p>“India is perhaps positioning itself to benefit. Also, Modi sees Israel as influential in Washington, and may hope that friendliness to Israel wins points with Congress and Trump, which India badly needs.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
