Roughly an hour later, Trump and Vice President JD Vance joined the discussion.</p><p data-start=\"594\" data-end=\"728\">Chancellor Merz and President Zelenskyy then delivered joint statements, followed by a separate address from Trump at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.</p><p data-start=\"730\" data-end=\"917\">Later in the day, the “Coalition of the Willing”, a group of 31 countries committed to strengthening support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, met in a separate virtual session, issuing a statement.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-key-takeaways-from-all-these-talks\" class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">What were the key takeaways from all these talks?</h2><p>Here is a breakdown.</p><h3 class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">EU leaders:</h3><p>Following the talks with other European leaders and Trump:</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Merz said that European and Ukrainian security interests must be respected at Friday’s Alaska summit.

That is undoubtedly what they want,” Zelenskyy said.</li>\n<li>The Ukrainian leader also warned that “talks about us, without us, will not work”.</li>\n<li>“Everything concerning Ukraine must be discussed exclusively with Ukraine. We must prepare a trilateral format for talks. There must be a ceasefire,” Zelenskyy added.</li>\n<li>He also said “there must be security guarantees – truly reliable ones”.</li>\n<li>Among the agreed principles, Zelenskyy said, is that Russia must not be allowed to block Ukraine’s path to joining the European Union or NATO, and that peace talks should go hand in hand with maintaining pressure on Russia.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>The Ukrainian leader also emphasised that sanctions should be strengthened if Russia fails to agree to a ceasefire during the Alaska summit. “These are effective principles.

I would rate it a 10, very friendly,” Trump explained. The US leader then went on to discuss potential next steps ahead of Friday’s meeting.</li>\n<li>“There’s a very good chance that we’re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first. Because the first is: I’m going to find out where we are and what we’re doing,” he said.</li>\n<li>Trump also mentioned the possibility of a later meeting “between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there”, after the first meeting between him and Putin.</li>\n<li>Trump also said he plans to call Zelenskyy and other European leaders after Friday’s discussions with Putin.</li>\n<li>The US president also said there will be “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war after Friday’s meeting.</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_3886723\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886723\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_689cc06e83dc-1755103342.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees on August 13, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC [Mandel Ngan/ AFP]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886723\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees on August 13, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC [Mandel Ngan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>“Do you believe you can convince him to stop targeting civilians in Ukraine?” one journalist asked Trump. “I’ve had that conversation with him,” Trump said.</li>\n<li>“Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I’ve had this conversation,” he added.</li>\n<li>However, he reaffirmed his intention to find a solution: “I want to end the war. It’s Biden’s war, but I want to end it. I’ll be very proud to end this war, along with the five other wars I ended,” he said, without explaining which other conflicts he was referring to. He has claimed credit for ceasefires between India and Pakistan in May and Israel and Iran in June, and helped mediate truce pacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. Trump has also repeatedly made it clear that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize and believes he is deserving of one.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">The Coalition of the Willing:</h3><p>The coalition <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-of-the-co-chairs-of-the-coalition-of-the-willing-13-august-2025#:~:text=The%20Coalition%20of%20the%20Willing%20is%20ready%20to%20play%20an,its%20cooperation%20with%20third%20countries.\">issued a statement</a> outlining four key requirements they believe should form the basis of Friday’s talks.</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>They said “meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or a lasting and significant cessation of hostilities”.</li>\n<li>Second, if Russia refuses a ceasefire in Alaska, sanctions and other economic measures should be intensified to further strain its war economy.</li>\n<li>Third, “international borders must not be changed by force”.</li>\n<li>Fourth, Ukraine should receive strong security guarantees, with the Coalition of the Willing ready to help, including a reassurance force after hostilities end. “No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries,” the statement said.

Kim also noted that Europe has used its power and influence to pressure Russia over the war.</p><p>“Russia was heavily dependent on Europe, not the United States, and this lack of trade is hurting Russia,” he said. “Also, you have European banks that are holding hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian government assets.”</p><p>“Trump has realised that without the Europeans, it will be very hard to reach any solution in Ukraine.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-russia-said-so-far-about-any-peace-agreement\">What has Russia said so far about any peace agreement?</h2><p>On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Alexey Fadeev told a press conference that Moscow’s position remained unchanged since President Putin outlined it in June 2024.</p><p>At the time, Putin had said that a ceasefire would take effect immediately if the Ukrainian government withdrew from four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russia — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

Begum married at the age of 13, and for more than 25 years, she and her husband have picked through mountains of rubbish at Delhi’s <a href=\"/features/2018/9/10/ghazipur-landfill-despair-over-delhis-deadly-rubbish-dump\">Ghazipur landfill</a>, scavenging for recyclable waste they can sell to scrap dealers.</p><p>Dressed in a ragged, green and yellow kurta and sitting on a chair in a narrow lane in the middle of the slum settlement where she lives beside the dump site, Begum explains that she came into contact with <a href=\"/gallery/2020/7/26/in-pictures-india-landfill-site-a-covid-19-risk-for-scavengers\">medical waste</a> in 2022, which infected her eye.</p><p>Her eye swells up painfully when it is exposed to the sun for too long, so she has had to stop working in the summer months. Even in winter, she struggles to work as much as she used to.</p><p>“Now I can’t work as much. I used to carry 40 to 50 kilogrammes of waste a day.

Choking with rubbish and filled far beyond their capacity, these towering waste mountains have become hubs for toxic fires, methane leaks and an unbearable stench.</p><p>It’s a slow-burning public health threat that every year blights the lives of the tens of thousands of people who live in the shadow of these garbage heaps.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878432\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878432\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878432\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sofia-Begum-1754650551-rotated.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi garbage pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sofia Begum, 38, in the slum settlement she lives in beside the Ghazipur landfill site in New Delhi.

They are typically paid by those who buy the materials they forage, depending on the quality and quantity they can find and sort.</p><p>As a result, they have no stable income and their work is hazardous, particularly in the summer months.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58693-5#Sec17\">study</a> published in the scientific journal Nature, the temperature at these landfill sites varies based on the size of the dump. The temperature from dumps exceeding 50 metres in height generally lies between 60 and 70C (158F) in the summer. This “heat island effect” is caused by the decomposition of organic waste, which not only generates heat but also releases hazardous gases.</p><p>“These landfills are gas chambers in the making,” says Anant Bhan, a public health researcher who has specialised in global health, health policy and bioethics for 20 years. “Waste pickers work in extreme heat, surrounded by toxic gases. This leads to long-term health complications,” he explains.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Additionally, they are exposed to several gases, like the highly flammable methane, which causes irritation to their respiratory system. The rotting waste also leads to skin-related complications among the waste pickers.”</p><p>Ghazipur, which now towers at least 65 metres high – equivalent to a 20-storey building – has become a potent symbol of Delhi’s climate crisis.</p><p>Begum’s eye started swelling up in the intense heat last year. “I went to the doctor and he suggested surgery to treat my eye, which would cost me around Rs 30,000 ($350) but I don’t have that kind of money,” she says.</p><p>Like other waste pickers, Begum says she is reluctant to visit the government hospital, where she could receive free treatment, as it can take six months to receive a diagnosis there. “It is a waste of time to stand in queue for long hours at the cost of work days, and the diagnosis takes months to come through,” she explains. “I prefer going to the Mohalla Clinic, they check the Aadhaar Card [a form of identification] and instantly give medicines.”</p><p>The Mohalla Clinics, an initiative started by former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, offer free primary healthcare, medicines and diagnostic tests to residents located in low-income areas.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tanzila-1754650725.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi garbage pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tanzila, 32, who works as a waste picker at Ghazipur landfill site in New Delhi, fainted in the scorching sun last year and now works mostly at night [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-ticking-time-bomb\">A ticking time bomb</h2><p>On a blazing summer day in July as temperatures reach 40C (104F), Tanzila, 32, who also lives in the slum next to the landfill site, is preparing for her night shift of waste picking. “It’s just too hot now,” she says. Tanzila, a mother of three children aged eight to 16, who has done this job for 12 years, says she passed out from dehydration while working under the sun last year. “Now I only go at night. During the day, it feels like being baked alive.”</p><p>Slender and dressed in a full-sleeve red, floral kurta with a headscarf, Tanzila appears exhausted and weary. She explains that when she did work during the day, “I would go early in the morning, come back around 9am, then again go around 4pm and come back around 7pm. But for the past two years, I have been going with other women only at night during summers because it has become harder to work during the day in this weather.”</p><p>Sheikh Akbar Ali, cofounder of Basti Suraksha Manch and a former door-to-door waste picker, has been campaigning for the rights of waste pickers across 52 sites in Delhi for the past 20 years. He explains that the conditions can be more dangerous at night than during the day.</p><p>“There are many vehicles like the tractors and JCBs operating on the landfills at night, and the waste pickers who work at night wear torchlights on their head, which indicates their visibility on the landfill. However, waste and gas leaks are more visible during the day.” This is because fires and smoke can more easily be seen in the daylight.</p><p>Despite the government’s repeated <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/govt-plans-to-remove-all-three-landfill-sites-in-delhi-in-next-two-years-minister-gahlot/articleshow/98903415.cms\">assurances</a> that these garbage mountains will be cleared, little has changed on the ground. In the latest assurance made in May 2025, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Delhi’s environment minister, claimed that the “garbage mountains” would be completely cleared by 2028, contradicting his own statement from April 2025, in which he had said that they would “disappear like dinosaurs” in five years.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878451\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-entrance-of-Ghazipur-landfill-from-where-all-the-trucks-carrying-the-citys-garbage-enter-1754650885-rotated.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The entrance of Ghazipur landfill through which all the trucks carrying the city’s waste enter [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As the summer heat accelerates the decomposition of organic waste, the release of hazardous gases has worsened the air quality in Delhi, something environmentalists and public health experts have sounded the alarm over.</p><p>According to a report from AQI, an open-source air quality monitoring platform based in New Delhi, since 2020, satellites have detected 124 significant methane leaks across the city, including a particularly large one in Ghazipur in 2021, which leaked 156 tonnes of methane per hour.</p><p>Even though the same work which puts food on the table also makes them ill, waste pickers like Begum and Tanzila say they have little choice other than to continue with their work. “Garbage is gold to us. We don’t get bothered by the smell of waste. It feeds our families, and why would we leave?” asks Tanzila.</p><p>Their labour, unrecognised as a profession by the government, comes with few protections, no health insurance and no stable income. Rubbish pickers must fashion their own safety gear from whatever they can afford – such as used disposable masks which can be bought in the market for 5 to 10 rupees (6 to 11 cents) – but nothing is particularly effective at keeping workers free from hazards.</p><p>“They don’t wear gloves because the heat makes their hands sweat easily and they aren’t able to hold waste properly. Even the masks are a total waste because all the sweat gets collected in the mask, which makes it difficult for them to breathe,” adds Akbar.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878457\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878457\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shah-Alam2-1754651002.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘The garbage grows, and we keep working.’ Shah Alam, a Delhi waste picker who also drives an electric rickshaw [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"when-climate-change-and-waste-mismanagement-meet\">When climate change and waste mismanagement meet</h2><p>New Delhi’s civic bodies, which are under pressure from environmental and health activists to demonstrate some visible progress in tackling the city’s waste and <a href=\"/features/2024/11/29/death-in-the-air-how-is-life-different-in-worlds-most-polluted-city\">pollution problems</a>, have largely responded with quick fixes, most notably plans to build four incinerator plants in Okhla, Narela, Tenkhand and Ghazipur. But experts warn that such infrastructure-centric solutions only mask deeper problems and could also cause further environmental damage.</p><p>Incinerators often release various harmful pollutants such as dioxins, furans, mercury contamination and particulate matter into the air, which pose serious health risks, they say.</p><p>According to a 2010 report by the World Health Organization, dioxins are “highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer”.</p><p>Furthermore, if incineration plants replace landfill-based recycling, many fear the erasure of their livelihoods altogether.</p><p>“Delhi’s shift to incinerators has completely excluded informal waste pickers, particularly women,” says Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group. “It threatens their livelihoods and pushes them into deeper poverty. It is an environmental disaster in the making. Incinerators emit toxic fumes and undermine recycling efforts.”</p><p>“Beyond just closing landfills or building incinerators, we need to ensure that waste pickers have alternative livelihoods and are part of the formal waste management system,” says Chaturvedi.</p><p>“This is not just about clearing garbage,” she argues. “It’s about including waste pickers in the formal economy. It’s about creating decentralised, community-level waste management systems. And it’s about acknowledging that climate change and poverty are deeply interconnected.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878462\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878462\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-look-at-the-Ghazipur-landfill-from-its-entrance-1754651191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the Ghazipur landfill site from its entrance [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Activists and public health professionals advocate for the creation of a decentralised waste system, one that includes segregating waste into separate places according to type, ward-level composting (processing organic waste locally to avoid transportation), and robust recycling systems.</p><p>Formalising the role of waste pickers by offering legal recognition, fair wages, protective gear and access to welfare schemes would not only empower one of the city’s most vulnerable communities but also help build a climate-resilient waste management model, say environment activists.</p><p>Back at the Ghazipur landfill, the reality remains grim. Fires break out with increasing frequency, and the acrid air clings to nearby homes. For residents and waste pickers, the daily battle against the heat, stench and illness is a matter of survival.</p><p>“Nothing has changed. The garbage grows, and we keep working,” says Shah Alam, Tanzila’s husband, who used to work solely as a waste picker but now also drives an electric rickshaw to earn a living. “During summers, more people fall sick, and we lose workdays. But what other option do we have?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They then overlaid the results with maps of cultural sites to pinpoint which places could be inundated in the coming decades.</p><p>The findings show waves could reach Ahu Tongariki, the largest ceremonial platform on the island, as early as 2080. The site, home to the 15 towering moai, draws tens of thousands of visitors each year and is a cornerstone of the island’s tourism economy.</p><p>Beyond its economic value, the ahu is deeply woven into Rapa Nui’s cultural identity. It lies within Rapa Nui National Park, which encompasses much of the island and is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p>The roughly 900 moai statues across the island were built by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th centuries to honour important ancestors and chiefs.</p><p>The threat isn’t unprecedented. In 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded – a magnitude 9.5 off the coast of Chile – sent a tsunami surging across the Pacific. It struck Rapa Nui and swept the already-toppled moai further inland, which damaged some of their features. The monument was restored in the 1990s.</p><p>While the study focuses on Rapa Nui, its conclusions echo a wider reality: Cultural heritage sites worldwide are increasingly endangered by rising seas. A UNESCO report published last month found that about 50 World Heritage sites are highly exposed to coastal flooding.</p><p>A UNESCO spokesperson told The Associated Press news agency that climate change is the biggest threat to UNESCO’s World Heritage marine sites. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Possible defences for Ahu Tongariki range from armouring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.</p><p>Paoa hopes that the findings will bring these conversations about now, rather than after irreversible damage. “It’s best to look ahead and be proactive instead of reactive to the potential threats.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The South African government had said it was a violation of international law.”</p><p>Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American journalist who worked as a reporter for 25 years for Al Jazeera, before she was killed by Israeli forces while covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p>In December 2023, <a href=\"/news/2024/1/11/a-quick-guide-to-south-africas-icj-case-against-israel\">South Africa brought a case</a> before the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h2><p>Reporters belonging to the UK branches of the National Union of Journalists paid their respects on Wednesday to the slain Al Jazeera workers outside the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street, said Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from London.</p><p>The reporters, holding placards bearing the names of journalists killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began, read out the names of each journalist that appeared on their placard and “symbolically, recited Islamic funeral prayers” for those killed on Sunday, said Hull.</p><p>Those present “have really condemned the British government … talking about its complicity in what is going on in Gaza, for not doing more and speaking out more,” said Hull.</p><p>While British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday “talked about his grave concern” about the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists, those present on Wednesday “want outright condemnation and nothing less”, said Hull.</p><p>“They also want the government to take firm steps to pressure the Israeli government to ensure the safety of journalists in Gaza, importantly to allow international journalists into Gaza to be able to work freely there and for an independent investigation to be carried out by the International Criminal Court in order to provide justice and accountability for those involved.”</p><p>Last week, Starmer condemned Israel’s plans to take over Gaza City, saying they were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”.

In April, car companies, including <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/30/automakers-suspend-financial-guidance-amid-tariff-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stellantis, Ford and Volvo, suspended</a> financial guidance as a result of the uncertainty.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last month Volvo also said that tariffs will cost it $1.2bn in the second quarter. Ford then announced it expects a reduced annual profits to $3bn after taking an $800m hit from tariffs in the second quarter. GM announced that it expects a $5bn hit, and Toyota said it expects $9.5bn in tariff-driven blows to profits for the year.</p><p>In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. Those cars began to reach lots last month.</p><p>As a result, consumers are overwhelmingly opting for used cars that are not subject to tariffs, including foreign-made ones, as they are already on US roads.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Used car sales are up 2.3 percent from this time last year, according to Used Car Index report, an auto industry insight platform by Edmunds.</p><p>In part, this is because of the limited supply of used cars. Edmunds’s report says that buyers, and sellers looking to upgrade but need the money from sale of a current car, are hesitant about undertaking expenses amid economic uncertainty.</p><p>The bigger impact of both those trends is of inventory piling up. On average, dealerships have 82 days worth of cars on the lot, a roughly 14 percent increase between May and June.</p><h2 id=\"an-expensive-escalation\">An expensive escalation</h2><p>Cox forecasts prices could rise anywhere between 4 to 8 percent over the next six months as a result of the tariffs. The group expects new car sales of 13 million to 13.3 million this year.</p><p>“Tariffs will be inflationary on both the new and used vehicle market,” Schirmer said, adding, the main challenge right now is the unsold inventory that’s piling up.</p><p>Analysts believe that prices will continue to rise amid Trump’s tariffs, especially as companies try to move supply chains to the US, as demanded by Trump, an effort that is years in the making.</p><p>“The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the meantime, the cost to import a car is expected to increase by $1,000 this year to $5,700, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>“The US imports a little less than half of the new vehicles sold, but dependence on imports varies substantially by segment. The most dependent segments are at the two ends of the price spectrum – the most affordable vehicles and luxury vehicles. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"evs-hit-hard\">EVs hit hard</h2><p>Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall.</p><p>“Our forecast had been for approximately 10 percent of new vehicle sales this year to be EV. We slightly lowered that to 9 percent,” Schirmer added.</p><p>Volvo reported a 26 percent decline in sales for electric vehicles (12 percent overall). Ford EV sales tumbled by 31 percent. Rivian saw sales decline by 23 percent. Tesla saw a decline of 13.5 percent globally as CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement hindered the brand’s reputation. The cuts to the EV tax credit is expected to cost Tesla $1.2bn every year, JP Morgan forecast.</p><p>“Several dealers have also stated that these [EV tax credits] are the main drivers [for consumers]. So without those incentives, there would definitely be a significant hit through EV sales,” Golara added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>General Motors has been the exception to the rule. The Michigan-based auto giant doubled its <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2025/07/03/gm-tesla-ev-sales-elon-musk/84452115007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EV sales</a> in recent months.</p><p>Despite the dip in sales, Golora believes that the setback in the EV market is temporary.</p><p>“It’s [the EV market] still compelling in the long run because many manufacturers have already reached a decision that this is where the industry is going,” Golara said.</p><p>“Investment [in EV production] doesn’t look like a lost one. The payback period will be longer.”</p><h2 id=\"manufacturing-strains\">Manufacturing strains</h2><p>While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. Production tumbled by 2.6 percent for the month as demand began to slow.</p><p>US auto manufacturing employment is also down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the United Auto Workers for comment about the effect on car manufacturing jobs, but the organisation did not respond.</p><p>“Demand was not growing as fast as needed, and many manufacturers were caught by surprise. That’s a problem, and it is kind of a longer-term, structural issue,” Golara said.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

TRUMP!”</p><p>By February 12, the new Kennedy Center board had made good on its promise <a href=\"https://www.kennedy-center.org/news-room/press-release-landing-page/kennedy-center-board-elects--president-donald-j.-trump-as-board-chair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to elect</a> Trump as chair.</p><p>Since then, Trump has expanded his reach into the country’s arts and culture spheres. On Tuesday, for instance, his administration <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revealed</a> it would undertake an “internal review” of several Smithsonian museums, to “ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism”.</p><p>Trump also teased his new vision for the Kennedy Center Honors — and appeared to troll critics who expressed outrage over Republican proposals to rename the performing arts centre after the Republican leader.</p><p>“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115015798555807745\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media in the lead-up to Wednesday’s announcement.</p><p>He pledged the revamped award show would reflect “the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886633\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886633\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886633\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25225572819354-1755100991.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Presenters unveil a portrait of the rock group KISS\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Presenters unveil a portrait of the rock group KISS at the Kennedy Center on August 13 [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-crackdown-on-crime-in-the-capital\">A crackdown on crime in the capital</h2><p>The Kennedy Center Honors is expected to air on the TV channel CBS in December, and it broadcasts from its eponymous theatre.</p><p>In Wednesday’s speech, Trump tied the upcoming ceremony to his broader campaign to crack down on crime in Washington, DC.</p><p>“ In the coming months, we’ll fully renovate the dated and, really, the entire infrastructure of the building and make the Kennedy Center a crown jewel of American arts and culture once again,” he said.</p><p>“ We have the right location, and soon we will be a crime-free area.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump invoked the capital’s Home Rule Act to take control of the local police force, and he deployed members of the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, despite the fact that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low.</p><p>Trump, however, has denied the legitimacy of those statistics, a claim he made again at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday.</p><p>“ You’re gonna see a big change in Washington crime stats very soon — not the stats that they gave because they turned out to be a total fraud. The real stats,” he said.</p><p>Trump also faces legal limitations to his efforts: The capital’s police can only be federalised for a period of 30 days, barring congressional action.</p><p>When asked about that limit at Wednesday’s news conference, Trump indicated he would seek to retain control of Washington’s police for the long term.</p><p>“ If it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” Trump said, though he added that he would introduce a crime bill that would allow him to extend his control over the local police.</p><p>“ We’re going to do this very quickly, but we’re going to want extensions. I don’t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will, but I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886814\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886814\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886814\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25225570015911-1755106316.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump stands in front of a photo of Sylvester Stallone at the Kennedy Center\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886814\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Donald Trump stands in front of a portrait of Sylvester Stallone, a 2025 Kennedy Center honouree [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trump-very-involved-in-honouree-selection\">Trump ‘very involved’ in honouree selection</h2><p>The Republican leader also hinted at a potential political bent to the reimagined Kennedy Center Honors.</p><p>He has previously denounced the Kennedy Center’s programming, pledging to nix artistic productions like drag shows and book classic Broadway hits instead.</p><p>In response, over the past year, the touring production of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton cancelled its scheduled stop at the Kennedy Center, as did comedian Issa Rae and the opera Fellow Travelers.</p><p>Performers in a touring production of Les Miserables also boycotted performances at the Kennedy Center to protest Trump’s changes.</p><p>Still, Trump doubled down on the programming changes, saying his ratings success on the reality TV show The Apprentice testified to his arts-industry smarts.</p><p>“I shouldn’t make this political because they made the Academy Awards political and they went down the tubes,” Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>“They’ll say, ‘Trump made it political,’ but I think, if we make it our kind of political, we’ll go up, OK? Let’s see if I’m right about that.”</p><p>He also confirmed that he had played a large role in selecting this year’s Kennedy Center honourees.</p><p>“I would say I was about 98-percent involved. No, they all went through me,” Trump explained, adding that he turned down “plenty” of candidates, including “a couple of wokesters”.</p><p>Looking ahead, Trump said the Kennedy Center would feature heavily in his plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding in 2026.</p><p>“I’m going to be president for the Olympics. I’ll be president for the World Cup. And the 250th is going to be maybe more exciting than both,” Trump said. “It’s a great celebration of our country. We’re going to be using this building for a lot of the celebration.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Make no mistake: This selection is a clear assault on independent analysis that will have far-reaching implications for the reliability of US  economic data,” Alex Jaquez, a member of the White House National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Many former Labor Department officials say that while it is unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Antoni was nominated by Trump after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a jobs report on August 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency and the broad condemnation of experts.</p><p>“Firing officials for reporting accurate data unflattering to the regime is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. It is an attempt to mislead the American people, to avoid being held to account for their failures, and to rewrite history,” Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Antoni’s nomination comes as <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-says-economic-growth-shatters-expectations-data-says-otherwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump continues to spin fabrications</a> throughout the US economic data, including claiming gas prices are lower than they are and that egg prices have fallen 400 percent – a mathematically impossible figure.</p><h2 id=\"government-data-critic\">Government data critic</h2><p id=\"the-stock-market-moves-clearly-based-on-these-job-numbers-and-so-people-with-skin-in-the-game-think-it-s-telling-them-something-about-the-future-of-their-investments-albrecht-said-could-it-be-improved-absolutely-katharine-abraham-an-economist-at-the-university-of-maryland-who-was-bls-commissioner-under-president-bill-clinton-said-updating-the-jobs-report-s-methods-would-require-at-least-some-initial-investment\">Antoni has been a vocal critic of the government’s jobs data in frequent appearances on podcasts and cable TV. His partisan commentary is unusual for someone who may end up leading the BLS.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On August 4, a week before he was nominated, Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices.</p><p>The monthly employment reports are probably the most closely watched economic data on Wall Street, and can frequently cause swings in stock prices.</p><p>When asked at Tuesday’s White House briefing whether the jobs report would continue to be released, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration hoped it would be.</p><p>“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.</p><p>Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.”</p><p>Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritises getting the math correct.</p><p>“There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favour Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics, told The Associated Press.</p><p>Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; he called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>His argument that the US was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was.</p><p>“This is actually maybe the worst Antoni content I’ve seen yet,” Alan Cole of the centre-right Tax Foundation said on social media, referring to his recession claim.</p><p>On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation.</p><h2 id=\"flawed-data\">Flawed data</h2><p>Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni’s concerns that the government’s jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. The drop has made the jobs figures more volatile, though not necessarily less accurate over time.</p><p>“The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. “Could it be improved? Absolutely.”</p><p>Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment.</p><p>The government could use more modern data sources, she said, such as figures from payroll processing companies, and fill in gaps with surveys.</p><p>“There’s an inconsistency between saying you want higher response rates and you want to spend less money,” she said, referring to the administration’s proposals to cut BLS funding.</p><p>Still, Abraham and other former BLS commissioners do not think Antoni, if confirmed, would be able to alter the figures. He could push for changes in the monthly press release and seek to portray the numbers in a more positive light.</p><p>William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. He said he did not see the figures until two days before publication when he served as commissioner.</p><p>“The commissioner does not affect the numbers,’’ Beach said. “They don’t collect the data. They don’t massage the data. They don’t organise it.”</p><p>Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’</p><p>It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Antoni will likely face stiff opposition from Democrats, but that may not be enough to derail his appointment.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.</p></div></div></body></html>"
