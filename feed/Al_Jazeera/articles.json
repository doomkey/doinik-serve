It designates Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic and allows schools to teach it.</p><p>It also abolishes measures dating to a 1962 census in Hasakah province that stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality, granting citizenship to all affected residents, including those previously registered as stateless.</p><p>The decree declares Newroz, the spring and new year festival, a paid national holiday. It bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging and sets penalties for incitement to ethnic strife.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2></h2><p class=\"pf0\">Reacting to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria’s north and northeast said the decree was “a first step, however it does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people”.</p><p class=\"pf0\">It added that “rights are not protected by temporary decrees, but… through permanent constitutions that express the will of the people and all components” of a society.</p><h2 id=\"meanwhile-the-syrian-army-on-saturday-took-control-of-the-town-of-deir-hafer-outside-aleppo-city-a-day-after-kurdish-forces-agreed-to-withdraw-from-the-area-following-recent-clashes\" class=\"pf0\">Army takes control of Deir Hafer</h2><p id=\"meanwhile-the-syrian-army-on-saturday-took-control-of-the-town-of-deir-hafer-outside-aleppo-city-a-day-after-kurdish-forces-agreed-to-withdraw-from-the-area-following-recent-clashes\" class=\"pf0\">Meanwhile, the Syrian army on Saturday took control of the town of Deir Hafer outside Aleppo city, a day after Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw from the area following recent clashes.</p><p id=\"in-a-statement-to-state-television-the-army-said-it-had-established-full-military-control-of-deir-hafer-and-other-areas-previously-held-by-the-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-sdf-in-the-governorate-of-aleppo\" class=\"pf0\">In a statement to state television, the army said it had established “full military control” of Deir Hafer and other areas previously held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the governorate of Aleppo.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The forces entered Deir Hafer after the SDF announced it would start withdrawing from their strongholds in the city.</p><p></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"pf0\">Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting on Saturday from Zaalanah, just east of Aleppo on the way to Deir Hafer, said the Syrian forces, who were building up around Deir Hafer for days, have started entering the town.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“And what we are likely to see in the next hours and days are the clearing operations,” he said.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“In many ways, this is really a best-case scenario – a short, sharp military operation overnight and then in daylight hours securing that agreement for a withdrawal from the SDF and then now moving in to try to clear the area,” Basravi added.</p><p class=\"pf0\">SDF leader Mazloum Abdi (also known as Mazloum Kobani) announced on X on Friday that “based on calls from friendly countries and mediators … we have decided to withdraw our forces tomorrow morning at 7am (04:00 GMT)” east of Aleppo “towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates”.</p><h2 id=\"power-struggle\">Power struggle</h2><p>Syria’s government is seeking to extend its authority across the country following the removal of al-Assad.</p><p>The SDF controls swaths of Syria’s oil-rich north and northeast, much of which it captured during the country’s civil war and the fight against the ISIL (ISIS) group over the past decade – a war the SDF fought as the main regional ally of the United States.</p><p>The Syrian government and the SDF engaged in months of talks last year to integrate the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), which leads it, and its political wing, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, but there has been little progress, which eventually led to the fighting in Aleppo.</p><p>Millions of Kurds live across Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkiye, with about one to 1.5 million estimated to live in northeastern Syria, controlled by the SDF.</p><p>Ankara, a main ally of the Syrian government, considers the SDF, the YPG and the PYD to be “terrorist groups” with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkiye, which has waged a decades-long fight inside the country against the state, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Later, the social platform retaliated against her by removing her premium X subscription and verification checkmark, and continued to allow degrading fake images of her, she said.</p><p>“I have suffered and continue to suffer serious pain and mental distress as a result of xAI’s role in creating and distributing these digitally altered images of me,” St Clair said in a document attached to the lawsuit.</p><p>“I am humiliated and feel like this nightmare will never stop so long as Grok continues to generate these images of me,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-public-nuisance\">‘A public nuisance’</h2><p>On Thursday, lawyers for xAI countersued St Clair in federal court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging she violated the terms of her xAI user agreement that requires lawsuits against the company be filed in federal court in Texas.

What are the after-effects going to be? And particularly if the regime feels that its back is up against the wall, it could lash out in really horrific ways against American forces in the region, against allies.”</p><p>Since the start of the year, as a <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">wave of antigovernment demonstrations</a> sweep Iran, Trump has threatened to intervene militarily against the country if the authorities kill protesters.</p><p>“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/trump-says-any-country-doing-business-with-iran-will-face-25-percent-tariff\">Trump wrote</a> in a social media post on January 2.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, he repeated that threat several times, and he called on protesters to take over state institutions, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/14/trump-says-help-is-on-the-way-for-iran-protesters\">promising them</a> that “help is on the way”.</p><p>But the government has led a deadly crackdown, and the death toll has risen into the thousands, according to activist groups. As Iranian authorities imposed a total internet blackout on the country, Trump appeared to dial back his position.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump presented <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/irans-fm-says-protests-became-bloody-to-give-trump-intervention-excuse\">Tehran’s version</a> of the events – that armed demonstrators were targeting security forces.</p><p>“They [Iranian officials] said people were shooting at them with guns, and they were shooting back,” Trump said. “And you know, it’s one of those things, but they told me that there will be no executions, and so I hope that’s true.”</p><p>Two days later, Trump conveyed his “respect” and gratitude to Iran for cancelling what he said were 800 executions scheduled for Thursday.</p><h2 id=\"sugar-high-from-venezuela\">‘Sugar high from Venezuela’</h2><p>Some reports also suggest that the protest movement appears to be receding for now, although it is difficult to verify the situation on the ground with Iranians unable to access the internet.</p><p>But experts warn the crisis is not over, and the situation could change quickly. Demonstrations may ignite again, and Trump has not taken the military option <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-says-all-options-on-the-table-if-iran-protest-killings-continue\">off the table</a>.</p><p>Several US media outlets reported on Friday that the Pentagon is starting to surge military assets to the Middle East, including an aircraft carrier strike group.</p><p>Trump has shown willingness to deploy the brute force of the US military to advance his policy goals.</p><p>He has bragged about the killing of ISIL (ISIS) leader <a href=\"/news/2019/10/27/us-targeted-isil-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-us-officials\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> in 2019, the Soleimani assassination and the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities last year. Just this month, he ordered the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>But experts say Trump’s chances of a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/analysis-why-a-quick-and-clean-us-attack-on-iran-wont-be-easy\">swift operational victory</a> in Iran are slim.</p><p>“This is not Venezuela,” Slavin said of Iran.</p><p>“This is not one and done, and given all the other crises, many of them self-inflicted, that he is dealing with – Venezuela, this ridiculous effort to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-may-tariff-countries-that-dont-go-along-with-his-greenland-plan\">take over Greenland</a> – does he really want a massive crisis in the Middle East after having campaigned against this sort of adventure?”</p><p>Only two months ago, the Trump administration released a National Security Strategy outlining a push to shift foreign policy resources away from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">the Middle East</a>. It said that the past considerations that made the region so important to the US – namely, energy production and widespread conflict – “no longer hold”.</p><p>The document also asserted Trump’s commitment to non-interventionism.</p><p>“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories,” it read.</p><p>However, given the Iranian government’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/iran-says-3000-people-arrested-as-antigovernment-protests-subside\">brutal crackdown</a> on protests, Trump may have “cornered himself into being a humanitarian interventionist”, according to Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on diplomacy.</p><p>“He may be on a sugar high from Venezuela, but that’s not replicable in Iran in that same manner, and it would require tremendous amount of military force,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-iran-may-respond\">How Iran may respond</h2><p>After the June 2025 strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Tehran’s response was relatively restrained. Iranian forces fired a volley of missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts US troops, in an attack that caused no casualties.</p><p>But Parsi said Iranian authorities have come to the conclusion that they will no longer tolerate attacks to avoid a major confrontation with Washington.</p><p>“Even though it’s going to be very bad for them, of course, the metric of success for Trump and the metric of success for Iran may be very different,” he said.</p><p>“Trump may need to take down the entire state. The Iranians cannot win the war, but they don’t have to. They just need to make sure that they destroy Trump’s presidency before they lose a protracted war that goes on for some weeks. Oil prices shooting up, inflation going up worldwide, including in the United States, could be sufficient to destroy Trump’s presidency.”</p><p>Naysan Rafati, a senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Iranian officials were willing to tolerate both the <a href=\"/news/2020/7/7/us-killing-of-irans-qassem-soleimani-unlawful-un-expert\">Soleimani assassination</a> and the strikes on nuclear facilities because of the limited nature of the attacks.</p><p>But the regime views the antigovernment protests as an existential threat, and even a limited US attack may prompt a stronger response from Tehran.</p><p>“If the Iranians are convinced that it’s a start of a wider campaign or that its effect on the ground will be sufficiently galvanising to spark another surge in the protests, then their desperate position could lead to reckless decisions,” Rafati told Al Jazeera.</p><p>If Trump’s goal were to collapse the regime, Rafati believes that Washington would ideally rely on a “synergy” of protesters reaching a critical mass and Iranians acting as boots on the ground, supported by a US air campaign.</p><p>But he noted that Trump is more inclined to pursue quick and decisive military operations.</p><p>“And here you get into potential scenarios where the ends are a little bit muddied,” Rafati said.</p><p>“Like, what happens if you end up in a scenario of US action, Iranian retaliation and then further US response – and then broadening of the campaign?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-struggling\">Iran struggling</h2><p>Despite the risks associated with military action with Iran, Tehran’s foes, including many US officials in Trump’s orbit, see a historic opportunity to take down the Iranian system.</p><p>Since the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran has endured enormous hardships and survived wars, sanctions and internal unrest.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2020/9/22/legacy-of-iran-iraq-war-still-reverberates-40-years-later\">Iran-Iraq war</a> in the 1980s lasted eight years and killed hundreds of thousands of people. But the regime survived it, as it has withstood several waves of protests, economic crises and feuds within the ruling class.</p><p>But the Islamic Republic is currently living through the most challenging period in its 47-year history, analysts say.</p><p>The network of regional allies that Tehran fostered over decades – known as the “axis of the resistance” – has all but crumbled.</p><p>Hamas and Hezbollah have been severely weakened by Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and its devastating 2024 campaign in Lebanon. Former President Bashar al-Assad in Syria fell to armed opposition fighters hostile to Tehran who have since taken power.</p><p>Even in Venezuela, Iran lost one of its last standing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trumps-abduction-of-maduro-escalates-concerns-over-potential-war-with-iran\">allies in Maduro</a> after his detention.</p><p>Militarily, Iran’s ability to deter attacks has been severely degraded after Israel took out the country’s air defences and claimed total control of the country’s skies in June of last year.</p><p>Tehran’s nuclear programme was also severely damaged by the US strikes, and Iran is no longer enriching uranium, although it continues to emphasise its right to enrichment.</p><p>These external challenges have been compounded by a crushing economic downfall after years of sanctions. The Iranian currency, the rial, has lost more than 90 percent of its value, reaching an all-time low.</p><p>And the protests, which have been met by a harsh security response, now represent a legitimacy crisis for the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The ferociousness with which the state has responded in the last two weeks underscores their sense of deep vulnerability, both in terms of their internal political legitimacy but also their strategic position in the region and vis-a-vis the US,” said Rafati.</p><p>For war hawks in Washington, Iran’s current vulnerability is a chance to “vanquish the great bete noir of US regional policy for the past 47 years”, Rafati added.</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy-chances\">Diplomacy chances</h2><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump, has been making the case that Iran is ripe for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trump-poses-with-make-iran-great-again-hat-after-maduro-abduction\">regime change</a>, and he travelled to Israel this week to advance the push for war.</p><p>The interventionist voices around Trump, however, are balanced by geopolitical dynamics: The US’s Gulf allies, wary of instability and regional violence, have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">cautioned against</a> striking Iran.</p><p>Internally, Trump must also face American voters ahead of the critical 2026 midterm elections, including large segments of his “America First” base who are largely opposed to war after the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Parsi noted that, even though the abduction of Maduro came at a minimal cost to the US, opinion polls suggest that the American public is not pleased with the military intervention in Venezuela.</p><p>“I don’t think his base is excited about this at all,” Parsi said.</p><p>“I think the base wonders why he is still so focused on foreign policy issues instead of focusing on domestic issues that they believe are much more important for their concerns.”</p><p>So is diplomacy still possible?</p><p>On Thursday, Trump’s special envoy <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">Steve Witkoff</a> said he hopes that there is a diplomatic resolution.</p><p>He outlined a list of US demands for Iran: giving up on nuclear enrichment, handing over highly enriched uranium, cutting back its missile programme and ending support for “proxies” like Hezbollah.</p><p>“If they want to come back to the league of nations [and] we can solve those four problems diplomatically, then that would be a great resolution.

Biden, over his four-year term, announced 4,245 acts of clemency, the most of any president in modern history.</p><p>But news of Vazquez’s pardon stirred dissent among Puerto Rico’s political opposition, including Pablo Jose Hernandez Rivera, who represents the island territory in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>“Impunity protects and promotes corruption,” Hernandez <a href=\"https://x.com/RepPabloJose/status/2012245345837740522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“The pardon granted to former governor Wanda Vazquez weakens public integrity, erodes trust in the justice system, and offends those of us who believe in honest government.”</p><p>Puerto Rico, as a territory, only has non-voting representation in the US Congress, and Trump has had a tumultuous relationship with the island.</p><p>In August, Trump removed the five Democratic members of Puerto Rico’s federal control board, which governs the island’s finances. And during his 2024 re-election campaign, Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York that featured a politician who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage”.</p><p>But Trump has sought to protect political allies through his use of pardons, often accusing the US justice system of being unfairly biased against conservatives.</p><p>He has also denounced what he calls the “weaponisation” of the Justice Department under his Democratic predecessors. Trump himself faced four criminal indictments, two on the federal level, during the four years between his two terms.</p><p>Only one state-level indictment, in New York, resulted in a conviction and sentence.</p><p>Vazquez identifies as a Republican, and she is a member of the New Progressive Party, which advocates for US statehood for Puerto Rico.</p><p>She became governor of Puerto Rico after her predecessor, Ricardo Rosello, stepped down in 2019, and she served until January 2021.</p><p>Vazquez was arrested in 2022 after the US Justice Department accused her of participating in an act of corruption while in office, allegedly promising to fire a commissioner in exchange for a campaign contribution.</p><p>The bribery case focused on incidents that happened while she was in office between December 2019 and June 2020.</p><p>At the time, Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions had been investigating a bank owned by the Venezuelan financier Julio Martin Herrera Velutini for suspicious transactions.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Vazquez agreed to call for the commissioner’s resignation in exchange for a promise of financial support in the 2020 gubernatorial election. She ultimately hired an associate of Herrera Velutini to replace the commissioner.</p><p>Herrera Velutini and Mark Rossini, a consultant and former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), allegedly paid $300,000 to political consultants to boost Vazquez’s 2020 campaign. She went on to lose the primary, though.</p><p>Vazquez at first denied any wrongdoing, but she agreed to a plea deal in August.

The most recent, in 2024, culminated with the government withholding the vote tallies typically released on election night — and Maduro claiming victory in his pursuit of a third term.</p><p>The opposition coalition, led by Machado, subsequently released documents that appeared to show its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, winning by a landslide.</p><p>On stage at the Heritage Foundation, Machado reiterated her belief that she has a mandate from the Venezuelan people to lead the government.</p><p>“We are facing challenging times ahead. We are prepared to do what it takes as a legitimate government,” she said.</p><p>“Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and I have been in communication  permanently all these days, and we feel the mandate from the Venezuelan people. That’s why I’m here, and that’s what I conveyed to the president of the United States.”</p><p>But she softened her rhetoric, appearing to accept Trump’s backing of the interim Rodriguez government.</p><p>She also called the democratic transition a “very complex, delicate process” and said the current government would handle the “dirty work” of having to “dismantle” itself.</p><p>“Delcy Rodriguez, yes, she’s a communist. She’s the main ally and representation of the Russian regime, the Chinese, and Iranians,” she said, citing some of Venezuela’s allies under Maduro.</p><p>“But that’s not the Venezuelan people, and that’s not the armed forces as well. So I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition. This is a complex phase we are [in] right now. Some of the dirty work is being done by them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"addressing-migration-and-human-rights\">Addressing migration and human rights</h2><p>Machado, known for her unwavering opposition to the Maduro government, said that the Venezuela that will emerge in the aftermath of his removal will be a country built on “merit”, echoing one of Trump’s frequent talking points.</p><p>She also described a more affordable Venezuela where residents do not have to live on “handouts”.</p><p>“The result of this process will be a society based on these values, a society that is profoundly pro-American,” Machado told reporters at the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>She also addressed recent steps the Rodriguez government had taken to address concerns over Venezuela’s human rights and appease Trump.</p><p>One reporter on Friday asked Machado about Venezuela’s decision to resume accepting deportation flights from the US, where Trump has made the mass deportation of immigrants a central pillar of his second term.</p><p>A plane carrying approximately 199 Venezuelan deportees had arrived at La Guaira airport earlier in the day, marking the first such flight since Maduro’s removal. At moments of tension, Maduro was known to reject such deportation flights.</p><p>“We all know how this regime weaponised migration against several countries, not only the United States,” Machado told the reporter.</p><p>The United Nations estimates that nearly 7.9 million refugees have fled Venezuela in recent years, for reasons including oppression and economic instability.</p><p>Machado argued that restoring Venezuelan democracy would help pave the way for many Venezuelan migrants to return home, thereby helping to address Trump’s concerns about immigration.</p><p>“I think it is clearly in the best interest of the United States, and those that are concerned about migration, to have a transition take place as soon as possible. Because you will see millions coming back home,” Machado said.</p><p>“It’s not a matter of having all economic problems solved. People are willing to go back to be part of the solution,” she added.</p><p>The opposition leader was also dismissive of the Rodriguez government’s announcement that it had released nearly 400 political prisoners, though human rights groups speculate the number is much smaller.</p><p>“The fact that you are not in a prison doesn’t mean that you are free. In Venezuela, they have left the jails, but they cannot speak to the press. They cannot leave the country, and they are still terrified,” Machado said.</p><p>“All torture centres have to be closed. And certainly there have to be guarantees for journalists to speak out and those who have left the country to come back.”</p><p>She added that, if the Rodriguez government respected Venezuela’s constitution, there would no longer be political prisoners at all, and Gonzalez Urrutia would be president.</p><p>“We wouldn’t have a president-elect exiled in Madrid. He would have taken power on January 9, 2024 — sorry, 2025,” she said. “We realise that there’s no rule of law in Venezuela.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-is-going-to-be-free\">‘Venezuela is going to be free’</h2><p>Machado has faced criticism in the past for her embrace of far-right figures like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and it remains unclear what role, if any, she will have in Venezuela’s future governance.</p><p>On January 3, the day of the US military operation, Trump appeared dismissive of her prospects, telling reporters, “I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.”</p><p>But Machado remains popular among the Venezuelan opposition, both in the country and abroad, and her visit to Washington, DC, saw her thronged by supporters, who sought hugs and selfies.</p><p>On Thursday’s visit, she sought to ingratiate herself to Trump by offering him the Nobel Peace Prize she accepted in December, after fleeing Venezuela in secret for fear of arrest.</p><p>She emphasised on Friday her view that a better Venezuela could only be built with Trump’s backing.</p><p>“The only thing I want to assure the Venezuelan people is that Venezuela is going to be free, and that’s going to be achieved with the support of the people of the United States and President Donald Trump of the United States,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But on Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a trade deal in Beijing that would <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/16/canada-china-strike-trade-deals-to-slash-tariffs-on-evs-canola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allow in up to 49,000 Chinese EVs</a> at a tariff of 6.1 percent on most-favoured-nation terms. That move has prompted alarm in the US that it could help China get a broader foothold in North America even as Washington takes an increasingly hardline on Canadian vehicles and parts.</p><p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the limited number of vehicles would not impact US car companies exporting cars to Canada.</p><p>“I don’t expect that to disrupt American supply into Canada,” he said. “Those cars are going to Canada – they’re not coming here.”</p><p>The Canadian Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.</p><p>Greer, in a separate CNBC interview, called Canada’s decision “problematic” and added, “There’s a reason why we don’t sell a lot of Chinese cars in the United States. It’s because we have tariffs to protect American auto workers and Americans from those vehicles.”</p><p>As per the trade agreements announced in Beijing on Friday, Carney said he expects China to lower tariffs on its canola seed by March 1 to a combined rate of about 15 percent, down from 85 percent.</p><p>Greer questioned that agreement. “I think in the long run, they’re not going to like having made that deal,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cybersecurity-of-vehicles\">Cybersecurity of vehicles</h2><p>Greer said rules adopted in January 2025 on vehicles that are connected to the internet and navigation systems are a significant impediment to Chinese vehicles in the US market.</p><p>“I think it would be hard for them to operate here,” Greer said. “There are rules and regulations in place in America about the cybersecurity of our vehicles and the systems that go into those, so I think it might be hard for the Chinese to comply with those kind of rules.”</p><p>In contrast, President Donald Trump has said he would like Chinese automakers to come to the US to build vehicles.</p><p>However, lawmakers from both major US parties have expressed strong opposition to Chinese vehicles as major US car makers warn China poses a threat to the US car sector.</p><p>Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, a Republican, said at the event he was opposed to Chinese vehicles coming into the US — and drew applause from the other government officials.</p><p>“As long as I have air in my body, there will not be Chinese vehicles sold the United States of America — period,” Moreno said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
