The total collapse of sanitation infrastructure has left 740,000 people vulnerable to toxic flooding.”</p><p>The countries urged Israel to ensure international NGOs can operate in Gaza in a “sustained and predictable” way and called for the opening of land crossings to boost the flow of humanitarian aid.</p><p>Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the joint statement “false but unsurprising” and “part of a recurring pattern of detached criticism and one-sided demands on Israel while deliberately ignoring the essential requirement ‌of disarming Hamas”.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"needs-in-gaza-are-enormous\">‘Needs in Gaza are enormous’</h2><p>Four months ago, more than 100 aid groups accused Israel of obstructing <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/8/13/al-jazeera-reporter-witnesses-chaos-as-aid-trucks-arrive-in-north-gaza\">life-saving aid from entering Gaza</a> and called on it to end its <a href=\"/news/2025/8/14/more-than-100-groups-blast-israels-weaponisation-of-aid-as-gaza-starves#:~:text=More%20than%20100%20aid%20groups,Egypt%20as%20more%20Palestinians%20starve.\">“weaponisation of aid”</a> as it refused to allow aid trucks to enter the battered Gaza Strip.</p><p>More than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023. Hundreds have died from severe malnutrition and thousands more from preventable diseases because of a lack of medical supplies.</p><p>Israel claims it’s upholding the aid commitments laid out in the latest ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, but humanitarian groups dispute Israel’s numbers and say a lot more aid is desperately needed in the devastated enclave of more than two million Palestinians.</p><p>Israel changed its registration process for aid groups in March, which included a requirement to submit a list of staff, including Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>Some aid groups said they didn’t submit a list of Palestinian staff for fear those employees would be targeted by Israel.</p><p>“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperately-needed-lifelines\">Desperately needed lifelines</h2><p>The decision not to renew aid groups’ licences means their offices in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem will close and organisations won’t be able to send international staff or aid into Gaza.</p><p>“Despite the ceasefire, the needs in Gaza are enormous, and yet we and dozens of other organisations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential lifesaving assistance,” Low said. “Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff.”</p><p>Israel’s decision means the aid groups will have their licences revoked on Thursday and, if they are located in Israel, they will need to leave by March 1, according to the ministry.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Israel has tried to crack down on international humanitarian organisations. Throughout the war, it accused the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, of being infiltrated by Hamas and Hamas of using UNRWA’s facilities and taking its aid. The UN has denied that.</p><p>In October, the International Court of Justice issued an <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs\">advisory opinion</a> saying Israel must support UN relief efforts in Gaza, including those conducted by UNRWA.</p><p>The court found Israel’s allegations against UNRWA – including that it was complicit in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel – were unsubstantiated.</p><p>The court also said Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure the “basic needs” of the Palestinian population of Gaza are met, “including the supplies essential for survival”, such as food, water, shelter, fuel and medicine.</p><p>A number of countries halted funding for UNRWA after Israel’s accusations, jeopardising one of Gaza’s most desperately needed lifelines.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3637339\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Interactive_Gaza_foodaid_timeline-1742987531-1744365779.webp?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C963&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"[Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid his fifth visit to the United States since President Donald Trump took office in January. Before the meeting between the two, the Israeli press described the prime minister as fully engaged in an attempt to placate his domestic political partners by achieving “concessions” from Trump. What were these concessions? They were predominantly related to denying Turkiye any presence in the Gaza stabilisation force and to US approval for an Israeli strike on Iran.</p><p>Netanyahu failed on both counts. Trump specifically referred to his good relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and spoke of “Bibi’s” respect for him, too. With regard to Iran, Trump mentioned Iran’s willingness to “make a deal” and provided clear guidelines for American involvement while saying nothing about authorising a solo Israeli operation. Israeli media suggests that Trump provided Israel with a “green light” for a strike on Iran. That is not reflected in Trump’s official statement in any way.</p><p>Trump talked about the reconstruction of Gaza beginning “soon”. When he spoke of the disarmament of Hamas, he said that it must happen or nearly 60 states will make it happen. Hamas has already agreed to disarm if the process is carried out by a Palestinian-led force. Trump said nothing to suggest that he does not agree with Hamas’s logic, especially when one considers the refusal of most participating countries to carry out a violent disarmament of the group. Trump also made no mention of the last hostage body held in Gaza as a necessary condition for moving to “Stage II” of the deal.</p><p>Nothing is more significant in Trump’s world than the use of language and symbolic gestures. When Trump referred to Netanyahu as a “great wartime prime minister” as he was discussing his blueprint for “peace”, he made it clear that his guest was running out of time. This was also clearly apparent when Trump said he had spoken with Israel’s official head of state, President Isaac Herzog, about a pardon for Netanyahu and was assured such a pardon was imminent. President Herzog, by the way, categorically denied that such a conversation had taken place.</p><p>What may be the best reflection of the Trump-Netanyahu meeting at Mar-a-Lago has to do with a brief conversation over the phone between Trump and Israeli Minister of Education Yoav Kish. The purpose of the call was for Kish to inform Trump that he will be awarded the Israel Prize on Israel’s Independence Day in 2026.</p><p>The award is given out by the minister of education in a televised ceremony attended by Israel’s leaders. It marks the official end of Independence Day celebrations. Its recipients are most frequently career academics at a late stage of their careers. The prize reflects a lifetime’s devotion to the expansion of human knowledge. Sometimes, special prizes are awarded in civic categories, most often for what is called a “life’s work”, such as fostering coexistence between Jews and Palestinians, promoting social equality, etc.</p><p>The prize, as understood by its name, is nearly always awarded to Israeli citizens but can be awarded to Jews living abroad and even to non-Jews who have made a “special contribution to the Jewish people”.</p><p>In other words, the Trump-Netanyahu meeting involved Trump instructing Netanyahu with regard to upcoming measures and Netanyahu snapping to attention and signalling his acceptance by heaping yet another semi-fictitious honour on Trump’s already crowded head.</p><p>Yet, despite these clear displays of the unequal nature of their relationships, there have been persistent voices suggesting that Trump and Netanyahu are operating in cahoots. According to such analyses, the United States fully supports the Israeli attempt to “change the Middle East” – Netanyahu’s favourite phrase – as the Americans make a pivot to Asia and the global race for dominance with China.</p><p>Israel will “take care” of the “Iranian threat” as the Arabs languish in their own irresolvable internal tensions and competitions. The mobilisation of Arab states after the Israeli strike on Doha is all but ignored.</p><p>These voices also point to the fact that Israel continues to completely ignore the “ceasefire” enacted by “Stage I” of the Trump plan, and does so with the full support of the United States. In fact, Trump said that Israel has “lived up” to the ceasefire “100 percent”, and that he has no problems with Israel’s actions in Gaza. These include bombing, destruction of buildings and infrastructure, the blocking of life-saving aid amid harsh weather and many other steps that ensure and expand the ongoing Israeli genocide.</p><p>It is indeed extremely difficult to reconcile this with the notion that Israel has run out of options for delaying Stage II and an internationally-brokered solution to Palestinian statehood. After all, one hears repeatedly from Israeli media about initiatives to “settle Gaza”, “relocate” 1.5 million Palestinians to Somaliland and dismantle the Oslo Accords, one ethnically cleansed Palestinian community at a time.</p><p>The US and other countries, like Germany and the UK, continue to buy Israeli arms at a massive rate and to equip Israel with arms of their own. How is it possible to reach a conclusion that the Israeli genocide is reaching its endgame?</p><p>The short answer is that it is not. Israel continues to kill, destroy, subvert and expand its efforts to destabilise any semblance of regional order. For example, Israel recognised the statehood of Somaliland in order to have a “dumping ground” for ethnically cleansed Palestinians, but also to pit the United Arab Emirates against Saudi Arabia, as both have conflicting interests in Somalia, and, by doing so, ensure that the Palestinian question is not addressed and that everyone remains frozen by fear of Israeli weapons.</p><p>The longer answer recognises the effects of this genocide on Israel itself: Genocide consumes genocidaires.</p><p>That is not to suggest that justice is assured by cosmic forces; far from it. Justice should be pursued at the most grounded and realistic level, as should the dignity and preservation of Palestinian lives.</p><p>However, the genocide has shaped Israel in its image on a daily, immediate level. Violence is rising as quickly as the prices of the staples, democracy is backsliding, and there is no end in sight to the “forever war”. This is not an abstract, “strategic” matter.</p><p>While Israel has been actively seeking to delete Palestinian identity for nearly 80 years, it has not succeeded in doing so. Israel’s internal contradictions have surfaced with paralysing force over the past two years.</p><p>Israel will not “die” or “recede”, but the gap between Israeli perceptions of the world and global perceptions of Israel has never been wider.</p><p>Trump and his vision of America do not appreciate “losers”. Israel no longer has any “wins” in the offing. It can and does kill and burn, procrastinate and obfuscate.</p><p>Even Trump recognises that this power has no lasting effects following its own immediate application. Israel has no options. There is no greater loss.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has previously also warned of possible attacks “on land”.</p><p>Caracas has rejected US accusations of drug trafficking, condemning its actions as “<a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/is-us-president-donald-trump-preparing-to-strike-venezuela\">illegal</a>” under international law and a violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty.</p><p>The Venezuelan government claims Washington is using drugs as a pretext for regime change and to seize the country’s oil wealth.</p><p>Moreover, United Nations <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">human rights experts</a> have condemned the partial naval blockade, finding it an illegal armed aggression against Venezuela, while urging the US Congress to intervene.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-attack-lead-to-an-imminent-war-with-venezuela\">Will this attack lead to an imminent war with Venezuela?</h2><p>Caracas-based analyst Elias Ferrer, of Orinoco Research, said if the US has in fact struck Venezuelan territory, it has “certainly violated international law” unless the attack was pre-approved by the Maduro government, which could be possible in light of recent conversations between the Venezuelan president and Trump in the past month.</p><p>Depending on the answer to that question, Ferrer said the incident could either “escalate, or actually de-escalate” the situation.</p><p>“Trump needs a victory before he can de-escalate in Venezuela, and this could be it: destroying an alleged drug-related target,” he said, citing the US bombing of Iran in July as an example during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June.</p><p>Iran responded by carrying out a pre-warned strike on a US base in Qatar, following which a ceasefire was announced between Iran and Israel within the next 24 hours.</p><p>If it was not pre-approved with Caracas, however, Alan McPherson, professor of Latin American studies at Temple University, said it represents a “serious escalation” by Washington as it is the first on Venezuelan territory.</p><p>“This has all the markings of a war of choice – militarily unnecessary – against a sovereign nation,” McPherson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Politically, the [US] administration wants to overthrow President Maduro – plain and simple,” he added.</p><p>In addition, McPherson said, while the US “may also want to damage the drug business” coming from Venezuela, Trump has been clear that he mostly wants to “reverse the nationalisation of petroleum to the benefit of American corporations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-campaign-really-about-oil\">Is the US campaign really about oil?</h2><p>Recent remarks by White House officials have raised questions about whether Venezuela’s large oil reserves are in fact the real source of tension with Caracas, rather than drug smuggling.</p><p>Venezuela has the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">world’s largest proven oil reserves</a>, and the US once partnered with the country to develop its oil fields. It was a founding member of OPEC in 1960 and became a major oil exporter, especially after PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, SA) was created in 1976, and all foreign oil companies were brought under state control.</p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied roughly 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day to the United States, making it one of the US’s largest foreign oil sources. However, exports began to decline sharply after Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998, as he reshaped the country’s oil sector, nationalising assets, restructuring PDVSA, and prioritising domestic and political objectives over traditional export markets.</p><p>The situation worsened under President Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez’s successor, when the Trump administration imposed oil sanctions in 2017 and then tightened them in 2019. These measures restricted Venezuela’s ability to sell crude to the US and limited access to international financial markets, further reducing the country’s oil exports.</p><p>Today, Chevron is the only US oil company that continues to operate in Venezuela under a special licence granted by former US President Joe Biden, which allows it to operate despite oil sanctions.</p><p>Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Donald Trump, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">said earlier this month</a> that Venezuela’s oil belongs to Washington, calling the country’s nationalisation of its petroleum industry “theft” and arguing that “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela”.</p><p>While US and British firms did invest in early development of oil projects in Venezuela, international law clearly recognises Venezuela’s sovereignty over its own resources.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925817\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"can-the-us-congress-intervene-to-prevent-trump-from-going-to-war\">Can the US Congress intervene to prevent Trump from going to war?</h2><p>Power over the military is divided in the United States. Congress is granted the power to declare war by the US Constitution, but the last time the US declared war was in World War II, in 1942. That means the longest wars the US has engaged in have been undeclared by Congress.</p><p>In addition to empowering the president to direct military actions during a declared war, the Constitution grants the president the authority to order the US military to respond to attacks and imminent threats. It is from these powers that the executive branch has been able to deploy military force against countries in the absence of a congressionally declared war.</p><p>The War Powers Resolution of 1974 was intended to limit the ability of the president to deploy the military in these non-war actions, imposing time limits on deployments without congressional authorisation, and imposing other requirements. However, enforcement has been spotty and broad executive interpretations of what does and does not require authorisation, as well as what is permitted by existing Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) have left the president with a relatively free hand.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Members of Congress have tried repeatedly to prevent Trump from taking military action against Venezuela.</p><p>Earlier this month, a group of Democratic and Republican US Congress representatives forced a vote that would have blocked US military action against Venezuela without congressional approval.</p><p>But the resolution was narrowly defeated in the Republican-controlled Congress by a vote of 216-210.</p><p>Academic McPherson said Congress can certainly refuse to declare war or to give the president “any authorisation to use force”.</p><p>“It can even cut off funds for specific military purposes. But the executive would likely defy any such restrictions, and this Republican Congress is unlikely to do any of the above.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His defiant message came hours after Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort that Washington could carry out another major assault on Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said, standing alongside Netanyahu. “We’ll knock the hell out of them.”</p><p>The US president said he would support strikes on Iran’s nuclear programme “immediately” and on its missile facilities if Tehran continues developing long-range weapons.</p><p>Israeli officials have expressed concern in recent weeks that Iran is quietly rebuilding its ballistic missile stockpile, which was significantly depleted during the June conflict.</p><p>“If the Americans do not reach an agreement with the Iranians that halts their ballistic missile program, it may be necessary to confront Tehran,” an Israeli official told Ynet this week.</p><p>Pezeshkian recently described the standoff as a “full-scale war” with the US, Israel and Europe that is “more complicated and more difficult” than Iran’s bloody conflict with Iraq in the 1980s, which left more than one million dead.</p><p>The June war saw Israel launch nearly 360 strikes across 27 Iranian provinces over 12 days, according to conflict monitoring group ACLED, targeting military installations, nuclear facilities and government buildings.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The assault destroyed an estimated 1,000 Iranian ballistic missiles and killed more than 30 senior military commanders and at least 11 nuclear scientists.</p><p>Iran fired more than 500 missiles at Israel during the conflict, with approximately 36 landing in populated areas. While Trump claimed Iranian nuclear capabilities were “completely obliterated” by the strikes, experts disputed that, saying Tehran may have hidden stockpiles of enriched uranium and could resume production within months.</p><p>Despite the losses, Iranian officials insist the country is now better prepared for confrontation. In a recent interview, Pezeshkian said Iran’s military forces are “stronger in terms of equipment and manpower” than before the ceasefire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The war failed to trigger the internal unrest it is suspected that Netanyahu had hoped for. No significant protests materialised, and daily life in Tehran largely continued despite the bombardment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The property is 360km (225 miles) north of Moscow.</p><p>Lavrov told reporters that Ukraine had launched 91 drones towards the residence. He added that air defence systems shot down the drones and no one was injured.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defence said 49 of the drones were shot down over the Bryansk region, one was shot down over the Smolensk region and 41 were shot down over the Novgorod region while en route.</p><p>“Such reckless actions will not go unanswered,” Lavrov said. “The targets for retaliatory strikes and the timing of their implementation by the Russian armed forces have been determined.”</p><p>Russian officials accused Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of carrying out the strike to derail the prospects of a peace agreement.</p><p>In an apparent reference to Zelenskyy, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on X: “The stinking Kiev b**tard is trying to derail the settlement of the conflict. He wants war. Well, now at least he’ll have to stay in hiding for the rest of his worthless life.”</p><p>Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the strike took place on Sunday “practically immediately after” talks were held in Florida between Trump and Zelenskyy on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>After that meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy had <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/trump-welcomes-zelenskyy-claims-russia-ukraine-truce-in-final-stages\">voiced optimism</a>, saying a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine was “close”.</p><p>Putin has not publicly commented on the attack yet. It is unclear where Putin was at the time of the attack, but he was holding meetings in the Kremlin on Saturday and Monday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-ukraine-responded\">How has Ukraine responded?</h2><p>Zelenskyy has strongly denied Russia’s allegation that Ukraine attacked one of Putin’s residences.</p><p>“Russia is at it again, using dangerous statements to undermine all achievements of our shared diplomatic efforts with President Trump’s team,” Zelenskyy wrote in an X post on Monday.</p><p>“This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war.”</p><p></p><p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned Moscow’s claims, saying they were designed to undermine the negotiations.</p><p>In a post on X, Sybiha said the claim was intended “to create a pretext and false justification for Russia’s further attacks against Ukraine, as well as to undermine and impede the peace process”.</p><p>In another post on Tuesday, Sybiha wrote: “Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged ‘attack on Putin’s residence.’ And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened.”</p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-reacted\">How has Trump reacted?</h2><p>Trump appeared to accept the Russian version of events on Monday when he told reporters: “It’s one thing to be offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”</p><p>But when reporters asked Trump if US intelligence agencies had evidence of the alleged attack, Trump said: “We’ll find out.”</p><p>Congressman Don Bacon, a member of Trump’s Republican Party, criticised the president for accepting the Russian account of events without assessing the facts.</p><p>“President Trump and his team should get the facts first before assuming blame. Putin is a well known boldface liar,” Bacon wrote in an X post.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-other-world-leaders-reacted\">How have other world leaders reacted?</h2><p>Like Trump, other leaders appeared to accept the Russian allegations.</p><p>In a statement released on Monday, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote: “The United Arab Emirates has strongly condemned the attempt to target the residence of His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, and denounced this deplorable attack and the threat it poses to security and stability.”</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in an X post on Tuesday: “Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.”</p><p>Modi added that the ongoing diplomatic engagement being led by the US is the “most viable path” towards achieving peace. “We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them.”</p><p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the alleged attack.</p><p>“Pakistan condemns the reported targeting of the residence of His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation. Such a heinous act constitutes a grave threat to peace, security, and stability, particularly at a time when efforts aimed at peace are underway,” Sharif wrote on X.</p><p>“Pakistan expresses its solidarity with the President of the Russian Federation, and with the government and people of Russia.”</p><h2 id=\"have-putin-s-residences-previously-been-attacked\">Have Putin’s residences previously been attacked?</h2><p>Russia has made previous claims of Ukrainian attacks on Putin’s residences, including on the Kremlin, Putin’s official residence and main workplace.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2023/5/3/what-we-know-alleged-drone-attack-kremlin\">May 2023</a>, Moscow alleged that Ukraine had deployed two drones to attack Putin’s residence in the Kremlin citadel but said its forces had disabled the drones. Kyiv denied any involvement.</p><p>On December 25, 2024, Russia alleged that it had intercepted and destroyed a Ukrainian drone also targeting the Kremlin. Kyiv again denied responsibility.</p><p>Conversely, Ukraine has alleged that Russia has attacked Kyiv and other government buildings in Ukraine.</p><p>In September, the Ukrainian military said a Russian drone attack damaged a government building in Kyiv that is home to Ukraine’s cabinet. Plumes of smoke were seen emerging from the building. Russia said it had targeted Ukrainian military infrastructure only.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-russia-now-threatened-to-do\">What has Russia now threatened to do?</h2><p>While Russia has not outright threatened to end the peace talks, Moscow said it would realign its position in the talks.</p><p>“The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned that Moscow’s response “would not be diplomatic”. Indeed, it has warned that it plans to hit back militarily but has given no details of how or when it might do this.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-derail-the-us-led-peace-talks\">Will this derail the US-led peace talks?</h2><p>Speaking to reporters after his <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/trump-welcomes-zelenskyy-claims-russia-ukraine-truce-in-final-stages\">“terrific” meeting</a> with Zelenskyy on Sunday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump told reporters that Moscow and Kyiv were “closer than ever” to a peace deal.</p><p>But Trump has made this claim several times before. In April, Trump said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” after Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow.</p><p>On December 15, Trump also said Russia and Ukraine were <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-says-deal-to-end-ukraine-war-closer-than-ever-after-berlin-talks\">“closer than ever”</a> to a deal after talks in Berlin involving Zelenskyy and the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and NATO.</p><p>However, observers and analysts said the issue of territorial concessions remains a major sticking point. Trump’s<a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\"> 28-point peace plan</a> for Ukraine, which he unveiled in November, involved Ukraine ceding large amounts of land that Russia has occupied during nearly four years of war. Zelenskyy has stated on numerous occasions that this is a line Ukraine will not cross.</p><p>Most analysts are sceptical that any progress has been made on this point and said the latest accusations against Ukraine will probably have little effect. “I don’t think there is anything to derail at this point,” said Marina Miron, an analyst at King’s College London.</p><p>The peace process “is not going well due to disagreements on key issues between Ukraine and Russia”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Miron also pointed out that Russia said the attack took place between the nights of December 28 and December 29.</p><p>“The interesting thing about it is Ukraine is accusing Russia of mounting a false flag operation to undermine the peace process.”</p><p>“Why would it be, then, after Zelenskyy met Trump? It would have to be before, so from the night of December 27 to December 28, right before Zelenskyy met Trump,” she said.</p><p>Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at the London think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera this month: “Trump has repeatedly claimed that a peace deal is close without sustainable agreement.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Russia has occupied nearly 20 percent of eastern Ukraine and has been slowly gaining territory as Ukraine’s military has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/28/ukraine-is-running-out-of-men-money-and-time\">weakened by</a> desertions, casualties and dwindling military aid.

This is an improvement on past proposals, where the same amount would be repaid over more than a decade.</p><p>However, observers noted that plans proposed in 2020, under the government of former Prime Minister Hassan Diab, had depositors receiving up to $500,000 back.</p><p>“This was probably the biggest lost opportunity, and it was done to protect the banks,” Fouad Debs, a lawyer and member of the Depositors Union, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is also supposed to be a full financial audit, according to Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.</p><p>“A forensic audit … means [the banks] will open all their operations – their dividends and the bonuses they paid executives – basically all the financial engineering they’ve done,” Debs said.</p><p>He added that an audit is important because “there are a lot of discrepancies between what they say and what the state is saying.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-bad-about-it\">What’s bad about it?</h2><p>Plenty.</p><p>First off, the $100,000 figure is per depositor and not per account. So if someone had two accounts with a figure more than $100,000, they would still only get $100,000 back.</p><p>For depositors who have more than $100,000 in their account or accounts, they will be given $100,000 in cash, and the rest will be paid in bonds backed by the Central Bank, according to PM Salam.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-the-draft-law-good-for-who-does-it-penalise\">Who is the draft law good for? Who does it penalise?</h2><p>The bankers, the banks, and politicians aligned with them get off fairly easily under the current draft law, while the state will bear most of the burden for the financial collapse.</p><p>Under the current version of the draft law, banks are responsible for paying only 40 percent of withdrawals, despite their major roles in engineering the financial crisis.</p><p>But banks, bankers, and affiliated politicians are still waging media campaigns and lobbying parliament to attack the law and make it even more favourable for them.</p><p>Under the new draft law, banks are being asked to pay much more than they are currently paying – but still significantly less than critics say they should be paying.</p><p>There is a lack of clarity over the claims.</p><p>During the crisis, banks were still able to pay out dividends to shareholders and pay executives bonuses, while regular depositors were blocked from accessing their money for daily expenses like buying food or paying bills.</p><p>“Depositors should be last on the list to have to pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-would-the-state-have-to-pay\">How much would the state have to pay?</h2><p>The state would have to make up the “gap” between what is owed by Lebanese banks to depositors and what the Lebanese financial system can pay out.</p><p>Estimates currently say there is a gap of $70bn.</p><h2 id=\"who-do-the-bankers-say-should-pay-all-this\">Who do the bankers say should pay all this?</h2><p>They say the state should pay. Many bankers and banks say that they entrusted their money to the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) and that BDL gave the money to the state, which lost it. Therefore, the state should pay.</p><p>But critics argue that many of the banks gave depositors’ money to BDL without asking the depositors.</p><p>“They put it there because banks made so much money and benefitted from it a lot,” Debs said. “They put all their eggs in the same basket … and the banks knew this very well.”</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-state-pay\">How would the state pay?</h2><p>With public funds, essentially. After the cash is given to depositors, everything else will be paid back in bonds backed by the state and its assets, including Lebanon’s gold reserves.</p><p>Critics say this is problematic because many of Lebanon’s current bonds were sold to vulture funds abroad. So state assets could essentially be used to pay back vulture funds or to pay back big depositors at the expense of the entire Lebanese population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-imf-saying\">What is the IMF saying?</h2><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is usually calling for austerity, but for once, civil society and the IMF are on the same page.</p><p>“The IMF is saying… ‘how can you make depositors pay before bankers?’” Debs said, adding that the IMF’s position shows “how greedy and vicious the ruling elites are here”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
