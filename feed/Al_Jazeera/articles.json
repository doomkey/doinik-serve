But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/what-is-the-international-stabilisation-force-for-gaza\">mandate of the ISF</a>.</p><p>“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.</p><p>But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/trump-and-netanyahu-discussed-proposal-for-ending-war-in-gaza\">20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September</a> – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.</p><p>The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.</p><p>“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”</p><h2 id=\"pakistan-s-rising-geopolitical-value\">Pakistan’s rising geopolitical value</h2><p>In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.</p><p>Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.</p><p>Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.</p><p>In September, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">Pakistan signed</a> a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/world-leaders-gather-in-egypt-for-signing-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal\">Gaza ceasefire agreement</a>. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.</p><p>By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/how-conflict-with-india-helped-boost-the-pakistan-militarys-domestic-image\">shot down Indian jets</a>, Munir <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\">met Trump</a> in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.</p><p>In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">rare earth minerals</a>.</p><p>Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”</p><p>That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.</p><p>Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.</p><p>That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116464\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116464\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116464\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/G1GofwcWkAAs8tr-1763516248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C553&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan SMDA KSA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4116464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a defence agreement on September 17, in Riyadh [Handout/Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"government-keeps-cards-close-to-chest\">Government keeps cards close to chest</h2><p>Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.</p><p>Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.</p><p>“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.</p><p>In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.</p><p>“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.</p><h2 id=\"legal-operational-ambiguities\">Legal, operational ambiguities</h2><p>Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.</p><p>Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.</p><p>“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.</p><p>Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.</p><p>Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.</p><p>The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.</p><p>Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.</p><p>So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.</p><p>US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.</p><p>King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116472\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116472\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/epa_691d1ff539e5-1763516405.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12533972 The ruins of destroyed buildings in northern Gaza City, Gaza Strip, 18 November 2025, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.</p><p>Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.</p><p>Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.</p><p>“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.</p><h2 id=\"domestic-political-risks-and-the-israeli-factor\">Domestic political risks and the Israeli factor</h2><p>Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.</p><p>Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.</p><p>Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.</p><p>Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.</p><p>“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.</p><p>Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.</p><p>“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.</p><p>But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.</p><p>Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.</p><p>“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Since 2023, the African Union has been a member, too. Combined, they represent 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the world’s population, according to the G20.</p><p>G20 country representatives meet throughout the year to discuss pressing issues. But in November, the leaders meet for the annual summit.</p><p>The leaders’ summit marks the culmination of the host country’s yearlong stewardship and usually ends with a non-binding leaders’ declaration. In Brazil last November, leaders issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by a 2030 deadline.</p><p>South Africa has held the presidency since November 2024 and will hand over to the US on November 30, 2025.

However, on November 8, Trump doubled down on claims of “human rights abuses” by South Africa in a post on his social platform Truth Social, and said <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/trump-says-us-to-boycott-south-africa-g20-summit-over-white-genocide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no US official </a>would be attending the forum.</p><p>“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote, while recounting his claims again. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue. I look forward to hosting the 2026 G20 in Miami, Florida!” he added.</p><p>South African officials have attempted to downplay the US’s absence. Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists in Cape Town after Trump’s announcement, said the action would likely not have an impact.</p><p>“It is unfortunate that the United States has decided not to attend the G20,” he said. “All I can say in my experience in politics is that boycotts never really work. They have a very contradictory effect.”</p><p>In another comment to the media, Ramaphosa told reporters the US boycott was “their loss”. The South African leader, this week, however, said he would hand over the presidency to an empty seat meant for the US representative in a symbolic gesture, and stressed the need to repair ties with Washington.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3725273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3725273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3725273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-21T175538Z_211099346_RC2GMEAOPQ99_RTRMADP_3_USA-SAFRICA-1747856541.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa looks towards a monitor (not pictured) that shows videos allegedly pertaining to the genocide of white people in South Africa, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 21, 2025.

The ministry did not state why, but South Africa and China have a thriving trade relationship. President Xi was in the country for the 2023 BRICS summit, another informal grouping of developing powers.</li>\n<li>The Kremlin announced in October that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin would not attend the meeting and would instead send his deputy head of the presidential administration, Maxim Oreshkin. Putin is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, and as a signatory, South Africa is legally obliged to arrest him if he sets foot in the country.</li>\n<li>Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu cancelled his trip after 25 girls were kidnapped this week from their school amid a security crisis in the country.</li>\n<li>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum will not attend due to scheduled appointments in the country, the government announced this week. Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente usually represents her abroad.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-agenda\">What’s on the agenda?</h2><p>South Africa, as host, will emphasise issues which affect Global South countries and is hoping to persuade leaders to collectively pledge their commitment to addressing topics from economic inequalities to improving development financing for vulnerable countries.</p><p>South Africa will also lobby countries to commit to scaling up their spending on climate-disaster resilience and disaster responses globally; increase the amount of climate finance flowing from richer to poorer nations; provide better debt restructuring and relief for poorer nations via international financial institutions and bilateral lending; and prioritise local communities and source countries amid a race among global powers for access to critical minerals, some of which are concentrated in African countries.</p><p>South Africa has not hosted an international event on this scale since the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Despite the snub from the US, this is an important moment for the country, and for Africa, Gilad Isaacs, executive director of South African think tank, the Institute for Economic Justice, told Al Jazeera, saying Pretoria has put “real issues” affecting African countries on the agenda this time.</p><p>“The US boycott will not derail the work,” Isaacs said. “The credibility of the presidency will be measured not by the presence of any one country, but by whether the agenda set in the interests of the Global South is carried through and used in other forums.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-21T074732Z_1002669083_RC2U0IAB4B0J_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1763716594.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"g20\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banners featuring world leaders are displayed inside the secured area of the G20 summit venue ahead of the meeting scheduled for November 22–23, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 21, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-protests-are-planned\">What protests are planned?</h2><p>Several protests are planned around the event, and started on Friday. Deputy national commissioner for policing, Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili, told reporters on Tuesday that authorities are expecting protests in Johannesburg and other major South African cities.</p><p>“We will allow that right [to protest] to be exercised,” she said. “But within the proper directives and proper confines of the law.”</p><h3 id=\"femicide-protests\">Femicide protests</h3><p>One of the largest demonstrations was planned by the Women for Change advocacy group, which called for a national shutdown on Friday, the eve of the summit, to protest against South Africa’s soaring rates of violence against women and femicide. Three women are killed by intimate partners every day, according to government figures.</p><p>The organisation had led a significant social media campaign in the days leading up to the event to create awareness. On Friday, it asked South African women to boycott work and school and to wear all black to signify mourning. Women were also urged to lie down for 15 minutes at 12pm local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the women murdered.</p><p>“Because, until South Africa stops burying a woman every 2.5 hours, the G20 cannot speak of growth and progress,” Women for Change said in a campaign statement.</p><p>In an impassioned statement during a sideline G20 event on Thursday evening, President Ramaphosa attempted to show solidarity with women, declaring gender-based violence and femicide both a national and global crisis. Women’s rights groups, however, say they are pushing for femicide to be declared a national disaster.</p><h3>Climate change protests</h3><p>On Thursday, a coalition of climate change and wealth inequality activists called The Citizen began an alternative summit in Johannesburg, decrying the G20 gathering as “for the rich”.</p><h3>White minority protests</h3><p>Separately, Solidarity, a trade union representing members of South Africa’s Afrikaner white minority, is also set to protest against the alleged marginalisation of white South Africans. The organisation has put up controversial billboards around Johannesburg that say: “Welcome to the most RACE-REGULATED country in the world.”</p><h3>Unemployment protests</h3><p>Meanwhile, Operation Dudula, a South African anti-immigration group, protested on Friday against joblessness and poverty in the country. South Africa’s 31 percent unemployment rate is one of the highest in the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Congress.</p><p>“Loyalty should be a two-way street”, while Congress “has mostly been sidelined” under the Trump administration, Greene posted in a lengthy resignation statement on social media late on Friday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

“always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I’ve been despised in Washington, DC, and never fit in”.</p><p>“I will be resigning from office with my last day being January 5, 2026,” she said.</p><p>Greene said she did not want her supporters and family to endure “a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/trump-withdraws-support-for-former-maga-champion-marjorie-taylor-greene\">hurtful and hateful</a> primary against me by the President we all fought for”.</p><p>President Trump responded to the news, saying: “I think it’s great news for the country”.</p><p>“It’s great,” ABC News quoted Trump as saying in an interview.</p><p></p><p>Previously an icon of Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Greene had a very public falling out with Trump, with the president announcing earlier this month that he was withdrawing all support for the congresswoman he described as “‘Wacky’ Marjorie”.</p><p>Greene has cited as a cause for her rift with Trump her outspoken advocacy for releasing the government’s files on <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/11/21/aje-onl-usa_epstein_av_v3-201125\">convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p><p>Trump had dismissed the Epstein issue as a “Democrat hoax” and has struggled with uproar in his MAGA base over his <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">U-turn on a pre-election promise</a> to release government files on the case.</p><p>But under mounting pressure from within his own party and Democrats, Trump signed a bill this week to release the Epstein files after a motion to release them passed in the House and Senate with overwhelming support.</p><p>In her resignation statement, Greene referenced the Epstein controversy.</p><p>“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Greene also this year became the first Republican lawmaker to call US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide.</p><p>Trump followed up his withdrawal of support for Greene earlier this month with multiple posts on his Truth Social platform attacking the lawmaker as a “lightweight” and even a “traitor” to the Republican Party.</p><p>Greene subsequently said she was being targeted by a wave of threats.</p><p>The move by Greene to resign from Congress before the 2026 midterms is the clearest sign yet of a growing split in the MAGA world amid strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, and Trump’s warm White House meeting earlier on Friday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trump-and-mamdani-hope-for-positive-relationship-after-productive-meeting\">New York’s

lay out a roadmap to phasing out fossil fuels, Yanakiew noted.</p><p>“So this is a big divisive point,” she said, adding that another major issue at the climate conference has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/20/to-close-the-climate-finance-gap-let-vulnerable-nations-use-carbon-markets\">financing the transition</a> away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Developing countries – many of which are more susceptible to the effects of climate change, including more extreme weather events – have said they want richer nations to shoulder more of the financial burden of tackling the crisis.</p><p>“So there is a lot being discussed … and negotiators say that this might likely continue throughout the weekend,” Yanakiew said.</p><p>The deadlock comes as the UN Environment Programme <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un\">warned ahead of COP30</a> that the world would “very likely” exceed the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) warming limit – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.</p><p>Amnesty International also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty\">said in a recent report</a> that the expansion of fossil fuel projects threatens at least two billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In a statement on Friday, Nafkote Dabi, the climate policy lead at Oxfam International, said it was “unacceptable” for any final agreement to exclude a plan to phase out fossil fuels.</p><p>“A roadmap is essential, and it must be just, equitable, and backed by real support for the Global South,” Dabi said.</p><p>“Developed countries who grew wealthy on their fossil fuel-based economies must phase out first and fastest, while financing low‑carbon pathways for the Global South.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We never thought about it.”</p><p>But Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.</p><p>Zohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">Israel’s abuses against Palestinians</a>, long considered a taboo subject in US politics.</p><p>He is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.</p><p>“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”</p><p>“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-mamdani-family\">Inside the Mamdani family</h2><p>The son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.</p><p>He earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>When Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.</p><p>Mahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”</p><p>He traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.</p><p>Living with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.</p><p>“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122211\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122211\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-05T050247Z_1026356933_RC24QHAXIBXO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR-1-1763758816.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani and his family\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani stands with his wife Rama Duwaji, mother Mira Nair and father Mahmood Mamdani after winning the 2025 New York City mayoral race [Jeenah Moon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-mood-of-change\">A ‘mood of change’</h2><p>Mahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.</p><p>“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”</p><p>Local media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.</p><p>Mahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.</p><p>“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”</p><p>Mahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor. He described politics as a sphere dominated by the influence of moneyed powers.</p><p>“ I am not sure he knows that world well,” Mahmood said of his son. “He’s a fast learner, and he will learn it.”</p><p>He noted that significant resources were mobilised during the mayoral election to blunt <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/30/zohran-mamdani-supporters-make-final-campaign-push-why-him-why-now\">Zohran’s campaign</a>.</p><p>“ He’s taking on powerful forces. He’s being opposed by powerful forces. They failed during the campaign,” Mahmood said. That defeat, he added, “exposed the failure of money” as a defining force in the race.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122195\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122195\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122195\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25325081535841-1763757989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122195\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be sworn in on January 1 [File: Seth Wenig/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-focus-on-palestine\">A focus on Palestine</h2><p>Mahmood also addressed the role of Zohran’s advocacy on the campaign trail.</p><p>Though faced with criticism from his mayoral rivals, Mamdani has refused to retreat from his stance that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.</p><p>That position, though widely affirmed by <a href=\"/news/2024/12/5/amnesty-international-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">rights groups</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/9/1/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-scholars-group-says\">experts</a>, including at <a href=\"/news/2024/11/14/israels-warfare-methods-in-gaza-consistent-with-genocide-un-committee\">the United Nations</a>, is relatively rare in mainstream US politics, where opposition to Israel is a political third rail.</p><p>Still, voters appear to be shifting on the question of US support for Israel.</p><p>A March poll from the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of US respondents with an unfavourable view of Israel has increased from 42 percent in 2022 to 53 percent in 2025.</p><p>While <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/new-poll-shows-plunging-us-public-support-for-israels-war-on-gaza\">unfavourable views</a> were most pronounced among Democratic voters, they have also increased among conservatives, especially those under the age of 50.</p><p>Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 69,500 Palestinians since its start in October 2023, and there has been continued outrage over <a href=\"/news/2025/10/14/mapping-the-rise-in-israeli-settler-attacks-across-the-occupied-west-bank\">widespread Israeli violence</a> in the occupied West Bank as well.</p><p>Mahmood said the undeniable human rights abuses are causing a shift in public perception – and not just in the US.</p><p>“The real consequence of Gaza is not limited to Gaza. It is global,” said Mahmood. “Gaza has brought us a new phase in world history.”</p><p>“There will never be a return to a period when the world believes that what Israel is doing is defending itself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Democrats had baulked at the prospect, arguing that recent restrictions to government programmes had put healthcare out of reach for some US citizens.</p><p>They also warned that insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire by the end of the year. Without an extension to those subsidies, they said that insurance premiums for many Americans will spike.</p><p>Republicans rejected the prospect of negotiating the issue until after their continuing resolution was passed. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.</p><p>The two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.</p><p>Only on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge. Late that night, seven Democrats and one independent broke from their caucus to side with Republicans and pass a budget bill to fund the government through January 30.</p><p>The bill was then approved by the House of Representatives on November 12, by a vote of 222 to 209. President Donald Trump signed the legislation into law that very same day.</p><p>Trump had openly sought to leverage the shutdown to eliminate federal programmes he saw as benefitting Democratic strongholds.</p><p>He also attempted to blame the political left for the lapse in government services, though he acknowledged public frustration with Republicans after Democrats won key elections in November.</p><p>“If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” he told a breakfast for Republican senators on November 5. “That was a big factor.”</p><p>The Trump administration had warned as early as October that the month’s consumer price data would be negatively affected as a result of the shutdown.</p><p>In a White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/inflation-remains-low-as-democrat-shutdown-threatens-progress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Trump officials touted Trump’s economic record while slamming a potential lapse in the government’s collection of data. Once again, they angled the blame for any slowed economic growth at the Democrats.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the Democrat Shutdown risks grinding that progress to a halt,” the statement said.</p><p>“Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history — depriving policymakers and markets of critical data and risking economic calamity.”</p><p>September’s Consumer Price Index, the most recent available, showed that inflation across all retail items rose about 3 percent over the previous 12-month period.</p><p>For food alone, inflation for that period was estimated at 3.1 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

of efforts, backed by the United States and Qatar, to end decades of fighting in eastern DRC that has been an enduring threat to regional stability.</p><p>The framework was described by the US and Qatari officials as an important step towards peace, but one of many that lie ahead.</p><p>Sheikh Tamim arrived in the DRC a day after visiting Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.</p><p>Rwanda has long denied allegations that it has helped M23, which has seized more territory in the DRC than it has ever previously held.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, reporting from Kinshasa, said the emir wrapped his brief state visit to the country after meeting the Congolese president at the airport and then at the presidential palace.</p><p>Vall said that Qatar signed a number of protocols on economic and political cooperation with the DRC.</p><p>He also said, “The emir of Qatar has made his first stop in Kigali overnight, before he arrived here this morning, and the understanding is that that’s a symbolic move to link the two capitals and show that there is no alternative to rapprochement between the two countries.”</p><p>Qatar’s acting charge d’affaires in the capital Kinshasa, Shafi bin Newaimi al-Hajri, said Sheikh Tamim’s visit to the DRC was of special importance for bilateral relations.</p><p>Al-Hajri said diplomatic ties between the sides expanded in recent years, noting that a DRC embassy was opened in Doha in 2022 and Qatar opened its mission in Kinshasa in May 2025.</p><p>Al-Hajri also stressed that Qatar’s mediation efforts aimed at stabilising eastern DRC played a key role in strengthening dialogue between the two governments.</p><h2 id=\"trade-of-barbs\">Trade of barbs</h2><p>In eastern DRC, violence has continued despite the various diplomatic processes in Washington and Doha, with Congolese authorities and M23 trading blame for violating the principles of earlier agreements and deliberately delaying <a

armed groups operating in the volatile east.</p><p>M23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.</p><p>The two sides <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\">agreed</a> in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.</p><p>The July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier,
