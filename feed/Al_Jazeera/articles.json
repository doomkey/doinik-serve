The NCP was that very alternative: A centrist force with the promise of a “new political settlement”.</p><p>For Bangladeshis weary of the country’s two dynastic poles – Hasina’s Awami League, now <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">barred from upcoming polls</a> for its role in the bloody crackdown on protesters that killed an estimated 1,400 people in 2024; and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – Islam and his colleagues briefly appeared as a plausible break from the same old gravitational pull.</p><p>That hope, however, began to fade for some when the party opted to enter into an alliance anchored by Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamic party whose opposition to the nation’s independence in 1971 sticks in people’s memories, and whose social positions are a cause for concern among social activists and minorities.</p><p>The alliance has caused a rift inside the party. As it took shape, the NCP shed many from its liberal wing, including several senior figures and women leaders, who said the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>But Islam defends his decision to team up with Jamaat. “It’s an electoral alliance, not ideological,” he tells Al Jazeera. “We do have some common issues: Reform, combating corruption, good governance, sovereignty protection, and opposing hegemony.”</p><p>NCP candidates are standing in 30 seats as part of a seat-sharing deal within the alliance, out of 300 constituencies being contested in the election, which, observers say, is poised to be one of the country’s most consequential votes in years. By contrast, Jamaat gets 222 candidates, with the remaining seats divided among nine other partners.</p><p>As well as voting for the next parliament, Bangladeshis will cast votes in a national referendum on a package of reforms drawn up by a consensus process launched under Yunus’s interim government after the uprising.</p><p>Polling suggests a close contest between <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\">two main blocs</a>: The BNP and a Jamaat-led alliance.</p><p>A survey released by the United States-based International Republican Institute (IRI) in early December last year put the BNP at 33 percent, with Jamaat close behind at 29 percent, and projected 6 percent support for the NCP. Another large <a href=\"https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/cks7ensdlc\">survey</a> – jointly conducted by Projection BD, NarratiV, the International Institute of Law and Diplomacy (IILD) and the Jagoron Foundation – positioned the BNP at 34.7 percent and Jamaat at 33.6 percent, calling it, statistically, “a very close contest”.</p><p>In a tight race, analysts say one small party could be strategically decisive – not necessarily by winning a large share of the national vote, but by helping make a baggage-heavy partner more palatable to voters, particularly swing and liberal ones, and by shaping post-election bargaining over reforms.</p><p>That is where Islam and the NCP come in: Too new to dominate on their own, but potentially large enough to nudge both the result and the terms of what comes next.</p><p>Or, as Islam’s critics argue, to help someone else claim July 2024’s full brand.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-02-28T131726Z_1366842436_RC2O3DAYRL2H_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-1770712876.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nahid Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nahid Islam speaks to a crowd during the inauguration of his party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), in front of the National Parliament building, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 28, 2025 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"win-win\">‘Win-win’</h2><p>When Islam joins a video call with Al Jazeera late one night last week, he looks spent. He has been walking the streets all day, he says, going door-to-door and crisscrossing the neighbourhoods he hopes to represent in parliament. The fatigue is visible in his eyes as he talks about what voters have told him they want.</p><p>“People wanted change then; they want change now,” he says. “They don’t want Bangladesh to be run the way it was before.”</p><p>They want “solutions to their day-to-day problems”, he adds, and they want “their true representatives”.</p><p>He, himself, is running for member of parliament in Dhaka-11 – a constituency which was previously an Awami League stronghold and includes Badda, Vatara and Rampura. He was born and raised there, but he faces a heavyweight BNP candidate, MA Quayum, a longtime party leader and former local commissioner with a strong base in the area.</p><p>Despite that, Islam says, he has enjoyed a warm reception during his canvassing. “The people’s response is visible… They trust me as one of their own. They seem proud of me… There is immense love.”</p><p>He is betting on his popularity and the alliance’s political machinery to carry his side across the line. “I am hopeful our alliance will secure the required seats to form the government, and the ‘waterlily bud’ symbol will win in this constituency,” he says.</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and Dhaka University professor, says Islam’s path is not straightforward against a BNP rival, but he argues Islam has two advantages that could give him an edge on election day.</p><p>“Nahid is the face of the July uprising,” Shahan says, adding that Badda and adjacent neighbourhoods were among the hotspots of the 2024 protests.</p><p>And, he points out, Islam will benefit from Jamaat’s ground operation: “In his area, Jamaat’s apparatus has been working long-term, he has their workforce, and a full vote bank.”</p><p>But his campaign is not just about him, supporters say. It is about whether a party built around the spirit of uprising can survive its first encounter with electoral reality and whether its strategic alliance will save it or swallow it.</p><p>Islam says the Jamaat partnership is, above all, therefore, a practical bridge over the NCP’s organisational weakness.</p><p>“This coming together is primarily for the election, involving seat-based adjustments,” he says. The NCP, he argues, “in a short time … was not ready for electoral politics”, and an alliance with an “experienced political party” was the price of competing at all.</p><p>“If it could be done alone, that would have been the best,” he says. “Since that wasn’t possible, we think an alliance is a win-win situation for everyone.”</p><p>In return, Islam says, the NCP gains election experience, organisational support and access to Jamaat’s vote bank, while Jamaat benefits from the NCP’s popular appeal. “Jamaat has a vote bank that is being shared with NCP, and NCP’s vote share will also be received by Jamaat,” he says.</p><p>He also insists the 11-party alliance changes the coalition’s public character, broadening what was once a more overtly Islamist bloc.</p><p>“Before, this alliance was completely an Islamic alliance,” Islam says. “But now it’s not a total Islamic bloc. It’s Islamic plus youth and other patriotic forces [which] have come together on some common grounds.”</p><p>For critics, however, that is precisely the point – and precisely the danger.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301858\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260071500-1770712925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nahid Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters gather during an election campaign by the National Citizen Party (NCP) and Dhaka-11 constituency candidate Nahid Islam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 8, 2026 [Syed Mahamudur Rahman/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"they-re-the-trophies\">‘They’re the trophies’</h2><p>Samina Luthfa, a Dhaka University sociology professor and social activist, says she does not view the Jamaat-NCP arrangement as mutually beneficial.</p><p>“It gives Jamaat an edge, but not too much to NCP,” she says. “Jamaat is claiming the credit for the uprising fully by tagging the front faces of the movement with them, which helps Jamaat, not NCP as a political party.</p><p>“It’s an attempt to sell the idea that only they own July [movement],” she said. “It wasn’t Jamaat or Nahid Islam. It was thousands of ordinary people who came to the streets and gave their blood.”</p><p>Luthfa argues that when Islam sits beside Jamaat’s amir [leader], <a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>, it lends Jamaat credibility. “But”, she adds, “it won’t be good for NCP as a party or for Bangladesh.</p><p>“They’re the trophies.”</p><p>Luthfa adds that the NCP’s identity has remained largely “reactive”, shaped more by “hasty responses to events and power moves” than by a coherent programme. “People don’t understand any more what their ‘new settlement’ meant,” she says.</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, makes a similar argument, but grounds it in electoral maths.</p><p>“From different surveys, my sense is NCP’s vote nationwide is around 2 to 4 percent, highest maybe 5 percent,” he says, adding that for a party born less than a year ago, that is “not nothing”.</p><p>But he also argues that Jamaat’s motives for the alliance with NCP are clear: To soften its image and claim the uprising’s “full brand value”, given that many Jamaat activists also prominently participated in the protest, but “all the leading figures are in NCP.”</p><p>Jamaat, he says, “needed some faces” that would help it signal a shift: “‘We’re not that extreme; we are moving toward the centre.’”</p><p>Aligning with July’s young leaders, then, gives Jamaat a public-facing argument that “it is more flexible than its reputation,” especially after months when parts of its broader membership “argued for Sharia-based governance, even pointing to Afghanistan as a model”.</p><p>While Jamaat and NCP present themselves as the “pro-reform force that owns July”, they portray their main rival, the BNP, as “anti-reform”, Shahan says.</p><p>It is true that the BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30.</p><p>Islam tells Al Jazeera that his party had also explored a coalition with the BNP but failed to reach an understanding. “In the reform issue, we did not find BNP that sincere, and there is the issue of seat sharing,” he says.</p><p>Ultimately, he says, “BNP was not interested in doing an alliance. If you want an alliance, you have to agree on at least some political programmes. It seemed to us they wanted to remain standalone.”</p><p>The BNP is contesting the election with its own candidates in 292 of 300 constituencies, leaving just eight seats for allies the party described as partners in past “democratic movements”. At the same time, as many as 92 party “rebels”, overlooked or un-nominated parliamentary aspirants and former BNP figures the party could not accommodate, are also contesting the election independently.</p><p>Analysts say the numbers underline why the NCP was unlikely to secure anything like a 30-seat arrangement with the BNP, but some question whether the NCP needed to pay court to an established party at all.</p><p>“I totally see the benefit of NCP-Jamaat alliance going to Jamaat,” Shahan says. “Whether they succeed in image-cleaning is another issue, but that’s what they’re trying to do.”</p><p>The issue, however, is more complex. It is not simply that “NCP is not just allied with Jamaat,” but that “it is dependent on it.</p><p>“NCP has no organisational basis, except in a few places,” he says. “Jamaat is running their campaign, doing meetings, and going door-to-door. In most places, their votes are basically Jamaat’s except for one or two seats.”</p><p>Shahan argues that NCP, buoyed by “youth support and voters weary of dynastic politics”, could have used this election as a test to build an apparatus: Volunteers, polling agents, and constituency machinery. “But they didn’t,” he says. “They handed their entire system to Jamaat and completely depended on Jamaat.”</p><p>That creates a trap, Shahan says. “If the NCP wins using Jamaat’s machinery and later tries to leave, Jamaat can paint it as betrayal. If it stays, it risks being co-opted.</p><p>“Movement parties have two futures,” he adds. “Either they expand and survive, or they get co-opted by a bigger party. So far, NCP’s future looks like co-optation.”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed, a political science professor at Dhaka University, says he initially had high expectations of the NCP emerging as an independent force that could promise a new political order, but he now wonders what kind of party it will become in this process.</p><p>“They should have fielded candidates in all 300 seats, not that they had to win, but to stand the party up and reach people. They missed that opportunity.”</p><p>And, he says, “by going into an alliance with Jamaat, they got themselves into more controversy and weakened their position.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257934764-1770712989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nahid Islam of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) and a candidate for the national election, waves as he canvasses in the Rampura area, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Kazi Salahuddin Razu/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"jamaat-s-social-stance-and-dilemmas\">Jamaat’s social stance and dilemmas</h2><p>The Jamaat-NCP partnership collides most directly with anxieties about women’s rights and minority rights, areas in which Jamaat’s record and rhetoric have provoked alarm among secular activists.</p><p>Jamaat was a junior partner in an alliance with the BNP when the late <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a> returned to power for a third term, and has worked with women leaders in the past</p><p>But in a recent interview with Al Jazeera, its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, was asked whether a woman could lead the party.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.</p><p>“That is Jamaat’s party position, not the position of our alliance,” Islam tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>He has also tried to turn the critique outward, arguing that the NCP is structurally more open to women’s leadership than the traditional, mainstream parties.</p><p>“In NCP, the priority or opportunity for a woman to come to the topmost party position is the greatest,” he says, arguing that in older parties, women have historically reached leadership through dynastic family lineage, a reference that inevitably points to Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the BNP’s Khaleda Zia, wife of Ziaur Rahman.</p><p>Luthfa, the social activist, disputes the claim that the NCP has demonstrated a markedly stronger commitment to women’s rights or minority rights, however.</p><p>“And I don’t think NCP is any better on women’s rights or minority rights; they’ve shown what they’re going to do,” she says. “They nominated only two women; we expected better.”</p><p>Those two nominations, however, put the NCP just above the July Charter’s 5 percent bar – about 6 percent of its 30 candidates – while the BNP nominated 10 women, roughly 3.4 percent, and Jamaat fielded none, Shahan says.</p><p>The NCP is doing some things on its own terms, then.</p><p>It also announced a 36-point election manifesto this week, separate from Jamaat-e-Islami. And many supporters since have framed the party’s alliance with Jamaat as a “blessing in disguise”: If the NCP leaders enter parliament or cabinet, they argue, the manifesto could act as a restraining force against any attempt by Jamaat to advance more hardline interpretations of Islamic law in governance.</p><p>Nevertheless, Luthfa doubts the NCP can “keep Jamaat in check”. “They don’t have the numbers.”</p><p>Shahan points to nominations as proof of NCP’s limited leverage. “Jamaat nominated zero women,” he says. “If you can’t pressure Jamaat now, if you win later with their help, how will you keep them in line?”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed is more optimistic about the NCP’s potential to restrain Jamaat. “If NCP gets even five seats out of 30, then they could make a difference in parliament,” he says. Restraining Jamaat, in his view, becomes possible only if the NCP has a real bloc.</p><p>“They will,” he said. “If Jamaat crosses the limit, then I see them resisting or walking out of that bloc.”</p><p>Five seats may not be enough, but Jamaat’s Rahman said on Sunday at a Dhaka rally that Islam would “definitely” be made a minister if their alliance forms a government.</p><p>And Islam says there are boundaries the NCP will not cross. “If our core positions, especially on women and minorities, are compromised,” he tells Al Jazeera, “the alliance will not continue.”</p><p>“If an alliance government is formed, policies will not be controlled by the ideology of any one party. Rather, work will be done based on the unity of the parties,” Islam says.</p><p>Ahmed argues that Jamaat has “shifted significantly” from its earlier positions and has publicly stated that it will not govern based on its old core ideology, which is to establish the Islamic way in all aspects of life based on Sharia, instead “speaking of inclusivity and even a national government”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301865\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301865\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257938055-1770713047.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener and Dhaka-11 candidate Nahid Islam greets voters before the upcoming national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Rehman Asad/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-good-boy-but-a-powerful-leader\">‘A good boy’ but a powerful leader?</h2><p>Islam says his brief time inside the Yunus caretaker government stripped away any illusions about how power works.</p><p>He credits the interim government under Muhammad Yunus with initiating the reform referendum process, but criticises its failures: It “tried to stabilise the economy but failed in law and order and managing public expectations”.</p><p>He describes the obstacles he faced while inside government, not only on sweeping changes, but in the everyday resistance of institutions.</p><p>“We wanted to change the president, change the constitution … big big things, and also in small things such as bureaucratic reform and many such things, we faced a lot of obstacles,” he says now.</p><p>Such was his apparent disillusion with the apparatus of government, Islam has previously suggested that it would be more effective to remain on the streets than to be in power. Now, he says that was said in a different context and insists that governing is where “parties gain the capacity to deliver for the nation meaningfully.</p><p>“Of course, being in power makes it more possible to work,” he says. “With the state, a lot can be done … in five years.”</p><p>Islam’s sharpest language is reserved for two issues: India and the Awami League.</p><p>Sheikh Hasina remains holed up in India while facing a death sentence for her order to kill protesters in Bangladesh, and, so far, India shows no sign of willingness to extradite her. But Islam argues that Bangladesh needs a relationship with its mighty neighbour based on “national dignity and national interest”. He lists grievances, though: “border killings, water disputes, political interference”.</p><p>“India has to change its policy,” he says, warning that a relationship shaped as warmly as during the Hasina era will not be accepted by “this generation”.</p><p>On the Awami League – Hasina’s former party, which is barred from the upcoming vote – he is uncompromising.</p><p>“We think the Awami League has no right to do politics,” he says. He says he wants “reconciliation and civic rights” for <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">supporters of the party</a>, but “not under the Awami League banner”.</p><p>There have been times when his party members have hailed the soft-spoken Islam as the “imam of democracy”. And some public figures, including veteran journalist and Yunus’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam, have floated Islam as someone who could be “the prime minister of this country [Bangladesh] … one day”.</p><p>Analysts say this election will test whether that aura can survive electoral reality.</p><p>Shahan warns that Islam is currently reaping the benefits of his role in the uprising, but a weak election result could trigger internal blowback and deepen what he refers to as an identity crisis.</p><p>“If NCP wins not even five seats, or only five, Nahid will face an internal challenge,” he predicts. “A towering figure needs a distinct party identity… If at the end of the day, Nahid equals Jamaat, Nahid’s value as a towering figure is gone.”</p><p>Ahmed is also sceptical about Islam’s leadership credentials. “He lacks political foresight and control over the party.</p><p>“He is a good boy, a polite boy,” he adds, “but good people don’t necessarily become good leaders; you need certain charismatic qualities, which I don’t see in Nahid.”</p><p>Islam himself has set a 10-year horizon: If the NCP cannot develop the capacity to form government within a decade, he said he would leave politics, during an interview with Dhaka Stream, a local news outlet, on November 5, 2025.</p><p>Talking to Al Jazeera now, he reaffirms this, but describes it as “a target and a challenge” for what he says should be enough for his party, the NCP, to bring a new political order.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the first time postal voting has been facilitated, <a href=\"/features/2025/10/28/bangladesh-expats-win-means-to-vote-could-they-sway-the-next-election\">benefitting about 15 million overseas workers</a> whose remittances form a vital part of the Bangladeshi economy.</p><p>Bangladesh has a “unicameral” legislature – a single legislative chamber which makes laws – the Jatiyo Shangsad or the House of the Nation, with 350 constituencies. Each constituency has a single-member seat.</p><p>Voting through the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system is used to elect 300 members, while the remaining 50 seats are reserved for women and are allocated to parties proportionally after the election results. So, for example, if a party wins 60 seats, it receives 10 reserved seats to be allocated to female politicians.</p><p>Bangladesh operates a plurality voting system under which voters make one choice from a list of candidates and, after the votes are counted, the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.</p><p>This means that if a party wins a large number of seats by only small margins, this will be reflected through an imbalance between overall vote share and overall seats won.</p><p>Theoretically, one party could win 51 percent of the vote in every seat, while another could win 49 percent in every seat. The first party would receive 100 percent of the seats, however.</p><p>The party which wins 151 seats forms a government without the need for a coalition with other parties, regardless of how well other parties perform.

That vote, boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) amid a crackdown on opposition figures, was widely described by international observers and rights groups as not free or fair.</p><p>In July 2024, <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/8/7/how-bangladeshs-gen-z-protests-brought-down-pm-sheikh-hasina\">students in Bangladesh</a> began protesting against a conventional job quota system, which reserved a significant share of prized government jobs for descendants of Bangladesh’s freedom fighters of 1971, now widely regarded as the political elite.</p><p>Hasina ordered a brutal crackdown as the protests escalated. Nearly 1,400 people were killed, and more than 20,000 were wounded, according to the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).</p><p>Hasina was eventually ousted, and she fled to India, where she remains in exile. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the country’s interim leader in August 2024.</p><p>Last year, Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit obtained recorded evidence that the former Bangladeshi leader had ordered police to use “lethal weapons” against the protesters.</p><p>In November, she was convicted, in absentia, of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/sheikh-hasina-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity-what-we-know\">crimes against humanity</a> and sentenced to death by the ICT in Dhaka.

In December, Rahman, 60, returned to Bangladesh after nearly 17 years of exile in London. He had escaped the country in 2008 amid what he deemed a politically motivated persecution.</p><p>The BNP was founded by <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/8/can-a-dynastic-heir-lead-a-post-dynasty-bangladesh\">Rahman’s father</a>, Ziaur Rahman, a prominent military figure in the country’s independence war against Pakistan in 1971, in 1978.</p><p>The party states that it was built on the principles of Bangladeshi nationalism. According to the BNP website, this is an “ideology that recognises the right of Bangladeshis from all walks of life, irrespective of their ethnicity, gender or race”.</p><p>The BNP has traditionally swapped positions as governing and opposition party with the Awami League since independence.</p><p>After Ziaur Rahman’s assassination in 1981, his wife Khaleda Zia led the BNP, serving twice as prime minister, from 1991 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2006.</p><p>During this time, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JIB) was a key ally of the BNP against the Awami League.</p><p>After Hasina returned to power in 2009, the BNP came under intense pressure; Khaleda was placed under house arrest following a conviction in 2018 on corruption charges, but was acquitted and freed after Hasina was ousted in 2024.</p><p>Since Hasina’s departure, the BNP has re-emerged as a leading political force.</p><h3>Jamaat-e-Islami</h3><p>The JIB, commonly known as Jamaat, spearheads an 11-party alliance, including the National Citizen Party (NCP), a group formed by students who led the protests against Hasina in 2024. The party is led by 67-year-old <a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>.</p><p>Jamaat was founded in 1941 by Abul Ala Maududi when India was still under British colonial rule.</p><p>In 1971, Jamaat opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan and was banned after the liberation. However, the BNP government lifted the ban in 1979.</p><p>Jamaat burgeoned into a significant political force over the next two decades, backing BNP-led coalitions in 1991 and 2001.</p><p>While Hasina was in power from 2009 to 2024, five senior JIB figures were executed, and others jailed for 1971 war crimes, and the party was barred from elections in 2013.</p><p>In June 2025, the Supreme Court restored its registration, allowing it to contest again. Jamaat is no longer allied with the BNP and is, instead, facing off against it as its biggest rival in the upcoming election.</p><p>In a bid to win support from non-Muslim voters, Jamaat is fielding one Hindu candidate, Krishna Nandi, from Khulna <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">for the first time</a> in its history.</p><p>JIB ally NCP was formed in February 2025 by students who led the mass protests in July 2024. It is led by 27-year-old Nahid Islam.</p><p>Independent University’s Rejwan said the election will serve as a test of how strong the Jamaat really is, and will determine Bangladesh’s path on the global stage.</p><p>“A victory by the BNP would likely signal a move towards detente with India amid existing diplomatic strains, alongside a more balanced and diversified engagement with external partners that avoids rigid alignments or geopolitical binaries,” Rejwan said.</p><p>“In contrast, a JIB-led government may pursue a markedly different approach. It could seek to counter India’s apprehensions by cultivating closer ties with Pakistan and Turkiye, as well as with either China or the United States, or both.”</p><h3>Non-allied parties</h3><p>A JIB-alliance breakaway party, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh, and the Jatiya Party, a longtime ally of Hasina’s Awami League, are contesting the elections independently.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299721\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-opinion-polls-suggest-so-far\">What do opinion polls suggest so far?</h2><p>A survey by the United States-based International Republican Institute, published in December 2025, put the BNP’s support at 33 percent.</p><p>The survey placed Jamaat closely behind the BNP, with 29 percent.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-the-results-be-known\">When will the results be known?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/timeline-of-past-bangladesh-elections-and-the-countrys-leaders\">previous elections</a>, unofficial results have typically begun to emerge early the following morning.</p><p>ECB officials have told local media, however, that the vote count may take longer this time as it will involve both the white parliamentary voting ballot and the pink ballots for the referendum on the July National Charter.</p><p>There is also a higher number of parties and candidates this time.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Past-elections-1770627595.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Past_Elections\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-election-so-significant\">Why is this election so significant?</h2><p>“After nearly 17 years, the electorate anticipates the opportunity to participate in a genuinely competitive and meaningful electoral process in which individual votes carry real weight,” Rejwan said.</p><p>Since Hasina rose to power in 2009, the fairness of each election in Bangladesh has been questioned by opposition parties.</p><p>Additionally, the election is significant because “young voters constitute a substantial proportion of the electorate, many of whom will be casting their votes for the first time”.</p><p>He said, “This generation was also at the forefront of the popular movement that challenged and ultimately deposed the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>The rapid rise of Islamist parties in both domestic politics and the public sphere, as well as the absence of the Awami League, one of Bangladesh’s largest and most influential political parties, from the electoral contest, are also highly significant, he said.</p><p>“This altered political configuration has transformed traditional alliances into arenas of competition. Former allies, such as the BNP and the JIB, now find themselves as rivals despite their earlier cooperation in opposing the Hasina regime.”</p><p>“Taken together, the longstanding public demand for a free and fair election, the unprecedented possibility of constitutional and structural transformation of the state, the decisive presence of a large Gen-Z electorate, and the growing popularity of Islamist parties such as the JIB render this election one of the most consequential in Bangladesh’s political history,” Rejwan concluded.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At least 79 percent of higher education campuses and 60 percent of vocational training centres are also damaged or destroyed.</p><p>Ahmad al-Turk, the dean of public relations and assistant to the president of the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/islamic-university-of-gaza-resumes-classes-on-site-amid-israeli-destruction\">Islamic University of Gaza</a>, said that Israel has been deliberately attacking education.</p><p>“Targeting professors affects future generations, especially given the experience and skills these professors possess in their fields of specialisation,” al-Turk said. “There is no doubt that the absence of competent professors negatively affects students’ achievement, as well as the research process in the future.”</p><p>This is particularly worrying for Raed Salha, a professor at the Islamic University and an expert on regional and urban planning.</p><p>“University expertise is not something that can be replaced quickly,” he said. “It is cumulative knowledge built through years of teaching and research. Losing it – whether through death, forced displacement, or prolonged disruption – is a devastating loss for students, academic institutions, and society as a whole.”</p><p>Most families and university students also struggle with the online education system, as it is difficult to afford to buy electronic devices and mobile phones, even before taking into account the weak internet connection in Gaza.</p><p>“Teachers are trying to teach; students are trying to follow, but the tools are almost nonexistent,” Salha said.</p><p>“We cannot recreate the experience of students leaving home in the morning, meeting friends, sitting in university courtyards, libraries, laboratories, or participating in activities and events,” he said. “This experience shaped generations of students’ identities and sense of belonging. Today, it is being taken away from them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4303831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4303831\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4303831 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image00004-1770756852.jpeg?resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"University students at the Islamic University campus in Gaza City after partially resuming face-to-face learning at IUG [Mustafa Salah/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4303831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students sit in a classroom at the Islamic University in Gaza City after partially resuming face-to-face learning [Mustafa Salah/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"university-challenges\">University challenges</h2><p>University student Osama Zimmo explained that getting used to online learning has been a challenge.</p><p>“We became names on screens, not students living a full experience,” the 20-year-old civil engineering student from Gaza City said.</p><p>Osama had enrolled to study computer systems engineering at Gaza’s al-Azhar University before the war, and completed the first year of his studies.</p><p>But despite his initial passion for that field, it became difficult to continue his studies online once the university shifted to e-learning.</p><p>“I found that I didn’t have a laptop, stable electricity, or good internet, and even my phone was old and unreliable,” he said, adding that uncertainty over when the war would end and the impact of artificial intelligence gave him pause about his chosen field.</p><p>Eventually, he decided to switch his major, starting a civil engineering degree at the Islamic University, which would involve him relying less on electricity and the internet.</p><p>The Islamic University resumed in-person classes in December.</p><p>“It was a choice to continue rather than stop; to adapt rather than giving in,” Osama said.</p><p>“We study not because the path is clear, but because giving up is exactly what this reality tries to force on us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In addition to allowing Jews to buy property in the West Bank – a Palestinian territory that Israel has occupied since 1967 in defiance of international law – the Israeli government has also ordered that land registries in the West Bank be opened up to the public.</p><p>That means that it will be easier for Israelis looking to take territory in the West Bank to find out who the owner of the land is, opening them up to harassment and pressure.</p><p>The cabinet also decreed that authority over building permits for illegal Jewish settlements in Hebron, and the Ibrahimi Mosque compound, would pass to Israel from the Palestinian Hebron municipality.</p><p>Moataz Abu Sneina has seen Israel’s efforts to seize Palestinian land first hand. He is the director of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a Palestinian national symbol and an important Islamic holy site due to its connection to the Prophet Ibrahim, also known as Abraham.</p><p>Abu Sneina said that the latest Israeli decisions reflect a clear intention to increase Israeli control over Hebron’s Old City, and the <a href=\"/news/2021/8/13/israeli-forces-attack-palestinian-worshippers-ibrahimi-mosque-hebron\">Ibrahimi Mosque</a> compound.</p><p>“What is happening today is the most serious development since 1967,” Abu Sneina said. “We view it with grave concern for the Old City and the Ibrahimi Mosque, which is the symbol and beating heart of Hebron, and the shrine of the patriarchs and prophets.”</p><p>The Ibrahimi Mosque site is also revered by Jews, who refer to it as the Tomb of the Patriarchs.</p><p>An Israeli Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians after opening fire on Muslims praying at the mosque in 1994. Shortly afterwards, Israeli authorities divided the site into Jewish and Muslim prayer areas, and far-right Israeli settlers continue to strengthen their control over areas of Hebron.</p><p>Despite only numbering a few hundred, the settlers have taken over large areas of the city centre, protected by the Israeli military.</p><p>Abu Sneina explained that Israel has repeatedly attempted to strengthen its foothold inside Hebron and the mosque, and that the latest government moves are a continuation of Israeli policy that has only increased since the October 2023 start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“This has taken the form of increased settler incursions, restrictions on worshippers, control over entry and exit, and bans on the call to prayer – all part of a systematic policy aimed at complete control over the holy site,” Abu Sneina said.</p><p>“[Israel] continues to violate all agreements, foremost the Hebron Protocol, closing most entrances to the mosque and leaving only one fully controlled access point,” he added. “This paves the way for a new division or an even harsher reality than the temporal and spatial division imposed since the 1994 massacre.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"taking-over-hebron\">Taking over Hebron</h2><p>Mohannad al-Jaabari, the director of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee, a Palestinian organisation focused on the restoration of Hebron’s Old City, said that the Israeli government was already increasing its presence on the ground, in an effort to take control of the city.</p><p>He pointed to the confiscation of shops belonging to the Hebron Municipality in the Old City, the construction of dozens of illegal settlement units, and the reconfiguration of water pipes by connecting them to an Israeli water company’s network, creating what he described as “a massive apartheid system”.</p><p>Al-Jaabari warned that the ultimate goal is to establish a Jewish quarter linking settlements to the Ibrahimi Mosque by emptying Palestinian neighbourhoods of their residents.</p><p>“All Hebron institutions are preparing for a difficult phase,” he said. “We are bracing for a fierce attack on Palestinian institutions, foremost the Rehabilitation Committee.”</p><p>The Israeli government’s latest decisions open the door for what has happened in Hebron to happen elsewhere, with Israeli settlers establishing a presence in other Palestinian cities, forcing locals out, experts say.</p><p>Nabil Faraj, a Palestinian journalist and political analyst, called the Israeli government’s moves “dangerous” and added that they “have driven the final nail into the coffin of the peace process”.</p><p>He explained that Israel is reengineering the geographic landscape of the West Bank, expanding infrastructure to serve settlements, and seeking to strip the Palestinian Authority of administrative and security control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-hebron-model\">The Hebron model</h2><p>Palestinians in Bethlehem are now worried that they will get a taste of what Hebron has already experienced.</p><p>One of the Israeli cabinet’s decisions on Sunday stipulated that the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque in the city, known to Jews as Rachel’s Tomb, would be placed under Israeli administration for cleaning and maintenance, after previously being under the jurisdiction of the Bethlehem municipality. The mosque’s cemetery has also been affected.</p><p>“It will affect the living and the dead,” said Bassam Abu Srour, who lives in Bethlehem’s Aida refugee camp. “Annexing the area would prevent burials and visits to the Islamic cemetery. This is extremely serious and completely unacceptable to us.”</p><p>In Bethlehem, Hebron, and the rest of the West Bank, Palestinians feel powerless to stop what they view as a creeping annexation.</p><p>Mamdouh al-Natsheh, a shop owner in Hebron, said he now has a growing sense that what is unfolding is an attempt to impose a permanent reality.</p><p>“The city is being taken from its people step by step,” he said. “Daily restrictions are turning it into a fixed policy that suffocates every detail of life.”</p><p>He added that the deepest impact is on children and young people, growing up in a city that is “divided and constantly monitored”, stripping them of a natural sense of the future.</p><p>“I fear the day will come when we are told this area has been officially annexed, and that our presence depends on permits,” al-Natsheh said. “In Hebron, a house is not just walls – it is history and identity. Any annexation means the loss of security and stability.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

As of February 2023, the trust had plummeted to a mere <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/grassley_to_doi_oig_-_bikini_atoll.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$100,000</a>, and payments to Bikini Atoll survivors and descendants have ceased.</p><p>Critics have blamed Jibas, who was elected in 2016 to lead the Kili, Bikini and Ejit islands as mayor. He campaigned on having more local autonomy over the fund.</p><p>But reports in The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets accused him of misappropriating the funds for purchases including vacations, travel and a new pick-up truck.</p><p>In Tuesday’s announcement, the State Department connected Jibas’s alleged abuse to the spread of Chinese power in the Pacific and an increase in immigration to the US, two key issues in Trump’s platform.</p><p>“The theft, misuse, and abuse of the U.S.-provided money for the fund wasted U.S. taxpayer money and contributed to a loss of jobs, food insecurity, migration to the United States,” the department wrote.</p><p>“The lack of accountability for Jibas’ acts of corruption has eroded public trust in the government of the Marshall Islands, creating an opportunity for malign foreign influence from China and others.”</p><p>Both Palau and the Marshall Islands were US territories, occupied during World War II and granted independence in the late 20th century.</p><p>They both continue to be part of a Compact of Free Association with the US, which allows the North American superpower to continue military operations in the area and control the region’s defence.</p><p>They are also part of a dwindling list of countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan’s government, much to the ire of the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>Only about a dozen remain, and they are largely concentrated in Central America, the Caribbean or the Pacific islands.</p><p>But China has sought to pressure those smaller countries into rupturing their ties with Taiwan and recognising its government in Beijing instead.</p><p>The Asian superpower – often seen as a rival to the US – has also attempted to expand its sphere of influence to the southern Pacific, by building trade relations and countering US military authority in the area.</p><p>Baules, for example, is among the local politicians who have advocated for recognising Beijing’s government over Taipei’s, and he is a vocal proponent for increased ties with China.</p><p>Those shifting views have placed island nations like Palau and the Marshall Islands in the midst of a geopolitical tug-of-war, as the US struggles with China to maintain dominance in the region.</p><p>In other parts of the world, the US has also used sanctions to dissuade local officials from seeking closer ties with China.</p><p>Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino, for instance, has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/panamas-president-alleges-us-threatening-to-revoke-visas-over-china-ties\">accused the US embassy</a> in his country of threatening to strip local officials of their visas, as the US and China jockey for influence over the Panama Canal.</p><p>Similar reports have emerged in neighbouring Costa Rica, where officials like lawmaker Vanessa Castro and former President Oscar Arias have accused the US of revoking their visas over ties to China.</p><p>But there have been other points of tension between the Pacific Islands and the US in recent years.</p><p>The Trump administration has withdrawn from accords designed to limit climate change and <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions\">quashed international efforts</a> to reduce emissions, straining ties with the islands, which are vulnerable to rising sea levels.</p><p>Still, the US State Department framed the sanctions on Tuesday as an effort to ensure local accountability and defend US interests in the region.</p><p>“The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who abuse public power for personal gain and steal from our citizens to enrich themselves,” it said.</p><p>“These designations reaffirm the United States’ commitment to countering global corruption affecting U.S. interests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A 74-year-old woman was also injured, he added.</li>\n<li>Russian attacks on energy infrastructure left the Lozova community in the Kharkiv region without electricity, local official Serhii Zelenskyy said. Syniehubov later declared an energy emergency, citing “constant enemy fire” across the region.</li>\n<li>A Russian missile attack killed a mother and her 11-year-old daughter, and injured 16 people, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office said in a post on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Five people were killed in a Ukrainian attack on Vasylivka, in a Russian-occupied area of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, Moscow-appointed local official Natalya Romanichenko told Russia’s TASS state news agency.</li>\n<li>A priest was killed in a Ukrainian attack on a funeral procession in Skelki, also in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia, according to TASS, citing Russian officials who widely condemned the attack.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks caused power outages in Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhia and heating outages in Enerhodar, also in Russian-occupied Zaporizhia, Russian-appointed officials said, according to TASS.</li>\n<li>One of two external power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia, has been cut as a result of a Ukrainian attack, the Russian-installed management of the power station said on Tuesday.</li>\n<li>A man was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on a van in the Shebekinsky district of Russia’s Belgorod region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</li>\n<li>Russian air defence systems shot down three guided aerial bombs and 72 Ukrainian drones in one day, TASS reported.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"weapons\">Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The US ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said in an online briefing that 21 NATO allies and two partners have pledged to buy more than $4.5bn in US weapons through the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative. Whitaker said he expects more announcements of pledges to buy weapons for Kyiv when defence ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian forces received an additional injection of 4.5 billion Ukrainian hryvnias ($104.5m) to order drones and electronic warfare systems over the past month, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"politics-and-diplomacy\">Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his country’s support for efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, the president’s office said. The Kremlin also confirmed that the two leaders discussed the war.</li>\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that France has not officially re-established relations with Russia, but that Moscow had “noted Mr Macron’s statement on the need to restore relations with Russia”, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron. “We are impressed by such statements,” Peskov added.</li>\n<li>Moscow’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it would further restrict the Telegram platform in Russia, saying the messaging app was not “observing” Russian law, that “personal data is not protected”, and that the app has “no effective measures to counter fraud and the use of the messaging app for criminal and terrorist purposes”.</li>\n<li>Telegram’s Russian-born founder, Pavel Durov, defended the app, which is used widely in Ukraine and Russia, saying Telegram would remain committed to protecting freedom of speech and user privacy, “no matter the pressure”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The management of the PCK Schwedt refinery in Germany, controlled by Russia’s Rosneft energy company, made an “urgent appeal” to German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Katherina Reiche, saying the threat of US sanctions could harm fuel supply to Berlin and the region. Berlin had secured a sanctions exception for the refinery, but it is set to expire on April 29.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

Her cousin, Hamzah Abushaban, said the family was “stonewalled, like hardcore”, as they searched for answers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Full transparency: Many people in her family thought she might have died, especially with the secrecy of her condition,” Abushaban told Al Jazeera. “Sometimes, silence speaks for itself.”</p><p>Her family and legal team confirmed on Tuesday that she has been released from the hospital. Kordia had suffered a seizure, but her family has only had fleeting contact with her since the medical emergency.</p><p>The ordeal is the latest turn in Kordia’s nearly <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/who-is-leqaa-kordia-the-columbia-protester-still-in-ice-detention\">yearlong detention</a>, which began when she was among several protesters targeted by immigration officials for taking part in pro-Palestine demonstrations at Columbia University in 2024.</p><p>Kordia remains the only person targeted in connection with the demonstration who is still in immigration detention.</p><p>Personal losses helped inspire her protest: Nearly 200 members of her family have been killed in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Her recent medical emergency underscores the dangers she faces from her continued detention, not to mention the urgent need for her release, according to Abushaban.</p><p>“She’s a fighter, but she’s not fooling anyone,” he said. “She’s still very sick”</p><h2 id=\"arbitrarily-detained\">‘Arbitrarily detained’</h2><p>On Monday, Amnesty International joined calls for Kordia’s release, echoing her family’s assertion that she is being unfairly targeted for her pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>“She has been arbitrarily detained for over ten months for exercising her rights to free speech and protest,” Justin Mazzola, the deputy director of research at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.</p><p>“The Trump administration must stop playing cruel political games with Leqaa’s life. Leqaa Kordia must be immediately released, and there must be accountability for the flagrant violation of her human rights.”</p><p>Kordia’s lawyers have also alleged unjust treatment, noting that federal judges had twice ruled she was eligible to be released on bond.</p><p>Each time, her release has been blocked after immigration officials filed “discretionary stay” requests to keep her in custody while the government appealed.</p><p>Since March 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump has targeted a range of student activists for deportation. They include Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, both of Columbia University, and Rumeysa Ozturk, who attended Tufts University in Massachusetts.</p><p>But those pro-Palestinian student activists have all successfully petitioned for their release as their cases continue in immigration court, though courts have signalled that they could be taken back into custody.</p><p>Kordia, however, has not had that same success.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kordia came to the US in 2016 from the town of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Initially, she arrived using a visitor’s visa, later transitioning to a student visa.</p><p>Eventually, she applied for permanent residency through her mother, a US citizen residing in New Jersey.</p><p>But her legal team has said she was wrongly advised by a trusted mentor that the initial approval of her application meant she had legal status. She subsequently allowed her student visa to lapse.</p><p>Immigration officials have, in turn, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/30/100-days-fighting-fake-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintained</a> that Kordia was detained for overstaying her student visa, not for her pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>However, in an initial news release announcing Kordia’s arrest in March 2025, the Department of Homeland Security suggested that she and a second protester – who allegedly “self-deported” – were targeted for their advocacy.</p><p><span>“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in the release.</span></p><p>“When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”</p><h2 id=\"intentionally-dehumanising\">‘Intentionally dehumanising’</h2><p>In his statement on Monday, Mazzola accused immigration officials of showing “blatant disregard” for Kordia’s human rights in detention, pointing to the deterioration of her health.</p><p>Kordia has been held at the Prairieland Detention Facility, some 2,400km (1,500 miles) away from her family in New Jersey.</p><p>Laila El-Haddad, an author and advocate, said she visited Kordia in December, finding her “very thin, very gaunt” as she complained about unsanitary conditions and a lack of nutritious food at the crowded facility.</p><p>“She talked about this being a place that is intentionally dehumanising; that aims to strip her and others of their dignity and their humanity,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kordia’s lawyers and family, meanwhile, said she regularly suffers dizzy spells, fainting and other signs of subpar nutrition.</p><p>Still, El-Haddad found that Kordia remained upbeat, and she described the 33-year-old as a pillar of support for other detainees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“She’s very humble. She kept talking about how ‘I’m not a leader or an activist,'” El-Haddad remembered.</p><p>El-Hadded added that Kordia’s case has not gotten as much attention as those of other student protesters, but her story is just as powerful.</p><p>“She wasn’t a public-facing activist or speaker in the way some of the other [targeted protesters] were,” El-Hadded explained.</p><p>“But she found herself in a position and felt compelled [to protest] because of her own humanity and because she was a person with a deep moral compass and consciousness to act and to speak out.”</p><p>Abushaban said he has felt Kordia’s absence acutely at family events. It has been a year of missed birthdays, holidays and other gatherings.</p><p>He called for US officials, regardless of political affiliation, to have empathy for her plight.</p><p>“I was born and raised here, and the rest of my family were all born and raised here,” he said. “And just because we are Palestinians, we still have to feel suppressed in this country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked if that meant another election would not happen for another five years.</p><p>“The only thing I could say is that there will not be an election in this immediate period of time where the stabilisation has to be achieved,” Rodriguez replied.</p><p>He explained that the decision is tied to a wider effort to rebuild and strengthen Venezuela’s state institutions.</p><p>“What we’re working on at the moment is what we call the re-institutionalisation of the country, so that every single institution of the country can again be brought to full power and full recognition by everybody,” he said.</p><p>Rodriguez, who has led the National Assembly since 2021, added that Venezuelans are seeking a return to normalcy following the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">abduction of President Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>“The government of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a> is actually looking for that, to stabilise the country completely and to make it all good and reconcile everybody, all the population of Venezuela,” he said.</p><p>The US abducted Maduro in a military action on January 3.

An estimated 25 people were killed, according to the US State Department.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">In Monday’s interview, Rodriguez rejected the assertion that the 2024 race was not legitimate. Instead, he emphasised his push for national unity, saying, “We have been divided for a very long time.”</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">He highlighted the legislature’s efforts to pass a mass <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/venezuelas-national-assembly-approves-amnesty-bill-in-first-of-two-votes\">amnesty law</a>, which would result in the release of all political prisoners and forgive any crimes related to political dissent since 1999.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">The bill was approved unanimously in the first of two votes on Thursday and is expected to pass this week.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Still, questions have surrounded the bill. Critics fear that political repression could take other forms after the prisoners’ release.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Schmitt asked whether opposition leader Maria Corina Machado would be able to return to Venezuela and campaign freely in a future election, following the bill’s passage.</p><p data-start=\"203\" data-end=\"338\">“So, allow me not to speak about only one single name, because there are many, many actors abroad that have to be included in this discussion,” Rodriguez responded.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“There is an amnesty law that is being done at the moment that contemplates working with people, but there are sectors of the opposition abroad which have promoted violence.”</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">He then indicated that the amnesty bill would not apply to the opposition leaders accused of violent crimes.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“Through this amnesty law, we are promoting for all the sections of the opposition who are abroad to comply with the law, so they can come back to the country,” Rodriguez said.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Opposition leaders, however, have long alleged that the government has peddled false accusations of violent crime to arrest and jail them.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Machado herself was accused of conspiring to assassinate Maduro in 2014, leading to her expulsion from the National Assembly.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Rodriguez’s comments also come amid developments in the case of former lawmaker <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/venezuela-rearrests-opposition-figure-guanipa-after-release-prosecutor\">Juan Pablo Guanipa</a>.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">The leader was released on Sunday after spending more than eight months in pretrial detention, but he was rearrested less than 12 hours later, after speaking with the media and supporters.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">According to his family, he was detained by armed men without identification or a court order. His son, Ramon Guanipa, described the incident as an “abduction”.</p><p data-start=\"2596\" data-end=\"2766\">Officials later stated that they had requested the revocation of his release order, citing his alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed upon his release.</p><p data-start=\"2768\" data-end=\"2890\">In the early hours of Tuesday, Guanipa was transferred to his residence in Maracaibo, where he remains under house arrest.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">Machado condemned the actions, stating that Guanipa’s case demonstrates that the releases announced by the government do not guarantee the full exercise of political and civil rights.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“What was Juan Pablo’s crime? Telling the truth. So are these releases, or what are they?” Machado said on Monday.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">She proceeded to question whether the released prisoners were truly free from what she described as the repressive machinery of the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“Can’t we talk in Venezuela about those who have been in prison?

The deployment includes the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Channel 12 and the news outlet Axios reported on Tuesday that Trump is also thinking about sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.</p><p>That <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/iran-ready-for-nuclear-focused-talks-rejects-us-military-build-up\">military build-up</a> has spurred fears of an impending US strike against Iran. Critics fear such an attack could destabilise the region.</p><p>Already, on Monday, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/us-urges-american-ships-to-stay-as-far-as-possible-from-iranian-waters\">the US issued guidelines</a> to US-flagged commercial ships, warning them to stay “as far as possible” from Iranian territorial waters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-demands\">Heightened demands</h2><p>Since January, Trump has heightened US pressure on Iran, warning that his country’s military is “locked and loaded and ready to go”.</p><p>Trump has also compared Iran’s situation with that of Venezuela, where a US military operation on January 3 resulted in the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>“Like with Venezuela, [the US military] is ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary. Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on January 28.</p><p>Late last month, the Trump administration issued Iran three overarching demands. They include an end to Iran’s uranium enrichment, a requirement to sever ties with regional proxies, and limits on the country’s ballistic missile stockpiles, a goal long sought by Israel.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his position that Iran should comply with his demands, telling the news outlet Fox Business that it would be “foolish” not to.</p><p>During his first term, the US president pulled his country out of a 2015 <a href=\"/features/2025/4/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-iran-us-nuclear-negotiations\">deal that placed strict limits</a> on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has resumed his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p>The push has included severe sanctions and pressure to dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme, which Tehran insists is for civilian energy purposes only.</p><p>Already, last June, Trump authorised a military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, as part of a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"responding-to-antigovernment-protests\">Responding to antigovernment protests</h2><p>Trump’s renewed threats in January coincided with a recent wave of antigovernment protests in Iran.</p><p>The government in Tehran reacted to the demonstrations with a violent crackdown that killed thousands of people, drawing widespread condemnation from rights groups.</p><p>Reports have found that state security forces opened fire on crowds of protesters as the country was under an internet blackout.</p><p>On January 2 – one day before his military operation in Venezuela – Trump threatened to intervene on behalf of the protesters and “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">come to their rescue</a>“, although he ultimately declined to do so.</p><p>Some analysts have pointed out that the proposed strikes on Iran would do little to aid the protesters, but would align with longstanding US and Israeli goals of reducing Iran’s military capacity.</p><p>Tehran has argued that the protests included the violent targeting of security forces by armed groups, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of officers. It has also accused outside powers like the US and Israel of backing the antigovernment demonstrations.</p><p>Details around the protests and their crackdown remain difficult to verify, but Iranian officials have conceded that the government’s response killed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">thousands of people</a>.</p><h2 id=\"chaotic-wars-of-choice\">‘Chaotic wars of choice’</h2><p>The prospect that the US might intervene in Iran has prompted domestic pushback for Trump.</p><p>On Tuesday, a coalition of 25 advocacy groups called on the US Congress to assert greater oversight over Trump’s use of the military, in the face of his threats against Iran.</p><p>Their letter coincided with a new war powers <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/sjres104/BILLS-119sjres104is.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resolution</a>, introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Rand Paul on January 29.</p><p>The bill calls for the US military to be removed “from hostilities within or against… Iran”, unless authorised by Congress to take action.</p><p>The advocacy groups urged other Congress members to support the bill and ensure its passage.</p><p>“Iran has not attacked the United States nor threatened an offensive strike, and Congress has not authorized any military action against Iran,” the letter said.</p><p>“As a coalition of groups concerned with reckless military escalation, we urge Congress to represent its constituents, assert its Constitutional role and block an unauthorized war with Iran.”</p><p>The Center for International Policy, J Street, CODEPINK, Common Defense, and Just Foreign Policy were among the letter’s signatories.</p><p>Previous war powers resolutions, however, have failed to pass. In June, after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, lawmakers failed to advance <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">a similar bill</a>, which sought to prohibit further “unauthorized hostilities” against Iran.</p><p>Legislation to limit Trump’s military actions in Venezuela also <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-senate-defeats-war-powers-resolution-designed-to-rein-in-trump\">faced defeat</a> last month.</p><p>Ordinarily, Congress has the sole power to authorise war and similar military actions under the US Constitution. But critics say that presidents in recent decades have exerted ever-growing control over the country’s military.</p><p>Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council Action (NIAC), told Al Jazeera that a war powers resolution on Iran could face a tough path forward. His organisation was among the groups that signed Tuesday’s letter.</p><p>Still, Costello expressed optimism. He pointed out that Congress had passed such resolutions during Trump’s first term, once in 2019 and again in 2020, though the Republican president ultimately vetoed both bills.</p><p>Congress should take action again, Costello said, given the high stakes of a war between the US and Iran.</p><p>“The messiness and bloodiness of a new war with Iran, combined with the prospect of pressure from Congress on war powers resolutions, likely makes diplomatic off-ramps look much more attractive,” said Costello.</p><p>“While it is a high bar to pass war powers resolutions, Congress did so in Trump’s first term and forced him to exercise a rare veto. We hope they keep the pressure up and do what their voters want, which is to keep the US out of new, chaotic wars of choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He formerly served as a congressmemeber representing a different New Jersey district from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>In his <a href=\"https://x.com/Malinowski/status/2021244666063081981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> conceding defeat, Malinowski applauded Mejia, saying she deserves “unequivocal praise and credit for running a positive campaign and for inspiring so many voters on election day”.</p><p>But he nevertheless acknowledged the role AIPAC played in the results.</p><p>“The outcome of this race cannot be understood without also taking into account the massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,” Malinowski wrote.</p><p>“The threat unlimited dark money poses to our democracy is far more significant than the views of a single member of Congress on Middle East policy.”</p><h2 id=\"an-ineffective-strategy\">An ineffective strategy?</h2><p>With Mejia’s victory, many observers see AIPAC’s newest approach backfiring.</p><p>Malinowski has long been a supporter of US funding for Israel. But he has suggested <span>that Washington should not provide a “blank cheque” to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span></p><p>Mejia, in contrast, was the only candidate in the race to refer to Israel’s war in Gaza as a genocide.</p><p>She will face two Republicans in a special election in April, competing for a district that swung heavily Democratic in the 2024 vote.</p><p>While the Democratic Party’s progressive branch has long criticised AIPAC’s tactics, the campaign against Malinowski has brought criticism from what is considered its more moderate flank.</p><p>The advertisements bought by UDP did not specifically reference Malinowski’s support for Israel.</p><p>Instead, they attacked the former Congress member over domestic issues, including a 2019 vote in support of funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Representative Brad Schneider, the leader of the centrist caucus New Democrat Coalition, told the publication Politico that AIPAC’s strategy “raised eyebrows”.</p><p>He questioned the group for “spending against a candidate that would’ve been a New Dem and instead electing a far-left candidate”.</p><p>“Come on, guys, this is not what we were hoping for here,” said Schneider, who himself has enjoyed AIPAC support.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mark Pocan, a Democratic Congressman and longtime AIPAC critic, meanwhile called the strategy a “monumental failure”.</p><p>He said the spending showed that Democratic voters were becoming increasingly averse not just to AIPAC but to groups associated with it, like the UDP, as outrage over Israel’s genocide in Gaza continues to grow.</p><p>“Their money is so toxic that the very people they are trying to help are now hurt by their involvement, no matter how well disguised,” Pocan <a href=\"https://x.com/MarkPocan/status/2020505199761338478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>For its part, AIPAC sent a letter to supporters last week, downplaying the situation. It noted that, because Mejia is running in a special election, even if she wins in April, her term will only run through January of next year. She will face another Democratic primary in June before the general election.</p><p>It pledged to get involved in that race as well.</p><p>“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, her prospective win was an anticipated possibility,” AIPAC said in its email.</p><p>“Our ultimate focus for this race remains the June primary that will likely determine who represents this district for the full term beginning in January 2027.”</p><p><em><strong>Ali Harb contributed reporting. </strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
