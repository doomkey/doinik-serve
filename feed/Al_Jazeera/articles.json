Mourners spread flower petals, lit candles and somberly clapped in solidarity with the families.</p><p>At a ceremony on Tuesday to honour 19-year-old Sepehr Shokri, his father told gathered crowds, “Don’t talk of death, but of life and happiness”, as he said his son had laid down his life for his country.</p><p>The father had captured hearts last month after releasing an excruciating 12-minute video of himself searching for his son among numerous bodies of killed protesters laid out in the open at the courtyards and warehouses of the Kahrizak medical examiner’s office, on the outskirts of Tehran.</p><p>Some of the commemoration events took place in smaller cities and villages, like Abdanan in the western province of Ilam, where thousands had participated in protests last month. Multiple videos circulating online on Tuesday showed mourners running away in panic from the cemetery of the city as the sound of bullets rang out.</p><p>In the village of Chenar in the Asadabad area of western Hamadan province, people could be seen chanting “death to the dictator” as they marched to pay respects to a father and his 13-year-old son who were gunned down during the protests. Local reports said security forces deployed to the area with armoured vehicles, but officials have not commented.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threats-to-students-and-teachers\">‘Threats to students and teachers’</h2><p>The Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations, a non-governmental body, said on Wednesday that its call for school strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday had been backed by large numbers of teachers and students.</p><p>It said schools in the cities and towns of Shahr-e Rey, Baharestan, Pakdasht, Varamin, and Eslamshahr near Tehran were effectively shut due to the absence of students on Wednesday, while high school students in the town of Andisheh did not attend classes as a way to honour fellow students killed in the protests.</p><p>“These strikes occurred despite threats to students and teachers against striking from school principals, who themselves have been pressured by the Ministry of Education,” the group said, adding that at least 230 children and teenagers were killed last month.</p><p>Iran’s Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi confirmed to state media on Wednesday that some of the children and teenagers arrested during the protests remain incarcerated. He said “many” minors have been released without saying how many were arrested.</p><p>Ehsan Azimirad, the spokesman of the parliament’s education commission, said that 17 percent of the participants in the nationwide protests were teenagers, many of them students.</p><p>“I have even heard that in some schools, an entire class had participated in the riots,” he said, adding that in some provinces, up to 45 percent of protesters were under 20 years old. Officials have previously said that most of the protesters across the country were in their 20s.</p><p>This comes amid widespread reports, also disseminated by some local media outlets, of a heavy presence of security forces near or inside schools in the aftermath of the protests. Some families have been concerned about sending their children to school.</p><p>Universities and dormitories have also become focus points for security forces, with reports indicating that some people have had their phones searched while others have been summoned for questioning. University students have also been among the large number of people arrested from their homes since last month. Iranian authorities have not released overall arrest figures.</p><p>A number of Tehran University students peacefully demonstrated on campus on Wednesday to observe the 40th day since the height of the protest killings.</p><p>Last month, members of the Basij – an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary force – hung up a banner reading “Either death or Khamenei” at one of the entrances of the university, in support of 86-year-old Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">Ali Khamenei</a>. Iranian authorities have also displayed a vehicle burned by “rioters” near another entrance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"clashing-versions-of-events\">Clashing versions of events</h2><p>The Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">claims 3,117 people were killed</a> during the unrest, saying that “terrorists” and “rioters” were behind the violence, and were armed and funded by the United States and Israel, which organised an ultimately failed “coup”.</p><p>A list of victims published by the government last month said 690 of those killed were “terrorists”, with others either civilians or security forces. But it did not say who was classified under which category, or exactly where, how, when or by whom they were killed.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for the widespread use of lethal force against protesters, and have called for the release of those arrested, including doctors and nurses who tried to help wounded protesters. The UN Human Rights Council adopted a censure resolution against Iran’s establishment last month.</p><p>The US-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency</a> says it has verified 7,015 deaths during the unrest and is investigating more than 11,700 other cases. Mai Sato, the UN special rapporteur on Iran, said last month that more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed as information remains limited amid access constraints.</p><p>The Iranian government on Tuesday and Wednesday held its own version of the 40th day ceremonies at the Grand Mosalla of Tehran, a huge mosque in the downtown part of the capital. A number of officials, including government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, were in attendance.</p><p>On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader outlined his classification of the thousands killed during the nationwide protests, and divided them into several groups.</p><p>According to Khamenei, the first group are security forces, recognised as “the greatest of martyrs”.</p><p>The second were “passerby” civilians, he said. “Wherever this bullet [that killed them] may have come from, this incident occurred in the enemy’s sedition, and they are martyrs”.</p><p>“The third group are those who were deceived, who acted naively, who were inexperienced and went along with the seditionists,” Khamenei said, adding, “We ask forgiveness for them; they made mistakes”.</p><p>Outside of those three groups, however, were “corrupt individuals, seditionists, and coup plotters”, who Khamenei said “were consigned to hell”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The rise of Donald Trump and the surge of political rhetoric have created new dangers for the city’s new arrivals, who must navigate unprecedented challenges just to survive and find stability in a place they once believed would offer refuge.</p><p>Within this tense environment, communities of immigrants themselves are strained. New arrivals escaping conflicts in other countries now encounter friction with members of their own communities, as fear, suspicion, and competition over limited resources create divisions where solidarity once prevailed. Kelly, a woman fleeing Colombia, arrives in New York and confronts both a labyrinthine bureaucracy and the harsh realities of a city that has changed. Randall, a native-born son of immigrants, represents a contrasting vision: aligned with conservative politics, he sees New York’s evolving demographic as a challenge, embodying the tension between established residents and the newcomers.</p><p>Amid these struggles, Howard, Nuala, and Evelyn dedicate themselves to preserving the spaces that keep the city alive and accessible to everyone. Through community initiatives, mutual aid, and grassroots organising, they work to sustain what makes New York a true sanctuary, even as political and social pressures threaten to fragment the city.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 18 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">18 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

Havana has used its medical missions worldwide as a tool for international diplomacy.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>So why are some countries withdrawing from the programme that helps the host countries?</p><h2 id=\"why-is-guatemala-phasing-out-cuban-doctors\">Why is Guatemala phasing out Cuban doctors?</h2><p>Guatemala’s health ministry said in a statement<strong> </strong>that it would begin a “gradual termination” over this year.</p><p>“The phased withdrawal of the Cuban Medical Brigade stems from an analysis of the mission’s completion of its cycles,” the statement, originally in Spanish, said on February 13.</p><p>The statement added that the Cuban medical mission was meant to support Guatemala through the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, which devastated parts of Central America, overwhelmed local hospitals and left rural communities with almost no access to medical care.</p><p>“The Ministry of Health is developing a phased strategic replacement plan that includes hiring national personnel, strengthening incentives for hard-to-reach positions, strategic redistribution of human resources, and specialized technical support,” the statement said.</p><p>The Cuban mission in Guatemala comprises 412 medical workers, including 333 doctors.</p><p>The Central American country’s decision comes amid growing pressure from the United States, which wants to stop Cuban doctors from serving abroad.</p><p>The move aims to starve Cuba of much-needed revenue as a major share of the incomes earned by doctors goes to government coffers. Cuba has been facing severe power, food and medical shortages amid an oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration since January.</p><p>Guatemala is just one country which benefits from Cuban medical missions.</p><p>Over the past decades, Cuba has sent medical missions around the world, from Latin America to Africa and beyond. It began sending these missions shortly after the 1959 Cuban revolution brought Fidel Castro to power.</p><p>Castro’s communist government reversed many of the pro-business policies of Fulgencio Batista, the dictator backed by the US. The revolution ruptured ties between the two countries, with the US spy agency CIA trying several times unsuccessfully to topple Castro’s government.</p><p>Guatemala has moved closer to the US since the election of <a href=\"/news/2024/1/15/guatemalas-arevalo-becomes-president-on-anticorruption-plank-amid-chaos\">Bernardo Arevalo </a>as the president in January 2024. He has cooperated with US President Donald Trump’s administration. Last year, Guatemala <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/guatemala-agrees-to-increase-number-of-us-deportation-flights-it-accepts\">agreed to ramp up</a> the number of deportation flights it receives from the US. The US has deported thousands of immigrants without following due process to third countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador, which are headed by pro-Trump leaders.</p><p>In November 2018, shortly after Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro as president, Cuba announced its withdrawal from the country’s Cuba “Mais Medicos” (More Doctors) programme. Bolsonaro, who is known as Brazil’s Trump, had criticised the medical mission, deeming it “slave labour”. Bolsonaro is serving a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/brazils-supreme-court-orders-jair-bolsonaro-to-begin-prison-sentence\">27-year prison sentence</a> after he was convicted in September 2025 of plotting to stage a coup in order to retain power after his defeat in the 2022 presidential election.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-targeting-cuba-s-global-medical-missions\">Why is the US targeting Cuba’s global medical missions?</h2><p>The US has deemed Cuba’s foreign medical missions a form of “forced labour” and human trafficking, without any evidence, and has a goal of restricting the Cuban government’s access to its largest source of foreign income.</p><p>US efforts to curb Cuba’s medical missions are not new. Just last year, Washington imposed visa restrictions aimed at discouraging foreign governments from entering into medical cooperation agreements with Cuba.</p><p>In February last year, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would restrict visas targeting “forced labor linked to the Cuban labor export program”.</p><p>“This expanded policy applies to current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program, particularly Cuba’s overseas medical missions,” a statement on the US State Department’s website said.</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban origin, has been a vocal critic of Havana, and has pushed US policies in Latin America, including the military operation to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">abduct</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3. Under Trump, Washington has pushed its focus on Latin America as part of its Western Hemisphere pivot, which seeks to restore Washington’s preeminence in the region.</p><p>Since Maduro’s abduction, the US focus has turned towards Cuba. Senior US officials, particularly Rubio, hinted that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">Havana could be the next target</a> of Washington’s pressure campaign.</p><p>The US, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">in effect, cut off Venezuelan oil</a> shipments to Cuba as part of a new oil blockade. Havana has faced sweeping US sanctions for decades, and Cuba has since 2000 increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>The blockade has caused a fuel shortage and, in turn, <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/8/from-blackouts-to-food-shortages-how-us-blockade-is-crippling-life-in-cuba\">a severe energy crisis in Cuba</a>. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has imposed harsh emergency restrictions as a response.</p><p>This has renewed US pressure on countries to phase out Cuban medical missions.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-cuban-doctors-are-on-missions-abroad\">How many Cuban doctors are on missions abroad?</h2><p>More than 24,000 Cuban doctors are working in 56 countries worldwide. This includes Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Mexico; Africa, including Angola, Mozambique, Algeria; and the Middle East, including Qatar.</p><p>There have been occasional deployments in other countries. For instance, Italy received Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic to help overwhelmed hospitals in some of its hardest-hit regions.</p><p>Cuban doctors are crucial for Caribbean countries. They fill a significant gap in medical care amid a lack of trained medical professionals.</p><h2><span>Have countries resisted US pressure in the past?</span></h2><p>Caribbean countries <a href=\"/news/2025/3/15/why-are-caribbean-leaders-fighting-trump-to-keep-cuban-doctors\">hit back</a> in March 2025 against the US threats to restrict visas. “We could not get through the pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors,” Barbados’s Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a speech to the parliament.</p><p>“Out of the blue now, we have been called human traffickers because we hire technical people who we pay top dollar,” Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley said back then, adding that he was prepared to lose his US visa.</p><p data-start=\"4903\" data-end=\"5051\">“If the Cubans are not there, we may not be able to run the service,” Saint Vincent and the Grenadines then-Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. “I will prefer to lose my visa than to have 60 poor and working people die.”</p><p>In August 2025, the US announced that it was revoking the visas of Brazilian, African and Caribbean officials over their ties to Cuba’s programme that sends doctors abroad.</p><p>It named Brazilian Ministry of Health officials, Mozart Julio Tabosa Sales and Alberto Kleiman, who had their visas revoked for working on Brazil’s Mais Medicos, or “More Doctors” programme, which was created in 2013.</p><p>Some countries are now finding ways around the pressure from Washington. For instance, this month Guyana announced that it would start paying doctors directly, rather than through the Cuban government.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"1028\">A parade of Western leaders to Beijing, including French President Emmanuel Macron in December,  and more recently, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the United Kingdom’s Keir Starmer, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz planning a visit later this month, might suggest a great geopolitical realignment in the making. But to interpret these visits as a strategic defection from the United States is to mistake tactical adaptation for fundamental realignment. What we are witnessing is the pursuit of economic pragmatism alongside enduring security alliances, a balancing act that China’s charm offensive has not fundamentally disrupted.</p><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"1028\">The initial phase of President Donald Trump’s second term saw US allies pursuing a delicate balancing act, engaging in strategic hedging by maintaining economic ties with China while aligning strategically with Washington against perceived threats from Beijing and Moscow. However, Trump’s prolonged trade wars, rough treatment of European and North American partners, and coercive threats shattered illusions of a united Western front. This disorientation soon found its voice in Canadian PM Carney’s Davos speech.</p><p data-start=\"1539\" data-end=\"1890\">He declared the end of the US-led, rules-based international order, framing the situation not as a transition but a “rupture”, where “the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must”. This crystallised the disillusionment, creating political and diplomatic cracks that Beijing was swift to explore and, if possible, exploit.</p><p data-start=\"1892\" data-end=\"2559\">Against this backdrop, the diplomatic pivot to Beijing reveals its true meaning: Western leaders are not embracing China but pursuing what Carney termed a “third path” for middle powers, a quest for “strategic autonomy” in energy, critical minerals, and supply chains to avoid becoming collateral in great power coercion. These visits focus on economic diversification and risk mitigation, not replacing one patron with another. The evidence from these visits reveals the severe limits of Beijing’s courtship. Joint statements emphasise practical cooperation but avoid any fundamental strategic shift, underscoring their transactional, not transformational, nature.</p><p data-start=\"2561\" data-end=\"3716\">This pattern highlights a critical reality: economic pragmatism confronts an immovable priority, foundational security. A stark demonstration of this priority came when Australia moved to reclaim the Port of Darwin from its Chinese lessee, despite the port’s profitability and official reviews finding no security threat. That the formal assessments found no immediate security risk only reinforces the point: in moments of strategic uncertainty, perception and alliance alignment can outweigh technocratic evaluations, signalling where ultimate loyalties lie.</p><p data-start=\"2561\" data-end=\"3716\">In alliance politics, signalling often matters as much as assessment. Even with deep and structurally significant European Union-China trade, European allies safeguard US intelligence sharing and defence commitments. Despite rhetorical tensions with Washington, European states have increased defence spending towards NATO’s 2 percent benchmark and deepened military coordination over Ukraine, reinforcing the institutional bedrock of transatlantic security. Their discontent fuels appeals for restraint, not support for China-led confrontation, revealing a gap rooted in deeper issues than trade.</p><p data-start=\"3718\" data-end=\"4693\">Beneath the transactional politics lies a civilisational schism, a chasm that neither diplomatic niceties nor economic pragmatism can bridge. For Europe, Canada and Australia, a legacy of shared Western identity permeates elite consciousness, fostering assumptions of cultural affinity amplified by visceral fears that China’s state-driven capitalist model poses a systemic threat to the liberal-democratic order. This identity is not merely cultural but institutional, embedded in NATO interoperability, Five Eyes intelligence integration and decades of joint operational planning. This unease transcends protectionism, representing an existential struggle to preserve institutional and ideological hegemony. The double standard is revealing: the US’s predatory behaviour is framed as a regrettable aberration, while China’s trade practices are cast as an inherent systemic challenge. Consequently, trade disputes with Washington fade against this deeper dissonance.</p><p data-start=\"4695\" data-end=\"5270\">For key Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, the US alliance is foundational to their sovereignty. Their post-war identities were forged under US security patronage, with integrated defence systems and political cultures creating deep bonds. To Tokyo and Seoul, China’s rise stirs historical anxieties about falling into a new sphere of influence. Thus, even as South Korea’s chip giants lobbied against decoupling from China, they reinforced joint research with the US, viewing the cost of ties with Washington as trivial against the risk of Chinese regional dominance.</p><p data-start=\"5272\" data-end=\"5768\">This loyalty is most evident in intelligence sharing. For Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the Five Eyes network, rooted in Allied World War II code-breaking, represents a strategic DNA common with Washington. Real-time intelligence sharing builds trust beyond mere profits. Australia knows China could disrupt its iron ore exports, yet it still bans Huawei from 5G networks. This reflects a civilisational kinship, a bond no Chinese trade deal can replace, as defiance would risk strategic suicide.</p><p data-start=\"5770\" data-end=\"6391\">This deep-seated allegiance sets the non-negotiable boundaries within which economic hedging occurs. German automakers may oppose US tech bans, Australian universities may host Confucius Institutes, and Japan may route exports through Chinese factories. They may even lend rhetorical support to China’s WTO appeals against US tariffs. Yet, when asked to side with Beijing against Washington on upholding the rules-based order, these allies hesitate, consistently choosing alliance management over systemic defence. The calculus remains clear: trade with China aids prosperity, but an alliance with the US ensures survival.</p><p data-start=\"6393\" data-end=\"7313\">Thus persists an unbroken chain of allegiance, a case of what might be called “calculated hypocrisy”. By this, I mean a pattern in which allies publicly criticise Washington’s coercive tactics while privately reinforcing the security architecture that depends upon them. Allies openly critique Washington’s coercive tactics while quietly sheltering under its security umbrella, invoking a rules-based order they expect China to obey, yet hesitate to enforce when the US bends the rules. Despite US economic uncertainty and Chinese clean-tech dominance, Washington’s alliance network remains its key advantage. Decades of military drills, academic exchanges, and shared values create resilience that Chinese chequebook diplomacy cannot crack. For all its dominance in rare earth refining and its growing strength across AI supply chains and ecosystems, China still lacks the trust to turn partners into strategic allies.</p><p data-start=\"7315\" data-end=\"7951\">Ultimately, the visits to Beijing signal a broader ailment: the failure of coercive US policy to maintain alliance unity. Yet engagement with China is no cure. The “third path” remains an uncertain experiment, constrained by a hard truth: while allies seek autonomy, they lack a realistic alternative to US security protection. The emerging order will be defined by this tense balance, assertive hedging, not decisive realignment. They may distance themselves from US unilateralism, but they are not entering Beijing’s orbit. Their cautious, pragmatic course reveals the great illusion: this is a story of resilience, not realignment.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8324\">The success of this manoeuvring depends on resolving a core contradiction: pursuing strategic autonomy while relying on a security protectorate that often undermines it. Coercion may undermine cohesion, but structural integration preserves it. Hence, the “third path” is less a stable course than a perpetual, perilous balancing act over the abyss of great-power rivalry.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8324\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But the devastating injury has put a spotlight on the importance of bindings, which hold boots to the skis and remain some of the oldest technology in the sport.</p><p>Officials told The Associated Press news agency that a binding system designed to automatically release skis when a racer like Vonn loses control is still in the drawing-board phase after years of stalled discussions.</p><p>“Unfortunately, sometimes it does take horrific accidents to shine even more of a light on what can be done,” said Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the US Ski and Snowboard Association. “It’s an area we can’t be competitive in; we’ve all got to be in it together with our different country counterparts and FIS [the International Ski and Snowboard Federation].”</p><p>Bindings haven’t significantly changed in their basic design for half a century: Once a skier steps in toes first and then locks in by stepping down with the heel, pressure needs to be applied for the system to release the boot. Less-skilled skiers have bindings that release more easily to avoid leg injuries. The higher the skill level and the more serious the skiing, the more the bindings are cranked down to keep elite racers on their skis.</p><p>Few were surprised that Vonn’s skis did not release. The question is whether they should have.</p><h2 id=\"a-smarter-binding\">A ‘smarter’ binding</h2><p>A “smart binding” system based on an algorithm and designed to automatically release when a skier loses control “would have surely” helped prevent Vonn from breaking her leg, said Peter Gerdol, the FIS women’s race director at the Olympics and on the World Cup circuit.</p><p>“That’s exactly what the system will be designed to do,” Gerdol told AP. “Her skis would have definitely popped off. … We’ve seen a lot of other cases in which the bindings don’t open and it results in knee issues, especially when the still-attached ski acts as a lever, either on the net or on the snow or on a gate or on any other obstacle. The leg becomes blocked, and the knee gives out.”</p><p>Nine days before her Olympic crash in Italy, Vonn tore the ACL in her left knee in a crash in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. She ended up in the safety nets with her skis still attached.</p><p>A smart binding system could borrow technology from the safety air bag system that became mandatory for skiers this season in the speed events.</p><p>“It’s still going to take time to develop, but the idea is that the binding would be triggered by the same algorithm that prompts the airbag to inflate,” Gerdol said. “The heel piece would slide back, and the athlete’s skis would pop off.”</p><h2 id=\"algorithm-needs-to-be-adapted\">Algorithm needs to be adapted</h2><p>Dainese and its sister company, D-Air Lab, spent years developing an algorithm for airbags to inflate under skiers’ racing suits after creating a similar system for motorcycle racing.</p><p>In coordination with the FIS, Dainese is sharing the airbag algorithm with top binding suppliers, such as Look, Tyrolia, Salomon, Atomic and Marker to adapt the formula to release skis.</p><p>Releasing skis is potentially more dangerous than inflating an airbag. Elite skiers are sometimes capable of spectacular recoveries after flying into the air, and they also can often use their skis to brake before slamming into safety fences.</p><p>“It’s a very complicated project,” said Marco Pastore, a Dainese representative on the circuit for the airbag system. “If you release a binding, you’ve got to be absolutely sure you do it at the right moment. For the airbag, you can look at the rotations and the entire body position. But with the bindings, you’ve got to examine how the feet move, what the trajectory of the skis is, plus a series of other variables.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4322089\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4322089\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039600194520-1771410562.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"In this image taken from video provided by Olympic Broadcasting Services, OBS, United States' Lindsey Vonn lays on the course after crashing during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">American Lindsey Vonn lies on the course after crashing during an alpine women’s downhill race at the 2026 Winter Olympics[Screengrab/Olympic Broadcasting Services via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"finances-an-issue-for-complicated-safety-projects\">Finances an issue for complicated safety projects</h2><p>While the FIS wants to coordinate the project, issues remain over who will pay for it.</p><p>“These are very costly projects, and to be honest, Dainese has not made much” from the airbags, Pastore said. “Right now, it’s costing us money. Everyone wants these great things, but at the end of the day, someone has to pay for it.”</p><p>Sasha Rearick, the head coach of the United States men’s ski team from 2008 to 2018, recalls discussions about bindings when he was in charge of the World Cup coaches working group nearly a decade ago.</p><p>“The problem is that Dainese is the one who’s putting in the money and all the investments,” Rearick said. “So if they’re sharing it with the binding companies, the binding companies now need to invest heavily, and it probably costs [a lot].”</p><p>Head racing director Rainer Salzgeber, who is involved in the project via Tyrolia, added: “It’s already a lot.” He suggested a simpler and quicker solution for crashes like Vonn’s: gate panels that give way.</p><p>Markus Waldner, the men’s World Cup and Olympics race director, said earlier this season that FIS is “working with biomechanists and manufacturers to refine boot and binding standards to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic edge catches at high speed.”</p><p>Still, Gerdol suggested the project could be anywhere from two to six years away from being implemented.</p><h2 id=\"will-ski-racers-use-the-technology\">Will ski racers use the technology?</h2><p>To avoid skis popping off, ski technicians crank up racers’ bindings so they are virtually locked in.</p><p>Leo Mussi, the ski technician for American downhillers Bryce Bennett and Sam Morse, said he sets his racers’ bindings at up to 200kg (440lb) of pressure – more than double what a store-bought binding is even capable of.</p><p>Austrian racer Marco Schwarz suffered a serious knee injury in a December 2023 crash during the Bormio Alpine Ski World Cup downhill in Italy. His skis didn’t release as he slid into the safety netting.</p><p>“It’s tough to say,” he said of whether the skis popping off would’ve saved him from injury, and he added that he isn’t sure about changing things.</p><p>“The best way is to keep it simple,” Schwarz said. “I don’t want to push too much into more technology.”</p><p>Nina O’Brien, an American who had to endure four surgeries after a gruesome compound fracture at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, said she didn’t fault any equipment issues for her crash and credited her technician.</p><p>“Regardless if I’ve worn the skis that morning, clicked out and gotten a coffee,” O’Brien said, “when I step back in, he checks them to make sure they’re perfect.”</p><h2 id=\"advances-in-ski-racing-safety-have-been-slow\">Advances in ski racing safety have been slow</h2><p>The airbag system was first tested on the World Cup circuit in 2013 and only this season became mandatory for the speed events of downhill and super-G. In between, some skiers said the bags hindered their aerodynamics, were uncomfortable to wear or could actually cause injuries.</p><p>Safety issues became more of a pressing issue recently when Italian skier Matteo Franzoso died from a head injury caused in a crash during preseason training in Chile.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it always takes something serious to happen for people to say, ‘No. Now we need to do something,’” Pastore said.</p><p>This is also the first season in which a cut-resistant undergarment is required for all World Cup and Olympic events.</p><p>There is plenty of room for safety advancements. While the smart bindings system is being developed, Rearick – now the director of Apex 2100, an international ski academy in Tignes, France – suggested addressing the racing suits.</p><p>“Make one suit of material for everybody that’s a little bit warmer, that’s a little bit slower, that’s cut-proof,” Rearick said. “That will make the sport a lot safer for everybody.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
