Trump’s opposition to electric vehicles has contributed to a <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/5/tesla-shares-slide-as-ceo-musk-and-president-trump-have-a-public-face-off\">strained relationship</a> with Musk.</p><p>Despite the downward trends in sales, investors have generally remained optimistic about Tesla and Musk’s ambitious plans to make the company a leader in driverless robotaxi services and humanoid robots for homes.</p><p>Reflecting that optimism, Tesla stock finished 2025 up about 11 percent.</p><p>Tesla has also recently introduced two less expensive electric vehicle models, the Model Y and Model 3, meant to compete with cheaper Chinese models for sale in Europe and Asia.</p><p>Musk entered 2026 as the wealthiest person in the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It is widely believed that the public offering of his rocket company, SpaceX, set for later this year, could make the 54-year-old the world’s first trillionaire.</p><p>In November, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/17/tesla-proposed-1-trillion-pay-package-for-musk-faces-investor-push-back\">historic pay package</a> of nearly $1 trillion if ambitious performance targets were met.</p><p>Musk scored another huge win in December,when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s ruling, awarding him a $55bn pay package that had been paused since 2018.</p><p>Conversely, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its licence to sell cars in California after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about the safety of its driverless taxis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The definition provides 11 examples of anti-Semitism, six of which involve Israel.</p><p>They include “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” and “applying double standards” to Israel.</p><p>“I think it’s wonderful that Mayor Mamdani took measures on day one to reinforce our rights to free speech, which included our right to criticize and oppose Israeli apartheid and genocide,” said YL Al-Sheikh, a Palestinian-American writer active in the Democratic Socialists of America.</p><p>“The IHRA being implemented as government policy isn’t about combatting antisemitism but about stifling dissent and this should be something all Americans oppose.”</p><h2 id=\"israel-weighs-in\">Israel weighs in</h2><p>The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs decried Mamdani’s moves on Friday, saying that the newly inaugurated mayor is showing “his true face”.</p><p>“This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire,” it said in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>Separately, Amichai Chikli, Israel’s minister of diaspora affairs, deployed Islamophobic language to criticise Mamdani’s decision.</p><p>He called the mayor a “Hamas sympathiser” and drew a connection between him and the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.</p><p>“When a Muslim Brotherhood Islamist whose slogan is ‘Globalize the Intifada’ takes control of New York City or London, these are exactly the decisions you get,” Chikli wrote on X.</p><p>Neither Mamdani nor Khan has any known connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Issa said the intense Israeli response is not about the mayor’s policy moves but is rather aimed at controlling the narrative.</p><p>“Israel’s main approach – at the highest level, at the level of the Foreign Ministry – has been to push for the criminalisation of protected speech through these warped definitions of anti-Semitism like the IHRA,” she said.</p><p>“Since they’re losing in the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/new-poll-shows-plunging-us-public-support-for-israels-war-on-gaza\">court of public opinion</a>, the response now is to push for the criminalisation of dissent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Issa also called Chikli’s attack on Mamdani “blatant Islamophobia, racism and disinformation”.</p><p>“They’re trying to promote these accusations that have no basis in reality whatsoever,” Issa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But from their perspective, any support for Palestinians, any opposition to Israel’s genocide or the conduct of its military – whether in Gaza or the West Bank, over the last two years, over the last decades – none of that is acceptable.”</p><p>Al-Sheikh said it was “absurd” that Israel is trying to impose its preferences on local policies in New York.</p><p>“Even Americans who aren’t Palestinian or pro Palestine can see this is strange and inhibits our rights,” Al-Sheikh said.</p><p>“It’s also weirdly counterproductive on Israel’s part since it only makes Mamdani look better. A single policy paper that said you can’t criticise a country was repealed and now they claim it is the end of the world, but ‘you should be allowed to criticise any country you want’ is the universal American position.”</p><p>Israel was not alone, however, in denouncing Mamdani’s actions. The administration of President Donald Trump also issued a warning to the Mamdani administration.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said her office would be vigilant “to ANY AND ALL violations of religious liberties” <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-citys-mayor\">in New York</a>.</p><p>“We will investigate, sue, and indict as needed,” Dhillon wrote in a social media post.</p><p>Palestine solidarity activists often stress that criticising Israeli abuses should not be conflated with attacking Judaism.</p><h2 id=\"mamdani-s-rise\">Mamdani’s rise</h2><p>Mamdani has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies against Palestinians, prompting accusations of anti-Semitism from Israel’s supporters.</p><p>But he has repeatedly promised to protect Jewish residents. During his inauguration ceremony, he pledged to continue the Mayor’s Office to Combat Anti-Semitism (MOCA), an Adams-era development, and he told reporters his administration would “celebrate and cherish” Jewish New Yorkers.</p><p>The new mayor, 34, took the oath of office on a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-city-mayor\">copy of the Quran</a> at the turn of the new year, becoming the first Muslim mayor of America’s largest city.</p><p>The Democratic socialist, who formerly served as a state legislator, had minimal name recognition when he first announced his candidacy late in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But he steadily grew his base of support with a message focused on affordability and housing.</p><p>Last June, he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic nomination, in one of the most stunning political upsets in recent US history.</p><p>Mamdani then defeated Cuomo again in the general elections in November, after the ex-governor relaunched his campaign as an independent with Trump’s support.</p><p>Adams was elected as a Democrat in 2021, but his administration faced numerous scandals during its four-year term, including accusations that Adams had entered into a quid pro quo with representatives from the Turkish government.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, Trump’s Justice Department dropped the federal bribery charges he faced. Adams had launched a re-election campaign as an independent, but he ultimately suspended his bid and backed Cuomo before the elections.</p><p>While Mamdani’s platform was largely focused on local issues, some of his supporters <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">have argued</a> that his vocal support for Palestinian rights helped propel his campaign amid the growing anger at Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Only one of the infections involved a fully vaccinated person.</p><p>Measles, a highly infectious and sometimes deadly virus, was declared eliminated in the US more than 25 years ago. But the past year has presented increasing challenges to maintaining that status.</p><p>Diseases are generally declared eliminated when there is no local transmission in a given region, although cases can still be “imported” from abroad.</p><p>The US’s elimination status is largely credited to the success of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>In 1963, the first measles vaccine was licensed in the US, and by 1971, the combination MMR vaccine was unveiled to protect against the three illnesses at once. Two shots are typically recommended to achieve full vaccination status.</p><p>Initially, in 1978, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set 1982 as a deadline to achieve the elimination of measles in the country. It missed that target by nearly 18 years, reaching elimination status in 2000.</p><p>But vaccine hesitancy has been blamed for allowing the virus to spread in the US, both then and now.</p><p>While the death rate for measles is relatively low, its infection rate is high. The CDC estimates that, if one person has the virus, they could infect nine out of every 10 people around them.</p><p>The World Health Organization says that, for every 1,000 reported cases, there are about two to three deaths.</p><p>Children are especially vulnerable. Complications can include high fever, hearing or vision loss and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.</p><p>Typically, medical professionals recommend children be vaccinated early in their lives, receiving their first dose before 15 months of age and their second by age six. The vaccine is widely accepted as safe.</p><p>But vaccine scepticism has been on the rise in the US, with critics blaming, in part, policies implemented under the administration of President Donald Trump.</p><p>According to CDC data, the MMR vaccination rate in the US was 95.2 percent among kindergarteners during the 2019-2020 school year.</p><p>That number, however, tumbled to 92.7 percent by the 2023-2024 school year, representing a difference of 280,000 kindergarteners.</p><p>2025 represented a high-water mark in the resurgence of the measles virus. The CDC reported 2,065 cases of measles last year, the most since 1991 — and more than seven times the rate of 2024, when only 285 cases were reported.</p><p>One of the biggest outbreaks took place in Texas, where three people died from the virus, with the first reported last February. Prior to that incident, no death had been reported from measles in the US <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/us-reports-first-measles-death-since-2015\">since 2015</a>.</p><p>In the wake of that death, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr <a href=\"/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak\">encouraged</a> vaccination, <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing</a> on social media, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”</p><p>But Kennedy, who is not a medical professional, has since expressed views that appeared to discourage the vaccine’s use.</p><p>In late April, for instance, he told NewsNation, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles.”</p><p>Experts, however, have denounced that claim as false. While the rubella part of the vaccine was developed using a cell culture that came from an elective abortion in the 1960s, no fetal tissue has been used since, nor is there any fetal issue in the vaccine.</p><p>Kennedy has also spread unfounded claims that purport to link vaccination to autism, despite widespread outcry from the medical community.</p><p>In South Carolina, the current measles outbreak is concentrated in the northwest. The South Carolina Department of Public Health says that the reported infections are largely in children under the age of 17.</p><p>One Democratic candidate running in the state’s 2026 midterm elections, paediatrician Annie Andrews, has made combating the outbreak a central part of her campaign. She hopes to unseat incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, in November’s vote.</p><p>“If you told me back in medical school that someday I would be running for the Senate and my campaign slogan would be ‘It’s me or the measles’ I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT HAVE BELIEVED YOU,” she wrote on social media on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The targets of Sturdivant’s alleged plans were a grocery store and a fast-food restaurant in Mint Hill.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“ Countless lives were saved here,” US Attorney Russ Ferguson said at a news conference.</p><p>“On New Year’s Eve, everyone is at the grocery store. We’re all buying the things we need to celebrate. And we could have had a significant, significant loss of life, a significant injury here.”</p><p>Ferguson explained that Sturdivant was arrested on New Year’s Eve, the day of his planned attack. The 18-year-old has been charged with “attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation”, and he made his first court appearance on Friday.</p><p>Sturdivant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to Ferguson.</p><p>But during his news conference, Ferguson, an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared to voice frustration with the court system for failing to approve an earlier effort to detain Sturdivant on mental health grounds.</p><p>“ I think it is notable that, as part of their efforts, the FBI took Mr Sturdivant to a state magistrate judge to try to have him involuntarily committed,” Ferguson said.</p><p>“And that was because he had threatened not only other people’s lives, but in the process said that he planned to die by a policeman shooting him. So he had threatened other people’s lives and self-harm, but the state magistrate judge denied involuntary commitment.”</p><p>Authorities later specified that the hearing with the magistrate judge took place on Monday, days before his arrest. Sturdivant, they said, turned 18 last month.</p><h2 id=\"authorities-detail-arrest\">Authorities detail arrest</h2><p>During Friday’s news conference, officials said this week’s arrest was part of a multiyear effort to investigate Sturdivant, whom they described as a “prolific social media user”.</p><p>The suspect had previously been an employee at a local Burger King in North Carolina.</p><p>James Barnacle, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s North Carolina field office, said the suspect first came to the bureau’s attention in 2022, after he tried to contact the armed group ISIL (ISIS) through social media.</p><p>The US considers ISIL a foreign terrorist organisation and has conducted <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/trump-says-us-launched-large-scale-attacks-on-isil-in-syria\">numerous military operations</a> in the Middle East — and one <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/26/us-releases-missile-launch-video-after-northwest-nigeria-strike\">recently in Nigeria</a> — on the premise of combating the group.</p><p>Barnacle alleged that Sturdivant received instructions to knock on doors and attack people with hammers, but his initial attempts were thwarted by his family. He was about 14 years old at the time.</p><p>“ No charges were filed at that time,” Barnacle said. “He underwent psychological care, of which I don’t know the details.”</p><p>Then, in December, Barnacle said the FBI discovered that Sturdivant had returned to social media and posted threatening messages.</p><p>He had also allegedly made contact with two undercover officers: one from the New York Police Department and the second a covert agent with the FBI.</p><p>“Within just a few days, Sturdivant direct-messaged the online covert employee with a picture of two hammers and a knife,” Barnacle said. “The message was significant since in recent years an ISIS propaganda magazine promoted the use of knives to conduct terrorist attacks in Western countries.”</p><p>Barnacle added that later messages contained a loyalty oath to ISIL and a request for help obtaining firearms.</p><p>“The JTTF [Joint Terrorism Task Force] collected evidence showing he turned his back on his country and his fellow citizens by pledging allegiance to ISIS with the intent of becoming a martyr,” Barnacle said of the 18-year-old.</p><p>“We allege Sturdivant was willing to sacrifice himself by committing a terrorist attack, using knives and a hammer to support the murder, torture and extreme violence that ISIS represents.”</p><p>An FBI search of his home reportedly recovered hammers and knives hidden under Sturdivant’s bed, as well as notes allegedly detailing his attack plans.</p><p>“I could tell you the FBI had 24/7 surveillance on this subject, all hours of night, Christmas Day, Christmas Eve,” Barnacle said. He described the suspect’s targets as “Jews, Christians and LGBTQ individuals”.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel quickly promoted Sturdivant’s arrest on social media, praising his bureau and its partners for “undoubtedly saving lives”.</p><p>The arrest comes one year after a pickup truck driver intentionally rammed his vehicle down Bourbon Street, New Orleans’s famed entertainment district, in a deadly New Year’s Day attack.</p><p>Fourteen people were killed, and authorities recovered an ISIL flag in the truck.</p><p>But critics have questioned the use of undercover agents to make “terrorism-related” arrests with some defence lawyers arguing that agents have encouraged suspects to make incriminating statements or take actions they otherwise would not have.</p><p>Lawyers for the 18-year-old have yet to publicly comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Local media reported that their removal was due to “a record of misconduct and failure to properly handle recent student protests”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking at a ceremony in Tehran on Thursday to mark the assassination of senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/who-was-qassem-soleimani-irans-irgcs-quds-force-leader\">Qassem Soleimani</a> in a US drone attack five years ago, Pezeshkian also took the opportunity to emphasise his government’s commitment to economic reforms and addressing corruption.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We are determined to eradicate all forms of rent-seeking, smuggling and bribery,” he told attendees. “Those who benefit from these rents will resist and try to create obstacles, but we will continue on this path.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We must all stand together to solve the people’s problems and defend the rights of the oppressed and the underprivileged,” he added.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Protecting people’s livelihoods is a “red line” for his government, he declared.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mass-protests-have-happened-before\">Mass protests have happened before</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Mass protests erupted across Iran in 2022 after the death in custody of 22-year-old <a href=\"/news/2022/10/7/iranian-coroner-denies-mahsa-amini-died-from-blows-to-body\">Mahsa Amini</a>, who was arrested in September that year for not wearing her hijab correctly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Demonstrations first broke out after Amini’s funeral in the western city of Saqqez when women ripped off their headscarves in solidarity with the dead woman before they <a href=\"/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran\">spread across much of the country</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Iran’s brutal response to the unrest involved the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of people, the extensive use of tear gas, the firing of live ammunition and, according to human rights organisations, the unlawful deaths of hundreds of people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"/news/2024/3/9/iran-condemns-un-experts-report-on-protest-crackdown-as-false-biased\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A 2024</a> investigation by United Nations experts into the government’s response found that its actions amounted to “crimes against humanity”, a claim rejected by authorities in Tehran as “false” and “biased”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The so-called morality police were briefly suspended in December 2022 after the protests before being <a href=\"/news/2023/7/16/irans-morality-police-return-as-authorities-enforce-hijab-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/news/2023/7/16/irans-morality-police-return-as-authorities-enforce-hijab-rule\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">reinstated</a> the following year.

He posted on his Truth Social platform: “If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Thursday, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/fight-against-darkness-foreign-ministry-appears-to-back-iranian-protests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/fight-against-darkness-foreign-ministry-appears-to-back-iranian-protests/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Farsi social media account</a> pre-revolutionary Iranian images of a lion and a sun with the lion’s paw resting on an hourglass featuring the country’s current flag. The post read: “The rise of Iranian lions and lionesses to fight against darkness”, continuing: “Light triumphs over darkness.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In June, Israel and the US launched attacks on Iran during a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12-day</a> war between Iran and Israel.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While that conflict ended with what the US claimed was a decisive strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/could-israel-be-planning-a-second-war-on-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speculation</a> that Israel has been readying itself for further strikes has continued.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This week, the US news website <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/31/netanyahu-trump-iran-strikes-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Axios</a> reported that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed further strikes on Iran as well as potentially targeting Tehran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p><p>Responding on social media, Pezeshkian <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/irans-president-answer-attack-harsh-apparent-response-trump-128776925\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote</a>: “Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
