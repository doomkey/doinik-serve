Their chants echoed past murals that do not merely decorate the city, but testify to its troubled past.</p><p data-start=\"1148\" data-end=\"1509\">Along the Falls Road, Irish republican murals sit beside Palestinian ones. The International Wall, once a rolling canvas of global struggles, has become known as the Palestinian wall. Poems by the late Palestinian writer Refaat Alareer, killed in an Israeli air strike in December 2023, run across its length. Images sent by Palestinian artists have been painted by local hands.</p><p data-start=\"1511\" data-end=\"1884\">More recently, new words have appeared on Belfast’s famed walls. “Blessed are those who hunger for justice.” Painted alongside long-familiar images of Irish republican prisoners like Bobby Sands are new names now written into the city’s political conscience: the four pro-Palestinian activists currently on hunger strike in British prisons, their bodies weakening as the days stretch on.</p><p data-start=\"1886\" data-end=\"2100\">“This is not a city that will ever accept any attempt to silence our voice or our right to protest or our right to stand up for human rights,” said Patricia McKeown, a trade union activist who spoke at the protest.</p><p data-start=\"2102\" data-end=\"2353\">“These young people are being held unjustly and in ridiculous conditions – and they have taken the ultimate decision to express their views … and most particularly on what’s happening to people in Palestine – why would we not support that?” she asked.</p><h2 id=\"a-hunger-strike-reaches-belfast\">A hunger strike reaches Belfast</h2><p data-start=\"2392\" data-end=\"2852\">The protest in Belfast is part of a growing international campaign urging the British government to intervene as the health of four detainees deteriorates behind prison walls. All are affiliated with Palestine Action and are being held on remand while awaiting trial, a process campaigners say could keep them imprisoned for more than a year before their cases are heard. With legal avenues exhausted, supporters say the hunger strike has become a last resort.</p><p>The Palestine Action members are being held over their <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/palestine-action-what-has-the-group-done-as-it-faces-a-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged involvement in break-ins</a> at the United Kingdom subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Filton near Bristol, where equipment was reportedly damaged, and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were sprayed with red paint. The prisoners deny the charges against them, which include burglary and violent disorder.</p><p data-start=\"2854\" data-end=\"3050\"><a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/who-are-the-palestine-action-hunger-strikers\">The prisoners</a> are demanding release on bail, an end to what they describe as interference with their mail and reading materials, access to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action. In July, the British government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned Palestine Action under a controversial anti-terrorism law.</p><p data-start=\"3052\" data-end=\"3359\">Heba Muraisi is on day 61 without food. Teuta Hoxha is on day 55. Kamran Ahmed on day 54. Lewie Chiaramello on day 41. Hoxha and Ahmed have already been hospitalised. Campaigners describe it as the largest hunger strike in Britain since 1981, one they say is explicitly inspired by the Irish hunger strikes.</p><p data-start=\"3361\" data-end=\"3739\">In 1981, Irish Republican Army and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten men died, including their leader, Bobby Sands, who was elected to the British parliament during the strike. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance, but behind the scenes, the government ultimately sought a way out as public opinion shifted.</p><p data-start=\"3741\" data-end=\"3918\">One prisoner, 29-year-old Martin Hurson, died on the 46th day. Others, including Raymond McCreesh, Francis Hughes, Michael Devine and Joe McDonnell, died between days 59 and 61. Sands died after 66 days on a hunger strike.</p><p data-start=\"3920\" data-end=\"4002\">Sue Pentel, a member of Jews for Palestine Ireland, remembers that period vividly.</p><p data-start=\"4004\" data-end=\"4224\">“I was here during the hunger strike,” she said. “I went through the hunger strikes, marched, demonstrated, held meetings, protested, so I remember the callous brutality of the British government letting 10 hungers die.”</p><p data-start=\"4226\" data-end=\"4444\">“The words of Bobby Sands, which are ‘Our revenge will be the laughter of our children’. And we raised our families here, and they’re the same people, this new generation who are standing in solidarity with Palestine.”</p><h2 id=\"if-this-continues-some-will-die\">‘If this continues, some will die’</h2><p data-start=\"4486\" data-end=\"4680\">Standing beneath a mural of Bobby Sands, Pat Sheehan fears history is edging dangerously close to repeating itself. He spent 55 days on a hunger strike before it was called off on October 3, 1981.</p><p data-start=\"4682\" data-end=\"4819\">“I was the longest on that hunger strike when it came to an end in 1981, so in theory I would have been the next person to die,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"4821\" data-end=\"4918\">By that stage, he said, his liver was failing. His eyesight had gone. He vomited bile constantly.</p><p data-start=\"4920\" data-end=\"5105\">“Once you pass 40 days, you’re entering the danger zone,” Sheehan said. “Physically, the hunger strikers must be very weak now for those who have been on hunger strike for over 50 days.”</p><p data-start=\"5107\" data-end=\"5266\">“Mentally, if they have prepared properly to go on hunger strike, their psychological strength will increase the longer the hunger strike goes on.”</p><p data-start=\"5268\" data-end=\"5349\">“I think if it continues, inevitably some of the hunger strikers are going to die.”</p><p data-start=\"5351\" data-end=\"5581\">Sheehan, who now represents West Belfast as an MLA for Sinn Fein, believes that Palestine Action-linked hunger strikers are political prisoners, adding that people in Ireland understand Palestine in a way few Western countries do.</p><p data-start=\"5583\" data-end=\"5791\">“Ireland is probably the one country in Western Europe where there’s almost absolute support for the Palestinian cause,” he said. “Because we have a similar history of colonisation; of genocide and detention.”</p><p data-start=\"5793\" data-end=\"5890\">“So when Irish people see on their TV screens what’s happening in Gaza, there’s massive empathy.”</p><h2 id=\"ireland-s-stance\">Ireland’s stance</h2><p data-start=\"5914\" data-end=\"6160\">That empathy has increasingly translated into political action. Ireland formally recognised the state of Palestine in 2024 and has joined South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice, alleging genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denies.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">The Irish government has also taken steps to restrict the sale of Israeli bonds, while Ireland has boycotted the Eurovision Song Contest over Israel’s participation and called for its national football team to be suspended from international competition.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">But many campaigners say the government’s actions have not gone far enough. They argue that the Occupied Territories Bill, which seeks to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements, has been stalled since 2018, and express anger that United States military aircraft transporting weapons to Israel are still permitted to pass through Ireland’s <a href=\"https://www.ontheditch.com/state-admits/\">Shannon Airport</a>.</p><p data-start=\"6402\" data-end=\"6506\">Meanwhile, in the northern part of Ireland that remains part of Britain, the war in Gaza has dominated domestic politics.</p><p data-start=\"6508\" data-end=\"6788\">The Stormont Assembly was thrown into crisis after Democratic Unionist Party education minister Paul Givan travelled to Jerusalem on a trip paid for by the Israeli government, prompting a no-confidence vote amid fierce criticism from Irish republican, nationalist, left-wing and unaligned political groups.</p><p data-start=\"6790\" data-end=\"6941\">Belfast City Hall’s decision last month to fly a Palestinian flag was also fervently opposed by unionist councillors before it was eventually approved.</p><p data-start=\"6943\" data-end=\"7120\">For some loyalist and unionist groups, support for Israel has become entwined with loyalty to Britain, with Israeli flags also flying in traditionally loyalist parts of Belfast.</p><p data-start=\"7122\" data-end=\"7262\">With a legacy of identity rooted along sectarian lines, the genocide in Gaza has at times been recast along the old fault lines of division.</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-reaches-palestine\">‘Solidarity reaches Palestine’</h2><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7418\">Yet on the streets of Belfast, protesters insist their solidarity is not rooted in national identity, but in humanity.</p><p data-start=\"7420\" data-end=\"7574\">Damien Quinn, 33, a member of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, said hunger strikes had always carried a particular weight in Ireland.</p><p data-start=\"7576\" data-end=\"7741\">“We are here today to support the hunger strikers in Britain. But we are also here for the Palestinian people for those being slaughtered every single day,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"7743\" data-end=\"7877\">Palestine Action, he said, “made it very clear they have tried signing petitions, they have tried lobbying, they’ve tried everything”.</p><p data-start=\"7879\" data-end=\"7991\">“So when I see the way they are being treated in prison, for standing up against genocide, that’s heartbreaking.”</p><p data-start=\"7993\" data-end=\"8111\">For Rita Aburahma, 25, a Palestinian who has found a home in Belfast, the hunger strike carries a painful familiarity.</p><p data-start=\"8113\" data-end=\"8213\">“My people don’t have the luxury of speaking out, being in Palestine – solidarity matters,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"8215\" data-end=\"8434\">“I find the hunger strikers are really brave – it’s always been a form of resistance. It does concern me, and many other people, how long it has taken the government to pay attention to them, or take action in any form.</p><p data-start=\"8436\" data-end=\"8673\">“Nothing will save those people if the government doesn’t do something about them. So it is shocking in a way, but not that surprising because the same government has been watching the genocide unfold and escalate without doing anything.</p><p data-start=\"8675\" data-end=\"8734\">“Every form of solidarity reaches the people in Palestine.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

All the UAVs were destroyed by the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces,” said Lavrov in a statement.</p><p>He did not say whether Putin was in residence at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lavrov’s Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, quickly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/kyiv-rejects-russias-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putins-residence\">dismissed the claim</a>. “Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged ‘attack on Putin’s residence’. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened,” Sybiha said.</p><p>Russia produced photographs of drone debris lying in the snow two days later, but the drone’s location, manufacture and the time of its downing could not be corroborated from them.</p><p>“The attack on Putin’s Valdai residence is presumably a Kremlin fake,” wrote the opposition outlet Sota. “Residents of Valdai, where Putin’s ‘Dinner’ residence is located, told Sota that last night they did not hear the work of the air defence, which would have shot down 91 drones.”</p><p>Sota also pointed out that drones attacking Valdai “necessarily cross a specially protected airspace with objects of the Strategic Missile Forces, East Kazakhstan region, military aviation, closed administrative units such as Solnechny, Lake, etc.</p><p>“A drone crossing the territory of these facilities can fly to the Dinner residence only by miracle,” Sota said.</p><p>Lavrov’s claim also appeared at odds with an earlier announcement from the Russian Ministry of Defence that only 41 drones had been downed in the Novgorod region on the night of December 28-29.</p><p>Russia’s Defence Ministry later issued an update, saying another 49 drones had been shot down over Bryansk and one over Smolensk “flying in the direction of Novgorod region”.</p><p>Ukraine observers pointed out that Bryansk and Smolensk are hundreds of kilometres from Valdai.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, stated that none of the usual evidence of Ukrainian strikes accompanied the alleged attack, such as footage, heat signatures, statements from local officials, or local media reports.</p><p>For example, a successful Ukrainian attack against an oil depot in Rybinsk on December 31 was well-documented on social media. So was an attack on the Novoshakhtinsk refinery in Rostov a week earlier, as well as a number of other strikes during the week.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206837\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206837\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206837\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1767190282.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1767190282\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-really-happened\">What really happened?</h2><p>News of the alleged attack came a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded successful talks with United States President Donald Trump in Florida, garnering a promise that US forces would participate in Ukraine’s security following any peace agreement with Russia.</p><p>It was the first time the US had agreed to such security guarantees, and it appeared to make Polish Premier Donald Tusk optimistic that the war in Ukraine could end early in 2026.</p><p>“Peace is on the horizon,” he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p><p>“The key result of recent days is the American declaration… (of) willingness to participate in security guarantees for Ukraine after a peace agreement, including the presence of American troops, for example, on the border or on the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia,” Tusk said.</p><p>Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s allies, known as the Coalition of the Willing, were scheduled to meet in Kyiv on January 3 and in France three days later.</p><p>Lavrov’s announcement cast a pall on this optimism when he said, “Russia’s negotiating position will be reviewed.” On the same day, Putin ordered his forces in southern Ukraine to continue efforts to seize the unoccupied remainder of the southern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia. Moscow controls three-quarters of the region.</p><p>Zelenskyy said Russia was “looking for a pretext” to escalate hostilities and avoid engaging in peace talks, following his successful meeting with Trump.</p><p>“Russia is at it again, using dangerous statements to undermine all achievements of our shared diplomatic efforts with President Trump’s team,” he wrote on social media.</p><p>Russia has repeatedly dashed Trump’s hopes for peace, refusing to cede occupied territory or to accept US and European forces on Ukrainian soil.</p><p>Yet Trump appeared to believe Moscow’s allegations.</p><p>“I don’t like it. It’s not good,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “It’s one thing to be offensive… It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”</p><p>Other US officials were not convinced. US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker expressed scepticism, telling an interviewer on Monday, “It’s unclear whether it actually happened.” On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence had determined that Ukraine did not target Putin’s residence.</p><p>Moscow’s messaging appeared to bookend Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, targeting the US president.</p><p>Putin held staged meetings with his General Staff on Saturday, December 27, and Monday, just before and after Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, during which commander-in-chief Valery Gerasimov broadcast exaggerated claims of success.</p><p>He said Russian forces had occupied 6,640 square kilometres (2,564 square miles) of Ukrainian territory and seized 334 Ukrainian settlements in 2025. The ISW said it had “observed evidence indicating a Russian presence in 4,952 square kilometres (1912 sq miles)” and 245 settlements.</p><p>Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii said territory amounting to 0.8 percent of Ukraine’s 603,550sq km (233,032sq miles) had been lost. at the cost of almost 420,000 dead and wounded Russians.</p><p>Ukraine’s General Staff estimated total Russian casualties for the war at more than 1.2 million, almost 11,500 tanks and 24,000 armoured fighting vehicles, more than 37,000 artillery systems, 781 aircraft and well in excess of 4,000 missiles.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>By the end of 2025, Russian forces had still not taken Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, the eastern Ukrainian towns in Donetsk that they had been fighting to capture for five months. They held 55 percent of Hulyaipole in the southern Zaporizhia region, despite claiming to have seized it. Even Russian military reporters admitted Russian forces were being squeezed out of Kupiansk in the northern Kharkiv region, despite claiming also to have seized that.</p><p>“Due to inaccurate reports on the situation to higher authorities, reserves that were ‘not needed’ for the capture and clearing of Kupiansk were redeployed to other areas,” wrote one Kremlin-friendly outlet, citing “systematic exaggeration of successes”.</p><p>While it remained doubtful whether Ukraine did target Valdai, Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities were documented. During the last week of the year, Russia launched just more than 1,000 drones and 33 missiles at Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s Air Force said it intercepted 86 percent of the drones and 30 of the missiles.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206833\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-EASTERN-UKRAINE-copy-1767190250.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN EASTERN UKRAINE copy-1767190250\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_4206835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1767190261.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1767190261\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Dressed in a black hoodie and blue jeans, Campbell is well-spoken but shows her disdain for Cape Town’s colonial past, often erupting in harsh language for those she blames for its consequences.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“This castle speaks to the first economic explosion in Cape Town,” she says at the beginning of her five-stop tour of the city. “It’s an architectural crime scene.”</p><p>Campbell refuses to enter the 17th-century castle, which she sees as a symbol of the violence and dispossession that the colonial era brought to South Africa’s second biggest city.</p><p>“That is where they used to hang people,” she says, pointing to one of the castle’s five bastions. It was built by the settlers of the Dutch East India Company, commonly known by its Dutch acronym, VOC. The VOC built the fortress as part of its efforts to establish a refreshment post between the Netherlands and other trade destinations in the East. The castle is now run by the South African military.</p><p>Campbell, an accredited tour guide, has been giving privately run tours like this for 17 years, starting at the castle and offering a scathing critique of the city’s monuments and museums for dozens of people each year.</p><p>She says most official tributes, such as the Slave Memorial erected in 2008 in Church Square, fail to do justice to the enslaved people who contributed to the construction of Cape Town and often neglect to acknowledge the Indigenous population that lived here for hundreds of years before the Dutch arrived in 1652, displacing them and introducing slavery to the Cape.</p><p>Campbell can still see clear echoes in the city of the “genocide” and dispossession of the Khoi people, the Indigenous herders who lived on this land for thousands of years. She remembers her mother’s stories about how this history personally affected her family, who are descendants of the famously wealthy Hessequa, a subset of the Khoi. The Hessequa lost their land and livestock to the Dutch.</p><p>Known as “the people of the trees”, the Hessequa lived for centuries in the farming area now known as Swellendam, about 220km (137 miles) east of Cape Town. The arrival of European settlers transformed them from land and cattle owners to peasant workers employed by white people, conditions that in many places persist to this day.</p><p>Land ownership in Cape Town and South Africa as a whole remains overwhelmingly in the hands of the white minority. Rights groups have also accused white farmers of sometimes abusing predominantly mixed-race agricultural workers and evicting them on a whim, a practice that has carried on since the colonial era.</p><p>“Many of them have worked there for <a href=\"/features/2024/5/30/forgotten-citizens-south-africas-farm-workers-threatened-with-eviction\">generations</a>, and they are just being evicted,” Campbell says. “There’s no pension. There’s nothing. So the ailments of the past [continue].”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203679\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203679\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-01T124013Z_2101072344_RC2BKHA45MB3_RTRMADP_3_TRAVEL-CM-CAPE-TOWN-1767093696.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Castle of Good Hope\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visitors enter Cape Town’s Castle of Good Hope, one of South Africa’s oldest surviving colonial buildings [Esa Alexander/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-coloniality-of-the-museum\">The coloniality of the museum</h2><p>With a resume that includes posts ranging from trade union administrator and mechanic’s assistant to historian, Campbell started her tours after working at the Groot Constantia estate of the VOC colonial Governor Simon van der Stel, now a museum. This is where she got her first taste for history.</p><p>When she started working on the estate as an information officer in 1998, she found that the history of enslaved and Indigenous people was largely erased on the property, including the “tot” system, the use of wine as payments to workers that dates back centuries and was still in use on some Cape Town farms years after the fall of apartheid in 1994.</p><p>Alarmed by this erasure of her ancestors at the estate, Campbell resigned and pursued a degree in history. Armed with a postgraduate degree specialising in the history of slavery in the Cape,<strong> </strong>Campbell established Transcending History Tours in 2008.</p><p>Her academic research uncovered the inherently colonial nature of museums globally. She discovered that human remains were held in museums, universities and in private ownership, especially in Europe. The South African Museum, founded in 1825, housed human remains that were used in studies that sought to reinforce racist ideologies, such as seeking to prove that non-Europeans were racially inferior. Even though these studies have been halted, the remains continued to be housed by these institutions.</p><p>Campbell would prefer that the museums she tours be decentralised and relocated to the <a href=\"/features/2024/4/10/thirty-years-waiting-for-a-house-south-africas-backyard-dwellers\">Cape Flats</a>, a mainly nonwhite working-class area where Campbell and most descendants of the Khoi and enslaved people live. She argues this would make the museums more accessible to these communities, bringing them closer to their personal histories and demonstrating that their current difficult living conditions and marginalisation are not natural or inevitable, but rather the result of a cruel past.</p><p>“At night, this place is filled with homeless people,” she says on a sunny morning in September as the tour leaves the castle.</p><p>A few steps away, past two lions perched on pillars at the castle’s entrance and a moat filled with fish and pondweed, a barefoot man is asleep on the sidewalk while a woman in a bra and camouflage pants scrounges for food in the shrubs. Like most of the unhoused on the wealthy city’s streets, they are people of colour.</p><p>The tour passes the Grand Parade, the city’s public square and oldest urban open space, where the mud and wood predecessor to the existing castle stood. For many years, it served as a training ground for the colonial garrison before becoming a marketplace, surrounded by striking buildings, such as the Edwardian City Hall.</p><p>The parade’s most famous moment in modern South African history was as the setting of Nelson Mandela’s first public speech after his release from prison in 1990. Today, traders still gather here to sell everything from brightly coloured dashikis (colourful, traditional garments) to kitchen electronics.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203682\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203682\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203682\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Krotoa-1767093701.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Krotoa, a Khoi Khoi woman who was the first indigenous person in South Africa to have an official interracial marriage\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Krotoa, a Khoi woman, was the first Indigenous person in South Africa to have an official interracial marriage [File: Creative Commons]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-trailblazer\">A ‘trailblazer’</h2><p>A few blocks away, the group stops to look at a plaque in St George’s Mall dedicated to one of Campbell’s heroes, Krotoa, a Khoi woman known as the progenitor of Cape Town’s mixed-race population after her marriage to a Danish surgeon.</p><p>The plaque dedicated to her in this busy modern commercial area feels misplaced and superficial to Campbell, who says it fails to celebrate the woman’s historical significance. Campbell also dislikes the commonly used image of Krotoa on the plaque, which she says is fabricated.</p><p>“The Krotoa that I know, she’s a trailblazer. She’s an interpreter. She’s a negotiator,” Campbell says.</p><p>The niece of the Khoi chief Autshumato, Krotoa joined the household of the first Dutch governor in the Cape, Jan van Riebeeck, at about the age of 12. As one of the first Indigenous interpreters, she became a mediator between the Dutch and the Khoi, playing a key role in the cattle trade, which was vital to the settlers’ survival at the Cape. She also negotiated in the conflict that arose between locals and the settlers.</p><p>Krotoa’s influence in van Riebeeck’s government eventually led to her becoming the first Indigenous person to be baptised as a Christian in 1662 and adopting the name Eva. She married a Danish soldier, who was later appointed as the VOC surgeon, Pieter van Meerhof, in 1664, and the couple became the Cape’s first recorded interracial marriage.</p><p>In the end, though, Krotoa was a controversial figure: Khoi leaders criticised her for adopting colonial ways, and both they and Dutch officials accused her of being a spy for the other side.</p><p>“She went right into the kitchens of the Dutch,” Campbell says. “She used to tell them, ‘I know you. I know who you are. You can’t do anything for yourself. Slaves have to do everything for you.’”</p><p>Campbell says Krotoa was instrumental as a mediator in the first Khoi-Dutch war, which lasted from 1659 to 1660 and was sparked by a campaign led by local Khoi leader Nommoa, or Doman, to reclaim the Cape Peninsula. The Dutch were victorious against the two Khoi groups, the Gorinhaiqua and the Gorachouqua, and expelled them from the peninsula to mountain outposts about 70km (44 miles) away.</p><p>Asked what she would consider a fitting memorial for Krotoa, Campbell says: “Monuments are Eurocentric and hierarchic. Where her memorial should be, I am not sure. What I know is that her story and her memory should be a popular memory and part of our learning in schools and in other tertiary learning. She and her Danish husband van Meerhof were sent to Robben Island. She also spent lots of time at the first castle, which is today’s Golden Acre [shopping mall], and her so-called plaque in Castle Street is a humiliation of the contributions she made in resisting the colony in favour of her people.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203676\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2019-07-25T100739Z_1921176509_RC1D5A69FC80_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-SLAVERY-ARTEFACTS-1767093665.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C571&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town [File: Mike Hutchings/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"profits-over-people\">Profits over people</h2><p>Around the corner from Krotoa’s memorial in Castle Street, Campbell stops at another VOC landmark – the cobbled walkway featuring the VOC’s bronze emblem framed by an outline of the castle’s five ramparts.</p><p>“I want you to see how the VOC is embedded right in the fabric of the city,” she says, pointing to the insignia emblazoned in the street.</p><p>Then she directs her tour’s attention to nearby skyscrapers, which she views as symbols of wealth rooted in VOC exploitation.</p><p>As she speaks, workers on their lunch breaks walk by while others sell beaded jewellery, paintings, leather handbags and other wares in stalls dotted along the mall. Most of these workers live in overcrowded townships far outside the city, which is famed for its French Riviera-like lifestyle and has often been voted one of the world’s top tourist destinations.</p><p>“For me, it’s important to speak of that company, the first company that came here,” Campbell says, explaining the origin of capitalism in the region.</p><p>“It comes from there – profits before people. It comes from history. … The VOC is alive and kicking in the city.”</p><h2 id=\"restoring-memory\">Restoring memory</h2><p>The most haunting stop on the tour comes next: the Slave Lodge. It stands on the doorstep of the parliament precinct and the gardens that the VOC established to provide fresh produce to ships journeying between the East and the Netherlands.</p><p>Thousands of enslaved people from as far away as Angola, Benin, Indonesia, India and Madagascar were housed here from 1679 to 1811.

One of the most horrific aspects of life there was the sexual violence inflicted by soldiers on women, including rape and coercion into sex work, often with payments made to the VOC.</p><p>This violent culture has had lasting effects, contributing to today’s high levels of sexual crimes and domestic violence on the Cape Flats, according to Campbell.</p><p>“The Slave Lodge does not get the reflection that it should get,” Campbell tells her tour. “It is very much veneered and made palatable to the visitors. It doesn’t bring the voices of the women in.”</p><p>The tour ends in the street behind the Slave Lodge, where Campbell shows the tourists a macabre landmark they might otherwise miss. On a traffic island in the middle of Spin Street is the spot where the city’s slave auctions were once held. A tree that marked the spot was chopped down in 1916. In its place, a slab of stone was installed in 1953, inscribed with a fading and barely legible message about its historical significance.</p><p>“It looks like a drain,” Campbell says, noting the sharp contrast between this neglected memorial and the bronze statue of Afrikaner leader Jan Smuts, oddly situated in front of the Slave Lodge, where the plaque bearing his name has been restored to a brilliant gleam.</p><p>In 2008, the city tried to rectify this oversight at the auction site, unveiling a commemorative art installation designed by prominent artists Gavin Younge and Wilma Cruise across the street. It consists of 11 granite blocks, roughly at knee height, inscribed with the assigned names of enslaved people and words that recall their tortured reality: “Suicide, infanticide, abscond, escape, flee.”</p><p>Activists have criticised the installation for being too cold and failing to convey the deep wounds left by nearly 200 years of slavery.</p><p>“Birds s*** on it, people sit on it, but they don’t know what it is,” Campbell says. “They have the names of the slaves that were held at the Slave Lodge, but there’s no story. … It’s a monument that only serves the master, at the end of the day, because it doesn’t bring out the pain of the people.</p><p>“I would have loved to see a high rise to bring out the memory of the people, … something more visible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203622\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203622\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250903_140515-1767091018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Lucy Campbell\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Historian Lucy Campbell, third from right, poses with American students at the end of her tour through historic sites that tell the story of slavery and colonialism in Cape Town [Gershwin Wanneburg/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

As I was about to introduce myself, he said, ‘Excellency, I recognise who you are and no need to introduce yourself’,” Sadiq, a veteran politician from Pakistan’s ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), recounted the interaction to a private news channel on Wednesday night.</p><p>Once Jaishankar entered the room, Sadiq said, the Indian minister first met delegations from Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives before approaching him.</p><p>“He knew what he was doing.

The tournament, played in the United Arab Emirates and won by India after beating Pakistan in a thrilling final, underscored how deeply resentful relations between the two neighbours had become.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/operation-sindoor-whats-the-significance-of-indias-pakistan-targets\">A bitter four-day aerial conflict</a> in May, in which both nuclear-armed countries declared themselves victorious, marked the latest and most serious chapter in an antagonism that stretches back to their violent partition from British rule in 1947.</p><p>As the fighting spilled over into sport, it reinforced how political tensions had seeped into nearly every public interaction when it comes to these two nations – until Jaishankar’s handshake on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>While some Indian commentators viewed the interaction negatively, voices in Pakistan saw it as a possible signal of a modest thaw in an otherwise icy relationship.</p><p>“I think that the interaction between Jaishankar and Ayaz Sadiq is a welcome development for the new year,” Mustafa Hyder Sayed, an Islamabad-based foreign policy analyst, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I think basic normalcy of relations in which respect is accorded to officials and hands are shaken, it is the bare minimum which unfortunately was absent after the war between India and Pakistan,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"rivalry-hardens\">Rivalry hardens</h2><p>Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have deteriorated for years and plunged further this April after an attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, when gunmen killed 26 civilians.</p><p>India blamed Pakistan for the killings and, among other measures, withdrew from the <a href=\"/features/2025/7/9/can-india-stop-pakistans-river-water-and-will-it-spark-a-new\">six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty</a> (IWT), which governs the use of six rivers in the Indus basin, which the neighbours share.</p><p>Pakistan denied responsibility, but in early May, the two countries fought an intense four-day air war, targeting each other’s military bases with missiles and drones in their most serious confrontation in nearly three decades.</p><p>The fighting ended after intervention by the United States, for which Pakistan later <a href=\"/news/2025/6/21/pakistan-to-nominate-genuine-peacemaker-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize\">nominated</a> US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>India, however, insisted the ceasefire was achieved through direct communication between officials of the two countries, in line with its longstanding opposition to third-party mediation.</p><p>Since then, ties have remained tense, with fears of renewed conflict never far from the surface.</p><p>Leaders on both sides have exchanged sharp rhetoric. Both countries have also <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/india-pakistan-missile-race-heats-up-but-china-in-crosshairs-too\">tested ballistic missiles</a> and conducted military exercises.</p><p>Against that backdrop, some analysts say the handshake in Dhaka could be significant.</p><p>Sardar Masood Khan, a former Pakistani envoy to the US, described the handshake as a pleasant diplomatic gesture.</p><p>“One can’t imagine that the Indian foreign minister would greet Pakistan’s speaker spontaneously without the explicit permission of the Indian prime minister and senior leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” Khan told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s Hindu-majoritarian ruling party.</p><p>Khan, who has also served as Pakistan’s envoy to the United Nations and China, referred to how the US – while announcing the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad in May – had “nudged” the two sides towards talks in a neutral country.</p><p>India had rejected those calls at the time: New Delhi insists that there is no point in talking to Pakistan until it stops cross-border fighters from entering India for attacks. India has accused Pakistan of sponsoring “terrorism” on its soil for decades – and in recent times, Pakistan has reciprocated those allegations, accusing New Delhi of backing separatists against Islamabad.</p><p>Each side rejects the other’s accusations, though Pakistan has, at times, accepted that the perpetrators of some of the biggest attacks on Indian soil in recent years – such as in Mumbai in 2008 – did come from Pakistan.</p><p>If there were to be any diplomatic breakthrough between India and Pakistan, Bangladesh would be an unlikely setting: Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan as its eastern wing, before it achieved independence in 1971, with India’s help, after Pakistani troops surrendered and thousands of its soldiers were taken as prisoners of war.</p><p>“Whatever prompted it [the handshake] is good for the region, but there are many ifs and buts down the road,” Khan said.</p><p>Rezaul Hasan Laskar, foreign affairs editor at India’s Hindustan Times newspaper, played down the significance of the interaction.</p><p>“The two happened to be in the same room and did what senior leaders of two countries would do when they find themselves in such a situation. They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries,” Laskar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said it was “significant” that all photographs of the encounter emerged from Bangladeshi and Pakistani official social media accounts – rather than from India.</p><p>Laskar noted that India and Pakistan have not held sustained official dialogue since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when gunmen linked to Pakistan killed 166 people.</p><p>“It is hard to see the two sides coming together in any way, given the growing trust deficit,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"hydro-politics\">Hydro politics</h2><p>Arguably, the most consequential fallout of the May conflict was India’s decision to put the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance.</p><p>Pakistan says the move poses an existential threat to its population, which depends heavily on the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, all of which flow from India or Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Khan, the former diplomat, said that if India were to rethink its position and return to the IWT, it would “be a big confidence-building measure and a harbinger for a semblance of rapprochement”.</p><p>But Laskar wasn’t optimistic.</p><p>“For anyone following India-Pakistan tensions in recent years, the suspension of the IWT should not have come as a surprise,” he said.</p><p>“This has the potential for becoming a new permanent hurdle between the two sides, especially since there are virtually no official contacts between them.”</p><h2 id=\"uncertain-thaw\">Uncertain thaw</h2><p>The past year has seen Pakistan’s geopolitical standing rise, with analysts arguing it is the first time in decades the country has been viewed as a major international player.</p><p>In South Asia, following the ouster of Indian ally Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh prime minister, it has <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">revived its ties</a> with Bangladesh as well, with several high-profile visits between the two countries.</p><p>Islamabad has also deepened ties with the US, China and Middle Eastern states. Trump, in fact, has on several occasions publicly praised Pakistani leadership and recently called Pakistan’s army chief Asim Munir his “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">favourite field marshal</a>”.</p><p>Pakistan is expected to be part of a controversial US-led international <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash\">stabilisation force</a> proposed to oversee security in Gaza, and it also signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">defence agreement</a> with Saudi Arabia in September.</p><p>India, meanwhile, has faced diplomatic pressure from Washington. Trump has repeatedly referred to the May conflict and appeared to endorse Pakistani claims of shooting down several Indian fighter jets.</p><p>The US president has also <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/16/how-us-tariffs-are-unraveling-indias-textile-industry\">imposed tariffs</a> of nearly 50 percent on India, while Pakistan received a lower rate of 19 percent.</p><p>With Pakistan seemingly enjoying diplomatic momentum, could 2026 bring a detente between New Delhi and Islamabad?</p><p>Sayed, the foreign policy analyst, said it was in the “national interest” of both countries to maintain at least minimal engagement.</p><p>“They can have a very basic, minimal agenda, in which they should define the rules, red lines and set guardrails. Once that is done, they can have a basic level of dialogue that is agreed upon with consent of both, and bring it to the table,” he said.</p><p>But Khan was sceptical, given the bitterness of the May conflict.</p><p>Laskar said India has steadily escalated its responses to attacks since 2019 and that the May 2025 conflict showed how far both sides were prepared to go.</p><p>As a result, he said, reviving back-channel contacts between India’s national security adviser and Pakistani intelligence officials was essential, as the mechanism had worked in the past.</p><p>“The consolidation of power by Field Marshal Asim Munir, his ability to strike a personal rapport with US President Donald Trump and the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia mutual defence pact are all factors that have implications for the region, which will be factored into New Delhi’s approach,” Laskar said.</p><p>Sayed agreed, saying a “pre-determined and mutually agreed mechanism” to handle incidents of violence, rather than immediate blame, would be a significant step forward.</p><p>“I think India has also understood that it cannot get away with not acknowledging Pakistan’s existence or pretending that it is not there,” he said.</p><p>“Pakistan has emerged as a very important regional player, and India is now compelled to have a bare-minimum level of engagement.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the STC also seeks to carve out a separate nation in southern Yemen, and in December, expanded its military operations in Hadramout and al-Mahra provinces that border Saudi Arabia, setting off a rapid escalation in tensions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has accused the United Arab Emirates – also a part of the anti-Houthi coalition – of arming the STC and of encouraging the separatist group to expand into Hadramout and al-Mahra, which Riyadh has said threatens its national security. The UAE has denied those allegations, insisting that it supports Saudi Arabia’s security.</p><p>However, while the UAE has since agreed to demands from Yemen’s Riyadh-backed Presidential Leadership Council and Saudi Arabia to withdraw its troops from Yemen, the STC has refused to pull back from Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>On Thursday, the STC-aligned Transport Ministry within the internationally recognised government claimed that the stoppage at the airport was a result of Saudi Arabia imposing new requirements mandating that flights to and from Aden airport undergo inspection in Jeddah.</p><p>The ministry said it was “shocked” by the move, adding that Saudi authorities later clarified the restriction only applied to flights operating between Aden and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>A Saudi source denied to the Reuters news agency that it was involved in restricting flights, saying Yemen’s internationally recognised government, led by the Presidential Leadership Council, was behind the requirement for UAE-bound flights.</p><p>Yemeni presidential adviser, Thabet al-Ahmadi, confirmed to Al Jazeera that it had imposed a requirement that applied to one flight route departing from Aden airport. He said the move was meant to prevent STC money smuggling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al-Ahmadi said the government did not support a complete halt to flights, adding it wanted to ensure air traffic continued unimpeded.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UAE announced it was voluntarily withdrawing its remaining “counterterrorism” forces from Yemen. That came after Riyadh <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemeni-port-over-unauthorised-weapons-shipment\">struck</a> what it claimed to be a UAE-linked weapons shipment in the southern port city of Mukalla.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Wednesday, Rashad al-Alimi, the head of the internationally recognised government in Yemen, warned that any moves by the STC to further entrench their position in the provinces would have severe consequences.</p><p>The STC has, however, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/yemens-separatist-stc-refuses-to-withdraw-from-provinces-near-saudi-arabia\">remained defiant</a>, saying it would remain in the provinces.</p><p>However, STC spokesperson Mohammed al-Naqeeb said the group was coordinating its movements with the Homeland Shield forces, which had been the main security force in the provinces prior to the STC offensive. The Homeland Shield is affiliated with the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since Houthi forces took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014. The group continues to control large swaths of the country’s northwest, with the STC and government contesting the southern and eastern flanks.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But, as he had in his campaign for the mayoralty, Mamdani flipped the script with his swearing-in events.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In act one, just after midnight, as the ball dropped in Times Square to ring in 2026, Mamdani took the oath of office in a small ceremony on the steps of the landmark New York City Hall subway station.</p><p>New York State Attorney General Letitia James administered the oath as Mamdani stood beside his wife, Rama Duwaji, on a staircase inside the transit hub, which has not been used for passenger service since 1945. He used a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-mayor-with-historic-quran\">historic Quran</a> borrowed from the New York Public Library for his swearing in, and a second one that belonged to his grandfather.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The public celebration arrived later, on New Year’s Day, when Mamdani repeated the oath on the steps of City Hall before a crowd that spilled across the surrounding plaza and into the streets. Despite the blistering cold, tens of thousands of supporters streamed into Lower Manhattan to watch the new mayor – along with the city’s comptroller, Mark Levine, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams – formally assume office.</p><p>National political heavyweights, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, flanked the city’s new leadership and delivered speeches outlining the progressive movement’s governing ambitions in New York and the national reverberations the race has already sent to lawmakers across the country.</p><p>“The most important lesson that can be learned today is that when working people stand, when they don’t let them [the ultra-wealthy] divide us up, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish,” Sanders said before swearing in Mamdani.</p><p>While guests and the press gathered inside the City Hall grounds, the city staged a seven-block-long public block party – a new twist on the traditionally ticketed inauguration format. In addition to a closed event capped at a few thousand attendees, anyone willing to RSVP and endure the frigid air and blustering winds after a night of snowfall could try their luck at getting in.</p><p>And many did, bundled New Yorkers shuffled through security checkpoints, hoping to glimpse the swearing-in of a 34-year-old democratic socialist now charged with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/zohran-mamdani-elected-as-new-york-mayor-in-historic-win\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running the largest city</a> in the United States, streaming on large monitors stationed throughout the surrounding area outside City Hall.</p><p>Some supporters told Al Jazeera they waited in line for hours, and many never made it through the checkpoints in time. While crowds cheered and horns blasted in solidarity from a distance, a handful of protesters lingered behind police barricades.</p><p>The block party in and of itself was symbolic in its effort to reach more New Yorkers who have normally been left out of the political process, Democratic strategist Nomiki Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was a way of opening up something that hasn’t been accessible for anybody, you know, that wasn’t part of the inner circle of New York politics and media,” Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was an opportunity to give back to the people who helped him get into office.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209134\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4209134 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6332-1767314647.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"New Yorkers gathered in a first of its kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New Yorkers gathered in a first-of-its-kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-message-of-unity-and-affordability\">A message of unity and affordability</h2><p>Mamdani, Williams and Levine spoke about unity for all New Yorkers, delivering remarks in English, Spanish, Hebrew and Greek, and appearing alongside faith leaders of <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/29/zohran-mamdanis-unlikely-coalition-winning-over-nycs-jewish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several different </a>faiths, including Islam, Christianity and Judaism.</p><p>“We have three swearings-in. One by a leader using a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-mayor-with-historic-quran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quran,</a> one by a leader using a Christian Bible, and one using a Hebrew Bible. I am proud to live in a city where this is possible,” Levine said after taking the oath of office.</p><p>Mamdani echoed that sentiment.</p><p>“We will draw this city closer together. We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism. If our campaign demonstrated that the people of New York yearn for solidarity, then let this government foster it,” Mamdani said in his address.</p><p>“We will deliver nothing less as we work each day to make this city belong to more of its people than it did the day before.”</p><p>But the core message, voiced repeatedly by Mamdani, Levine, Williams, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, was the same one that defined the campaign: that the ultra wealthy should pay higher taxes.</p><p>“Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes is not radical. It is exactly the right thing to do,” Sanders said, as supporters chanted, “Tax the rich.”</p><p>One of <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/21/will-zohran-mamdani-help-or-hurt-new-yorks-economy\">Mamdani’s core promises</a> was to raise the corporate tax rate in New York City from 7.25 percent to 11.5 percent, equivalent to that of neighbouring New Jersey, as well as a 2 percent increase in taxes on those who make more than $1m a year. Any tax plan would need the approval of the governor to move forward.</p><p>“This movement came out of eight-and-a-half million somewheres – taxi cab depots and Amazon warehouses, DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] meetings and curbside domino games. The powers that be had looked away from these places for quite some time – if they’d known about them at all – so they dismissed them as nowhere. But in our city, where every corner of these five boroughs holds power, there is no nowhere and there is no no one,” Mamdani said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Housing policy has been central to that affordability message for Mamdani. One of his signature campaign promises was to freeze the rent on the city’s rental stabilised apartments, which represent about half of the city’s rental housing stock.</p><p>“Those in rent-stabilised homes will no longer dread the latest rent hike – because we will freeze the rent,” Mamdani said in his remarks.</p><p>Only hours later, Mamdani introduced a slate of executive orders all aimed at housing.</p><p>“On the first day of this new administration, on the day when so many rent payments are due, we will not wait to deliver action,” Mamdani said at a news conference.</p><p>He announced three executive orders inside a rent-stabilised building in Brooklyn, including the creation of two new city task forces on housing policy: one to take inventory of city-owned land that could be used for housing, and another to identify ways to spur development.</p><p>“The housing crisis is at the centre of our affordability crisis. There are a number of things we are going to be focused on: protecting tenants, going after bad landlords, and building more housing. A huge part of how we get out of our housing crisis is to build more affordable housing across the city,” Leila Bozorg, the Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning, told Al Jazeera on the steps of City Hall hours before announcing the new policies.</p><p>“These are policy decisions we can address if we have the political will and if we put the resources behind it. And that is what he [Mamdani] is committed to doing.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
