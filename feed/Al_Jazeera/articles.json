military facilities and resettle displaced Palestinians from Gaza in exchange for recognition by Israel.</p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday dismissed the claims as baseless, saying its engagement with Israel was “purely diplomatic” and conducted “in full respect of international law”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The denial came in response to allegations by Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-strange-unexpected-somali-president\">told</a> Al Jazeera that Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: The resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden coast, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel.</p><p>Reports began circulating earlier this year that Somaliland was interested in assisting Israel’s widely condemned aim of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/somaliland-recognition-for-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-not-worth-it\">ethnically cleansing Palestinians</a>, as officials in Hargeisa pushed for recognition.</p><p>Somaliland’s foreign minister said no talks had taken place on the issue but stopped short of rejecting the possibility, unlike other countries rumoured to be of interest to Israel.</p><p>Only the final condition has been publicly acknowledged.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Somaliland would join the Accords, telling United States media outlet Newsmax he wanted to “support a democratic, moderate country, a Muslim country, that wants to join the Abraham Accords”.</p><p>Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent state last week, ending more than three decades of failed bids by the breakaway region of Somalia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cover-for-israeli-objectives\">‘A cover for Israeli objectives’</h2><p>Somaliland’s President Abdurrahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, is planning an official visit to Israel in the coming weeks, according to Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster.</p><p>Sources told Kan on Wednesday evening that the visit could take place as early as the second week of January, during which Abdullahi would formally join the Abraham Accords.</p><p>Netanyahu initially invited Cirro during a video call announcing the mutual recognition.</p><p>Somalia’s president warned that Israel’s recognition “was not merely a diplomatic gesture but a cover for specific, high-stakes Israeli strategic objectives”.</p><p>He claimed Israel would “export its problem in Gaza” to the Horn of Africa and described the move as opening “a box of evils in the world”.</p><p>Israel’s motives for suddenly recognising Somaliland remain unclear, though analysts point to the region’s strategic position at the gateway to the Red Sea, opposite Yemen’s Houthis, who imposed a naval blockade on Israeli-linked shipping before the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and fired rockets at Israel.</p><p>According to a November report by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base” for intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and “a platform for direct operations” against them.</p><p>The Houthis <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/any-israeli-presence-in-somaliland-will-be-a-target-houthi-leader\">said</a> earlier this week that any Israeli presence would be a target, a statement Somaliland’s former intelligence chief, Mostafa Hasan, said amounted to a declaration of war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"condemnation-and-concerns\">Condemnation and concerns</h2><p>Somaliland’s foreign minister appeared to downplay regional concerns on Wednesday, telling Israel’s i24NEWS that while some countries “feel Israel establishing a relationship will cause their downfall”, such fears were unfounded.</p><p>The recognition has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/somalis-rally-against-israels-world-first-recognition-of-somaliland\">triggered</a> widespread anger across Somalia, with tens of thousands taking to the streets on December 30 in Mogadishu, Baidoa, Dhusamareb, Las Anod and other cities, waving Somali flags and demanding unity.</p><p>More than 50 countries <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/un-security-council-members-condemn-israels-recognition-of-somaliland\">condemned</a> Israel’s move, while the African Union and the European Union said Somalia’s territorial integrity should be respected.</p><p>Despite the backlash, Somaliland’s president expressed confidence on New Year’s Eve that “many more nations will soon formally recognise the Republic of Somaliland.”</p><p>The region declared independence from Somalia in 1991 during a civil war but has never secured international recognition, despite maintaining its own government, currency and military.</p><p>Somalia continues to claim Somaliland as part of its territory.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As we enter 2026, one truth is impossible to ignore: children around the world are facing their greatest levels of need in modern history – just as the humanitarian system meant to protect them and their futures is battling some of its biggest challenges in decades.</p><p>The events of 2025 marked a dramatic rupture in global humanitarian and development efforts. When the United States abruptly halted foreign aid in January, billions of dollars vanished overnight. Critical programmes were suspended, offices closed, and millions suddenly lost access to food, healthcare, education, and protection. Overnight, lifelines that communities had depended on for decades were thrown into jeopardy – and children, as always, paid the highest price.</p><p>For international NGOs, the shock was immediate and severe. At Save the Children, we were forced to take some of the toughest decisions in our 106-year history. We had to close country offices, cut thousands of staff positions, and wind down life-saving operations. We estimated that about 11.5 million people – including 6.7 million children – would feel the immediate impacts of these cuts, while many more would be impacted in the longer term.</p><p>The aid cuts came at a time when children globally were already facing major challenges, from conflict to displacement, to climate change, with decades of progress at risk of being reversed.</p><p>The facts are startling. In 2025, one in every five children was living in an active conflict zone where children are being killed, maimed, sexually assaulted and abducted in record numbers. About 50 million children globally are displaced from their homes. Nearly half the world’s children – about 1.12 billion – cannot afford a balanced diet, and some 272 million were out of school.</p><p>These numbers point to a global failure. Behind each statistic is a child whose childhood is being cut short, a childhood defined by fear, hunger and lost potential.</p><p>For children, the collapse of aid was not an abstract budgetary decision, but it was deeply personal.  Health clinics closed, classrooms closed, and protection services disappeared just as violence, climate shocks and displacement intensified. Years of hard-won progress in child survival, education and rights were suddenly at risk of being undone, leaving millions of children more vulnerable to hunger, exploitation and violence.</p><p>The crisis also revealed the fragility of the global aid system itself. When humanitarian support is concentrated among a handful of government donors, sudden political shifts reverberate directly through children’s lives. The events of 2025 showed how quickly international commitments can unravel – and how devastating that can be for the youngest and least protected.</p><p>Yet amid this turmoil, something extraordinary happened.</p><p>In many places, families, teachers, health workers and local organisations found ways to keep learning going, to provide care, and to create spaces where children could still play, heal and feel safe. These efforts underscored a simple truth: Responses are strongest when they are rooted close to children themselves.</p><p>There were also moments of progress. In a year marked by pushback against human rights, important legal reforms advanced children’s protection – from a ban on corporal punishment in Thailand, to the criminalisation of child marriage and the passing of a digital protection law in Bolivia. These gains reminded us that change is possible even in difficult times, when children’s rights are put at the centre of public debate and policy.</p><p>Out of the shocks of 2025 has come a moment of reckoning and an opportunity: to adapt, to innovate, towards approaches that are more sustainable, more locally led and more accountable to the people they are meant to serve. For children, this shift is critical. Decisions made closer to communities are more likely to reflect children’s real needs and aspirations.</p><p>This period of reinvention has also revived difficult questions that can no longer be postponed. How can life-saving assistance be insulated from political volatility? How can funding be diversified so that children are not abandoned when a single donor withdraws? And how can children and young people meaningfully participate in decisions that shape their futures?</p><p>Innovation alone will not save children, but it can help. When digital tools, data and community-led design are used responsibly, they can improve access, accountability and trust. Used poorly, they risk deepening inequalities. The challenge is not technological — it is political and ethical.</p><p>Children do not stop wanting to learn, play or dream because bombs fall or aid dries up. In camps, cities and ruined neighbourhoods, they organise, speak out and imagine futures that adults have failed to secure for them. They remind us why our work – and our ability to adapt – matters so profoundly.</p><p>In Gaza this year, I witnessed the horrors that children are living through daily, with the war now raging for more than two years and most of the Strip covered in rubble. I saw children facing malnutrition at our healthcare clinics and heard how some now wish to die to join their parents in heaven. No child should ever be living under such terror that death is preferable. They are children, and their voices need to be heard.</p><p>If 2025 exposed the failures of the old aid model, 2026 must become a turning point. A different choice is possible — one that builds systems resilient to political shocks, grounded in local leadership and accountable to the children they claim to serve. The challenge now is to reshape our systems so that, no matter how the world changes, we can put children first, always, everywhere.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In their place are basic human needs: securing flour, food and water, obtaining tents to shield them from the cold, accessing medical care, and simply surviving bombardments.</p><p>For Palestinians like Sanaa, hope for the new year has been reduced to a daily struggle for survival.</p><p>Sanaa is a 41-year-old mother of seven, who has been solely responsible for raising her children after her husband was killed in an Israeli strike in November 2024, at the end of the first year of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“Responsibility for the children, displacement, securing food and drink, making tough decisions here and there. Everything was required of me at once,” Sanaa, who fled with her family from al-Bureij to Deir el-Balah, both in central Gaza, said.</p><p>Sanaa’s biggest challenge in 2025 was securing “a loaf of bread” and getting her hands on even a kilogram of flour every day for her family.</p><p>“During the famine, I slept and woke up with one wish: to get enough bread for the day. I felt I was dying while my children were starving before me, and I could do nothing,” she said bitterly.</p><p>The search for flour eventually saw Sanaa decide to go to the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-backed-ghf-aid-mission-in-gaza-ends-a-timeline-of-violence\">US-backed GHF</a> aid distribution points that opened at the end of May across Gaza.</p><p>“At first, I was scared and hesitant, but the hunger we live through can force you to do things you never imagined,” Sanaa said, describing her weekly visits to the aid points.</p><p>Visiting the sites, which the US and Israel supported as alternatives to long-established aid organisations, was inherently dangerous. More than 2,000 Palestinians were killed in and around GHF sites, according to the United Nations, before the GHF officially ended its mission in late November.</p><p>But going to the sites wasn’t just a risk to Sanaa’s life, it was a path that “took away her dignity”, leaving lasting scars.</p><p>On one occasion, Sanaa was hit by shrapnel in her arm while waiting for aid at the Netzarim distribution point in central Gaza, and her 17-year-old daughter was injured in the chest at the Morag point east of Rafah.</p><p>But her injuries didn’t stop her from trying again, although she began to go alone, leaving her children behind in relative safety.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207132\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207132\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207132\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1745-1767205773.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"During the famine, Sana’a’s greatest wish was to provide a loaf of bread for her seven children, amid a six-month-long blockade that prevented food and goods from entering [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">During the famine in Gaza, Sana’a’s greatest wish was to provide a loaf of bread for her seven children, amid a six-month-long Israeli blockade that prevented food and goods from entering [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"desperation\">Desperation</h2><p>The war in Gaza led to severe interruptions in food and humanitarian aid, the last of which began in late March 2025, eventually leading to the declaration of a famine. It continued until October 2025, gradually easing after the ceasefire announcement.</p><p>During this period, the United Nations officially declared a state of famine, confirming that parts of Gaza had entered catastrophic hunger stages, with acute shortages in food, water, and medicine, and high rates of malnutrition among children and pregnant women.</p><p>Thousands of residents had to search for food using dangerous methods, including by waiting for long hours at the GHF sites.</p><p>“Hunger lasted a long time; it wasn’t a day or two, so I had to find a solution,” Sanaa said. “Each time, people crowded in their hundreds of thousands. Some would spend the night there, hundreds of thousands of displaced people – men, women, children, old and young.”</p><p>“The scenes were utterly humiliating. Bombing and heavy gunfire on everyone, not to mention the pushing and fighting among people over aid.”</p><p>The crowds meant that Sanaa often returned to her tent empty-handed, but the rare times she brought back a few kilos of flour felt like “a festival”, she recalled.</p><p>“One time, I got five kilos [11 pounds] of flour.

My brothers were in their room, my father had just returned from outside, and my mother was preparing food in the kitchen,” she recalled, eyes vacant, describing the day.</p><p>“In an instant, everything turned to darkness and thick dust. I didn’t realise what was happening around me, not even that it was bombing, due to the shock,” Batoul added, as she stood next to the ruins of her destroyed home.</p><p>She was trapped under the debris of the destroyed home for about an hour, unable to move, calling for help from anyone nearby.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe what was happening. I wished I were dead, unaware, trying to escape the thought of what had happened to my family,” Batoul said.</p><p>“I called for them one by one, and there was no sound. My mother, father, siblings, no one.”</p><p>After being rescued, she was found to have severe injuries to her hand and was immediately transferred to hospital.</p><p>“I was placed on a stretcher above extracted bodies, covered in sheets. I panicked and asked my uncle who was with me: ‘Who are these people?’ He said they were from the house next to ours,” she recalled.</p><p>As soon as Batoul arrived at the hospital, she was rushed into emergency surgery on her hand before she could learn about what had happened to her family.</p><p>“I kept asking everyone, ‘Where is my mom? Where is my dad?’ They told me they were fine, just injured in other departments.”</p><p>“I didn’t believe them,” Batoul added, “but I was also afraid to call them liars.”</p><p>The following day, her uncles broke the news to Batoul that she had lost her mother and siblings. Her father, they told her, was still in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p><p>“They gathered around me, and they were all crying. I understood on my own,” she said.</p><p>“I broke down, crying in disbelief, then said goodbye to them one by one before the funeral.”</p><p>Batoul’s father later succumbed to his injuries three days after the incident, leaving her alone to face her grief.</p><p>“I used to go to the ICU every day and whisper in my father’s ear, asking him to wake up again, for me and for himself, but he was completely unconscious,” Batoul said as she scrolled through photos of her father on her mobile phone.</p><p>“When he died, it felt as if the world had gone completely dark before my eyes.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207152\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207152\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207152\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A2057-1767206534.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batoul holds a photo on her phone showing her with her family, including her father, mother, and siblings Muhammad, Youssef, Tayma, and Habiba [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Batoul al-Shawish holds a photo on her phone showing her with her family, including her father, mother, and siblings Muhammad, Youssef, Tayma, and Habiba [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"where-is-the-ceasefire\">‘Where is the ceasefire?’</h2><p>Israel said that it conducted the strikes in Nuseirat in response to an alleged gunman crossing into Israel-held territory in Gaza, although it is unclear why civilian homes in Nuseirat were therefore targeted.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Government Media Office and the Ministry of Health, around 2,613 Palestinian families were completely wiped out during the war on the Gaza Strip up until the announcement of the ceasefire in October 2025.</p><p>Those families had all of their members killed, and their names erased from the civil registry.</p><p>The same figures indicate that approximately 5,943 families were left with only a single surviving member after the rest were killed, an agonising reflection of the scale of social and human loss caused by the war.</p><p>These figures may change as documentation continues and bodies are recovered from beneath the rubble.</p><p>For Batoul, her family was anything but ordinary; they were known for their deep bond and love for one another.</p><p>“My father was deeply attached to my mother and never hid his love for her in front of anyone, and that reflected on all of us.”</p><p>“My mother was my closest friend, and my siblings loved each other beyond words. Our home was full of pleasant surprises and warmth,” she added.</p><p>“Even during the war, we used to sit together, hold family gatherings, and help one another endure so much of what we were going through.”</p><p>The understandable grief that has overtaken Batoul leaves no room for wishes for a new year or talk of a near future, at least for now.</p><p>One question, however, weighs heavily on her: why was her peaceful family targeted, especially during a ceasefire?</p><p>“Where is the ceasefire they talk about? It’s just a lie,” she said.</p><p>“My family and I survived bombardment, two years of war. An apartment next to our home in eastern Nuseirat was hit, and we fled together to here. We lived through hunger, food shortages, and fear together. Then we thought we had survived, that the war was over.”</p><p>“But sadly, they’re gone, and they left me alone.”</p><p>Batoul holds onto one wish from the depths of her heart: to join her family as soon as possible.</p><p>At the same time, she carries an inner resignation that perhaps it is her fate to live this way, like so many others in Gaza who have lost their families.</p><p>“If life is written for me, I will try to fulfil my mother’s dream that I be outstanding in my field and generous to others,” said Batoul, a second-year university student studying multimedia, who is currently living with her uncle and his family.</p><p>“Life without family,” she said, “is living with an amputated heart, in darkness for the rest of your life, and there are so many like that now in Gaza.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207156\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207156\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207156\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1970-1767206634.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batoul stands in front of the rubble of her destroyed home, where she was trapped for about an hour before being rescued when it was hit [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Batoul al-Shawish stands in front of the rubble of her destroyed home, where she was trapped for about an hour before being rescued [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

The vast majority of those killed were men, but the list included 10 women.</p><p>“128 journalists killed in a single year is not just a statistic; it is a global crisis. These deaths are a brutal reminder that journalists are being targeted with impunity, simply for doing their job,” IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said.</p><p>Palestinian journalists were the biggest cohort of victims: 56 Palestinian media professionals were killed in 2025. Yemen followed, with 13 deaths, Ukraine, with eight, and Sudan, with six, according to the IFJ.</p><p>The Paris-based media union cited Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif as the most “emblematic” of the 56 journalists murdered in Palestine last year covering Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Al-Sharif, 28, was killed on August 10 alongside several colleagues when Israeli forces struck a media tent outside Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital.</p><p>The attack also killed Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, Al Jazeera camera operators Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal, freelance camera operator Momen Aliwa and freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khalidi.</p><p>IFJ also cited an Israeli strike in early September on a Yemeni newspaper office as “one of the worst-ever attacks on a media office”. Thirteen journalists and media workers at the Houthi-affiliated “26 September” newspaper were killed, along with more than 20 other people.</p><p>Another nine deaths were ruled as accidents, while others – including two journalists in Syria and two in Iran – were “targeted and killed” because of their work, IFJ said.</p><p>While the Middle East was the deadliest region for the third year in a row in 2025, the Asia Pacific accounted for the largest number of journalists and media workers behind bars. Most cases in 2025 were in China and Hong Kong, which together accounted for 143 journalists, followed by 49 in Myanmar and 37 in Vietnam.</p><p>Europe was another detention hotspot last year, accounting for 149 imprisoned journalists. IFJ attributed the figure, up 40 percent from a year earlier, to “intensified repression in Azerbaijan and Russia”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His collection became the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.</p><p>Schomburg was born in Puerto Rico in the 1870s to parents of German and Afro-Caribbean descent. He later immigrated to New York and was a key player in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s – a period of intense cultural and intellectual flourishing within New York’s Black community.</p><p>The library praised Mamdani’s decision to use Schomburg’s Quran because of its connection to one of New York’s “most groundbreaking scholars and for its simple, functional qualities”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207558\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207558\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207558\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25365617541506-1767238332.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This photo provided by The New York Public Library shows the Schomburg Quran on Dec. 16, 2025 in New York.

The edition is neither signed nor dated, but its “minute naskh script and its binding, featuring a gilt-stamped medallion filled with a floral composition, suggest it was produced in Ottoman Syria in the 19th century”, the library added.</p><p>“The significance of this Quran extends far beyond the beauty of its pages,” said Hiba Abid, curator of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. “It is a Quran close to the people, not only because of its simple craftsmanship, but also because it is part of the collections of the nation’s largest public library system.”</p><p>Anthony W Marx, the library’s president and CEO, said the choice of Quran and its association with Schomburg “symbolises a greater story of inclusion, representation, and civic-mindedness”.</p><p>Mamdani is one of only a handful of US politicians to be sworn in with the Quran. New York does not require mayors to take the oath of office with their hand on a religious text, but many past mayors have used a copy of the Bible.</p><p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg used a 100-year-old family Bible during one ceremony, while Mayor Bill de Blasio used a Bible that once belonged to US President Franklin D Roosevelt. Mamdani’s predecessor, Mayor Eric Adams, also used a family Bible for his oath.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207562\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207562\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207562\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25365617538321-1767238552.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This photo provided by The New York Public Library shows the Schomburg Quran on Dec. 16, 2025 in New York.

Other videos featured the experiences of everyday New Yorkers, including many of its Muslim and immigrant communities.</p><p>Mamdani has also been a firm critic of Israel’s policies towards Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Critics like New York Representative Elise Stefanik homed in on Mamdani’s background and left-wing politics as a Democratic Socialist, calling the incoming mayor a “jihadist Communist” and “terrorist” sympathiser.</p><p>Mamdani, however, pledged to never hide from his background during a campaign speech. “I will not change who I am, how I eat, or the faith that I’m proud to call my own,” he said during his campaign. “I will no longer look for myself in the shadows. I will find myself in the light.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
