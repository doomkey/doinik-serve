The drills have caused controversy in the country and drawn the ire of the United States.</p><p>Although South Africa regularly holds drills with Russia and China, the latest maritime training comes amid heightened tensions between the US and many of the group’s members, particularly Iran, which until last week was grappling with mass protests at home that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/narrative-war-who-killed-thousands-during-irans-nationwide-protests\">turned deadly</a>.</p><p>Pretoria said the exercise, named Will for Peace 2026, was essential for ensuring maritime safety and international cooperation. The training “brings together navies from BRICS Plus countries for … joint maritime safety operations [and] interoperability drills”, a statement from the South African military noted before the exercises.</p><p>However, US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has previously accused BRICS of being “anti-American” and has threatened its members with tariffs, has strongly criticised the naval exercises.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the exercises and why they were controversial:</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-drills-for\">What were the drills for?</h2><p>South Africa hosted the BRICS naval exercise, which included warships from participating countries, on January 9-16.</p><p>China led the training, which took place near the southwestern coastal city of Simon’s Town, which is home to a major South African naval base.</p><p>Exercises in rescue and maritime strike operations as well as technical exchanges were planned, according to China’s Ministry of National Defense. All BRICS countries were invited.</p><p>Captain Nndwakhulu Thomas Thamaha, South Africa’s joint task force commander, said at the opening ceremony that the operation was not just a military exercise but a statement of intent by BRICS countries to forge closer alliances with each other.</p><p>“It is a demonstration of our collective resolve to work together,” Thamaha said. “In an increasingly complex maritime environment, cooperation such as this is not an option. It is essential.”</p><p>The purpose, he said, was to “ensure the safety of shipping lanes and maritime economic activities”.</p><p>South African Deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa told journalists that the drills had been planned before the current tensions between some BRICS members and the US.</p><p>While some BRICS countries may face issues with Washington, Holomisa clarified that they “are not our enemies”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4230490\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4230490\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4230490\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26009517448249-1768115408.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"iran\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4230490\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Iranian navy ship Naghdi is seen docked at Simon’s Town Harbour near Cape Town, South Africa, on January 9, 2026 [Nardus Engelbrech/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-participated-and-how\">Who participated and how?</h2><p>China and Iran deployed destroyer warships to South Africa, while Russia and the United Arab Emirates sent corvettes, traditionally the smallest warships.</p><p>South Africa, the host country, dispatched a frigate.</p><p>Indonesia, Ethiopia and Brazil joined the exercises as observers.</p><p>India, the current chair of the group, chose not to participate and distanced itself from the war games.</p><p>“We clarify that the exercise in question was entirely a South African initiative in which some BRICS members took part,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. “It was not a regular or institutionalised BRICS activity, nor did all BRICS members take part in it. India has not participated in previous such activities.”</p><h2 id=\"why-is-south-africa-facing-us-backlash-over-the-drills\">Why is South Africa facing US backlash over the drills?</h2><p>The US is angry that South Africa allowed Iran to participate in the drills at a time when Tehran was accused of launching a violent crackdown on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/iran-just-getting-started-on-punishing-rioters-arrested-during-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">antigovernment protests</a> that had spread across the country.</p><p>The protests broke out in late December, when shopkeepers in Tehran closed up their businesses and demonstrated against inflation and the falling value of the rial. These protests swelled into a broader challenge to Iran’s rulers, as thousands of people took to the streets nationwide to demonstrate over a few weeks.</p><p>Security forces in some areas cracked down on the crowds, resulting in the deaths of “several thousands”, according to a statement on Saturday by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While activists said thousands of protesters were killed, the Iranian government said this was an exaggeration and claimed police officers and security service members formed a significant chunk of those who were killed.</p><p>The Iranian authorities also claimed the US and Israel had armed and funded “terrorists” to inflame the protests. They said agents affiliated with foreign powers, and not state forces, were responsible for the deaths of civilians, including protesters.</p><p>The mass uprising is one of the most disruptive the country has witnessed since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been arrested.</p><p>Before the BRICS drills, the US warned South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that Iran’s participation would reflect badly on his country, according to a report by the Daily Maverick, a South African newspaper.</p><p>Ramaphosa subsequently ordered Iran to withdraw from the exercises on January 9, the paper reported.</p><p>However, three Iranian vessels that had already been deployed to South Africa continued to participate.</p><p>In a statement on January 15, the US embassy in South Africa accused the South African military of defying orders from its own government and said it was “cozying up to Iran”.</p><p>“It is particularly unconscionable that South Africa welcomed Iranian security forces as they were shooting, jailing, and torturing Iranian citizens engaging in peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves,” the statement read.</p><p>“South Africa can’t lecture the world on ‘justice’ while cozying up to Iran.”</p><p>South African political analyst Reneva Fourie said Washington was merely fishing for reasons to criticise South Africa for bringing a genocide case against Israel before the International Court of Justice for its war in Gaza.</p><p>“The US is looking for an entry point,” she said.</p><p>The US “is facing increased infringement on freedom of expression and association, democracy and human rights as well as increased militarisation. The US should focus on its own dire state instead of meddling in the affairs of others.”</p><p>Tensions over the military drills are only the latest point of contention between the US and Iran.</p><p>During the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in 2025, Washington sided with Israel, and on June 22, the US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran. Initial assessments from US officials noted that all three were severely damaged. Iran retaliated by bombing a military base in Qatar where US troops are positioned, in what was largely seen as a face-saving exercise.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-brics-members-have-tensions-with-the-us\">Which other BRICS members have tensions with the US?</h2><p>Nearly all members of BRICS have problems with the current US government.</p><p>Besides the dispute over Iran joining the naval drills, South Africa is also caught up in a battle of narratives with the Trump administration, which alleges, without any evidence, that the country’s minority white population is being subjected to a “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/fact-check-do-trumps-white-genocide-claims-to-ramaphosa-hold-up\">genocide</a>“. In 2025, Trump established a <a href=\"/features/2025/5/15/theyll-be-back-white-afrikaners-leave-south-africa-to-be-refugees-in-us\">refugee programme</a> for white Afrikaners wishing to “flee” to the US.</p><p>The US has also condemned South Africa’s decision to take Israel to the International Court of Justice in December 2023.</p><p>The US currently levies tariffs on South African exports of up to 40 percent as a result.</p><p>China has been locked in a tense trade war with the US for more than a year. After slapping each other with tariffs exceeding 100 percent early last year, these were suspended pending trade talks. But China then restricted exports of its rare earth metals, which are required for technology crucial for defence, and Trump again threatened more tariffs before the two sides reached an <a href=\"/news/2025/6/27/trump-says-us-has-signed-trade-deal-with-china\">agreement</a> in late October, under which China agreed to “pause” restrictions on the export of some metals.</p><p>Russia is also on Washington’s radar because of its war in Ukraine.</p><p>Just three days before the drills began, the US seized a Venezuela-linked Russian oil tanker in the North Atlantic due to its sanctions on both countries.</p><p>On January 3, the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the capital, Caracas. Both now face drugs and weapons charges in a New York federal court. In September, the US had begun a campaign of air strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, claiming they were trafficking drugs to the US, but providing no evidence.</p><p>India has been hit with 50 percent tariffs on its exports to the US, partly as <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/us-imposes-50-percent-tariff-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases\">punishment</a> for continuing to buy Russian oil.</p><p>This month, the US withdrew from the India-led International Solar Alliance, although this withdrawal was part of a broader move to pull the US out of several international bodies.</p><p>Harsh V Pant, a geopolitical analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, told Al Jazeera that, for India, keeping out of the naval drills was “about balancing ties with the US”.</p><p>Pant added that in India’s opinion, “war games” were never part of the BRICS mandate.</p><p>While BRICS was founded as an economic bloc, it has widened its mandate to include security.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3823022\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3823022\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3823022\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-06T142428Z_1117404647_RC22HFACJHQ0_RTRMADP_3_BRICS-SUMMIT-BRAZIL-1751885241.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"brics\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3823022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaders and top diplomats from Brazil, China, Russia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran meet at the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6, 2025 [Pilar Olivares/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2>What has the response been in South Africa?</h2><p>Ramaphosa’s government has also faced some backlash over the drills at home.</p><p>The Democratic Alliance (DA), a former opposition party that is now part of the governing coalition and largely represents the interests of the white minority, blamed Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola for failing to hold the Department of Defence to account.</p><p>Lamola is from the African National Congress (ANC) party, which, until 2024, governed South Africa alone.</p><p>“By allowing the Department of Defence to proceed unchecked in these military exercises, Minister Lamola has effectively outsourced South Africa’s foreign policy to the whims of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), exposing the country to serious diplomatic and economic risk,” the DA said in a statement two days after the exercises started.</p><p>“South Africa is now perceived not as a principled non-aligned state, but as a willing host for military cooperation with authoritarian regimes.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-south-african-government-saying-now\">What is the South African government saying now?</h2><p>South African officials have shifted from initially justifying the drills to distancing themselves from the Iran debacle.</p><p>Despite initial statements from officials that the drills would go ahead as planned, Ramaphosa eventually appeared to bow to US pressure and, on January 9, ordered that Iran be excluded, local media reported.</p><p>Those instructions do not seem to have been followed by the South African Defence Department or the military, however.</p><p>In a statement on January 16, Defence Minister Angie Motshekga’s office said Ramaphosa’s instructions had been “clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and adhered to as such”.</p><p></p><p>The statement went on to say that the minister had established an inquiry board “to look into the circumstances surrounding the allegations and establish whether the instruction of the President may have been misrepresented and/or ignored as issued to all”.</p><p>A report on the investigation is expected on Friday.</p><p>This is not the first time South Africa has been criticised for its military relations with Iran.</p><p>In August, its military chief, General Rudzani Maphwanya, prompted anger from the DA when he embarked on a trip to Tehran and affirmed that South Africa and Iran had “common goals”.</p><p>His statement came just weeks after the Iran-Israel war. He was also reportedly critical of Israel while in Tehran.</p><p>Some ANC critics called for Maphwanya’s firing, but he has remained in office.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has destroyed the majority of its housing and infrastructure, and killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, leaving the rest of Gaza’s population facing a harsh winter with inadequate food, medicine, and shelter.</p><p>And yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – for whom the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for war crimes committed in Gaza – this week <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">joined</a> US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, established to oversee the reconstruction and governance of Gaza.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>It opens up the question of what Netanyahu – and Israel – actually want from the Palestinian territory, and whether they want the territory to rebuild or just want a continuation of the status quo.</p><p>Ahead of Netanyahu lies a difficult journey, observers say. With Israeli elections looming later this year, he must appear to the world and the Israeli public as working with US ambitions for Gaza.</p><p>But he also needs to maintain his governing coalition, which relies in part on elements, such as his Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who are not just opposed to the reconstruction of Gaza, but also opposed to the ceasefire in a territory that he and his allies – as religious Zionists – regard themselves as divinely entitled to settle upon.</p><p>So far, things do not seem to be going entirely Netanyahu’s way. He has failed to delay the transition to the second phase of Trump’s three-phase ceasefire plan, despite Hamas’s refusal to disarm. Similarly, despite his objections, Gaza’s Rafah crossing is due to open in both directions, allowing people in and out of the enclave, next week. Lastly, his protestations against Turkiye and Qatar <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">joining</a> the Board of Peace, and potentially deploying forces to Gaza as part of a proposed International Stabilisation Force, also appear to have been overruled by the US.</p><h2 id=\"settlement-or-security\">Settlement or security</h2><p>At home, Netanyahu’s cabinet remains divided on Gaza. On Monday, Smotrich not only slammed US proposals as “bad for Israel”, but on Monday, called for the US base in southern Israel responsible for overseeing the ceasefire to be dismantled. Meanwhile, others in the Israeli parliament have primarily focused on the upcoming elections, aiming only to galvanise their political base, regardless of ideology.</p><p>Netanyahu continues to insist that Hamas will be disarmed, and the Israeli military is working on razing territory all along the border with Gaza, creating a buffer zone deep into the coastal enclave.</p><p>Even if Hamas does not completely lose all its weapons, it has been weakened, and pushing Palestinians further away from the Israeli border allows the Israeli government to project the image of security for its population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Israeli public, exhausted after more than two years of war, largely relegates the consequences of Israel’s actions to the back pages of national media.</p><p>“The public is deeply divided on Gaza and the Board of Peace,” said American-Israeli political consultant and pollster Dahlia Scheindlin. “Though there’s a minority bloc favouring resettling Gaza, most of Israeli society is splintered. People typically view Gaza with a mixture of fear and a need for security, driven entirely by the events of October 2023. They want Israel to remain in Gaza in some form and don’t trust outsiders to handle it. At the same time, there’s hope that US involvement could achieve what two years of war couldn’t.”</p><p>“However, nearly everyone starts from the same point: Anything is better than going back to war,” Scheindlin said.</p><p>“They don’t have a strategy, and everything is chaos,” peace campaigner Gershon Baskin said, referring to Israel’s leaders. “They’re in election mode and only speaking to their base. I went to the Knesset yesterday. It’s like watching lunatics in a house of madness. It’s a disaster.”</p><p>For much of the public, Palestinians remain invisible. “They don’t exist. Israel has probably killed more than 100,000, but the majority of Israelis don’t know or care what’s going on the other side of the border. We even dispute there’s a border; it’s just ours,” Baskin said. “We don’t even see it on TV. All they show are old clips on loop. You can find images of Gaza on social media, but you have to go looking for it.</p><p>“Most Israelis don’t.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4057773\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4057773\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4057773\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68fbbc307bec0-1761328176.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinians walk through the destruction caused by the Israeli air and ground offensive in the Al-Shati camp, in Gaza City, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

Currently, according to analysts within Israel, there appears to be no plan for the coexistence that geography dictates, only the unspoken suspicion that outside powers, in this case the US, are not really capable of determining how best to achieve it.</p><p>Even Israel’s commitment to US plans is open to question, with Netanyahu – when safely outside of Trump and his team’s earshot – framing the ceasefire’s second phase as a “declarative move”, rather than the definite sign of progress described by US envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>“The genocide hasn’t stopped. It’s continuing; it’s just moved from active to passive,” said Israeli lawmaker Ofer Cassif. “Israel is not bombing Gaza as before, but now it is leaving the people there to freeze and starve.

However, according to the latest outlook by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, more than 15 million Ethiopians are in need of emergency food aid amid shrinking international humanitarian support.</p><p>The government agency said it recently distributed food aid worth the equivalent of $1.8m to the Tigray provincial government, blaming them for misappropriation and distribution problems. The provincial government, however, denies receiving such support.</p><p>The head of the Tigray Disaster Risk Management Commission, Gebrehiwot Gebre-Egziahber, told Al Jazeera the provincial government has been forced to cut humanitarian support in most places across the region, mainly in rural areas where severe hunger affects a large population.</p><p>Despite Addis Ababa’s insistence that the situation is stable, with dwindling international humanitarian aid and an overwhelming hunger crisis causing people to flee in desperation, this month the government belatedly announced that it will soon launch a new tax system on fuel and telecommunications to help fund local initiatives to curb the impending famine that many say is in Ethiopia’s future.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257896\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257896\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257896\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG-20260121-WA0012-1769018486-e1769113405287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4257896\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chronically ill, Marta Tadesse believes hunger will ultimately kill her [Samuel Getachew/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"running-short-of-burial-space\">Running short of burial space</h2><p>Almaz Gebrezedel, 71, has lived in Hitsats for four years.

Experts have told PolitiFact that Greenland’s status as part of Denmark is not in question, and has not been for more than a century.</p><p>Denmark’s colonisation of Greenland dates to the 1720s. In 1933, an international court settled a territorial dispute between Denmark and Norway, ruling that as of July 1931, Denmark “possessed a valid title to the sovereignty over all Greenland”.</p><p>After the 1945 approval of the United Nations Charter – the organisation’s founding document and the foundation of much of international law – Denmark incorporated Greenland through a constitutional amendment and gave it representation in the Danish Parliament in 1953. Denmark told the UN that any colonial-type status had ended; the UN General Assembly accepted this change in November 1954. The US was among the nations that voted to accept Greenland’s new status.</p><p>Since then, Greenland has, incrementally but consistently, moved towards greater autonomy.</p><p>Greenlandic political activists successfully pushed for and achieved home rule in 1979, which established its parliament. Today, Greenland is a district within the sovereign state of Denmark, with two elected representatives in Denmark’s Parliament.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-iceland\">What about Iceland?</h2><p>Four times in the Davos speech, Trump referred to Iceland instead of Greenland.</p><p>“Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland has already cost us a lot of money, but that dip is peanuts compared to what it’s gone up, and we have an unbelievable future.”</p><p>US markets reacted negatively to Trump’s Greenland comments the day before his Davos speech, falling about 2 percent in value.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Trump has said nothing about acquiring Iceland, an independent island nation with nearly 400,000 residents, located east of Greenland.</p><p>In an X post following Trump’s Davos address, the White House press secretary criticised a reporter for posting that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland” several times. Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s “written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is”. Although Trump did call Greenland a “very big piece of ice”, he also separately mentioned “Iceland”.</p><p>Traditionally, Icelanders have maintained strong ties to the US, dating back to World War II, when Reykjavik invited US troops into the country. In 1949, Iceland became a founding member of NATO, and in 1951, the two countries signed a bilateral defence agreement that still stands.</p><p>Its location – between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans, a strategic naval choke point in the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap – means that Iceland, despite its lack of a standing military, is geographically important for both North America and Europe.</p><p>In 2006, the US gave up its permanent troop presence at the Keflavík airbase – a 45-minute drive south of the capital, Reykjavik – but US troops still rotate through. Icelandic civilians now handle key NATO tasks such as submarine surveillance and operations at four radar sites on the nation’s periphery. Iceland also makes financial contributions to NATO trust funds and contributes a small number of technical and diplomatic personnel to NATO operations.</p><p>Trump’s pick for ambassador to Iceland, former Republican Congressman Billy Long, attracted criticism earlier this month when he was overheard saying Iceland should become a US state after Greenland, and that he would serve as governor.</p><p>Long apologised during an interview with Arctic Today.</p><p>“There was nothing serious about that. I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland, and they started joking about me. And if anyone took offence to it, then I apologise,” Long told the publication. Trump has tapped Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, to be the US envoy to Greenland.</p><p>Silja Bara R Omarsdottir, an international affairs professor who now serves as rector, or president, of the University of Iceland, told the Tampa Bay Times in August that newfound attention to Iceland’s security, including concerns over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the rest of Europe, is “definitely very noticeable at the political level”.</p><p>Multiple analysts in Iceland told the daily, only half-jokingly, that the key to surviving the Trump era has been to remain out of sight, something Greenland, for whatever reason, was unlucky enough not to be able to do.</p><p>“You could say Icelandic policy towards the US has been to try to keep under the radar,” said Pia Elisabeth Hansson, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the University of Iceland.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A 17-year-old student was taken on Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.</p><p>The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said on Thursday that Liam and his father were taken to an immigration lockup in Dilley, Texas, and that he assumes they were being held in a family holding cell.</p><p>“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or moral pressure,” he said at a news conference.</p><p>A lawyer who visited the Dilley detention facility last week, as part of an ongoing lawsuit to ensure the safekeeping of immigrant children in federal custody, said conditions were deteriorating.</p><p>“The conditions were worse than ever,” said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsellor at the advocacy group Children’s Rights.</p><p>“The number of children had skyrocketed, and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said.</p><p>“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick – and it seemed there was an epidemic of illnesses going around. Families reported that their children were malnourished, extremely ill, and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention,” Welch said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said he heard the “terrible story” about Liam, but said he was not sure what the federal agents could have done differently.</p><p>“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he was also the parent of a five-year-old.</p><p>US federal agents have arrested some 3,000 people in immigration raids across Minnesota in recent weeks, according to Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official.</p><p>Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.</p><p>Also on Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said that three people have been arrested in Minneapolis after they protested at Cities Church in St Paul, where they alleged one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director for the St Paul ICE field office. Those arrested included Minneapolis civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong and St Paul school board member Chauntyll Louisa Allen, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.</p><p>In a post on X, Bondi said that Armstrong had played a “key role” in organising the protest on Sunday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His statement, however, failed to identify the precise circumstances that prompted the warning.</p><p>“The US would consider anyone supporting such a disruptive step favoring the gangs to be acting contrary to the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people and will act accordingly,” Landau said.</p><p>Haiti continues to struggle with the ravages of widespread gang violence, instability and corruption in its government.</p><p>But the US threat is likely to send shudders throughout the region, particularly in the aftermath of the January 3 attack on Venezuela.</p><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly advanced the notion that the entire Western Hemisphere falls under its sphere of influence, as part of a policy it dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine”, a riff on the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine.</p><p>Trump has referenced that premise to justify the use of US military force to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as well as to claim the US needs to control Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"a-political-crisis\">A political crisis</h2><p>Located some 11,000 kilometres (800 miles) southeast of the US, Haiti has long struggled with instability. It is considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as it continues to suffer from the legacy of foreign intervention, dictatorship and natural disasters.</p><p>But in 2021, the country faced a new crisis when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in the capital, Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Federal elections have not been held since, leading to a crisis of confidence in the government. The last federally elected officials saw their terms expire in 2023.</p><p>Experts say the lack of leadership has allowed Haiti’s gangs to flourish, and since the Moise assassination, they have taken control of vast stretches of the territory, including up to 90 percent of the capital.</p><p>The resulting violence has forced more than 1.4 million Haitians from their homes. Millions more suffer from food insecurity, as thoroughfares are often restricted by gang-led roadblocks.</p><p>This week, a United Nations report found that, between January and November of last year, an estimated 8,100 people were killed in the violence. That marks an escalation from 2024, when the yearly total was 5,600.</p><p>But efforts have been made to restore the country’s stability. The Transitional Presidential Council was designed as a temporary governing structure to set the framework for new federal elections. Established in 2024, it has nine members who rotate to serve as chair.</p><p>Very quickly, however, the council faced criticism for its membership – largely selected from the country’s business and political elite – and allegations of corruption swirled. Infighting has also broken out among the members.</p><p>The US too has added to the tensions on the council. In November, it <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-imposes-visa-sanctions-against-haitian-official-on-governing-council\">announced visa restrictions</a> against an unnamed government official, later identified in the media as one of the council’s members, economist Fritz Alphonse Jean.</p><p>While the council had been slated to hold tiered elections starting last November, it failed to meet that benchmark, and the first vote has been postponed to August.</p><p>In the meantime, the council’s mandate is set to dissolve on February 7, and the panel’s future remains unclear.</p><h2 id=\"un-calls-for-action\">UN calls for action</h2><p>In this week’s report on Haiti, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres linked Haiti’s ongoing humanitarian crisis to the vacuum in its government.</p><p>“Violence has intensified and expanded geographically, exacerbating food insecurity and instability, as transitional governance arrangements near expiry and overdue elections remain urgent,” Guterres said.</p><p>Another UN representative – Carlos Ruiz-Massieu, who leads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) – was also emphatic about the immediate need for transparent democratic processes and unified governance.</p><p>“Let us be clear: the country no longer has time to waste on prolonged internal struggles,” he said.</p><p>Still, in a speech on Wednesday to the UN Security Council, Ruiz-Massieu added that there have been “encouraging” signs ahead of this year’s scheduled elections. He applauded efforts to increase voter registration, including in Haiti’s diaspora, and encourage political participation among women.</p><p>But Ruiz-Massieu underscored that security concerns, including gang violence, could impede the democratic process, and that there was more work to be done before elections could be held.</p><p>“Achieving this goal will require sustained coordination among relevant institutions, predictable financing of the electoral process and security conditions that allow all voters and candidates to participate without fear,” he said.</p><p>The UN also signalled it would bolster its multinational security support mission in Haiti with more troops later this year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This week, it switched its offer from a cash and stock combination to an <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/netflix-switches-its-warner-bros-offer-to-all-cash-deal-to-quell-paramount\">all-cash deal </a>that the companies say is more straightforward and will speed the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of that deal is about $83bn, or $27.75 per share.</p><p>Paramount, however, argues its offer is better and has accused Warner’s leadership of a lack of transparency with shareholders.</p><p>On Thursday, the company said Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, warning that debt from a previously announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business could reduce the eventual payout to shareholders.</p><p>The battle for Warner is complicated by the fact that Netflix and Paramount are seeking different assets.</p><p>A successful deal would reshape Hollywood by handing control of franchises from Friends to Batman, along with the HBO Max streaming service, to a single buyer.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-deal-lingers\">Netflix deal lingers</h2><p>Netflix’s bid covers only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including HBO Max and its TV and film production arms. Paramount’s offer, by contrast, is for the entire company, including its news and cable operations, potentially putting CNN under the same roof as CBS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Netflix prevails, Warner’s networks would be spun off into a separate company called Discovery Global under a previously announced plan.</p><p>A sale of Warner Bros Discovery <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is expected to be lengthy</a> and face intense antitrust scrutiny. Politics are likely to play a role under Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement in the approval process.</p><p>The Ellisons have argued that their relationship with Trump gives them an easier regulatory path. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday that the company has made progress toward securing the necessary approvals.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance is up 1.9 percent, Warner Bros Discovery is down 0.4 percent.

At a minimum, he committed large scale perjury!”</p><p>All the while, Smith told the committee his investigations were nonpartisan — and that there were, indeed, grounds to bring two federal indictments against Trump during the period between his two terms in office.</p><p>“I made my decisions without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith told the congressional panel.</p><p>“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the law — the very laws he took an oath to uphold.”</p><p>Formerly a war-crimes prosecutor at an international tribunal in The Hague, Smith was selected to serve as special counsel in 2022, under former Democratic President Joe Biden.</p><p>Special counsels are tapped to operate independently, without the usual day-to-day oversight from politically appointed Justice Department leadership.</p><p>But Smith’s mandate was particularly sensitive.

So were Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, when thousands of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an apparent attempt to disrupt the certification of the election results.</p><p>Smith ultimately determined that Trump had intentionally attempted to subvert the vote. In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the country, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the free exercise of rights under the US Constitution.</p><p>A separate grand jury, this time in the state of Florida, issued a second federal indictment in June 2023, related to another probe Smith led.</p><p>That investigation focused on Trump’s decision to withhold classified documents after leaving office and defy a subpoena for their return. Trump was ultimately charged with 40 counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements, and failing to adhere to standards concerning sensitive documents under the Espionage Act.</p><p>Both federal cases were dropped after Trump was re-elected in 2024. It is Justice Department policy not to investigate or prosecute sitting presidents. Smith himself resigned shortly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.</p><p>Nevertheless, at Thursday’s hearing, Smith defended the indictments and suggested his cases would have been successful had the circumstances been different.</p><p>“I want to be clear: I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump,” Smith told the committee.</p><p>“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”</p><p>He added that the evidence compelled him to move forward with the indictments, regardless of the high-profile defendant.</p><p>“The law required that he be held to account,” Smith said. “So that is what I did. To have done otherwise on the facts of these cases would’ve been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor.”</p><p>Later on in his testimony, he emphasised his stance: “ We were ready, willing and able to go to trial in the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260495\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260495\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022580949846-1769102231.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jim Jordan and Jamie Raskin on the House Judiciary panel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and ranking member Representative Jamie Raskin speak to Jack Smith on January 22 [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"republican-criticisms\">Republican criticisms</h2><p>But Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to portray Smith as a partisan shill whose mission was to take down Biden’s political rival.</p><p>Some of the most aggressive questioning came from Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, who cast doubt on Smith’s independence as special prosecutor.</p><p>“You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. Maybe they’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they?” Issa asked.</p><p>“They were the enemies of the president. And you were their arm, weren’t you?”</p><p>Smith replied to the accusation with a single word: “No.”</p><p>Issa went on to assert that, in spreading false statements denying his 2020 election defeat, Trump was simply expressing his First Amendment right to free speech.</p><p>“ You understand the Constitution? Do you understand the Bill of Rights that someone has the absolute right to believe something, whether it’s true or not, and to advocate for something whether it’s true or not?” Issa said at one point.</p><p>“So if you know that people have a right to opine, lobby for, assert [and] do everything they can legally to ask for people to make different decisions, then why is it you saw criminal conduct on behalf of a president who believed he didn’t win?”</p><p>Smith was not able to respond to that question, but his indictment asserts that Trump went beyond simply voicing his disagreement with the results.</p><p>Rather, it argues that Trump and his allies attempted to recruit “false electors” to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for certification, and it highlights evidence that Trump pressured elected officials to reject unfavourable vote outcomes.</p><p>Another key point of criticism among Republicans was Smith’s decision to seek “limited toll records” from the telephones of nine lawmakers who communicated with Trump during his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was among the Congress members targeted.</p><p>Such toll records do not include the content of the calls in question. Rather, they identify where the call originated from, who it was received by, and how long the connection lasted.</p><p>Republicans argued that subpoenaing the telephone records amounted not only to a violation of privacy but also to an infringement of the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from legal action stemming from their legislative duties.</p><p>Conservative members of the committee also questioned the secrecy of the subpoenas, something Smith argued was necessary.</p><p>“The subpoenas that we secured, we secured with non-disclosure orders from a judge because I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation,” Smith responded.</p><p>“Specifically with regards to Donald Trump, not only did we have the obstruction of justice that we were investigating in the classified documents case, but I was aware during the course of our investigation of the targeting of witnesses.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260513\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022607184489-1769103274.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A photographer snaps a shot of Jack Smith at a committee meeting.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith takes his seat as he prepares to testify [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"smith-defends-team-s-work\">Smith defends team’s work</h2><p>While Republicans blasted Smith for what they perceived to be prosecutorial missteps, Democrats praised him as a paragon of integrity.</p><p>“I want you to lean in today. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You did everything right, sir,” Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told Smith.</p><p>He then proceeded to accuse his Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, particularly after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.</p><p>“These guys are so lucky they’re not under oath because they would have to tell you what they really think of Trump,” Swalwell said, gesturing to the Republicans on the panel. “ They call him crooked. They call him cruel. They call him a scumbag. I’ve heard you all say it.”</p><p>Swalwell invited Smith to reflect on the Capitol attack and how he felt watching Trump supporters break into the legislature while lawmakers fled. At the time, Smith was in Europe on behalf of the State Department, working on the war-crimes tribunal.</p><p>“ I was shocked by it. Being in Europe and not following things as closely, I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it,” Smith replied. “ I just had never seen anything like that happen in our country.”</p><p>Smith also denied that he faced any pressure from the Biden administration to come to any foregone conclusion.</p><p>“ I was given the independence to conduct my investigation,” he said.</p><p>Since being named special prosecutor, Smith has become a frequent target for criticism on the political right. Just this week, Trump himself called Smith a “sick son of a b****” who led a group of “ handpicked radical-left Marxist prosecutors”.</p><p>Over the past year, the Trump administration has largely removed the nonpartisan federal employees who were involved in the two federal investigations Smith led.</p><p>Smith used Thursday’s committee hearing to lash out at those employment decisions, accusing Trump of seeking retribution against government workers who served presidents of both parties.</p><p>“ I’m proud of the work my team did, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to correct false and misleading narratives about our work,” Smith told the panel.</p><p>“President Trump has sought to seek revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff simply for having worked on these cases,” he added. “To vilify and seek retribution against these people is wrong. Those dedicated public servants are the best of us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260590\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260590\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022583919808-1769107061.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jack Smith testifies at House Judiciary Committee\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260590\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The House Judiciary Committee hears Jack Smith’s testimony [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"president-responds-to-smith-s-testimony\">President responds to Smith’s testimony</h2><p>Trump, meanwhile, appeared to be watching Smith’s testimony live. In the midst of the committee’s back-and-forth dialogue, the president posted on Truth Social a message applauding Republicans for their takedowns of Smith.</p><p>“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115939889414201547\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”</p><p>Trump also suggested Smith should face professional penalties or even prosecution, in a message seemingly directed at the Justice Department.</p><p>“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done,” Trump continued.</p><p>“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”</p><p>Trump has deployed a similar tactic in the past, using his social media account <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in September</a> to direct the Justice Department to indict <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james\">other critics of his actions</a>, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.</p><p>Smith was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-house-judiciary-committee-subpoenas-former-trump-prosecutor-jack-smith\">subpoenaed</a> by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in early December and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-defends-record-before-republican-lawmakers\">testified</a> later that month in a closed-door hearing, despite his protestations that the proceedings should be public.</p><p>He is currently under a gag order barring him from divulging evidence about the classified documents case, though US District Judge Aileen Cannon indicated she would allow his report to be released on February 24. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.</p><p>As part of his prepared remarks, Smith implored his audience to defend the rule of law, regardless of which party might seek to undermine it.</p><p>“After nearly 30 years of public service, including in international settings, I have seen how the rule of law can erode,” Smith said.</p><p>“My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in our country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted. The rule of law is not self-executing. It depends on our collective commitment to apply it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
