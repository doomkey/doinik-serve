Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, and Mahara is close to the border.</p><p>Saudi Arabia on Tuesday said it was disappointed about “pressure exerted by the UAE” on the STC to conduct military operations in the Hadramout and Mahara provinces. Riyadh said it considered the moves a threat to its national security.</p><p>“In this context, the kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat,” it said.</p><p>Following Tuesday’s rapid-fire events, the UAE’s Ministry of Defence said it carried out a “comprehensive assessment” of its role in Yemen and decided to end its mission there.</p><p>“In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel,” the UAE statement said.</p><p>The UAE announcement came amid efforts to tamp down tensions that have erupted in recent days.</p><p>Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it welcomed the Saudi Arabian and UAE statements, which it said reflected a “commitment to prioritising the interests of the region, strengthening the principles of good neighbourliness, and adhering to the foundations and principles upon which the GCC Charter is based.”</p><p>The Gulf Cooperation Council consists of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the UAE.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held telephone conversations with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, discussing “regional developments”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tensions-over-the-stc\">Tensions over the STC</h2><p>The Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s strike on Yemen’s Mukalla revealed widening tensions within a coalition built in 2015 to combat the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen.</p><p>Emirati troops first arrived in Yemen as part of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition that year, but the UAE pulled most of its forces out in 2019, leaving only a limited number in the government-run south.</p><p>Following the Mukalla strike, which did not cause casualties, Rashad al-Alimi, the head of Yemen’s Saudi Arabia-backed presidential council, dissolved a defence pact with the UAE and gave Emirati forces 24 hours to leave.</p><p>In a televised speech, al-Alimi said it had been “definitively confirmed ‌that the UAE pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation”, according to the Yemeni state news agency.</p><p>Saudi Arabia backed al-Alimi’s call for the UAE to withdraw its forces from Yemeni territory, and asked that it halt “any military or financial support to any party” in the country.</p><p>The UAE said it had been surprised by the Saudi Arabian air strike, and that the shipments in question did not contain weapons and were destined for the Emirati forces, rather than the STC.</p><p>It also said that it was committed to ensuring the security of Saudi Arabia and that it was seeking a solution “that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination”.</p><p>Yemeni state television showed what it said was black smoke rising from the port in the early morning, with burned vehicles. Al-Alimi declared a no-fly zone, and a sea and ground blockade on all ports and crossings for 72 hours.</p><p>However, the STC remained defiant, insisting there was “no thinking about withdrawal” from its newly seized positions.</p><p>“It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing,” STC spokesman Anwar al-Tamimi told the AFP news agency.</p><p>“We are in a defensive position, and any movement toward our forces will be responded to by our forces,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition.</p><p>Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close:</p><h2 id=\"gdp-growth\">GDP growth</h2><p>After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent.</p><p>That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries.</p><p>During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis.</p><p>Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p>By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025.</p><p>That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy.</p><p>While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped.</p><p>Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity.</p><p>“We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.”</p><h2 id=\"consumer-sentiment\">Consumer sentiment</h2><p>While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows.</p><p>The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high.</p><p>Yet Americans are continuing to spend.</p><p>Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024.</p><p>The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year.</p><p>The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means.</p><p>The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics.</p><p>Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10.</p><p>“Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said.</p><p>Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure.</p><p>“The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"us-stock-market\">US stock market</h2><p>After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note.</p><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent.</p><p>While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households.</p><p>Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup.</p><h2 id=\"inflation\">Inflation</h2><p>Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent.</p><p>Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch.</p><p>In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable.</p><p>Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs.</p><p>Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year.</p><p>“Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office.</p><p>However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact.</p><p>“The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said.</p><p>“Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.”</p><h2 id=\"employment\">Employment</h2><p>Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January.</p><p>The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people.</p><p>Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For the roughly 500 families who live there, in houses of nipa grass and rattan, the developments spell disaster.</p><p>“We were here before the Americans, even before the Spanish,” said Petronila Capiz, 60, the chieftain of the Aeta Hungey tribe in Sapang Kawayan. “And the land continues to be taken from us.”</p><p>Historians say American colonisers, who seized the Philippines from Spain in 1898, took over the 32,000-hectare (80,000-acre) tract that became Clark Air Base in the 1920s, dispossessing the Aetas, a seminomadic and dark-skinned people thought to be among the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants.</p><p>Many were displaced, though some moved deeper into the jungle inside the base and were employed as labourers.</p><p>The US turned over the base to the Philippine government in 1991, some four decades after granting the country independence. Since then, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, or BCDA, has managed the complex. Some 20,000 Aetas are thought to remain in the Clark area today, spread across 32 villages.</p><p>But most of their claims to the land are not recognised.</p><p>In Sapang Kawayan, residents fear the government’s development boom means they could be pushed out long before they can establish such claims. The community – along with other Aeta villages in Clark – is working with researchers from the University of the Philippines to expedite a long-pending application for a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title, or CADT — the only legal mechanism that would allow them to assert rights to their territory and its resources.</p><p>In January, July and September, Aetas young and old gathered under makeshift wooden shelters in Sapang Kawayan, assembling family trees and sharing stories and photographs. Volunteers documented each detail in hopes of demonstrating that the community there predates colonial rule.</p><p>Their 17,000-hectare claim overlaps with nearly all of the 9,450 hectares designated for New Clark City, while 14 kilometres to the south is the airport complex where the new railway line, runway and stadium are slated to rise.</p><p>Together, the new city and airport complex “will eat up the fields where we farm, the rivers where we fish and the mountains where we get our herbs”, Capiz said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194888\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194888\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/geneaology-gathering-3-1766643752.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"As part of a requirement to claim their ancestral lands, the Aeta Hungey gather in the village of Sapang Kawayan to trace their genealogy back hundreds of years ago.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aetas work with researchers at the University of the Philippines to expedite their application for an ancestral land title [Michael Beltran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"taylor-swift-ready\">‘Taylor Swift-ready’</h2><p>The Philippine government first announced plans for New Clark City under then-President Rodrigo Duterte, promoting it as a solution to the crippling congestion in Metro Manila. The BCDA describes the development as a “green, smart and disaster-resilient metropolis”.</p><p>Construction began in 2018 with major roads and a sports complex that hosted the Southeast Asian Games in 2019.</p><p>Designed to accommodate 1.2 million people, the city is expected to take at least 30 years to complete.</p><p>The BCDA is now building three highways linking New Clark City to the airport complex, where the “Taylor Swift–ready” stadium is planned. Officials have hyped that the stadium, to be built by 2028, will lure Swift after she skipped the Philippines during the South Asian leg of her Eras tour last year.</p><p>“One of the main elements that make Clark so attractive to investors is its unmatched connectivity,” the BCDA’s president, Joshua Bingcang, said this year, citing the airport, a nearby seaport and major expressways. “But we need to further build on this connectivity and invest more in infrastructure.”</p><p>That expansion has come at a cost for Aeta communities.</p><p>Counter-Mapping PH, a research organisation, and campaigners estimate that hundreds of Aeta families have been displaced since construction of the city began, including dozens of families who were given just a week in 2019 to “voluntarily” vacate ahead of the Southeast Asian Games.</p><p>They warn that thousands more could be uprooted as development continues.</p><p>The BCDA has offered financial compensation of $0.51 per square metre as well as resettlement for affected families. In July, it broke ground on 840 housing units, though it is unclear whether they are intended for displaced Aetas.</p><p>The agency maintains that no displacement has occurred because Aetas have no proven legal claim to the area. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the BCDA said it “upholds the welfare and rights of Indigenous peoples” and acknowledges their “long historical presence” in central Luzon, where Clark is located. However, it noted that Clark’s boundaries follow “long-established government ownership” dating to the US military base, and that the New Clark City does not encroach on any recognised ancestral domains.</p><p>The BCDA also contended that it is the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) that deals with the applications for a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title, and stressed that it respected “lands awarded to Indigenous peoples”.</p><p>The Clark International Airport Corporation, which oversees the airport complex, offered similar assurances, stating that “there are no households or communities existing in the said location”. The group added that while the extended Clark area has Aeta communities, none exist within the airport complex itself.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20190719__1IX3GU__v1__HighRes__Seagames2019Phi-1766644683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Labourers work on buildings in the games village for this year's Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in New Clark City in Capas town.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Labourers work on buildings in the games village for the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in New Clark City in Capas town, Tarlac province, north of Manila, on July 19, 2019 [Ted Jibe/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"since-time-immemorial\">‘Since time immemorial’</h2><p>Only a handful of Aeta tribes have been awarded CADTs.</p><p>Two certificates have been granted on the outskirts of Clark, while the application filed by Sapang Kawayan and other villages inside the base have languished since 1986.</p><p>Marcial Lengao, head of NCIP’s Tarlac office, told Al Jazeera that to grant Aetas in Clark a CADT they must “prove that they have been there since time immemorial”, meaning, during or before the arrival of the Spanish colonisers to the archipelago 400 years ago.</p><p>The commission, he said, specifies minimum requirements for a CADT: a genealogy of at least five clans dating back at least three generations or to the precolonial period, testimonies from elders, a map of the domain and a census of the current population.</p><p>Lengao said Sapang Kawayan’s application has yet to complete these.</p><p>But even if the application is granted, the village faces another unique hurdle. Because the BCDA owns land rights to Clark, any CADT approved by the commission in the area must then be deliberated by the executive branch or the president’s office.</p><p>“They will be responsible for finding a win-win solution,” Lengao said.</p><p>Activists, however, denounced the NCIP’s requirements as onerous and warned that the longer Aetas remain without a CADT, the more vulnerable they are to losing their lands.</p><p>“Without a CADT and without genuine recognition from the government, the Aetas will continue to be treated like squatters on their own land,” said Pia Montalban of Karapatan-Central Luzon, a local rights group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"among-the-most-abused-indigenous-filipinos\">‘Among the most abused Indigenous Filipinos’</h2><p>The Aetas, who rely on small-scale subsistence farming, are among the most historically disenfranchised Indigenous peoples in the Philippines. No official data exists on the Aeta population, but the government believes them to be a small subset of the Philippines’s Indigenous peoples, numbering in the tens of thousands nationwide.</p><p>The Aeta Tribe Foundation describes them as among the “poorest and least educated” groups in the nation.</p><p>“They are among the most abused Indigenous Filipinos,” said Jeremiah Silvestre, an Indigenous psychology expert who worked closely with Aeta communities until 2022 while teaching at the Tarlac State University. “Partly because of their good-natured culture, many have taken advantage of Aetas. Worse, they live off a land that is continuously taken from them.”</p><p>Silvestre, too, described the CADT process as “unnecessarily academic”, saying it required Indigenous elders to present complete genealogies and detailed maps to government officials in what he likened to “defending your dissertation”.</p><p>Changes in government personnel can restart the entire process, he noted.</p><p>A World Bank report last year found that Indigenous peoples in the Philippines “often face insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles in their efforts to process CADTs”. The report called recognising and protecting Indigenous land rights a “crucial step in addressing poverty and conflict”.</p><p>For the families of Sapang Kawayan, experts fear the lack of formal recognition could lead to displacement and homelessness.</p><p>“There’s no safety net,” Silvestre said. “We may see more Aetas begging on the street if this continues. Systemic poverty will also mean the loss of an Indigenous culture.”</p><p>Victor Valantin, an Indigenous Peoples Mandatory Representative for Tarlac Province, which includes parts of Clark, fears that the territory for the Aetas in the former base is shrinking as the new projects accelerate.</p><p>“We’ll have to move and move,” he said. “Shopping centres won’t move for us.”</p><p>Valantin went on to lament what he sees as a familiar imbalance.</p><p>“BCDA projects happen so fast,” he said. “But anything for us will be awfully slow.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid his fifth visit to the United States since President Donald Trump took office in January. Before the meeting between the two, the Israeli press described the prime minister as fully engaged in an attempt to placate his domestic political partners by achieving “concessions” from Trump. What were these concessions? They were predominantly related to denying Turkiye any presence in the Gaza stabilisation force and to US approval for an Israeli strike on Iran.</p><p>Netanyahu failed on both counts. Trump specifically referred to his good relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and spoke of “Bibi’s” respect for him, too. With regard to Iran, Trump mentioned Iran’s willingness to “make a deal” and provided clear guidelines for American involvement while saying nothing about authorising a solo Israeli operation. Israeli media suggests that Trump provided Israel with a “green light” for a strike on Iran. That is not reflected in Trump’s official statement in any way.</p><p>Trump talked about the reconstruction of Gaza beginning “soon”. When he spoke of the disarmament of Hamas, he said that it must happen or nearly 60 states will make it happen. Hamas has already agreed to disarm if the process is carried out by a Palestinian-led force. Trump said nothing to suggest that he does not agree with Hamas’s logic, especially when one considers the refusal of most participating countries to carry out a violent disarmament of the group. Trump also made no mention of the last hostage body held in Gaza as a necessary condition for moving to “Stage II” of the deal.</p><p>Nothing is more significant in Trump’s world than the use of language and symbolic gestures. When Trump referred to Netanyahu as a “great wartime prime minister” as he was discussing his blueprint for “peace”, he made it clear that his guest was running out of time. This was also clearly apparent when Trump said he had spoken with Israel’s official head of state, President Isaac Herzog, about a pardon for Netanyahu and was assured such a pardon was imminent. President Herzog, by the way, categorically denied that such a conversation had taken place.</p><p>What may be the best reflection of the Trump-Netanyahu meeting at Mar-a-Lago has to do with a brief conversation over the phone between Trump and Israeli Minister of Education Yoav Kish. The purpose of the call was for Kish to inform Trump that he will be awarded the Israel Prize on Israel’s Independence Day in 2026.</p><p>The award is given out by the minister of education in a televised ceremony attended by Israel’s leaders. It marks the official end of Independence Day celebrations. Its recipients are most frequently career academics at a late stage of their careers. The prize reflects a lifetime’s devotion to the expansion of human knowledge. Sometimes, special prizes are awarded in civic categories, most often for what is called a “life’s work”, such as fostering coexistence between Jews and Palestinians, promoting social equality, etc.</p><p>The prize, as understood by its name, is nearly always awarded to Israeli citizens but can be awarded to Jews living abroad and even to non-Jews who have made a “special contribution to the Jewish people”.</p><p>In other words, the Trump-Netanyahu meeting involved Trump instructing Netanyahu with regard to upcoming measures and Netanyahu snapping to attention and signalling his acceptance by heaping yet another semi-fictitious honour on Trump’s already crowded head.</p><p>Yet, despite these clear displays of the unequal nature of their relationships, there have been persistent voices suggesting that Trump and Netanyahu are operating in cahoots. According to such analyses, the United States fully supports the Israeli attempt to “change the Middle East” – Netanyahu’s favourite phrase – as the Americans make a pivot to Asia and the global race for dominance with China.</p><p>Israel will “take care” of the “Iranian threat” as the Arabs languish in their own irresolvable internal tensions and competitions. The mobilisation of Arab states after the Israeli strike on Doha is all but ignored.</p><p>These voices also point to the fact that Israel continues to completely ignore the “ceasefire” enacted by “Stage I” of the Trump plan, and does so with the full support of the United States. In fact, Trump said that Israel has “lived up” to the ceasefire “100 percent”, and that he has no problems with Israel’s actions in Gaza. These include bombing, destruction of buildings and infrastructure, the blocking of life-saving aid amid harsh weather and many other steps that ensure and expand the ongoing Israeli genocide.</p><p>It is indeed extremely difficult to reconcile this with the notion that Israel has run out of options for delaying Stage II and an internationally-brokered solution to Palestinian statehood. After all, one hears repeatedly from Israeli media about initiatives to “settle Gaza”, “relocate” 1.5 million Palestinians to Somaliland and dismantle the Oslo Accords, one ethnically cleansed Palestinian community at a time.</p><p>The US and other countries, like Germany and the UK, continue to buy Israeli arms at a massive rate and to equip Israel with arms of their own. How is it possible to reach a conclusion that the Israeli genocide is reaching its endgame?</p><p>The short answer is that it is not. Israel continues to kill, destroy, subvert and expand its efforts to destabilise any semblance of regional order. For example, Israel recognised the statehood of Somaliland in order to have a “dumping ground” for ethnically cleansed Palestinians, but also to pit the United Arab Emirates against Saudi Arabia, as both have conflicting interests in Somalia, and, by doing so, ensure that the Palestinian question is not addressed and that everyone remains frozen by fear of Israeli weapons.</p><p>The longer answer recognises the effects of this genocide on Israel itself: Genocide consumes genocidaires.</p><p>That is not to suggest that justice is assured by cosmic forces; far from it. Justice should be pursued at the most grounded and realistic level, as should the dignity and preservation of Palestinian lives.</p><p>However, the genocide has shaped Israel in its image on a daily, immediate level. Violence is rising as quickly as the prices of the staples, democracy is backsliding, and there is no end in sight to the “forever war”. This is not an abstract, “strategic” matter.</p><p>While Israel has been actively seeking to delete Palestinian identity for nearly 80 years, it has not succeeded in doing so. Israel’s internal contradictions have surfaced with paralysing force over the past two years.</p><p>Israel will not “die” or “recede”, but the gap between Israeli perceptions of the world and global perceptions of Israel has never been wider.</p><p>Trump and his vision of America do not appreciate “losers”. Israel no longer has any “wins” in the offing. It can and does kill and burn, procrastinate and obfuscate.</p><p>Even Trump recognises that this power has no lasting effects following its own immediate application. Israel has no options. There is no greater loss.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has previously also warned of possible attacks “on land”.</p><p>Caracas has rejected US accusations of drug trafficking, condemning its actions as “<a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/is-us-president-donald-trump-preparing-to-strike-venezuela\">illegal</a>” under international law and a violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty.</p><p>The Venezuelan government claims Washington is using drugs as a pretext for regime change and to seize the country’s oil wealth.</p><p>Moreover, United Nations <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">human rights experts</a> have condemned the partial naval blockade, finding it an illegal armed aggression against Venezuela, while urging the US Congress to intervene.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-attack-lead-to-an-imminent-war-with-venezuela\">Will this attack lead to an imminent war with Venezuela?</h2><p>Caracas-based analyst Elias Ferrer, of Orinoco Research, said if the US has in fact struck Venezuelan territory, it has “certainly violated international law” unless the attack was pre-approved by the Maduro government, which could be possible in light of recent conversations between the Venezuelan president and Trump in the past month.</p><p>Depending on the answer to that question, Ferrer said the incident could either “escalate, or actually de-escalate” the situation.</p><p>“Trump needs a victory before he can de-escalate in Venezuela, and this could be it: destroying an alleged drug-related target,” he said, citing the US bombing of Iran in July as an example during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June.</p><p>Iran responded by carrying out a pre-warned strike on a US base in Qatar, following which a ceasefire was announced between Iran and Israel within the next 24 hours.</p><p>If it was not pre-approved with Caracas, however, Alan McPherson, professor of Latin American studies at Temple University, said it represents a “serious escalation” by Washington as it is the first on Venezuelan territory.</p><p>“This has all the markings of a war of choice – militarily unnecessary – against a sovereign nation,” McPherson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Politically, the [US] administration wants to overthrow President Maduro – plain and simple,” he added.</p><p>In addition, McPherson said, while the US “may also want to damage the drug business” coming from Venezuela, Trump has been clear that he mostly wants to “reverse the nationalisation of petroleum to the benefit of American corporations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-campaign-really-about-oil\">Is the US campaign really about oil?</h2><p>Recent remarks by White House officials have raised questions about whether Venezuela’s large oil reserves are in fact the real source of tension with Caracas, rather than drug smuggling.</p><p>Venezuela has the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">world’s largest proven oil reserves</a>, and the US once partnered with the country to develop its oil fields. It was a founding member of OPEC in 1960 and became a major oil exporter, especially after PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, SA) was created in 1976, and all foreign oil companies were brought under state control.</p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied roughly 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day to the United States, making it one of the US’s largest foreign oil sources. However, exports began to decline sharply after Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998, as he reshaped the country’s oil sector, nationalising assets, restructuring PDVSA, and prioritising domestic and political objectives over traditional export markets.</p><p>The situation worsened under President Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez’s successor, when the Trump administration imposed oil sanctions in 2017 and then tightened them in 2019. These measures restricted Venezuela’s ability to sell crude to the US and limited access to international financial markets, further reducing the country’s oil exports.</p><p>Today, Chevron is the only US oil company that continues to operate in Venezuela under a special licence granted by former US President Joe Biden, which allows it to operate despite oil sanctions.</p><p>Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Donald Trump, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">said earlier this month</a> that Venezuela’s oil belongs to Washington, calling the country’s nationalisation of its petroleum industry “theft” and arguing that “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela”.</p><p>While US and British firms did invest in early development of oil projects in Venezuela, international law clearly recognises Venezuela’s sovereignty over its own resources.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925817\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"can-the-us-congress-intervene-to-prevent-trump-from-going-to-war\">Can the US Congress intervene to prevent Trump from going to war?</h2><p>Power over the military is divided in the United States. Congress is granted the power to declare war by the US Constitution, but the last time the US declared war was in World War II, in 1942. That means the longest wars the US has engaged in have been undeclared by Congress.</p><p>In addition to empowering the president to direct military actions during a declared war, the Constitution grants the president the authority to order the US military to respond to attacks and imminent threats. It is from these powers that the executive branch has been able to deploy military force against countries in the absence of a congressionally declared war.</p><p>The War Powers Resolution of 1974 was intended to limit the ability of the president to deploy the military in these non-war actions, imposing time limits on deployments without congressional authorisation, and imposing other requirements. However, enforcement has been spotty and broad executive interpretations of what does and does not require authorisation, as well as what is permitted by existing Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) have left the president with a relatively free hand.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Members of Congress have tried repeatedly to prevent Trump from taking military action against Venezuela.</p><p>Earlier this month, a group of Democratic and Republican US Congress representatives forced a vote that would have blocked US military action against Venezuela without congressional approval.</p><p>But the resolution was narrowly defeated in the Republican-controlled Congress by a vote of 216-210.</p><p>Academic McPherson said Congress can certainly refuse to declare war or to give the president “any authorisation to use force”.</p><p>“It can even cut off funds for specific military purposes. But the executive would likely defy any such restrictions, and this Republican Congress is unlikely to do any of the above.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
