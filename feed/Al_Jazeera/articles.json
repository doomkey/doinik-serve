They included career government employees involved in the prosecution of rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>During his Senate hearing, however, Bove categorically denied that he has acted as Trump’s “henchman”.</p><p>Still, Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the two Republicans to oppose the confirmation, said the evidence presented in the chamber portrayed Bove as “somebody who has counseled other attorneys that you should ignore the law, you should reject the law”.</p><p>“I don’t think that that individual should be placed in a lifetime seat on the bench,” Murkowski added.</p><p>Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, in an interview with MSNBC after Bove’s confirmation, gave a more blunt assessment: “This is a genuinely bad guy.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-approach\">A new approach?</h2><p>In his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump already helped to transform the US judiciary, appointing a total of 226 federal judges.</p><p>They include 54 appellate judges and three justices to serve on the nine-member Supreme Court.</p><p>Those appointments, largely based on chance vacancies, are almost always pulled from a pool of candidates approved by conservative groups like the Federalist Society.</p><p>That organisation has sought to <a href=\"/opinions/2022/6/29/the-federalist-society-architects-of-the-american-dystopia\">reshape</a> the country’s legal landscape with a rightward bent.</p><p>The Federalist Society says it advocates for “individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law”, and it has helped lay the groundwork for major conservative victories, including the overturning of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that had protected the nationwide right to abortion access.</p><p>But early this year, Trump signalled a break from the group, lashing out at its former leader, Leonard Leo, whom he called a “sleaze bag” and a “bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America”.</p><p>Trump argued that Leo had given him “bad advice”, leading him to appoint a Federalist Society-approved judge during his first term. That judge was among a panel that ruled against the president’s signature tariff policy in May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the Federalist Society has been conspicuously mum on Bove’s nomination, legal experts from both conservative and left-leaning circles have questioned whether his commitment to Trump would outweigh his commitment to jurisprudence.</p><p>Nunziata, from the Society of the Rule of Law, wrote that Trump’s past judicial appointees generally exhibited “judicial excellence and a commitment to the rule of law”.</p><p>“Many of them have proven their mettle in contentious litigation involving the president or his policies,” he explained.</p><p>But he proceeded to describe Bove’s conduct as “unthinkable” for a federal judge.</p><p>“The Bove nomination represents a stark and apparently intentional break from this successful model and should raise concerns across the ideological spectrum,” he wrote.</p><p>The progressive Alliance for Justice expressed a similar sentiment, writing that Bove’s “allegiance lies not with civil rights or the rule of law but with Trump and his authoritarian agenda to expand executive power far beyond the limits set by the Constitution”.</p><p>“Emil Bove’s record makes clear he is unfit for a lifetime seat on the federal bench.”</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Trump’s attacks on the federal judiciary – aimed at judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike – have been unprecedented in their own right.</p><p>Judges have openly speculated that the Trump administration may be found in contempt for ignoring court orders. And Trump himself has openly criticised judges as “deranged” or “lunatic” for opposing his policies.</p><p>But it remains unclear if Trump’s caustic approach to the judiciary will manifest in more controversial appointments like Bove.</p><p>Some analysts <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/25/federalist-society-judges-trump-bove-senate-00421065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted</a> that Trump has generally nominated judges from the more traditional conservative pipeline. It remains to be seen if Bove will be the exception or the start of a new trend.</p><p>Just this week, the Trump administration signalled it may continue to take an aggressive stance in its approach to the judiciary.</p><p>For example, the Justice Department filed a complaint on Monday that seeks to censure US District Court Judge James Boasberg, who attempted to block Trump-ordered deportation flights in March.</p><p>The complaint accused Boasberg of making inappropriate comments about the president’s administration, but critics see it as an effort to discredit a judge who has issued high-profile rulings against Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On the day of Bove’s appointment, Trump also took aim at a Senate custom that gives the minority party – in this case, the Democrats – an opportunity to block some lower-level federal judicial and prosecutorial nominations.</p><p>Under the so-called “blue slip” tradition, lawmakers are given the ability to veto the confirmation of federal district judges or federal prosecutors who will serve in their state. The practice, more akin to a gentleman’s agreement than an official policy, has long been seen as one of the last vestiges of bipartisanship in the US legislature.</p><p>While the custom does not apply to higher federal judges, including appellate or Supreme Court justices, its removal would make it easier for Trump to more fully assert his influence over all levels of the federal judiciary.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114938820270436889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Truth Social</a>, Trump called upon Republican senators to end the tradition, which he called “ancient and probably Unconstitutional”, as well as a “hoax”.</p><p>With the “blue slip”, he added, Democrats “have an ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates”.</p><p>Republican leaders in the Senate, however, have voiced reluctance to ending the tradition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, over the years, Congress has passed multiple laws ceding some of that power to the president.</p><p>Trump has justified his most far-reaching assertions of tariff power by citing the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows tariffs on all imports during an “unusual and extraordinary threat … to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States”.</p><p>Small businesses challenging that position in the case VOS Selections v Trump make two key arguments. They contend that the law doesn’t explicitly allow the president to impose tariffs. And they argue that neither of two Trump tariffs – the levies against Mexico, Canada and China to counter a declared fentanyl crisis and those against a broad swath of trading partners to address US trade deficits – rise to the level of an “unusual and extraordinary” emergency.</p><p>On Thursday, one day before Trump’s deadline for a batch of new tariffs to take effect, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case. The Trump administration lost the first round in May at the Court of International Trade. (That decision did not affect other Trump tariffs, such as those on steel, aluminium and cars or proposed tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Trump imposed these using other legal authorities.)</p><p>The appeals court will be the last stop before expected consideration by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Here’s a primer on how this case could affect Trump’s tariff policies:</p><h2 id=\"does-the-international-emergency-economic-powers-act-allow-tariffs\">Does the International Emergency Economic Powers Act allow tariffs?</h2><p>Whether the law permits the imposition of tariffs may be hard for the administration to prove.</p><p>The law “authorises the president to take various actions but with no mention of ‘tariffs’, ‘duties’,  ‘levies’, ‘taxes’, ‘imposts’ or any similar wording”, said Meredith Kolsky Lewis, a University at Buffalo law professor. “No president has sought to impose tariffs pursuant to the law” before Trump</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The administration’s strongest argument may be that although the law “doesn’t specifically authorise tariff measures, it doesn’t bar them either”, said David A Gantz, a Rice University fellow in trade and international economics. “Some have questioned whether Congress intended to cede basic Commerce Clause powers so completely to the president, but the statute does not appear to ever have been seriously challenged in Congress with repeal.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"does-the-present-situation-constitute-an-emergency\">Does the present situation constitute an emergency?</h2><p>The second issue might be more challenging for Trump: Are trade deficits a security threat?</p><p>In asserting the authority to impose tariffs, Trump said “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”</p><p>Babson College economist Kent Jones was sceptical. “Those with knowledge of trade economics scoff at the notion that a trade deficit is a national emergency,” he said. “The US has run trade deficits consistently for the last four decades without signs of an economic emergency that can be systematically linked to the deficits.”</p><p>The tariffs are being applied to dozens of countries that ship more goods to the US than they import, which “suggests a lack of an ‘unusual’ threat”, Lewis said. “In other words, this is commonplace.”</p><p>Using fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits as examples of emergencies breaks new ground, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who specialises in trade.</p><p>Although the law “does not delineate what a national emergency is, the precedent from previous administrations is not to invoke a national emergency based on day-to-day trade flows”, Burkhart said.</p><h2 id=\"an-even-more-aggressive-argument-in-the-case-of-brazil\">An even more aggressive argument in the case of Brazil</h2><p>Trump’s threat of 50 percent levies on <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/23/trumps-hefty-tariff-on-brazil-expected-to-push-the-country-towards-china\">Brazil</a> may be on thinner legal ground, legal experts said.</p><p>On July 9, Trump wrote a letter to Brazil’s president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, explaining that the new tariffs would be “due in part” to Brazil’s prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, as well as its treatment of US social media companies. The letter also cited a “very unfair trade relationship” with Brazil.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/Trump_Brazil_letter_7925.png?w=770&amp;ssl=1\"></p><p>[Screengrab from Truth Social]</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump declared an emergency based in part on the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/us-sanctions-brazils-supreme-court-judge-overseeing-case-against-bolsonaro\">Bolsonaro</a> prosecution, triggering a 40 percent tariff, effective after a week.</p><p>Experts said Trump’s justifications ring hollow legally under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Brazil policy isn’t at issue in the case being argued on Thursday, but it has already resulted in at least one lawsuit.</p><p>Experts said they doubted that citing the Bolsonaro case as an emergency would survive judicial scrutiny. Bolsonaro sought unsuccessfully to hang on to power after Lula <a href=\"/news/2022/10/30/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-narrowly-defeats-jair-bolsonaro\">defeated</a> him in the 2022 election, which prompted years of <a href=\"/news/2025/5/19/former-president-bolsonaros-coup-trial-opens-in-brazil\">investigations</a> and charges that could land him in prison.</p><p>“I and many others would agree that the Bolsonaro trial – even if [it were] questionable, and it isn’t – would not come close to meeting” the standard under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Gantz said.</p><p>Trump’s letter undercuts another key fact in the US-Brazil <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/10/whats-behind-trumps-50-percent-tariff-for-brazil-despite-trade-surplus\">trade</a> relationship: The US had a $6.8bn trade surplus with Brazil in 2024 and surpluses in earlier years as well.</p><p>Certain US sectors, such as social media and electronic payment networks, may have plausible gripes with Brazil over trade policy. Even so, Gantz said, “all of these grievances together seem to me insufficient for action under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Most legal experts we talked to said the appeals court would have ample reason to follow the Court of International Trade’s lead in striking down Trump’s authority. “I am quite confident that the law doesn’t give a limitless grant of authority to the president simply by saying some magic words,” said Julian Arato, a University of Michigan law professor.</p><p>But that result is no certainty – and ultimately, the US Supreme Court will have the final say. The conservative-majority court should be a friendlier venue for the administration.</p><p>If the appeals court doesn’t reverse the Court of International Trade’s ruling, “the Supreme Court will, in my opinion, likely do so,” Gantz said.</p><p>And even if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump, he could still impose tariffs under other laws.</p><p>He could use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows tariffs when the president determines that a foreign country “burdens or restricts United States commerce” through violations of trade agreements. This authority has been invoked dozens of times by various presidents.</p><p>Or he could use Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which lets the president impose tariffs if national security is threatened. Trump and former President Joe Biden used this as the basis for steel and aluminium tariffs imposed since 2018.</p><p>These more traditional mechanisms have been more battle-tested in court than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Gantz said, providing “a more persuasive legal basis for the tariffs”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Wednesday.</p><p>At midnight Eastern Time tonight, therefore, US Customs and Border Protection will begin enforcing these new duties, which will range from 15 percent to 50 percent – or even higher in some cases – depending on the trading partner, the nature of the goods being traded and whether the trading partner and the US have specific agreements in place.</p><p>Additional <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/donald-trump-threatens-copper-pharma-tariffs-who-will-they-hurt\">sectoral tariffs</a> will be applied to certain industries.

Initially, Trump had threatened a 30 percent rate.</p><h3>Japan</h3><p>Japan has secured a 15 percent reciprocal tariff on its goods exported to the US, reduced from a threatened 25 percent, with Japan promising to invest $550bn in the US economy.</p><h3>United Kingdom</h3><p>The UK agreed to a 10 percent tariff rate on its exports to the US. It also received a 25 percent sectoral tariff on steel and aluminium – half the 50 percent being imposed on other countries.</p><h3>South Korea</h3><p>A lower 15 percent tariff will apply to South Korean imports to the US, in return for a $350bn investment pledge and zero tariffs on US exports like cars and agricultural products.</p><h3>Indonesia</h3><p>Indonesia has negotiated a 19 percent tariff on its exports to the US, down from a threatened 32 percent, by making a commitment to buy US Boeing aircraft and to remove or reduce trade barriers.</p><h3>Vietnam</h3><p>Vietnam has agreed to a 20 percent tariff on most exports to the US, with an additional 40 percent levy to be applied to “transshipped” goods – those entering the US via another location – while also agreeing to zero tariffs on US imports like large-engine automobiles.</p><h3>Philippines</h3><p>This Philippines has agreed to a 19 percent tariff on its exports to the US, with zero tariffs on US exports to the Philippines, alongside commitments for enhanced military cooperation.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Struck a deal to jointly develop oil reserves with the US, but specific tariff rates on goods remain unclear.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"which-big-us-partners-have-no-deal-yet\">Which big US partners have no deal yet?</h2><p>None of the US’s top three trading partners – Mexico, Canada, and China – have trade deals in place as of Thursday.</p><h3>Mexico</h3><p>Tops the list of trade partners of the US, with nearly $840bn in total trade, driven by sectors including vehicles, electronics and agriculture. With no new deal for August 1, existing tariffs of 25 percent on most imports will persist under earlier 2025 trade war measures, with some exemptions under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p><h3>Canada</h3><p>Ranks second in terms of size with about $700bn, primarily in energy, vehicles, and aerospace products, passing between the two countries. With no deal finalised by the August 1 deadline, Trump has threatened to impose a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/trump-threatens-trade-deal-after-canada-moves-towards-recognising-palestine\">35 percent tariff</a> on goods that don’t comply with the USMCA.</p><h3>China</h3><p>Third among the top US trade partners, Beijing trades about $532bn with the US, focused on electronics, machinery and consumer goods. With no permanent deal in place, a 30 percent combined tariff will be applied, following an agreed pause until August 12. That followed an earlier escalation to a 145 percent tariff on imports.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3785318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3785318\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3785318\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-02-13T235546Z_707021281_RC2ZTCAFSWHQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-INDIA-1750307310.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pictured in a mirror as they attend a joint press conference at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.

They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.</p><p>“We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together,” he wrote. “Let’s keep it that way.”</p><p>In a statement, the Indian government said it was studying the implications of these new tariffs and added: “India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months.”</p><p>The statement further noted that “we remain committed to that objective.” New Delhi signalled what it believes to be potential barriers to the deal by noting that the government “attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>India’s neighbouring rival, Pakistan, has seen its stock rise with the Trump administration before and after the military conflict with New Delhi earlier this year.</p><p>Trump revealed that the US had concluded a deal with Pakistan, where they will work together on developing oil reserves, but did not announce tariffs. “Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!”</p><h3>Taiwan</h3><p>Taiwan is also facing a high-stakes deadline, with proposed tariffs set at 32 percent, excluding semiconductors, if no deal is struck by August 1.</p><p>Taiwanese officials have engaged in intense negotiations in Washington, spanning four high-level rounds led by Vice Premier Cheng Li‑chun and US counterparts, addressing not only tariff technicalities but also non‑tariff trade barriers, investments and market access.

Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke at the event, underscoring the WTO’s role as a foundation of predictability amid the current turmoil surrounding global trade.</p><p>“Uncertainty around global trade has reminded many members why they value the WTO as a bedrock of predictability in the global economy – and as a platform for dialogue and cooperation on trade,” she said.</p><p>The “uncertainty”, of course, was a reference to President Donald Trump’s “<a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">Liberation Day</a>” tariffs of 10 percent on all US imports in addition to country-specific “reciprocal tariffs”.</p><p>The WTO has long been beset by critics – from US and European workers angry over lost jobs, to developing nations hamstrung by rules favouring the West. Now, Trump’s aggressive tariffs and attacks have brought these long-simmering dilemmas to a head, threatening the very foundations of the organisation.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-trade-tensions\">Trump’s trade tensions</h2><p>Earlier this year, Trump’s tariffs signalled the US’s most protectionist stance since the 1930s. While he later paused his reciprocal tariffs – to be reinstated again on August 1, with exceptions for <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/23/trump-announces-massive-trade-deal-with-japan\">bilateral deals</a> – the uncertainty caused by the moves has led to increased costs for US consumers and businesses, disrupted global supply chains, and triggered retaliatory tariffs from key trade partners. Tariff measures have sparked WTO disputes and increased the effective US tariff rate to its highest level in over a century, according to The Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research centre.</p><p>The role of the WTO – to boost global trade and arbitrate disputes – has been called into question. Trump’s moves threaten to turn an already creaking trade system, the WTO’s “<a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/webcas_e/ltt_e/ltt10_e.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rules-based</a>” order, into a complex web of bilateral deals.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3861064\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3861064\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3861064\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25208597304813-1753681587.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a man in a yellow tie sits in front of a US and EU flag\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3861064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Donald Trump gestures as he meets European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the Trump Turnberry golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, on Sunday, July 27, 2025 [Jacquelyn Martin/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trump-s-complaints\">Trump’s complaints</h2><p>“The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” Trump told hundreds of business executives at an Economic Club of Chicago event weeks before the 2024 election. For decades, the club had championed globalisation, but last year, its guests rallied behind Trump’s protectionist promises. After winning the election, he announced his “Liberation Day” plan.</p><p>“Tariffs are a legitimate policy tool,” says Ian Fletcher, economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, noting they can lead to reshoring production.</p><p>Trump has criticised the WTO for prioritising low prices over protecting homegrown jobs and wages. “When someone like Trump says ‘I’m against all this stuff’ that’s caused [the demise of labour-intensive manufacturing], how do you expect people to behave?” Fletcher asked.</p><p>Trump believes the US has lost out economically to China. China’s 2001 WTO entry allowed cheap goods into a market in which US manufacturing was already struggling. From 1974 to 2024, US trade deficits totalled $20 trillion, while China’s trade surpluses hit nearly $7 trillion. Trump has argued that this is a national emergency.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Though Beijing claims to follow WTO rules, it has been accused of distorting trade with import quotas, subsidies, and tax breaks. Trump argues the WTO lets China undermine US workers. He has also objected to China’s “special and differential treatment” as a developing country, giving it favourable terms.</p><p>In September 2020, Trump promised to “do something about the WTO” because it has “let China get away with murder”.</p><p>But Trump is not the first to criticise the WTO. In fact, it has faced scrutiny since it was founded.</p><p>The WTO’s troubles in wealthy countries first became visible in 1999.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3864042\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3864042\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3864042\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP20217768556954-1753825664.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"WTO protesters in Seattle, Washington, in November 1999.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3864042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seattle police use tear gas to push back World Trade Organization protesters in downtown Seattle in November 1999 [Eric Draper/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"battle-in-seattle\">Battle in Seattle</h2><p>In late 1999, 50,000 people gathered in the streets of Seattle, Washington, to express their grievances with the WTO, which was hosting its ministerial meeting in the city. The throngs of protesters in Seattle were diverse – from trade unionists and farmers to church groups and NGOs – but most people were united by a common cause: railing against the interests of large corporations.</p><p>The Seattle protestors also argued that the WTO’s ability to override domestic labour, health and environmental protections threatened standards they had long fought for at home.</p><p>Many felt that the economic system was rigged against them in favour of multinational companies, such as Microsoft, Nike and Ford. Indeed, inflation-adjusted earnings for most US workers <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/17679/real-wages-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fell</a> between 1969 and 1999. Over the same period, the real (inflation-adjusted) return of the S&amp;P 500 increased by several hundred percent, reflecting a substantial increase in investors’ purchasing power. Demonstrators felt left behind and wanted to push back.</p><p>Protests also broke out in other cities. The New York Times reported that demonstrators in New York smashed windows at downtown stores, such as Nordstrom, Starbucks and Gap, carrying signs that read “End Corporate Rule” and “We Want Fair Wages”.</p><p>Mounted police, armoured cars and even torrential rain did not stop the Seattle protesters from postponing the WTO meetings. Eventually, after four days of standoffs, the talks were abandoned, and the demonstrators went home feeling vindicated.</p><p>While US companies had been outsourcing jobs long before the creation of the WTO, its rules were seen as locking in such practices. Over time, that whipped up a nostalgia for an era when blue-collar workers could earn middle-class wages.</p><p>By 2016, that nostalgia had reached a fever pitch, fuelling populist politics like Trump’s. Meanwhile, far from the spotlight, developing countries were growing increasingly frustrated with WTO rules that limited their development ambitions.</p><h2 id=\"developing-country-dissent\">Developing country dissent</h2><p>The WTO sets the global ground rules for trade, negotiating agreements, enforcing policies, and arbitrating disputes when countries believe rules have been broken. It replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and serves as the only forum where trade conflicts can be settled through binding decisions. Without the WTO, countries could raise tariffs, subsidise industries, or otherwise break rules – ushering in a new era of trade uncertainty.</p><p>To understand Seattle and disillusionment with the WTO, it’s important to look at the historical context. Ten years before the protests, in 1989, the Berlin Wall had come down. The Cold War ended, and the contest between Soviet communism and Western capitalism had been roundly decided in the US’s favour.</p><p>Free markets and limited government intervention – together presented as necessary conditions for sustained growth – became gospel. Along with the World Bank and the IMF, the WTO became an expression of the globalisation era, promoting policies in developing countries that emphasised privatisation, balanced budgets and the liberalisation of trade. It was dubbed the “Washington Consensus”.</p><p>But even in the 1990s, the Washington Consensus had its critics. Many analysts expressed frustration at the WTO’s treatment of poor countries.</p><p>For Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, “trade agreements at the WTO have always been heavily loaded in favour of developed country industries. TRIPS is a classic example.”</p><p>In 1995, the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (or TRIPS) was adopted, and for the first time, intellectual property rights (IPRs) became enforceable under international law with the WTO as referee.</p><p>Several Global North industries benefitted enormously, including, most controversially, pharmaceutical companies. Meanwhile, technology transfers – which are important for developing countries trying to move up the economic value chain – became blocked behind legal barriers.</p><p>TRIPS first received widespread attention in the late 1990s, when South Africa was in the grip of an HIV/AIDS epidemic. Some of the world’s most powerful pharma companies controlled the distribution of life-saving drugs and simply refused to drop their IPRs.</p><p>As a result, South Africa was unable to procure cheap generic drugs, and hundreds of thousands of people died. So it passed a law allowing for the import and manufacturing of cheaper generic medicines. In response, in 2001, 39 pharmaceutical companies, including giants GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Merck, took the South African government to court over alleged IPR violations.</p><p>The pharma groups quickly dropped the case amid public outcry from NGOs and public health advocates. But a similar case unfolded again following the outbreak of COVID-19, in which <a href=\"/news/2021/3/1/can-a-waiver-on-ip-rights-solve-vaccine\">patent protections for vaccines</a> were upheld by a small group of rich countries.</p><p>“Pharma companies [such as Moderna and Pfizer] didn’t even create a lot of the intellectual property that went into the COVID vaccines,” Ghosh told Al Jazeera. “They simply bought the patents and limited the supply, creating an artificial supply and raising the price.”</p><p>“So many unnecessary deaths occurred in developing countries because of TRIPS,” Ghosh said. “And looking ahead, inhibitive knowledge sharing will limit governments’ ability to cope with the effects of climate change and the green energy transition.”</p><p>Developing countries also decry the trade body for blocking “infant” industry protections – like import quotas, subsidies and tax breaks – in favour of free trade practices. At the same time, many rich countries continue to provide huge subsidies to certain sectors.</p><p>Oxfam reported that European agricultural subsidies – known as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – inflict “enormous damage” on farmers in poor countries.</p><p>The practice of overproducing sugar and dairy products in Europe and then “dumping” it abroad, the UK charity says (<a href=\"https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/114605/bp31-stop-dumping-011002-en.pdf?sequence=8&amp;isAllowed=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>), is particularly harmful to agricultural workers in Mozambique, India and Jamaica. In 2024, European farmers received 53.8 billion euros ($61.7bn) through CAP.</p><p>“Subsidies in wealthy nations disadvantage companies in developing countries, who struggle to compete,” said Ghosh, noting that this has been especially true of the textile and agriculture industries.</p><p>Empirical evidence does not indicate a strong relationship between trade barriers and growth. If anything, most of today’s rich countries climbed the development ladder while pursuing protectionist trade policies.</p><p>As such, many developing countries have been frustrated by the WTO for limiting their pursuit of long-term industrial development in favour of free trade. The message from wealthy nations has been clear for roughly 30 years: Do as I say, not as I do.</p><p>That message has grown louder under Trump.</p><h2 id=\"internal-wto-wobbles\">Internal WTO wobbles</h2><p>The longstanding inability to resolve North-South struggles left the WTO vulnerable. Now, with the US both flouting rules and paralysing the dispute mechanism, the institution is facing an existential moment.</p><p>The WTO has 166 member states and is consensus-based, meaning that all formal objections have to be resolved before a trade decision is finalised. This can cause gridlock and delays, but “that suited America and the big industrial powers when the WTO was created in the mid-’90s,” says Rob Davies, South Africa’s former minister of trade and industry.</p><p>“At the time,” he adds, “small government and free markets were the only game in town. So, the first set of rules established by the WTO was largely determined by wealthy nations, with the US at the forefront.”</p><p>In turn, power asymmetries between rich and poor countries were amplified through WTO agreements. But as China emerged as the world’s dominant manufacturing hub, wealthy nations’ grip on the WTO, as well as international markets, loosened. China’s economy was still growing rapidly in 2016, when Trump was <a href=\"/news/2016/11/9/donald-trump-beats-hillary-clinton-to-win-us-presidency\">first elected president</a>.</p><p>Davies says the US’s “non-observance of WTO rules started then”, when Trump banned federal agencies from buying equipment from telecoms giant <a href=\"/economy/2019/8/7/us-bans-federal-purchases-of-telecom-gear-from-huawei\">Huawei</a> in August 2019. Trump also neutralised the WTO by <a href=\"/economy/2019/9/20/one-man-down-how-a-us-lawyer-could-cripple-the-wto\">blocking the appointment</a> of members to the Appellate Body, where disputes were resolved. The standoff persisted under President Joe Biden, and the Appellate Body has remained nonoperational, providing no enforceable path to resolving trade conflicts.</p><p>In 2022, for instance, the WTO ruled that (then) former President Trump had violated its rules four years earlier when he invoked national security concerns to justify tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The Biden administration, however, strongly condemned the decision and refused to remove the duties that Trump had imposed.</p><p>The backlog of unresolved appeals has now made it easier for countries to break WTO rules without facing penalties, including Trump’s 2025 “reciprocal” tariffs.</p><p>Looking ahead, Davies thinks that the WTO will “limp along … until we arrive at a more stable multipolar world.”</p><p>He noted that while the WTO was a “major driver of neoliberal structural reform, we’re a far cry from that now”.</p><p>If the WTO fails, there would be no neutral forum for countries to resolve disputes, and global trade could slide into bilateral fights and tariff wars, raising prices, threatening jobs, and upending the global economy with uncertainty. Some hope reforms can create rules better tailored to today’s realities and more fair to both North and South. But with deep distrust and no clear US leadership, the odds remain uncertain.</p><p>At the WTO’s recent birthday celebrations, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news25_e/30yr_10apr25_e.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stressed</a> that “I remain convinced – I am ever the optimist – that a bright future awaits global trade, and the WTO, if we do the right thing.”</p><p>To many, though, the bright glare could be an oncoming train.</p></div></div></body></html>"
