Washington wants New Delhi to open its market to genetically modified (GM) soya and corn.</p><p>The GM technology involves altering plant DNA to introduce new traits that help speed up production compared with traditional breeding.</p><p>The US is the world’s second-largest producer of soya beans after Brazil, accounting for 28 percent, or 119.05 million metric tonnes, of global production.</p><p>China was the biggest buyer of US soya beans until the trade war with Beijing led to a <a href=\"/gallery/2025/10/14/us-soya-bean-farmers-battered-by-trade-dispute-with-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slump in sales</a>.</p><p>Suman Sahai, the founder of Gene Campaign, a nonprofit working for farmers, said the US desperately needs a market for its soya beans and corn, because China, its one-time top buyer, has dramatically scaled back its purchases.</p><p>“Trump has to sell this soya and corn so as not to annoy his big political base of the soya [and] corn farmers,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soya farmer Mahesh Patel says heavy rains wrecked his crop [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-s-reluctance\">India’s reluctance</h2><p>India has so far held off the imports of GM-variety soya beans and corn on the grounds that it produces non-GM, or organic, crops, which have a global niche market and could be undermined by the perception of GM varieties diluting the strain.</p><p>India produces about 13.05 million tonnes of soya beans, with Madhya Pradesh alone yielding more than half.</p><p>India’s corn production stands at approximately 42 million tonnes, 20 percent of which is used in making fuel-grade ethanol. The country is self-sufficient in its corn output but imports soya oil for cooking purposes because of a lack of processing infrastructure for edible oil.</p><p>Farmers of soya and corn, however, complain that they are already being ripped off by traders who pay below the price set by the government. On top of that are the steep costs of fertilisers, seeds and other farm items, coupled with the erratic rainfall that has destroyed crops.</p><p>“The traders set the prices at their will, as the government does not buy from us. We are unable to even recover the production cost,” said Prakash Patel, 50, a corn farmer in Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>“The profit is a distant dream for us, and we still have to pay the loans we took to buy our farming materials.”</p><p>Farmers worry that these losses would be exacerbated if US goods enter the Indian market.</p><p>A farmer in India typically produces about 1 metric tonne of soya beans in 0.40 hectares (1 acre). But GM soya bean yield can go up to 3 metric tonnes over the same land area, said Nirbhay Singh, a soya farmer in the state’s Piploda village.</p><p>Corn exporter Hemant Jain also worries about how US goods entering India may affect exports.</p><p>“The soya and corn from India have a major demand in the international market due to their non-GM quality,” Jain said.</p><p>“The import of GM material would create a doubt of adulteration in the minds of foreign buyers, who might be reluctant to buy from us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181559\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian growers cannot win against US farmers, who have large plots of land and heavy government subsidies, experts say [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Indra Shekhar Singh, an independent agrarian analyst in New Delhi, said farmers in India have average land holdings of about 2 hectares (5 acres), on which five to seven members of a family work and rely for food and livelihood. They often also have to work on other people’s land as labourers for more income.</p><p>This is unlike the US, where farmers have vast stretches of land for cultivation and, depending on the crop, receive heavy subsidies from the government.</p><p>“The US is trying to find an alternative market to China, but Indian farmers can’t win against the US government’s subsidised agri-commodities. They would capture the complete market in a few years, leaving our farmers in deep poverty and helplessness,” Singh said.</p><h2 id=\"strong-lobby-at-work\">Strong lobby at work</h2><p>However, some scientists and industry watchers believe there are benefits to GM production of soya and corn in India.</p><p>A senior scientist working with the Indian government on GM technology told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media that the introduction of the technology would allow farmers to use specific herbicides to control weeds without harming the crop.</p><p>“The GM technology is insect-resistant, and it would help to reduce the need for spraying insecticides and lower costs for farmers. Besides, production also increases massively in the GM technique that helps farmers to minimise their losses.”</p><p>Kawaljeet Bhatia, 52, a poultry feed supplier in India, said the production of corn and soya beans would increase manifold with the introduction of GM varieties, which would help farmers and businesses like his, which are part of the production chain.</p><p>But he suggested that the government develop its own GM seeds, instead of importing them.</p><p>“A handful of exporters receive a premium price, as they claim to export organic products. They want that status to continue as it benefits them. It is just a matter of time when we have to switch to GM for increased productivity,” Bhatia said.</p><p>The Indian government is being cautious, political analysts told Al Jazeera. Agriculture contributes 18 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) and supports 46 percent of its population.</p><p>“The government is acting with caution, taking lessons from the massive farmers’ protest that had rocked the nation in 2020-21,” Sibaji Pratim Basu, an independent political commentator in Kolkata, West Bengal, told Al Jazeera, referring to the yearlong protests by tens of thousands of farmers in northern India against three farm laws introduced by the government. The protests ended only after the government withdrew those rules.</p><p>“There are already hiccups in India-US relations due to tariffs that have badly hit several businesses in India dependent on the US market. The government is definitely concerned about its vote bank before taking any decision,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These are bigger. They’ll be 100 times the force, the power [of the old ships], and there’s never been anything like these ships,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that the vessels would be “cutting edge” and equipped with the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and directed energy lasers. They will also be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles and rail guns – all technologies that are in various stages of development by the US Navy.</p><p>“Each one of these will be the largest battleship in the history of our country, the largest battleship in the history of the world,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump downplayed the idea that the new ships were meant to counter any particular country, saying that they were “a counter to everybody”.</p><p>The US president said that production would start with two ships, but could scale up to 10, and as many as 25, over an unspecified period of time.</p><p>Trump said work on the first two would begin “immediately” and that the first ship would be named the USS Defiant.</p><p>Both Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically, that term has referred to a very specific type of ship – a large, heavily armoured vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.</p><p>This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the US battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tonnes. But after World War II, the battleship’s role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favour of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles.</p><p>Trump referenced the Great White Fleet, commissioned by former President Theodore Roosevelt during the early 20th century as a symbol of US naval strength, as well as a documentary about naval warfare during the second world war.</p><p>“Victory at Sea. I don’t know if anyone has seen Victory at Sea, but it was a classic,” he said, adding that the new ships would help “maintain American military supremacy”.</p><p>According to a newly created website for the Golden Fleet, this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships, but only weigh about half as much, approximately 35,000 tonnes, and have far smaller crews – between 650 and 850 sailors.</p><p>Its primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.</p><p>Trump said the naval expansion would also be paired with renewed pressure on defence contractors to ‌speed up production and rein in costs.</p><p>He said he will meet with major defence firms next week to address delays and overruns, ‌and to examine whether executive compensation, stock buybacks and dividends ⁠are contributing to missed production targets.</p><p>“We don’t want to have executives making $50m a year, issuing big dividends to everybody, and also doing buybacks”, while production of F-35s and other jets languishes, Trump said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And they just didn’t have the capacity to do the clearance … a lot of people are expecting to receive international packages, and they’re just never gonna get them.”</p><p>UPS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"suspending-tariff-exemptions\">Suspending tariff exemptions</h2><p>Since 2016, the de minimis trade exemption determined that packages worth $800 or less were not subject to taxes and tariffs. According to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of shipments entering the US claiming the exemption increased by more than 600 percent from 139 million shipments in 2015 to more than one billion in 2023.</p><p>In August, this all changed. President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending de minimis treatment for all countries, spiralling US imports into a new landscape of paperwork and processes, subject to duties and tariffs based on their place of origin.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4180728\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4180728\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25237470791790-1766004965.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4180728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25237470791790-1766004965.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Parcels slide down a ramp after being scanned at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection overseas mail inspection facility at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in USA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4180728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Parcels slide down a ramp after being scanned at a US Customs and Border Protection overseas mail inspection facility [File: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Just a month after de minimis ended, while shipping products with UPS, Tezumi Tea, an online Japanese tea and teaware company that sells its products online and through meetups in New York City, fell victim to the tariff backlog at US customs. Tezumi lost roughly 150kg (330lbs) of matcha, totalling about $13,000.</p><p>“We responded by increasing buffers in our supply planning across the dozen farms that we partner with,” said Ryan Snowden, a cofounder of Tezumi. “Even with those adjustments, the loss had a severe effect on a number of our cafe customers who suddenly needed to switch to another matcha blend.”</p><p>Now, UPS is no longer accepting shipments from Japan, and Tezumi has switched to shipping supplies through alternate carriers such as DHL and FedEx.</p><h2 id=\"disposing-shipments\">Disposing shipments</h2><p>Wasserbach has witnessed similar instances of UPS losing imports.</p><p>“When a UPS package goes uncleared, it’s just basically sitting in a UPS facility, uncleared for a certain period of time,” said Wasserbach. “Then UPS indicates in their tracking that they’re disposing of the shipments without making, really, any effort, from what I’ve seen, to contact either the sender or the receiver, to get information they need to do to get the clearance.”</p><p>Wasserbach shared email chains with Al Jazeera from UPS customers who looped in his firm to their customs clearance UPS debacles.</p><p>In one exchange, UPS customer Stephan Niznik responded to a notice from the UPS Alternate Broker Team that their packages had been “destroyed”.</p><p>“The tracking says on multiple instances that UPS attempted to contact the sender (me), but this is false; aside from a request for more information on September 5 (which I responded to immediately), UPS never attempted to contact me,” wrote Niznik. “It is absolutely disgraceful that my package was mishandled – clothes and children’s toys were destroyed at the hands of UPS.”</p><p>In another email chain, UPS told customer Chenying Li that their package was released following an email from Express Customs Clearance stating that the shipment was cleared.</p><p>A week later, Li’s package was still showing as “Pending Release”, and when they asked for an update on the shipment, UPS responded, “At this time we are unable to provide an ETA,  as volume is currently backed up and awaiting delivery due to the De Minimis impact.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"impose-additional-pressure\">‘Impose additional pressure’</h2><p>In addition to the customs backlog, Virginia Tech associate professor David Bieri says cost prevention may provide one explanation for UPS choosing to dispose of packages rejected by US customs rather than return the shipments to senders.</p><p>“All these additional rules and regulations impose additional pressure on already relatively tight margins for these companies – UPS, FedEx, DHL and so forth,” said Bieri. “They need to make money, and sometimes it’s easier not to fulfil a service than to take on the additional cost of customs clearance and making sure that it gets to its final destination.”</p><p>Bieri added that UPS resorting to package disposal may indicate that they believe themselves to be in “a sufficiently strong monopolistic position that they can do such horrible practice – unilateral nonfulfillment of contract”.</p><p>Wasserbach told Al Jazeera that “with FedEx and DHL shipments, we aren’t seeing these problems”.</p><p>When asked whether FedEx has disposed of packages stuck in customs, a spokesperson wrote, “If paperwork is not complete and/or rejected by US Customs and Border Protection, FedEx actively works with senders to update paperwork to resubmit to CBP or return shipments to senders. In some cases, shippers can request that packages be disposed of if they would prefer not to pay to return to sender. In those rare cases, recipients are notified at the direction of the shipper.

The film looks at the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s in parallel with the pursuit of justice after the Dayton Accords. It shows the horrors of ethnic cleansing, mass killings and displacement beginning when Yugoslavia started to break apart. Raw survivor testimonies highlight the human cost of the war from the siege of Sarajevo to the Srebrenica genocide. It also shows how the investigators and prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia built cases against those responsible, including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, and how this tribunal ultimately gave birth to the ICC. The film ends by asking whether justice can genuinely heal a shattered region – and what the future of international justice is today.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 22 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">22 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/trump-announces-new-offshore-drilling-projects-despite-bipartisan-pushback\">pivot away</a> from renewable energy.</p><p>Shares in Danish energy firm Orsted, which owns two of the affected projects, traded down more than 12 percent by late morning, with other companies like Dominion and Equinor also trading lower.</p><p>The US Department of the Interior said the Department of Defense had raised concerns that the movement of huge turbine blades for offshore wind projects, as well as the highly reflective towers that hold them up, could cause radar interference that could make it hard for the military to identify and locate threats.</p><p>“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement.</p><p>The pause will give relevant federal agencies “time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects,” the department said.</p><p>The pause will affect Orsted ‘s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ Vineyard Wind 1 project, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 project, according to the department.</p><p>The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), a trade group representing offshore wind developers, urged the administration to end the pause quickly.</p><p>“The regulatory process involves a rigorous framework for assessing the national security implications of proposed projects, and every project under construction has already undergone review by the Department of Defense with no objections,” NOIA President Erik Milito said.</p><p>Orsted, Equinor and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners were not immediately available for comment.</p><p>Dominion said the suspension will threaten grid reliability for its Virginia customers, including military bases and data centres powering artificial intelligence.</p><p>“These electrons will power the data centres that will win the AI race, support our war fighters, and build the nuclear warships needed to maintain our maritime supremacy,” the company said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"anti-wind-stance\">Anti-wind stance</h2><p>Monday’s move was the latest instance of the administration ordering a pause to offshore wind projects already under construction.</p><p>In August, the administration ordered Orsted to halt the advanced construction on the Revolution Wind project off the Rhode Island coast, though a federal judge later lifted the ban.</p><p>Earlier in the year, the administration lifted a stop-work order on Equinor’s Empire Wind in a compromise with New York state that paved the way for a natural gas pipeline Trump supports.</p><p>Trump campaigned for the White House on a promise to end the offshore wind industry, saying “windmills” are too expensive and hurt whales and birds. He has instead <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/trump-announces-new-offshore-drilling-projects-despite-bipartisan-pushback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promoted oil and gas drilling.</a></p><p>The uncertainty has taken a financial toll on developers.

Shapiro, a vocal supporter of Israel, described others as “grifters” and “charlatans” for amplifying so-called conspiratorial and extremist figures in the broader conservative movement.</p><p>Shapiro said Carlson’s decision to host far-right figure Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility”. Fuentes has been accused of anti-Semitism.</p><p>Carlson, for his part, responded directly on the same stage, mocking Shapiro’s criticism and framing attempts to ostracise certain voices as divisive.</p><p>He said he “laughed” at the push for what he characterised as attempts to censor dissenters, underscoring an intense ideological clash within the Republican-aligned media sphere.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4189840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4189840\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4189840\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/reuters_69492ab0-1766402736.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Megyn Kelly hosts a &quot;prove me wrong&quot; session during AmericaFest, the first Turning Point USA summit since the death of Charlie Kirk, in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S. December 19, 2025.

She has demanded Washington stop its military support to Israel.</p><p>The Daily Wire cofounder said that Owens (who was not at the event) “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years”.</p><p>He said Kelly, a former Fox News host, was “guilty of cowardice” because she refused to condemn Owens over unsubstantiated claims of a conspiracy involving the US and Israeli governments in the killing of Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who was born in the US to Indian immigrants, also condemned bigotry and hate on the right, saying that anyone who normalises hatred towards any ethnic or religious group “does not have a place as a leader” in the conservative movement.</p><p>In his speech, journalist Carlson also spoke out against bigotry targeting Muslims. “What you’re watching now … attacking millions of Americans because they’re Muslims? It’s disgusting.”</p><p>“And I’m a Christian. I am not a Muslim. I’m never going to … I know there’s a lot of effort to claim I’m a secret jihadi. I’m not,” he added.</p><p>In his speech on Sunday, US Vice President JD Vance refused to take sides in the debate around bigotry, saying the conservative movement should be open to everyone as long as they “love America”.</p><p>“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during the convention’s closing speech.</p><p>“We don’t care if you’re white or Black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between.”</p><h3>US support for Israel</h3><p>Israel came up repeatedly during the conference.</p><p>Steve Bannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the ‘Israel First’ crowd”.</p><p>“Israel needs its sovereignty, Israel needs to be independent. If Israel wants to take on Syria, go for it … but not drag the USA into another endless war,” he said.</p><p>Some on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party’s historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump’s “America First” platform.</p><p>Meanwhile, Carlson strongly criticised certain Christian minister who he claimed justified the killing of innocent people in a reference to Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“If a man commits a crime, do we kill his kids? I don’t care if it’s in Minneapolis or Gaza City. No, we don’t,” Carlson told the audience. “God is not on any country’s side … [God] doesn’t have a nationality,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"debate-over-who-is-an-american\">Debate over who is an American</h2><p>Ramaswamy, who is the Republican candidate for Ohio governor, also questioned the idea of deciding who is an American based on one’s ancestry or heritage.</p><p>“The idea that a ‘heritage American’ is more American than another American is un-American at its core,” he said at the conference.</p><p>“You are an American if you believe in the rule of law, in freedom of conscience and freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the US Constitution, in the American dream, and if you are a citizen who swears exclusive allegiance to our nation,” Ramaswamy, a wealthy businessman, wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times on December 17.</p><p>Ramaswamy’s stance on the US seems to differ from that of his party colleague Vice President Vance, who, in a July speech, expressed his concerns against granting citizenship because someone agreed with the principles, for example, of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p>“America is not just an idea. It is a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation,” he had said.</p><p>During his speech at the conference on Sunday, Vance highlighted the Trump administration’s efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which were aimed at ensuring equal opportunities to the communities that have historically faced obstacles.</p><p>“In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologise for being white any more,” he said, adding that the US “always will be a Christian nation”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
