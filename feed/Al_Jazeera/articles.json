“principles” for negotiating with Iran as he heads to Washington, DC, for his sixth official visit with the US president over the past year.</p><p>Netanyahu hailed the “unique closeness” between Israel and the United States and his own warm ties to Trump before leaving Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“I will present Trump with principles for negotiations with Iran that are important not only to Israel but to everyone who wants peace and security,” Netanyahu told reporters, according to The Jerusalem Post newspaper.</p><p>“In my opinion, these are important principles for everyone who wants peace and security in the Middle East.”</p><p>His visit comes days after Washington and Tehran concluded a round of nuclear talks in Oman – the first negotiations since the June 2025 war that saw the US bomb Iran’s main nuclear facilities after waves of <a href=\"/news/2024/10/26/israel-strikes-iran-what-we-know-so-far-and-whats-next\">Israeli attacks</a>.</p><p>Israel is not part of those talks, but Netanyahu has long sought <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/what-happens-when-netanyahu-visits-trump-a-look-at-his-past-six-us-visits\">to exert influence</a> over US presidents to shape Washington’s policies in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Netanyahu did not provide details about his “principles” for a potential Iran deal, but he has previously said Tehran should agree to full disarmament of heavy weapons, akin to Libya’s 2003 deal with the West.</p><p>Iran has ruled out negotiations over its missile programme, which it views as one of its most important deterrents against Israeli attacks.</p><p>When Israel launched its surprise assault against Iran in June of last year – killing several of the country’s top generals and nuclear scientists as well as hundreds of civilians – Tehran relied primarily on its missiles to respond after air defences were taken out.</p><p>Iran fired hundreds of missiles at Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s multilayered air defences, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">killing 28 people</a> and causing significant damage.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera on Saturday that Iran’s missile programme is a defence issue that is “never negotiable”.</p><p>Israel and the US may also push Iran to end support to its network of allied non-state actors in the region – including the Houthis in Yemen, <a href=\"/features/2026/2/3/will-hezbollah-continue-to-avoid-responding-to-israels-attacks-on-lebanon\">Hezbollah in Lebanon</a>, Hamas in Palestine, and armed groups in Iraq.</p><p>But that alliance, known as the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/iraqs-kataib-hezbollah-warns-of-total-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">Axis of Resistance</a>, has already been weakened by Israeli assaults over the past two years.</p><p>Another sticking issue in the talks is whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium domestically.</p><p>While Tehran has said it would agree to strict limits and monitoring of its nuclear activities, it has maintained that domestic enrichment is a sovereign national right.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite Washington’s talks with Tehran, US Ambassador <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/trump-picks-pro-settlement-mike-huckabee-as-us-ambassador-to-israel\">Mike Huckabee</a> – who is joining Netanyahu on his trip – has stressed Israel and the United States have the same red lines when it comes to Iran.</p><p>“I think there’s an extraordinary alignment between Israel and the United States. Everyone would love to see something that would resolve without a war, but it will be up to Iran,” he told reporters.</p><p>“If they insist on holding nuclear weaponry and enriched uranium, then I think the president made very clear that this is not acceptable.”</p><p>The United States has moved the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\">USS Abraham Lincoln</a> aircraft carrier, destroyers, and fighter jets to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement. Tehran says it won’t be swayed by threats of war.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s a lot.”</p><p>The other top issue on Netanyahu’s agenda was Iran. The Israeli prime minister had been seeking escalation against Tehran.</p><p>But instead of a move towards war, Trump announced at the meeting with Netanyahu that the US and Iran would hold <a href=\"/news/2025/4/12/iranian-us-delegations-set-to-begin-high-stakes-nuclear-talks-in-oman\">nuclear talks</a>, reiterating his preference for a deal with Iran.</p><p>“We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” Trump said at that time.</p><p>Netanyahu responded by setting out maximalist conditions for US diplomacy with Iran – a complete disarmament of heavy weapons akin to the 2003 Libyan model.</p><p>“If it can be done diplomatically in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”</p><p>Iran has repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons while Israel is widely believed to have an undeclared <a href=\"/news/2009/10/27/israels-nuclear-arsenal\">nuclear arsenal</a>.</p><p>Despite signs of disagreement between Trump and Netanyahu over Iran and trade at that time, the US administration continued to support and fund Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"july-victory-lap\">July: Victory lap</h2><p>Although Trump and Netanyahu did not appear on the same page when it came to Iran weeks earlier, the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/us-joins-israel-in-attacks-against-iran-strikes-key-nuclear-sites\">US joined Israel</a> in bombing Iran in June, hitting three of its key nuclear sites and fulfilling a wish that the Israeli prime minister had been seeking for years.</p><p>Netanyahu visited the White House a month later to hail the war and its outcomes, which Trump said “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>“I think the partnership between Israel and the United States, the partnership between President Trump and me, produced a historic victory. It’s an incredible victory, actually,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>“It brought the greatest capabilities of the United States – that are unmatched – with the great capabilities of Israel and the army of Israel, the pilots of Israel, the soldiers of Israel and the Mossad.”</p><p>Netanyahu met with Trump on <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-netanyahu-meet-for-a-second-time-to-discuss-a-gaza-ceasefire\">two occasions</a> during that visit as the US was pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza amid international outrage at Israel’s atrocities and a forced starvation campaign against Palestinians.</p><p>Some media reports had suggested at the time that Trump may pressure Netanyahu to stop the war, but the Israeli prime minister stressed that he and the US president were in “lockstep” over Gaza.</p><p>“President Trump wants a deal, but not at any price,” <a href=\"/news/2025/7/10/if-trump-wants-gaza-ceasefire-he-must-pressure-netanyahu-experts-say\">Netanyahu said</a>. “I want a deal, but not at any price.

But hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>From there, Trump and Netanyahu heaped praise on one another, dismissing media reports that they were not seeing eye to eye on the future of Gaza and other regional issues.</p><p>Trump called Netanyahu a “hero”, arguing that Israel may not have existed without his leadership.</p><p>“We’re with you, and we’ll continue to be with you, and a lot of good things are happening in the Middle East,” Trump told Netanyahu.</p><p>For his part, the prime minister announced that his country would award Trump the Israel Prize, which is normally given to Israeli citizens.</p><p>“I have to say that this reflects the overwhelming sentiment of Israelis across the spectrum,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>Days after that meeting, antigovernment protests broke out in Iran, leading Trump to threaten to intervene militarily as he promised demonstrators who faced a <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/13/iran-protests-live-tehran-says-its-prepared-for-any-move-by-trump\">security crackdown</a> that “help is on the way”.</p><p>That threat never materialised.</p><p>With the protest movement in Iran all but faded and renewed US-Iranian diplomacy under way, the Israeli prime minister is likely to lobby for greater pressure on Tehran as he returns to Washington, DC, this week.</p><p>What remains to be seen is how the US president – who, like his predecessors has shown reluctance to say “no” to Israeli demands – will respond.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"318\" data-end=\"918\">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was shot 19 times inside his compound in Zintan, a mountain town in western Libya, where he had lived since his capture in 2011. Four masked men entered the compound after disabling the security cameras. Roughly 90 minutes earlier, his guards had withdrawn from the area for reasons that remain unexplained. When the shooting ended, the assailants did not flee. They left. No gunfight. No pursuit. No claim of responsibility. The perpetrators vanished into the kind of silence that, in Libya, usually means the killers have nothing to fear from an investigation.</p><p data-start=\"920\" data-end=\"1545\">Saif was the son of Muammar Gaddafi, who ruled Libya for more than four decades before being overthrown and killed in the 2011 revolution. Since 2014, the country has been divided between two rival power centres. In the west, successive governments in Tripoli, the latest led by Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, derive their authority from United Nations recognition. In the east, renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar controls territory through military force, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and Egypt, while a paper government in Benghazi provides civilian cover for what is effectively military rule. Neither side has faced a national election, nor intends to.</p><p>The mechanics of the killing tell their own story. This was not violence born of chaos. It was an operation, executed within a narrow window by actors who understood Saif’s movements, his protection, and the informal rules governing both. Members of his inner circle have described it as an inside job. Reaching him required more than weapons. It required access to his routines, to his guards, and to the layered arrangements that had kept him alive in secret. For years, Saif had lived in varying degrees of concealment, protected by local understandings and, at times, by Russian-linked security support. By the night of the attack, all that protection had been withdrawn. Whoever planned the operation knew it would be.</p><p data-start=\"2279\" data-end=\"2352\">Motive alone is not evidence. But method and capability narrow the field.</p><p data-start=\"2354\" data-end=\"3201\">When Abdelghani al-Kikli, the commander of Tripoli’s largest militia, Stabilisation Support Apparatus (SSA), was assassinated last year by a rival brigade, the result was immediate chaos. Armed clashes shut down large parts of the capital – factional and noisy, and instantly legible. The Zintan operation bears no resemblance. Its precision and the silence that followed point to a different kind of actor. Critics, liabilities, and inconvenient figures within Haftar’s orbit have often been removed quietly. Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a senior officer in Haftar’s forces and a man wanted by the International Criminal Court, was shot dead in broad daylight in Benghazi in 2021. No serious investigation followed. Others have disappeared in a similar fashion. These operations do not require total territorial control. They rely on networks, intimidation and the expectation of impunity.</p><p data-start=\"3203\" data-end=\"3310\">None of these constitutes proof. Libya rarely offers proof. Only patterns. But patterns have infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"3312\" data-end=\"3776\">The political order Muammar Gaddafi built did not disappear in 2011. It was disassembled and repurposed. Haftar took its fragments, tribal patronage networks, security hierarchies, and the militia economy, and reassembled them around his own family, anchored by a praetorian guard, the Tariq bin Ziyad Brigade, commanded by his son Saddam, the recently appointed deputy general commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army and the most likely successor to his father.</p><p data-start=\"3778\" data-end=\"4277\">Former loyalists of the old regime were not excluded from this system, but they were never trusted within it. Pro-Gaddafi political figures and commanders were encouraged to return under Haftar and absorbed after 2014 only on strictly conditional terms. Figures such as Hassan Zadma, once aligned with Saif’s brother Khamis’s infamous 32nd Brigade, were coopted for their utility, not integrated as partners. When their presence threatened Haftar’s control, they were marginalised or dismantled.</p><p data-start=\"4279\" data-end=\"4567\">Saif himself was never offered even that conditional inclusion. He remained outside the system, tolerated, contained, and watched, a reminder of an alternative line of inheritance that could never be fully neutralised. He had lived under the persistent threat of assassination since 2017.</p><p data-start=\"4569\" data-end=\"5397\">Saif did not represent change. He represented an alternative. The danger he posed was structural. Haftar’s coalition is held together not by ideology but by patronage, and patronage is distributed unevenly. Some tribes and armed groups receive more than others. Loyalty is transactional, calibrated to what each faction can extract. In the event of Haftar’s death, those who feel short-changed would see succession as an opportunity to renegotiate their terms, or defect to whoever offers a better deal. The only figure with a history and surname symbolic enough to draw them in was Saif, heir to the very system Haftar had repurposed. He would not have dismantled it. He would have ruled through it, with the same patronage logic and the same authoritarian reflexes. Same system, different family.</p><p data-start=\"5399\" data-end=\"6688\">That made him extraordinarily difficult to accommodate. Forty-eight hours before the killing, Saddam Haftar met Ibrahim Dbeibah, the prime minister’s nephew and head of Libya’s national security apparatus, secretly at the Elysee Palace in Paris. There was no official readout. Leaks suggest a single agenda: whether Libya’s rival camps could form yet another interim unity government, one that would bring the LAAF formally under the state, divide ministries and institutions between the Haftar and Dbeibah families, and postpone elections for what would now be over a decade. Libyans have not voted since 2014. That grievance has deepened with every failed transition, every broken promise of elections, every new interim arrangement designed to keep the same people in power. A family carve-up negotiated in Paris would have made it volcanic. Saif did not need a programme to exploit that. He only needed to be on the ballot. In the aborted 2021 presidential election, he polled significantly ahead of Haftar. If the only viable candidates are authoritarians, the anti-establishment authoritarian wins. He could not be absorbed into such an arrangement without destabilising both sides, and he could not be left outside it without becoming the vehicle for every Libyan’s rage against it.</p><p data-start=\"6690\" data-end=\"7273\">Five days after his killing, Saif’s tribe buried him in Bani Walid, a town long associated with loyalists of his father. They had wanted Sirte, his father’s tribal seat. Haftar’s forces denied them. Condolence receptions were blocked. Public mourning was prevented. Saif spent a decade being told where he could live, who he could see, and when he could speak. His killers decided where he could die. His rivals decided where he could be buried. No one has been arrested. No one will be. In Libya, silence after a killing is never the absence of an answer. It is the answer.</p><p data-start=\"6690\" data-end=\"7273\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They revealed that Mandelson had maintained a close friendship with the disgraced financier even after Epstein had pleaded guilty to solicitation of sex with a minor and was jailed in 2008.</p><p>They include documents and emails that suggest Mandelson may have received payments from Epstein and passed sensitive information to him during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.</p><p>Since then, Starmer has admitted that he knew of the pair’s friendship when he appointed Mandelson as ambassador but said the peer had lied about the extent of it. The affair has caused outrage in parliament. Two key members of Starmer’s inner circle have resigned and a third is under pressure to go. On Monday, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for the prime minister to do the same.</p><p>While Starmer’s position has been shored up for now by a rally of support from his cabinet on Monday night, just how badly has this affair shaken his government?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301900\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96PW8A3__v1__MidRes__BritainScotlandUsPoliticsLabourEpsteinMandelson-1770714191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C526&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"anas sarwar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301900\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘The distraction needs to end,’ Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says at a news conference in Glasgow on February 9, 2026, at which he called for Starmer to step down [Andy Buchanan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-did-anas-sarwar-call-for-starmer-to-resign\">Why did Anas Sarwar call for Starmer to resign?</h2><p>Sarwar said at a news conference early on Monday afternoon that he had called Starmer and told him it was time for him to resign. “I spoke to the prime minister earlier today, and I think it’s safe to say he and I disagreed,” Sarwar said.</p><p>He said “too many mistakes” had been made in relation to the appointment of Mandelson.</p><p>“The distraction needs to end, and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,” Sarwar said as he became the first Labour heavyweight to stand against the prime minister.</p><p>While Sarwar said he believed Starmer to be a “decent man”, the fury over the Epstein files had severely damaged the government’s support and wrecked its chances in the upcoming Scottish parliament elections. Opinion polls put Scottish Labour some distance behind the Scottish National Party, followed by the far-right Reform party, led by Nigel Farage.</p><p>But cabinet members came out in support of Starmer, ultimately ending the coup that never was. Angela Rayner, former deputy prime minister and a senior member of the Labour Party, was the first to show him support. She said in a post on X that while she did not defend Starmer’s judgement, “the worst possible response [to the scandal] would be to play party politics or factional games.”</p><p>“I urge all my colleagues to come together, remember our values and put them into practice as a team,” she wrote on X. “The Prime Minister has my full support in leading us to that end.”</p><p>Within hours, nearly every minister had followed suit. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, urged people to “give Keir a chance”. Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, said he hoped the prime minister would stay on, and Douglas Alexander, Scotland secretary, said he “respected” Sarwar’s stance but backed the prime minister.</p><p>On Monday night, Starmer addressed more than 400 MPs and peers at a Labour Party meeting. “I have won every fight I’ve ever been in. I fought to change the Labour Party to allow us to win an election again,” he told them.</p><p>“But I’ll tell you this, after having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I’m not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301896\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301896\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96P79VC__v1__MidRes__BritainUsPoliticsEpsteinMandelson-1770714140.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C501&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"starmer\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Journalists gather outside 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain’s prime minister, on February 9, 2026, as Starmer was ‘getting on with the job of delivering change across the country’, a spokesman told them.

A parliamentary by-election is also due on February 26.</p><p>“The immediate danger [to Starmer] is that [Labour] suffers catastrophic losses in a by-election and then a big set of elections in May,” Bale said. “That will reignite calls for Starmer to resign and, if he doesn’t, a challenge from one or more of his colleagues.”</p><p>Among the top runners to replace Starmer are Rayner, his former deputy prime minister who resigned from the cabinet last year over a tax scandal.</p><p>A website pitching Rayner as leader, angelaforleader.co.uk, went live in January briefly, The Guardian newspaper reported. Rayner has denied any links to the website.</p><p>Another politician gearing up to replace Starmer is Wes Streeting, the health secretary.</p><p>Streeting, 43, has also been called out for his ties with Mandelson. In a bid to distance himself from the former ambassador, Streeting this week shared private chats he had with Mandelson that questioned the government’s growth plan.</p><p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, 45, is another possible successor to Starmer.

However, the prime minister has since had a difficult time in Downing Street.</p><p>In the 2024 elections, Reform UK, the right-wing, populist, anti-immigration party led by Farage, won just five of the 650 seats in parliament. However, it has gone on to become one of the best polling British parties. In July, a YouGov <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">poll</a> put Reform in the lead, predicting it could win 271 seats if elections were held then.</p><p>In his speech on Monday, Starmer called the challenge posed by the rise of the Reform party, which has won over a number of high-profile defectors from the Conservative Party in recent weeks, “a fight for our lives”.</p><p>Starmer is also facing domestic pressure to put a stop to undocumented immigration to the UK. More than 32,000 people tried to cross the English Channel from France in small boats last year. These crossings are dangerous and have resulted in many deaths.</p><p>The UK and France have laid the blame on each other for the rising numbers. This led to a “<a href=\"/news/2025/9/24/how-effective-is-uks-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-so-far\">one-in-one-out</a>” migrant deal signed between the UK and France last year, under which the UK returns one migrant to France for each accepted refugee. The scheme has had little success, however, with only a handful of migrants returned.</p><p>Starmer himself has dropped in popularity by 20 percentage points from July 2024 to January this year, according to YouGov.</p><p>“Reform has obviously spooked some in the Labour Party,” Bale said, adding, however, that Reform is eating into the Conservatives’ base more. “And Labour probably needs to worry more about the Greens and the Liberal Democrats at this stage.”</p><p>“The break-up of the two-party duopoly that has dominated British politics for a century is no longer simply an aspiration among challenger parties but an ongoing reality,” Bale said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

instructed the Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p><p>The move came amid ongoing political tensions

the team’s fate at the World Cup after consultations with the government.</p><p>One week after Bangladesh’s expulsion, Pakistan’s government sent shockwaves through the cricketing world by <a

change its position, the ICC <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/7/icc-in-pakistan-talks-to-revive-india-t20-world-cup-clash\">initiated</a> a series of meetings and negotiations with PCB officials to persuade them otherwise.</p><p>PCB chief Naqvi hosted BCB Chairman Aminul Islam and top ICC officials on Sunday and reportedly put forth a series of demands, most of which involved Bangladesh.</p><h2

hour, Pakistan’s government said it had ordered the cricket team to <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/9/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-on-feb-15\">take the field</a> against India on

She found her husband screaming, but of Saad, there was no trace.</p><p>“I went into the mosque and found myself stepping on flesh and blood,” Mahani told Al Jazeera Arabic for an investigation that aired on Monday. She searched hospitals and morgues for days. “We found nothing of Saad. Not even a body to bury. That was the hardest part.”</p><p>Mahani is one of thousands of Palestinians whose loved ones have simply vanished during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people.</p><p>According to the Al Jazeera Arabic investigation, The Rest of the Story, Civil Defence teams in Gaza have documented 2,842 Palestinians who have “evaporated” since the war began in October 2023, leaving behind no remains other than blood spray or small fragments of flesh.</p><p>Experts and witnesses attributed this phenomenon to Israel’s systematic use of internationally prohibited thermal and thermobaric weapons, often referred to as vacuum or aerosol bombs, capable of generating temperatures exceeding 3,500 degrees Celsius [6,332 degrees Fahrenheit].</p><h2 id=\"grim-forensic-accounting\">Grim forensic accounting</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"11\">The figure of 2,842 is not an estimate, but the result of grim forensic accounting by Gaza’s Civil Defence.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"12\">Spokesperson Mahmoud Basal explained to Al Jazeera that teams use a “method of elimination” at strike sites. “We enter a targeted home and cross-reference the known number of occupants with the bodies recovered,” Basal said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">“If a family tells us there were five people inside, and we only recover three intact bodies, we treat the remaining two as ‘evaporated’ only after an exhaustive search yields nothing but biological traces—blood spray on walls or small fragments like scalps,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"the-chemistry-of-erasure\">The chemistry of erasure</h2><p>The investigation detailed how specific chemical compositions in Israeli munitions turn human bodies into ash in seconds.</p><p>Vasily Fatigarov, a Russian military expert, explained that thermobaric weapons do not just kill; they obliterate matter. Unlike conventional explosives, these weapons disperse a cloud of fuel that ignites to create an enormous fireball and a vacuum effect.</p><p>“To prolong the burning time, powders of aluminium, magnesium and titanium are added to the chemical mixture,” Fatigarov said. “This raises the temperature of the explosion to between 2,500 and 3,000 degrees Celsius [4,532F to 5,432F].”</p><p>According to the investigation, the intense heat is often generated by tritonal, a mixture of TNT and aluminium powder used in United States-made <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-made-bombs-used-in-deadly-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-schools-hrw-says\">bombs</a> like the MK-84.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3172453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3172453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INTERACTIVE-Israel-2000lbs-mk-84-mk-84-bomb-1726052230.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel 2000lbs mk 84 mk-84 bomb-1726052230\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Dr Munir al-Bursh, director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, explained the biological impact of such extreme heat on the human body, which is composed of roughly 80 percent water.</p><p>“The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius [212F],” al-Bursh said. “When a body is exposed to energy exceeding 3,000 degrees combined with massive pressure and oxidation, the fluids boil instantly. The tissues vaporise and turn to ash. It is chemically inevitable.”</p><h2 id=\"anatomy-of-the-bombs\">Anatomy of the bombs</h2><p>The investigation identified specific US-manufactured munitions used in Gaza that are linked to these disappearances:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>MK-84 ‘Hammer’:</strong> This 900kg [2,000lb] unguided bomb packed with tritonal generates heat up to 3,500C [6,332F].</li>\n<li><strong>BLU-109 bunker buster:</strong> Used in an attack on al-Mawasi, an area Israel had declared a “safe zone” for forcibly displaced Palestinians in September 2024, this bomb evaporated 22 people. It has a steel casing and a delayed fuse, burying itself before detonating a PBXN-109 explosive mix. This creates a large fireball inside enclosed spaces, incinerating everything within reach.</li>\n<li><strong>GBU-39:</strong> This precision glide bomb was used in the al-Tabin school attack. It uses the AFX-757 explosive. “The GBU-39 is designed to keep the building structure relatively intact while destroying everything inside,” Fatigarov noted. “It kills via a pressure wave that ruptures lungs and a thermal wave that incinerates soft tissue.”</li>\n</ul><p>Basal of the Civil Defence confirmed finding fragments of GBU-39 wings at sites where bodies had vanished.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2474448\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/INTERACTIVE-Israels-precision-guided-missiles-1699530503.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1069&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -Israels precision guided missiles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"a-global-genocide-not-just-an-israeli-one\">A ‘global genocide, not just an Israeli one’</h2><p>Legal experts said the use of these indiscriminate weapons implicates not just Israel but also its Western suppliers.</p><p>“This is a global genocide, not just an Israeli one,” said lawyer Diana Buttu, a lecturer at Georgetown University in Qatar.</p><p>Speaking at the Al Jazeera Forum in Doha, Buttu argued that the supply chain is evidence of complicity. “We see a continuous flow of these weapons from the United States and Europe. They know these weapons do not distinguish between a fighter and a child, yet they continue to send them.”</p><p>Buttu emphasised that under international law, the use of weapons that cannot distinguish between combatants and noncombatants constitutes a war crime.</p><p>“The world knows Israel possesses and uses these prohibited weapons,” Buttu said. “The question is why are they allowed to remain outside the system of accountability.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/INTERACTIVE-What-damage-a-bomb-can-do-Gaza-war-1699764224.png?w=770&amp;quality=80\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"collapse-of-international-justice\">Collapse of international justice</h2><p>Despite the International Court of Justice issuing provisional measures against Israel in January 2024, ordering it to prevent acts of genocide, and an arrest <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza\">warrant</a> from the International Criminal Court issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in November 2024, the killing intensified.</p><p>Tariq Shandab, a professor of international law, argued that the international justice system has “failed the test of Gaza”.</p><p>“Since the ceasefire agreement [in October], more than 600 Palestinians have been killed,” Shandab said. He highlighted that the war has continued through siege, starvation and strikes. “The blockade on medicine and food is itself a crime against humanity.”</p><p>Shandab pointed to the “impunity” granted to Israel by the US veto power at the UN Security Council. However, he noted that universal jurisdiction courts in countries like Germany and France could offer an alternative path to justice, provided there is political will.</p><p>For Rafiq Badran, who lost four children in the Bureij refugee camp during the war, these technical definitions mean little. He was only able to recover small parts of his children’s bodies to bury.</p><p>“Four of my children just evaporated,” Badran said, holding back tears. “I looked for them a million times. Not a piece was left. Where did they go?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The organisation said the violence had left some 250,000 people without healthcare, as the NGO had been the only medical provider in the area.</p><p>MSF said the targeted attacks on its facilities have forced the closure of two hospitals in the Greater Upper Nile and the suspension of general healthcare activities in Jonglei, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria states.</p><p>Gul Badshah, operations manager for MSF, told Al Jazeera the NGO has not been allowed to access its care facilities in opposition-held areas in Jonglei since December.</p><p>“We are in constructive dialogue with the government and the relevant authorities to allow us and also facilitate access” to the people seeking help at the facilities, said Badshah.</p><p>The Information Minister Wek also rejected allegations that the government forces bombed a MSF-run hospital in Jonlei state on February 3.</p><p>“Given the circumstances of the rules of engagement in the fighting between the government forces and the rebels, it is very difficult to ascertain who did what,” he said.</p><p>“But the government forces do not loot, and government forces do not take anything against humanitarian organisations,” he said, adding that the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was given wrong information about the government’s involvement in the hospital attack.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Reporting from a displacement camp in Bor, Jonglei state, Al Jazeera’s Malcolm Webb said women there described being subjected to sexual attacks.</p><p>“Two of them [the women] told us … that they had been raped as they fled, a third one said she had narrowly missed being raped by soldiers when someone came to save her,” said Webb.</p><p>“Sexual violence was widely reported to have been used as a weapon of war during the last civil conflict,” added Webb, noting there are growing concerns from the international community and humanitarian groups “that rates of sexual violence are going to go up once again”.</p><p>On Sunday, UN chief Antonio Guterres “strongly” condemned the escalating violence in the country and warned that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict.</p><p>In a statement, the secretary-general called on all parties “to immediately and decisively halt all military operations, de-escalate tensions through dialogue, uphold international law, protect civilians, and ensure safe and sustained humanitarian access and the security of aid workers and United Nations peacekeeping personnel and their assets”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Just over two years in power, and the United Kingdom’s Labour government is facing an existential crisis.</p><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Disclosures linked to the Epstein files have triggered intense criticism of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s appointment of Peter Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, prompting senior resignations and fuelling speculation about Starmer’s political survival. But even if Starmer weathers the immediate political storm, a more profound challenge is looming: the steady fracturing of the political centre that has defined his leadership and electoral appeal.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">UK politics has been marked by years of churn, volatility, and repeated shocks. Yet, through that instability, the political centre largely kept control of the steering wheel – presenting itself as the only credible governing alternative and containing pressure from both flanks. That dominance reinforced the view, particularly abroad, that the UK was largely insulated from the destructive polarisation reshaping other Western democracies, most notably the US.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">Starmer is perhaps the clearest and most explicit embodiment of that centrism, having won the 2024 election on a promise of competence and restraint at a moment when the Conservative Party had lost much of its own reputation for managerial authority and “grown-up” government.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">That centrist settlement is now beginning to fracture.</p><p data-start=\"1677\" data-end=\"2073\">The strain is now visible across multiple fronts. It is visible in polling, electoral behaviour, policy choices, and the tone of public debate. For Starmer, this creates a governing dilemma: how to hold the centre when the forces pulling away from it are becoming louder, sharper, and more confident – and when the authority of the centre itself looks increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2075\" data-end=\"2613\">On the right, Reform UK has emerged as a persistent and disruptive force. Its significance is not primarily electoral – it is unlikely to form a government – but discursive. Reform has succeeded in dragging political debate towards its framing on immigration, borders, and sovereignty. Recent defections and polling momentum have amplified its presence, forcing mainstream parties to respond to its agenda rather than define their own. Even where Reform does not win seats, it shifts the conversation, narrowing the space for moderation.</p><p data-start=\"2615\" data-end=\"3183\">Labour’s response illustrates the bind. Starmer’s leadership has been built around restoring credibility after years of Conservative turmoil: fiscal discipline, institutional stability, and reassurance to voters and markets. But this caution has its limits. Under pressure from the right, Labour has overseen tougher immigration enforcement and deportation rhetoric, moves that signal responsiveness to public anxiety but risk reinforcing Reform’s framing rather than displacing it. The centre adapts, but in doing so, it appears reactive rather than authoritative.</p><p data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3779\">Pressure from the left is no less significant. The Green Party is no longer a marginal protest movement confined to environmental activism. Its growing visibility in local elections and national debates reflects a broader appetite – particularly among younger voters – for sharper positions on climate change, civil liberties, and foreign policy. Where Labour emphasises managerial competence, the Greens speak the language of moral urgency. This contrast matters. Politics is not only about governing capacity, it is about meaning – and on that terrain, the centre increasingly looks hesitant.</p><p data-start=\"3781\" data-end=\"4215\">This tension is now being mirrored inside Labour itself. Recent internal upheaval – including the resignation of Starmer’s chief of staff amid controversy and criticism over appointments and strategy – has exposed unease within the governing project. The centre is no longer just under attack from the outside; it is being questioned from within. That internal turbulence weakens the claim that stability alone can anchor authority.</p><p data-start=\"4217\" data-end=\"4666\">Starmer’s governing style reflects this broader moment. His approach prioritises calm, caution, and predictability – virtues in a country fatigued by crisis. But managerial politics, by definition, struggles to inspire loyalty when social, economic, and geopolitical pressures feel unresolved. The more politics is framed as administration rather than direction, the more space opens for challengers on both flanks to claim clarity and conviction.</p><p data-start=\"4668\" data-end=\"5170\">This dynamic is increasingly visible in the UK’s foreign policy too. Starmer has sought to reposition the UK as a pragmatic global actor, signalling openness to engagement with China while maintaining transatlantic ties. Diplomatically, this is defensible. Domestically, it is harder to sell nuance in a fragmented political environment. Foreign policy, once buffered by elite consensus, is now pulled into domestic culture wars and moral disputes, further narrowing the centre’s room for manoeuvre.</p><p data-start=\"5172\" data-end=\"5568\">Polling reinforces the sense of drift. Surveys showing greater openness to electoral coalitions and rising support for smaller parties point to a loosening grip of the traditional centre. Voters appear less committed to inherited alignments and more willing to experiment – not necessarily out of ideological zeal, but out of frustration with a politics that feels risk-averse and unresponsive.</p><p data-start=\"5570\" data-end=\"5900\">None of this means the UK is on the brink of US-style polarisation. But it does suggest that the old assumptions underpinning centrist dominance no longer hold. The post-war consensus that once stabilised UK politics has eroded. What remains is a thinner centre that must be actively argued for, not simply occupied.</p><p data-start=\"5902\" data-end=\"6255\">The danger is gradual hollowing out rather than sudden collapse. If the centre comes to be seen as evasive, overly technocratic, or morally cautious, it risks losing legitimacy, even as it retains power. In that scenario, politics becomes less about governing choices and more about symbolic confrontation, with the centre permanently on the defensive.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\">For Starmer, the challenge is therefore not just electoral management, but narrative reconstruction. Governing from the centre can no longer mean merely avoiding extremes. It must articulate why the centre is a destination in its own right – capable of leadership, not just restraint. Whether the UK’s political centre can make that transition may determine not only the future of this government, but the shape of UK politics in the years ahead.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He introduced dozens of innovations that simplified bureaucracy and business, according to a four-star general.</p><p>“Fedorov managed to sort it out with Musk – somehow, because we couldn’t do it earlier,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukrainian armed forces, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said the shut-off “significantly lowered” the effectiveness of Russia’s drone attacks and disrupted the communication of small groups of Russian soldiers trying to infiltrate Ukrainian positions.</p><p>The effect was so devastating that it made Russian forces “howl” with despair, said Andriy Pronin, one of the pioneers of military drone use in Ukraine.</p><p>“They’re like blind kittens now,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Russian servicemen in places like the contested eastern town of Kupiansk are now “deprived of any way of getting in touch with mainland”, one of them <a href=\"https://t.me/apwagner/54919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complained</a> on Telegram on February 4.</p><p>Other servicemen and war correspondents decried the shortsightedness of Russian generals who built communications around Starlink and did not create an alternative based on Russian technologies and devices.</p><p>However, the shutdown affected Ukrainian users of Starlink that were not supplied to the Defence Ministry but were procured by civilians and charities.</p><p>“The communications were down for two days until we figured out the white list procedure,” Kyrylo, a serviceman in the northern Kharkiv region, told Al Jazeera. He withheld his last name in accordance with the wartime protocol.</p><p>The effect, however, is short-term and is unlikely to turn the tables in the conflict that is about to enter another year.</p><p>“It’s not a panacea, it’s not like we’re winning the war,” Pronin said. “It will be hard [for Russians], but they will restore their communications.”</p><p>According to Romanenko, “it’ll take them several weeks to switch to older” communication devices such as radio, wi-fi, fibre optic or mobile phone internet.</p></div></div></body></html>"
