But in the aftermath of Maduro’s abduction, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">announced</a> that much of the economic exchange between the two countries would cease.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela.

They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They’re not getting any of it.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly pushed Cuba to “make a deal” to resolve the impasse, though it is unclear what such an agreement would include.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-tariffs\">Threat of tariffs</h2><p>But when weeks passed without a negotiated solution, the Trump administration upped the ante. On January 29, it <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared</a> the situation in Cuba a “national emergency” for the US.</p><p>It <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> the government in Havana of being an “extraordinary threat” and supporting “hostile actors, terrorism, and regional instability that endanger American security and foreign policy”.</p><p>Paired with this emergency declaration was the announcement that the US would impose tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly.</p><p>That put Mexico on the defensive. Mexico, like Venezuela, was among the regional trading partners that supplied Cuba with oil.</p><p>But it is also one of the top trading partners for the US. As many as 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, and the two countries are currently part of a regional free-trade agreement.</p><p>Sheinbaum has nevertheless criticised Trump’s oil blockade against Cuba, calling the situation “unfair”.</p><p>Cuba has long suffered from economic instability, which its government blames on the US sanctions regime. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the island saw shortages of basic supplies, including fuel, sparking one of the island’s largest exoduses in recent history.</p><p>Still, the new Trump-era restrictions on fuel exports to Cuba have brought the island to the brink of a new humanitarian crisis.</p><p>In early February, Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the situation on the island had grown dire. Already, blackouts are a chronic problem.</p><p>“I can tell you that the secretary-general is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,” Dujarric said.</p><p>The US has also announced this month it will supply <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/mexico-promises-food-support-for-cuba-as-us-stifles-the-islands-fuel-supply\">$6m in humanitarian aid</a> to Cuba, though it said it would avoid disbursing the funds through the Cuban government by going through the Catholic Church instead.</p><p>As the two Mexican ships unloaded their humanitarian cargo on Thursday, locals told international news agencies they were grateful for the show of support.</p><p>Ediberto Rodriguez, a 65-year-old Havana resident, told the news outlet Reuters that the delivery was an “unforgettable gesture” from an ally.</p><p>“Mexico hasn’t abandoned us,” he said. “Even with pressure from a global superpower [the United States], they weren’t afraid.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His supporters say the allegations were a <a href=\"/news/2022/9/25/what-really-happened-during-labours-anti-semitism-crisis\">manufactured crisis</a> to undermine him because of his support for Palestinian rights.</p><p>Streeting – long seen as a rising star on the right of the party – became one of the most prominent detractors of Corbyn at the time.</p><p>In 2020, Starmer succeeded Corbyn as leader and suspended him from the party months later over accusations of anti-Semitism as he purged Labour of many officials critical of Israel.</p><p>Corbyn retained his Parliament seat as an independent candidate <a href=\"/news/2024/7/5/uk-general-election-2024-results-five-key-takeaways\">in the 2024 vote</a> that swept Labour into power.</p><p>Last year, he cofounded the socialist Your Party.

But securing a foothold in the West Bank – which Smotrich and his settler movement believe they are biblically entitled to – was <a href=\"/news/2022/12/29/who-are-the-ministers-leading-israels-new-far-right-government\">among his demands</a> before agreeing to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government in 2022.</p><p>Little known internationally before the genocidal war in Gaza began in 2023, Smotrich and his fellow far-right figure, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have become regular fixtures in headlines and government sanction lists around the world. Each has sought to fuel the Gaza war, threatening to collapse the coalition at the first sign of any change in intensity, and pressing on with an illegal campaign of settlement and occupation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s not that Smotrich is particularly charismatic, or that he’s being driven by his base,” Orly Noy, journalist and editor of the Israeli Hebrew-language magazine Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “It’s more that he’s incredibly ideological and he’s smart,” she said, explaining how, over the years, Smotrich had painstakingly worked to have the mechanisms of West Bank governance shifted from the military to his own, civil control.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be anything surprising in this,” Noy continued.</p><p>“In his early days as a political nonentity, he published what he called his ‘Decisive Plan’,” she said, outlining the strategy published by Smotrich in 2017 whereby Palestinians in the West Bank would be left with three essential options: to leave, to accept Israeli domination, or to face annihilation.</p><p>“People, even those on the right wing, laughed at that and dismissed it,” she said, pausing. “They really shouldn’t.”</p><h2 id=\"religious-zionist-upbringing\">Religious Zionist upbringing</h2><p>Bezalel Smotrich is, in every sense, a child of Israel’s settler movement, and one who draws ideological inspiration from Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a key figure in shaping religious Zionism in the 20th century.</p><p>Unlike the better-known American rabbi <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/normalising-hate-israel-leans-in-to-anti-palestinian-violence-rhetoric\">Meir Kahane</a>, whose teachings have been invoked by figures including Ben-Gvir to justify violence, Kook’s ideas have underpinned what their adherents think of as a more high-minded form of ethnic supremacy and colonialism. This ideology casts Israel’s victory in the 1967 war as divinely mandated, but also adds a future Israeli settlement of Palestinian territory as the will of God.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4307361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4307361\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4307361\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-1371429326-1770884136.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel/Palestine: Zvi Yehuda Kook (1891-1982), rabbi, leader of Religious Zionism and Rosh Yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva.

Smotrich remained in the chamber through a shifting variety of right-wing alliances, briefly serving as transport minister for a year in 2019.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until 2022, after Netanyahu brokered a joint electoral slate between Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party and Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) bloc, that the two finally got access to real power.</p><h2 id=\"far-right-alliance\">Far-right alliance</h2><p>Both men have exploited their positions ruthlessly since, acting in concert to urge Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza on, irrespective of the political and international cost, while seeking to maximise the power of the government ministries under their control.</p><p>For Ben-Gvir, that has meant politicising the security force to such a degree that he now finds himself confronting Israel’s Supreme Court over it. Smotrich, for his part, has continued to channel millions to the settler movement, even as other ministries’ budgets have been cut, while settlements and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/mapping-1800-israeli-settler-attacks-in-the-occupied-west-bank-since-october-7\">settler violence</a> have increased.</p><p>Smotrich has also continued to expand his influence over both Palestinian and Jewish residents of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>He was appointed head of the Settlements Administration under his initial deal with Netanyahu, and by <a href=\"/news/2024/6/21/is-israels-smotrich-fulfilling-his-dream-of-annexing-the-west-bank\">June 2024</a>, as global attention focused on the war in Gaza, additional authority was transferred from the military to the Smotrich-headed body.</p><p>“They’re different,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said of Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who, too often, are lumped together. While both politicians rely on the fundamental idea of Jewish supremacy, Goldberg said, “Smotrich wants order. He has a vision for the future; Ben-Gvir isn’t interested in any of that. He’s about hate, racism and a keen desire to burn it all down”.</p><p>“The thing is, many Israelis feel the same way.”</p><p>Throughout, attacks on Palestinians by settlers have become <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/if-you-sleep-settlers-will-burn-your-house-fear-in-the-west-bank\">more brazen</a> and lethal – and conducted with even greater impunity. Even politicians, such as the parliamentarian Ofer Cassif, who have vocally objected to the settlers’ activities, are <a href=\"/news/2021/4/9/video-shows-police-beating-israeli-politician-in-jerusalem\">not safe from physical assault</a>.</p><p>For Cassif, the blame extends beyond just the settlers’ patrons in government to the more mainstream political establishment, including self-styled opposition figures, such as Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, who Cassif describes as turning a blind eye to both the settlers’ violence and Smotrich’s agenda.</p><p>“They don’t dare confront these neo-Nazi bigots in the West Bank, who are launching daily pogroms,” Cassif said.</p><p>“They’ve emboldened them. Now they’re attacking both Arabs and activists within Israel proper, and no one does anything,” he said. “Netanyahu, Smotrich and other ministers don’t interfere with these groups and, in return, these groups help finance them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300230\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300230\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6989d7913b305-1770641297.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich holds a map that shows the E1 settlement project during a press conference near the settlement of Maale Adumim, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Aug. 14, 2025.

The damage has already been done.</p><p>“I don’t know what the future holds for him,” Goldberg concluded. “Extremism [has] become part of the national conversation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It will open the way to transfer them based on political reasons,” Jabareen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is the first law that we know in any Western democracy that allows the state to revoke the citizenship of their citizens only for political reasons.</p><p>“As Netanyahu said, this is just the beginning. This means that they are going to revoke more and more citizenships. This is a way of transferring Palestinian citizens,” who make up about 20 percent of Israel’s overall population of about 10 million people.</p><p>Jabareen added that the Israeli government has done this to stoke tension between Palestinian citizens and the state ahead of the October legislative elections. The Israeli “right wing” wants to be seen as attacking Palestinians for “populist reasons and for electoral reasons”, Jabareen said.</p><p>Prior to the 2023 legislation, the Citizenship Law of 1952 already allowed for the revocation of citizenship or residency of Palestinians in Israel and Jerusalem on the grounds of “breach of loyalty to the State of Israel”.</p><p>“Breach of loyalty” is defined to include carrying out an “act of terror,” aiding or soliciting such an act, or “taking an active part” in a “terrorist organisation,” among other activities.</p><h2 id=\"apartheid-which-other-israeli-laws-discriminate-against-palestinians\">‘Apartheid’: Which other Israeli laws discriminate against Palestinians?</h2><p>The 2023 citizen revocation law is aimed primarily at Palestinians and adds to a longstanding body of legislation that is <a href=\"/news/2018/7/19/five-ways-israeli-law-discriminates-against-palestinians\">applied differently</a> to Palestinians in Israel than to Jewish Israelis.</p><p>There are currently about 100 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens in Israel and Palestinian residents of the occupied Palestinian territory, according to Adalah.</p><p>In 2018, Israel’s parliament adopted a controversial “Jewish nation-state” law defining the country as a Jewish homeland, further marginalising Palestinian citizens of Israel. The law stipulates that Jewish people have “an exclusive right to national self-determination”.</p><p>Last November, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/israeli-parliament-nods-to-bill-to-introduce-death-penalty-for\">passed</a> a first draft of a death penalty bill, introducing capital punishment for those convicted of killing Israelis if they had “racist” motives or were doing it “with the aim of harming Israel”. The bill is under discussion in the Knesset.</p><p>Legal experts say the law is discriminatory in how it defines “terrorism”. Palestinians’ attacks will most likely be dubbed “racist”, attracting the death penalty.</p><p>In a statement on February 3, Amnesty International <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/amnesty-demands-israel-drop-death-penalty-bills-entrenching-apartheid\">called on Israel</a> to abandon the bill, warning that the measures would violate international law and “further entrench Israel’s apartheid system” against Palestinians.</p><p>Amnesty’s statement said: “If adopted, these bills would distance Israel from the vast majority of states which have rejected the death penalty in law or in practice, while further entrenching its cruel system of apartheid against all Palestinians whose rights Israel controls.”</p><p>Last week, the Israeli cabinet passed measures aimed at expanding its power across the occupied West Bank, making it easier to seize Palestinian land illegally.

Everyone else, including Palestinians, has to undergo regular naturalisation.</p><p>Palestinians who live in Gaza or the West Bank are typically not allowed to enter Israel, and, in exceptional circumstances, require permits, which are extremely rare and difficult to obtain.</p><p>Even after they obtain permits, they have to pass through several checkpoints and other barriers such as roadblocks, earth mounds, road gates, road barriers and trenches.</p><p>In 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) documented 565 such obstacles in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and excluding the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron.</p><p>However, Palestinian men from the West Bank over the age of 55 and women over the age of 50 can enter East Jerusalem without a permit.</p><p>Jabareen told Al Jazeera that the recent revocations are “part of the war against Palestinians”.</p><p>“Palestinians in Gaza under genocide, Palestinians in West Bank are facing the violence of the settlers and army, and now Palestinian citizens are facing the threat of revoking their citizenship.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-status-of-palestinian-citizens-in-israel\">What is the status of Palestinian citizens in Israel?</h2><p>Besides being subjected to discriminatory legislation, Palestinian citizens face <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/palestinian-citizens-israel-demand-government-do-more-stop-crime\">violence</a> in Israel.

Only 54 percent of Palestinian men and 36 percent of Palestinian women in Israel have jobs, after already low employment levels plummeted in tandem with the genocide in Gaza, according to figures from 2024.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It feels like a festival,” Hoque told Al Jazeera, smiling.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The last time he voted was in 2008 – the year former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina returned to power and allegedly rigged subsequent elections until her autocratic 15-year regime was challenged by a student-led uprising in 2024, toppling her government and forcing her into exile in India.</p><p>“The elections we had after 2008 were farcical and one-sided under Awami League,” Hoque said, referring to Hasina’s political party, which was barred from elections after the uprising. “They would cast our votes themselves, so we were not even needed at the polling centres in those years.”</p><p>That changed on Thursday as Bangladesh held its first <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/12/bangladesh-election-results-live-polls-formally-close-counting-under-way\">parliamentary election</a> since the 2024 uprising, with the country of 173 million people seeking a return to democracy after years of turmoil.</p><p>Alongside choosing a new parliament, people also voted in a referendum to endorse the so-called “July Charter”, a document born out of the 2024 uprising that proposes sweeping constitutional reforms in order to save the country from future authoritarian rule.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"eid-like-atmosphere\">‘Eid-like atmosphere’</h2><p>Like Hoque, Jainab Lutfun Naher had also returned to the polling booth after 17 years.</p><p>“I was pregnant with my daughter in 2008. Today I voted again, and my daughter is now 17,” the voter from Dhaka’s Gulshan area told Al Jazeera. “It feels absolutely great to vote.”</p><p>Naher said the day felt emotional and empowering – and allowed her hope. <span>“I want this country to prosper,” she said. “I want it to be democratic, where everyone has rights and freedoms.”</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The people’s hopes are pinned on two alliances that were in the fray in <a href=\"/gallery/2026/2/12/bangladeshis-turn-out-for-historic-election-after-hasinas-downfall\">Thursday’s vote</a> – the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/is-bnps-tarique-rahman-the-change-post-hasina-bangladesh-is-looking-for\">Tarique Rahman</a>, and the Jamaat-e-Islami-led coalition of 11 parties, which includes the National Citizen Party (NCP), founded by the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/11/nahid-islam-and-the-uneasy-alliance-that-could-shape-bangladeshs-vote\">youth activists</a> who ousted Hasina.</p><p>Voting took place in 299 of 300 constituencies, with polling in one seat cancelled following the death of a candidate. The Election Commission declared a turnout of around 48 percent up until 2pm local time (08:00 GMT). A finally tally of the turnout is awaited.</p><p>Polls closed at 4.30pm (10:30 GMT) on Thursday and official <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/live-results-bangladesh-election-2026\">results are expected</a> early Friday morning.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Across polling stations in Dhaka, home to 20 parliamentary constituencies, a similar picture emerged: long queues snaking outside school gates and community centres that were turned into polling centres.</p><p>At one such school, first-time voter Nazmun Nahar said she “was so excited I could hardly sleep last night”.</p><p>“It felt like Eid,” she told Al Jazeera, referring to the Muslim religious festival and expressing a sentiment also shared by Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, who told reporters that people were voting in an exuberant “Eid-like atmosphere”.</p><p>Reports from elsewhere in the country suggested a similarly festive mood, as the government declared a three-day holiday for the election and millions of voters travelled to their hometowns – many on train rooftops – to cast their vote.</p><p>Abdur Rahman, a voter in northern Bangladesh who travelled on one such crowded train, said almost everyone he knew — from neighbours to extended family — had returned home to cast their ballots.</p><p>“We were robbed of the joy of voting for so long,” Rahman said. “None of us wanted to miss this opportunity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"birthday-of-a-new-bangladesh\">‘Birthday of a new Bangladesh’</h2><p>After casting his vote at Gulshan Model High School and College in Dhaka, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman, who is a frontrunner for the prime minister, said if he comes to power, he will “prioritise improving law and order in the country so that people feel secure”.</p><p>“I am confident of winning the election,” Tarique Rahman, 60, told reporters.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/country-of-the-blind-how-will-bangladesh-remember-muhammad-yunus\">Muhammad Yunus</a>, the head of the interim government formed after the 2024 uprising, cast his ballot at the same centre.</p><p>“Today is the birthday of a new Bangladesh,” he said. “Through today’s process, people have rejected the past. From today, at every step, we have gained the opportunity to build a new Bangladesh.”</p><p><a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, cast his vote at another polling centre in Dhaka.</p><p>“Through this vote, we hope a government will be formed that does not belong to any individual, family or party, but to the [millions] of people of this country,” the 67-year-old former government doctor, told reporters, calling the election a “turning point” for Bangladesh.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Analysts said that while there were scattered allegations of poll malpractices, the election process had largely been peaceful.</p><p>Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera the election did not see “reports of major irregularities”.</p><p>“Some isolated incidents have occurred, which are of course unwanted, but every election in Bangladesh has had some irregularities. Unless those are serious enough to change the overall result, they do not cross a critical threshold,” he said.</p><p>Political analyst Dilara Choudhury said a relatively peaceful election is a first step in Bangladesh’s long transition towards democratic normalcy. “Minimal violence in the election is good,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If both parties accept the results, it would be a first step for Bangladesh towards a new kind of politics or democratic transition,” she added.</p><p>But Choudhury cautioned that an election “does not mean a full transition to democracy”, arguing that the next phases would depend on whether governing and opposition forces jointly pursue reforms outlined in the July Charter and institutionalise them – including commitments to accountability, rule of law, and good governance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mazeda Begum, a voter at Dhaka’s Civil Aviation School and College polling centre, said she hopes the new government — whoever forms it — will work for the country’s progress, particularly in education and economy.</p><p>“There are many problems in our education system and in the education of our children,” she said. “We also face economic difficulties in our daily lives. I hope the new government will work for us.”</p><p>At another polling centre in Dhaka’s Agargaon area, Nurul Amin had come to vote with deep expectations.</p><p>“I have come to vote after many years,” he told Al Jazeera. “This country needs to move forward, and the next government should fix our problems.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

the withdrawal of a longstanding United States troop presence at the base.</p><p>The ministry said in a statement on Thursday that Syrian Arab Army units had taken control of al-Tanf, securing the base and its surroundings, “through coordination between the Syrian and American sides”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

the ministry said, while border guards would be deployed in the coming days.</p><p>US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed the withdrawal in a statement, saying that the “orderly departure” was “part of a deliberate and conditions-based transition.”</p><p>“US forces remain poised to respond to any [Islamic State] threats that arise in the region as we support partner-led efforts to prevent the terrorist network’s resurgence,” said Admiral Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander.</p><p>“Maintaining pressure on [Islamic State] is essential to protecting the US homeland and strengthening regional security.”</p><p>The base was established during Syria’s civil war in 2014 as a ‌key hub for operations by the global coalition against ISIL (ISIS), which at the time controlled large areas of Syria and Iraq until the group was vanquished in 2017.</p><p>The US withdrawal from the base comes months after Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of the armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, who the US once deemed a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist”, joined the anti-ISIL coalition in November.</p><p>The US military has not officially commented on the pullout, but Trump has expressed an interest in withdrawing US troops from Syria since his first term.</p><h2 id=\"syrian-government-expands-control\">Syrian government expands control</h2><p>The pullout also follows ⁠a US-brokered deal to integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces – a key US partner in the fight against ISIL – into Syrian government institutions, an agreement the US hailed as a major step towards national unity and ⁠reconciliation in Syria.</p><p>Last month, as al-Sharaa’s government <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">pushed to expand</a> its control over the country, Syrian government forces captured large areas of previously Kurdish-held territory in northeast Syria, amid deadly clashes with the SDF.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/syrian-forces-deploy-in-hasakah-under-ceasefire-agreement-with-sdf\">ceasefire</a> was later <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/kurdish-led-sdf-agrees-integration-with-syrian-government-forces\">struck</a> between the sides.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Amid the advance of Syrian forces, the US military <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">has been transferring</a> thousands of ISIL prisoners from jails previously run by the SDF in northeastern Syria, as the facilities were transferred to Syrian government control.</p><h2 id=\"us-drawdown\">US drawdown</h2><p>While the size of the US deployment in Syria has fluctuated over the years, with precise figures often unclear due to the classified nature of many operations, a Pentagon announcement in July 2025 said there were about 1,500 American soldiers in Syria.</p><p>The size of the deployment currently stands at 900, The Associated Press reported.</p><p>Earlier this month, an Al Jazeera correspondent on the ground <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/us-transfers-isil-detainees-to-iraq-as-northeast-syria-base-draws-down\">reported</a> that US military personnel appeared to be drawing down their presence from watchtowers surrounding a military installation in the al-Shaddadi area in northeastern Hasakah province.</p><p>Soldiers were also seen lowering the US flag from one tower, while equipment used to manage aircraft takeoffs and landings at the base’s airstrip was no longer visible.</p><p>The US carried out a round of <a

It ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Khan’s eye and directed that he be allowed phone contact with his sons, who both live in the United Kingdom, and ordered both tasks to be completed before February 16.</p><p>“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” Chief Justice Yahya Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"health-concerns-mount\">Health concerns mount</h2><p>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party founded by Khan, expressed “profound concern” in a statement on Thursday and strongly condemned the treatment meted out to him, “particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight”.</p><p>The party said it reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings against relevant officials over his declining health, warning that “any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for”.</p><p>“We demand that Imran Khan be granted <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/why-jail-access-to-pakistans-imran-khan-has-caused-a-political-storm\">immediate and unrestricted access</a> to his personal physicians and that, for specialized eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team. Unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights are his fundamental rights,” the statement read.</p><p>Khan, a popular former Pakistan cricket captain and World Cup winner, became prime minister in 2018 in elections that opponents alleged were rigged in his favour by the powerful military. Four years later, <a href=\"/news/2022/4/9/analysis-end-of-imran-khans-term\">he was removed</a> through a no-confidence vote that he claimed was orchestrated by the military, after their relationship soured, in collusion with Washington and Khan’s political rivals in Pakistan.</p><p>These allegations were denied by both the Pakistani military and the United States.</p><p>Since his ouster, he has blamed army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for his troubles and repeatedly urged supporters to stage public protests.</p><p>Following his removal from power, Khan faced a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/ex-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-wife-sentenced-to-17-years-in-corruption-case\">cascade of charges</a> that his party says were designed to sideline Pakistan’s most popular opposition leader. After being detained for less than two days in May 2023, he was arrested again in August 2023 on corruption charges.</p><p>He has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August 2023. He has remained there since, in what Safdar’s report confirms as solitary confinement for approximately two years and four months.</p><p>In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Khan’s detention “had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running [for] political office.”</p><h2 id=\"political-fallout-deepens\">Political fallout deepens</h2><p>The Supreme Court’s decision to appoint an independent observer followed months of restricted access to Khan. Chief Justice Afridi had stressed that Safdar should be given “respectful and unhindered access” and not be kept waiting outside the jail.</p><p>The report states that Khan has been denied access to his lead counsel and legal team for the past five months. He also told Safdar that his sisters and other immediate family members had not been permitted to visit him. Only after the change in jail superintendent was he allowed to meet his wife – who is also behind bars on corruption charges – once a week for about 30 minutes every Tuesday.</p><p>Benazir Shah, a senior political analyst, said the public deserves transparency and his family deserves answers.</p><p>“The government has mishandled Imran Khan’s health from the very start, first by concealing the news until it was reported by a local English newspaper, then by dismissing it as a routine matter, and ultimately by performing a procedure without the knowledge or presence of his family,” she said.</p><p>“The treatment meted out to a former prime minister for so long shows that the current government in Pakistan has scant regard for basic human rights,” Lahore-based Shah told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One might question whether he is the patriot we need to comment on this issue,” he said.</p><p>Recent protests against the club’s ownership will now likely expand.</p><p>Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club expressed outrage at Ratcliffe’s use of the word “colonised”, with its echoing of “far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats”.</p><p>“Such rhetoric has real-world consequences,” said the group, pointing to a recent <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/28/why-is-it-that-the-uk-government-cant-define-islamophobia\">rise</a> in race-motivated hostility that has coincided with surging support for the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">Reform UK</a> party.</p><p></p><p>Rhetoric around immigration has hardened in recent years, with a wave of protests last summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers and widespread rioting in 2024, prompted by misinformation that a teenager who <a href=\"/news/2024/8/2/southport-stabbing-what-led-to-the-spread-of-disinformation\">killed three young girls</a> was a Muslim immigrant.</p><p>Other fan clubs piled on more condemnation of Ratcliffe, with the Rainbow Devils club for LGBTQ supporters expressing fears that his words could cause “real damage” to “minority communities in general, including many loyal Manchester United fans who are immigrants”.</p><p>The Manchester United Supporters’ Trust pointed out that the club’s leadership “should make inclusion easier, not harder”.</p><p>Ratcliffe, who founded chemical giant Ineos in 1998, bought a minority share in Manchester United in late 2023, subsequently leading to anger among fans over soaring ticket prices.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
