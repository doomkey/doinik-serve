The new deal, analysts noted, could give India an edge in several sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, machinery, steel, petroleum products and electrical equipment.</p><p>Overall, the EU is giving India access to 144 services subsectors while India is opening 102 subsectors to the EU, including in the financial, maritime and telecommunications industries.</p><p>On Tuesday, Modi told Indian workers and industry leaders in sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery that “the agreement will prove very helpful for you,” adding that it will not only boost manufacturing in India but will also expand India’s services sector.</p><p>“This free trade agreement will strengthen confidence in India for every business and every investor in the world. India is working extensively on global partnerships in all sectors,” Modi said.</p><p>The final draft of the trade agreement must still pass legal scrutiny in Brussels and New Delhi and may only become operational next year, said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has been involved with multiple Indian trade negotiations.</p><p>Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who has dealt with regional trading blocs, described the trade deal as “excellent, providing professional market access while taking care of the bureaucratic labyrinth of the EU”.</p><p>“Unlike 20 years ago, today India has the capacity to work together with the Europeans and provides a good market for them,” Trigunayat said. “There will be much more to look into other than cheaper wines or BMWs, including trade investments.”</p><p>“It’s a very significant deal for both India and the EU,” Dhar told Al Jazeera, “and a major step towards consolidating India’s trade and economic relations with its largest trade partner.”</p><p>Crucially, Dhar said, this deal represents an opportunity for both sides to “diversify and look beyond the US and grow beyond their dependence on the American market”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-27T090700Z_25585653_RC2VWIA1A5UM_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AUTO-STOCKS-1769506214.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"bmw india\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cars made by Germany-based BMW, on sale in Mumbai, are now subject to high Indian tariffs, but those duties will fall dramatically under the trade pact [File: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-india-opening-its-much-protected-automobile-industry\">Is India opening its much-protected automobile industry?</h2><p>India has been criticised in the past for its protectionist approach to the automobile sector, including by Tesla owner Elon Musk. It has been levying tariffs as high as 110 percent on foreign vehicles.</p><p>Negotiations to reach a trade deal between India and the EU broke down in 2013 over New Delhi’s reluctance to open its automobile sector.</p><p>Under the deal announced on Tuesday, however, New Delhi will open its domestic automobile market to EU imports, slashing tariffs on most cars from the EU to 30 to 35 percent, which are to be then phased down to 10 percent over several years.</p><p>It is understood that EU cars priced below 15,000 euros ($17,800) are excluded from the deal and will remain subject to higher tariffs. Cars costing more than this will be divided into three categories, each with quotas and separate tariffs.</p><p>Electric vehicles, however, will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic Indian electric car manufacturers.</p><p>After that, imports from the EU will be restricted to 160,000 internal combustion engines and 90,000 electric vehicles per year.</p><p>Despite these safeguards, shares in Indian carmakers dipped by about 1.6 percent after the announcement of the trade deal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268485\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268485\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-26T074224Z_704819240_RC2T8JA45FXW_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-REPUBLICDAY-1769506351.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ursula von der Leyen\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modi, von der Leyen and Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh attend the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26, 2026 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-benefit-the-eu\">How will the deal benefit the EU?</h2><p>Indian tariffs on 30 percent of goods imported from the EU will fall to zero immediately.</p><p>Overall, tariffs on 96.6 percent of EU goods exports to India will be eliminated or reduced, EU officials said. The deal will save up to 4 billion euros ($4.74bn) a year in duties on European products.</p><p>Besides the relaxation of tariffs on car imports from the EU, existing Indian tariffs of up to 44 percent on machinery, 22 percent on chemicals and 11 percent on pharmaceuticals will, for the most part, be eliminated.</p><p>Tariffs on EU aircraft and spacecraft will also be eliminated for almost all products while those on optical, medical and surgical equipment will be eliminated for 90 percent of products.</p><p>Meanwhile, spirits and wines imported to India from the EU, currently tariffed at 150 percent, will be cut to 20 to 30 percent for wines, 40 percent for spirits and 50 percent for beer.</p><p>India will also provide improved access for EU firms in financial and maritime services, and both sides will simplify customs rules and provide stronger intellectual property protections.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-benefit-india\">How will the deal benefit India?</h2><p>The EU will scrap all tariffs on 90 percent of Indian goods, and within seven years, that will be extended to 93 percent of Indian goods.</p><p>Among those benefitting from zero tariffs immediately are marine/seafood products, such as shrimp and frozen fish (currently levied at up to 26 percent); chemicals (12.8 percent); plastics and rubber (6.5 percent); leather and footwear (17 percent); textiles (12 percent); apparel (4 percent); base metals (10 percent); and gems and jewellery (4 percent).</p><p>There will be partial tariff cuts and quotas for about 6 percent of Indian goods, bringing the EU’s average tariff rate down from 3.8 percent to 0.1 percent.</p><p>Overall, 99.5 percent of bilateral trade will benefit from some form of tariff concession.</p><p>India is still seeking improvements in tariff-free steel export quotas, and the outcome of these talks is due by June 30 before EU rules take effect on July 1. Under the deal as it stands, India would be allowed to export 1.6 million tonnes of steel to the EU duty-free, but this is only about half what it exports annually at present.</p><p>The EU has not granted India an exemption from its carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which taxes “carbon-intensive” goods – those that require large amounts of energy to produce, such as steel, cement, fertiliser and electricity.</p><p>Only countries that are associated with the EU, such as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are exempt from these due to their participation in the EU emissions trading system or related agreements. Countries whose emissions-trading systems are linked directly to the EU’s, such as Switzerland, are also exempt.</p><p>However, India will be able to negotiate this if the EU grants flexibility to another country.</p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-india-eu-trade-now\">How significant is India-EU trade now?</h2><p>The US remains the biggest overall trading partner for both India and the EU.</p><p>However, over the past decade, goods trade between India and the EU has grown substantially, rising from about $74bn in 2020 to $136bn in 2024-2025, making the EU India’s largest goods trading partner.</p><p>India has a favourable trade surplus with the EU of more than $15bn as its exports of $75.85bn outpace imports of $60.68bn.</p><p>EU exports are heavy on machinery, transport equipment and chemicals while India mostly exports chemicals, base metals, mineral products and textiles.</p><p>The two sides hope to increase that to about $200bn by 2030.</p><p>From 2019 to 2024, India-EU trade in services also grew with Indian exports rising from $22.5bn to $44bn while EU exports increased from about $17bn to $34bn. The two mainly trade in business consulting and IT services.</p><p>India is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.4 percent of its total trade, compared with 17.3 percent for the US and 14.6 percent for China.</p><p>As of 2024, 931,607 Indians resided in the EU, according to the Indian government. Comparative figures for EU citizens living in India are not available.</p><p>The EU says about 6,000 European companies operate in India while about 1,500 Indian companies have a presence in the EU.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3785318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3785318\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3785318\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-02-13T235546Z_707021281_RC2ZTCAFSWHQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-INDIA-1750307310.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pictured in a mirror as they attend a joint press conference at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.

Half of that is punishment for India’s continued purchase of Russian crude oil, which White House officials said is financing the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>EU tensions with the Trump administration have been building as well, particularly over Trump’s insistence that the US be allowed to buy Greenland, which is a territory of EU member Denmark.</p><p>This month, Trump threatened additional tariffs of 10 percent – rising to 25 percent in June – against eight European countries that had objected to Trump’s demand to buy Greenland. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stated that the island, which is politically part of Europe but is geographically located in North America, is not for sale.</p><p>However, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Trump walked back this threat and said he would not impose tariffs. Instead, he said, constructive talks had laid the basis for a framework of an agreement over Greenland.</p><p>The EU is still subject to up to 15 percent tariffs by the US under an EU-US trade deal signed last year.</p><p>Experts said the finalisation of the India-EU trade agreement has been expedited, in part, in response to this pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p><span>“The global trade disruptions have become a norm, and there is an urgent necessity for both [India and the EU] to provide a certain degree of certainty to their businesses,” Dhar said. “The US is mired in uncertainty, and one just doesn’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-us-react-to-the-india-eu-trade-deal\">How will the US react to the India-EU trade deal?</h2><p>The White House has already criticised the agreement.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lashed out at the EU over the pact with New Delhi. “We have put 25 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” Bessent told ABC News on Sunday.</p><p>“They [the Europeans] are financing the war against themselves,” he added.</p><p>While the EU <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">signed a trade deal</a> with the US fairly quickly after Trump announced his <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">trade war</a> last year, New Delhi is still trying to negotiate one with Washington. It is also seeking to diversify trade to other parts of the world.</p><p>“India has taken a policy of strategic patience [in dealing with Trump’s trade war],” Trigunayat said. “The deal with the EU is part of the same process to cushion the impact and find new partners.”</p><p>Harsh Pant, vice president of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, told Al Jazeera: “You have two big economic players coming together, which is a signal to the US that they are willing to move forward with their own agenda.”</p><p>“There is a quite extraordinary geopolitical realignment between India and the EU,” Pant said. “The Trump effect has accelerated the process of this convergence, and we are going to see more strategic engagement between the two.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/16/how-save-un-trump\">emphasised</a> the hate and dispensed with the love, denouncing what it perceives as “anti-American” and “hostile agendas.”</p><p>The administration has <a href=\"https://x.com/loucharbon/status/2009336871902695752?s=20\">disregarded and defunded</a> dozens of lifesaving UN programs. It has also withheld much of the  assessed contributions, which member states are obligated to pay. The administration has pulled out of the UN World Health Organization, UN climate bodies, and international climate agreements, and stopped funding the UN population fund, which supports and protects women and girls in armed conflicts and crisis zones.</p><p>US negotiators have <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20260118/p2g/00m/0op/018000c\">pushed</a> Trump’s ideological agenda in UN negotiations, demanding the removal of selected human rights language from resolutions and statements. According to UN diplomats, targeted language includes words like “gender,” “diversity” and “climate” because the Trump administration views them as “woke” or politically correct. While the administration has had some success with its ideological campaign in the UN Security Council thanks to its veto power, it has been less successful in the General Assembly, where the US is just one of 193 voting members and has no veto.</p><p>But it is the Security Council that the administration appears determined to recreate in a Trumpian form. The Board of Peace’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-board-of-peace-charter-full-text\">charter</a> describes it as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”</p><p>The charter doesn’t mention human rights, which is doubtless music to the ears of the Russian and Chinese governments, which have <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/06/un-needs-protect-its-vital-yet-underfunded-human-rights-work\">worked for years to de-emphasize human rights</a> at the UN.</p><p>Trump’s board appears to be a kind of pay-to-play, global club, judging from the $1 billion fee for permanent membership. With several notorious human rights abusers and leaders implicated in war crimes – and few countervailing voices – it is hard to imagine this body giving priority to ending suffering, hatred and bloodshed, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/president-trump-ratifies-board-of-peace-in-historic-ceremony-opening-path-to-hope-and-dignity-for-gazans/\">declared</a> at the launch event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. Among those Trump has invited to join are two who are subject to International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity – Russian President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-asks-putin-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-even-as-ukraine-war-rages\">Vladimir Putin</a> and Israeli <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">invited leaders of other countries</a> with appalling human rights records to join his board: From China and Belarus to Kazakhstan.</p><p>The charter makes clear that Trump as board chairman would have supreme authority “to adopt resolutions or other directives” as he sees fit.</p><p>So far, the only European Union members that agreed to join are Hungary and Bulgaria. Hungary’s far-right populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long been a Trump supporter. French President Emmanuel Macron is among those who turned down an offer to join – Trump responded with a threat to significantly increase tariffs on French wine and champagne.</p><p>Trump also offered Canada a permanent seat on the board. But he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/trump-revokes-canadas-invitation-to-join-board-of-peace\">withdrew</a> the offer after  Prime Minister Mark Carney’s <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/\">speech</a> in Davos. Without naming Trump or the US, Carney said the UN and other multilateral organisations are under threat, and sharply criticised great powers’ use of economic coercion against smaller countries. Carney urged middle powers to band together and resist great power bullying.</p><p>Originally the Board of Peace was meant to oversee the administration of Gaza following over two years of onslaught and destruction by Israeli forces that left at least 70,000 Palestinians dead, with which the US was complicit. The board’s charter doesn’t mention Gaza. But Gaza was the focus of a side event at Davos led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner will be a member of the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">Gaza Executive Board</a>,” a subsidiary body of the Board of Peace.</p><p>Kushner offered a surreal vision of a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/imperial-agenda-whats-trumps-gaza-development-plan-unveiled-in-davos\">New Gaza</a>” complete with glistening office towers and pristine beaches packed with tourists. The Gaza Executive Board includes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vx7kn33elo\">no Palestinians</a> but has former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff, and senior officials from Türkiye and Qatar.</p><p>Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks, governments should work together to protect the UN and other institutions established to uphold international human rights and  humanitarian law, the global rule of law, and accountability. They should use all available resources to counter unjust US actions like Trump’s sanctions on ICC judges and prosecutors, a UN special rapporteur, and prominent Palestinian human rights groups. They should press for accountability for grave international crimes by all warring parties, whether in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, Myanmar, or elsewhere.</p><p>Anything less would hand Trump a dangerous victory and allow him and his board to sideline the UN and other vital international organizations. The UN has its problems, including when it comes to upholding human rights. But it’s worth strengthening, not replacing with a club of rights abusers and alleged war criminals.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Importantly, she claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits.</p><p>She alleges the apps fueled her depression and suicidal thoughts and is seeking to hold the companies liable.

And yes, this is a general pattern that applies to other countries, too, though Japan has an especially high level of debt, making its position more vulnerable.”</p><p>Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio already exceeds 230 percent, following decades of deficit spending by governments aiming to reverse the country’s long-term economic stagnation.</p><p>The East Asian country’s debt burden stands far above that of peers such as the US, UK and France, whose debt-to-GDP ratios are about 125 percent, 115 percent and 101 percent, respectively.</p><p>At the same time, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been scaling back bond purchases as part of its move away from decades of ultra-low interest rates, limiting its options for interventions to bring yields down.</p><p>“Bond investors reacted because her headline package looks like large, near-term fiscal loosening at exactly the moment the BOJ is trying to normalise policy,” Sayuri Shirai, a professor of economics at Keio University in Tokyo, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-all-this-affect-the-rest-of-the-world\">How does all this affect the rest of the world?</h2><p>The sell-off in Japanese bonds reverberated through markets overseas, with yields on 30-year US Treasuries rising to their highest level since September.</p><p>As Japanese bond yields rise, local investors are able to earn higher interest payments at home.</p><p>That can incentivise investors to offload other bonds, such as US Treasuries.</p><p>As of November, Japanese investors held $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries, more than any other foreign group of buyers.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed concern about the impact of Japan’s bond market on US Treasury prices and said he anticipated that his Japanese counterparts would “begin saying the things that will calm the market down.”</p><p>Japan’s long-term bond yields fell on Monday amid the expectations that Japanese and US authorities would step in to prop up the yen.</p><p>On Friday, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had inquired about the cost of exchanging the Japanese currency for US dollars.</p><p>“Japan matters globally through flows. If Japanese government bond yields rise, Japanese investors can earn more at home, potentially reducing demand for foreign bonds; that can nudge global yields and risk pricing,” Shirai said.</p><p>“This is why global-market pieces have framed Japan’s bond move as a wider rates story.”</p><p>Higher bond yields in Japan, the US and elsewhere raise the cost of borrowing and servicing the national debt.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario, a sharp escalation in interest rates can lead to a country defaulting on its debts.</p><p>Masahiko Loo, a fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management in Tokyo, said that the reaction of international investors to Takaichi’s plans reflects growing sensitivity to fiscal credibility in highly indebted economies.</p><p>“Yes, Japan may be the spark, but the warning applies equally to the US and others with large structural deficits,” Loo told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"is-japan-on-the-verge-of-a-financial-crisis\">Is Japan on the verge of a financial crisis?</h2><p>Probably not.</p><p>While Japan is more indebted than its peers, its fiscal position is more sustainable than it might appear due to factors specific to the country – at least in the short to medium term – according to economists.</p><p>The vast majority of Japan’s debt is held by local institutions and denominated in yen, reducing the likelihood of a panic induced by foreign investors, while interest rates are far lower than in other economies.</p><p>“The debt situation is more manageable than a lot of people think,” Thomas Mathews, head of markets for Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Net debt-to-GDP is on a downward trajectory, and Japan’s budget deficit isn’t all that big by global standards.”</p><p>Loo of State Street Investment Management said that the turmoil surrounding Japan had more to do with a “communication gap around fiscal sustainability and policy coordination” than the country’s solvency.</p><p>“That said, markets are likely to continue testing the feasibility of the agenda, as even fiscally sanguine countries have, at times, been disciplined by market forces,” Loo said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He explained that approaching the cemetery was impossible, as tanks enforced a deadly perimeter, firing at anything that moved.</p><p>From his position near the “Yellow Line”, Israel’s self-proclaimed buffer zone inside Gaza, al-Rifi described a “wall of fire” created by artillery and helicopters to protect the engineering units. Inside this sealed zone, witnesses and video footage obtained later revealed that the forces spent two days churning up the earth.</p><p>“They dug up about 200 graves,” al-Rifi said. “They pulled the martyrs out, tested them one by one until they found the [Israeli] body.”</p><p>The disparity was most evident in the aftermath. Gvili’s remains were airlifted for dignified burial in Israel. The Palestinian bodies, however, were left to the mercy of bulldozers.</p><p>“When citizens went to the area [after the withdrawal], they found the martyrs put back randomly … covered with sand by the bulldozers,” al-Rifi said. “Some bodies were still visible on the surface.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-world-s-largest-graveyard\">‘The world’s largest graveyard’</h2><p>While Israel used satellite technology and DNA labs to close the chapter on its missing policeman, Palestinian families are denied even the basic machinery to dig.</p><p>Alaa al-Din al-Aklouk, spokesperson for the National Committee for Missing Persons, stated last November that Gaza has become “the world’s largest graveyard”.</p><p>“These martyrs are buried under the rubble of their homes … without their last dignity being preserved,” al-Aklouk said. He highlighted the “fatal injustice” of an international community that mobilised resources for Israeli captives while blocking the entry of heavy civil defence equipment needed to recover Palestinian victims.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera on Monday that while he respects the right of any family to bury their dead, the contrast is inescapable. “The lack of equal treatment, the lack of respect to Palestinians as equal human beings, is really astonishing,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"a-cost-paid-in-blood\">A cost paid in blood</h2><p>The dark irony of this Israeli mission is that it created new victims. On Tuesday morning, as residents approached the desecrated cemetery to check on the graves of their loved ones, Israeli fire struck again.</p><p>“Four martyrs fell in the area this morning,” al-Rifi said, noting that one of them, his relative Youssef al-Rifi, had simply gone to inspect the destruction left behind.</p><p>In its quest to close a raw chapter that has shaken its national psyche since October 2023, Israel opened new graves in 2026. The operation serves as a grim microcosm of the entire war: The sanctity of one side’s life and death is upheld at the absolute expense of the other’s.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.</p><p>The ICE agent was not harmed in the incident.</p><p>Porter’s family lawyer has raised questions over the DHS account, calling for evidence that the slain father of two fired at the officer.</p><p>Jamal Tooson, the lawyer, also criticised the ICE agent for confronting Porter with his weapon instead of involving the local police, who are well-trained and familiar with the community.</p><p>“Had he just stayed in his apartment for five minutes, Keith would be with us,” Tooson said in a news conference.</p><h2 id=\"geraldo-lunas-campos\">Geraldo Lunas Campos</h2><p>Earlier this month, ICE announced that Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 at the agency’s largest detention facility – Camp East Montana in Texas.</p><p>Since then, contradicting details have emerged about his death, which a medical examiner has ruled as a homicide – meaning caused by another person.</p><p>ICE initially said Lunas Campos “became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm” and was placed in segregation.</p><p>He then became distressed, according to the agency.</p><p>“Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS,” ICE said in a January 9 statement.</p><p>The agency repeatedly highlighted Lunas Campos’s criminal record.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The authorities later changed their own story, claiming that Lunas Campos tried to kill himself.</p><p>“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS’s McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”</p><p>But an autopsy report found that Linas Campos was killed by someone.</p><p>“Based on the investigative and examination findings, it is my opinion that the cause of death is asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,” Adam Gonzalez, deputy medical examiner for El Paso County, said in the report, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>“The manner of death is homicide.”</p><p>Lunas Campos’ three children have filed a legal petition aiming to block the deportation of any detainees who may have witnessed the incident, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit.</p><p>“According to an eyewitness to Mr Lunas Campos’s death, guards at the facility choked him to death,” the petition said.</p><h2 id=\"victor-manuel-diaz\">Victor Manuel Diaz</h2><p>Immigration authorities arrested Nicaraguan immigrant Victor Manuel Diaz on January 6 in Minneapolis as part of their <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/who-is-greg-bovino-the-face-of-trumps-minneapolis-crackdown\">immigration crackdown</a> in Minnesota. Eight days later, he died in ICE custody at Camp East Montana in Texas.</p><p>“Contract security staff found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room,” ICE said in a statement. “He died of a presumed suicide; however, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.”</p><p>But Diaz’s family is questioning the government’s story.</p><p>“I don’t believe he took his life,” Diaz’s brother Yorlan told ABC News. “He was not a criminal; he was looking for a better life and he wanted to help our mother.”</p><p>The family has also raised concerns over how the authorities are handling the investigation.</p><p>According to several US media reports, Diaz’s body was transferred to William Beaumont Army Medical Center for an autopsy, instead of the county medical examiner.</p><p>“This, taking of the body and doing the autopsy report and not letting the medical examiner do it? You’re then having the fox guarding the henhouse,” Randall Kallinen, the family’s lawyer, told the local outlet KTSM.</p><p>“It was with the federal government where the individual was staying and where he was killed. And now it’s the federal government who is controlling the investigation and the information included in the autopsy report.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"parady-la\">Parady La</h2><p>Cambodian immigrant Parady La, 46, had been in the US since 1981. He had come to the US legally as a child but lost his Green Card due to criminal convictions.</p><p>Immigration authorities arrested him on January 6 and sent him to the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Philadelphia, where he started experiencing “severe drug withdrawal” symptoms, according to ICE.</p><p>“The next day, La was found unresponsive in his cell. FDC officers immediately administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance,” the US agency said.</p><p>NARCAN is a drug used for people experiencing a drug overdose, not withdrawals.</p><p>La was transferred to a hospital and diagnosed with “anoxic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, shock and multiple organ failures” before he died, ICE said.</p><p>But La’s family is voicing scepticism about the level of care he received.</p><p>His nephew, Michael La, said ICE’s version of the events leading to his uncle’s death “didn’t add up”.</p><p>“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” Michael La told local public radio WHYY. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”</p><h2 id=\"luis-beltran-yanez-cruz\">Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz</h2><p>A father of three, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, had been in the US for more than 20 years when ICE picked him up in New Jersey in November and transferred him to a detention centre in California.</p><p>He died on January 6 of “heart-related health issues” after being transferred to a hospital.</p><p>But his family has said that he was feeling ill for weeks and was only given pain medication.</p><p>“As a father, he was an excellent dad,” his daughter, Josselyn Yanez, told the news website northjersey.com. “As a grandfather, the best grandfather of all. We hoped our father would get out of that place, that he would come out alive – not the way he did.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heber-sanchez-dominguez\">Heber Sanchez Dominguez</h2><p>Seven days after ICE picked up Heber Sanchez Dominguez, the 34-year-old Mexican national was found dead in his cell at the Robert A Deyton (RAD) Detention Facility in Georgia on January 14.</p><p>“RAD medical staff discovered Sanchaz (sic) hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters at approximately 2:05 am,” ICE said in a statement.</p><p>The lack of details has prompted calls for investigation, including from Mexican officials.</p><p>Sanchez Dominguez was arrested in Georgia for driving without a licence before being transferred to ICE custody.</p><p>“In coordination with the relevant US authorities, the Consulate General has requested that the circumstances of the incident be clarified and is cooperating in the necessary steps to ensure that the investigation is carried out promptly and transparently,” Mexico’s consulate in Atlanta said after Sanchez Dominguez’s death.</p><p>The Clayton County Democratic Committee in Georgia also called on state officials to push for an investigation.</p><p>“We further demand the immediate release of all records and documentation related to Mr. Sanchez Dominguez’s detention, medical treatment, and the events leading up to his death. Transparency is not optional, it is a moral and legal obligation,” the group said in a statement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268718\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4268718 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_ICE_killed_Jan27_2026-01-1769512374.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_ICE_killed_shootings_Jan27_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"luis-gustavo-nunez-caceres\">Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres</h2><p>ICE has said that Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, a 42-year-old immigrant from Honduras, died on January 5 at a hospital in Houston, Texas, after being admitted for “chronic heart-related health issues”.</p><p>Nunez did not have a criminal record, but he had entered the country irregularly. ICE nabbed him during an immigration enforcement operation in November 2025 and transferred him to the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas.</p><p>“ICE is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments,” the agency said in a statement, after Nunez’s death.</p><p>“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The conclusion of his protest brings an end to a rolling hunger strike that began in November.</p><p>Khalid is among eight remand prisoners affiliated with Palestine Action who participated in the protest, which is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in the United Kingdom’s history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands and 10 hunger strikers, including Sands, starved themselves in protest over British policies towards political prisoners and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Palestine Action’s Khalid was the last to keep refusing food after the others ended their hunger strikes earlier this month, claiming <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/prison-rights-elbits-loss-how-the-palestine-action-hunger-strike-won\">victory.</a></p><p>“At the hospital … I was given a choice between treatment and likely death within the next 24 hours due to kidney failure, acute liver failure, and potential cardiac arrest,” said Khalid, in a statement shared by the Prisoners for Palestine group, which is supporting the collective.

They deny the charges against them.</p><p>The incident, which was claimed by Palestine Action, caused millions of pounds worth of damage, according to the British government, which later proscribed the protest group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Khalid had called for immediate bail; an end to alleged censorship in prison, with the authorities accused of withholding mails, calls and books and denying visitation rights; an inquiry into alleged involvement of the UK in Israeli military operations in Gaza; and the release of surveillance footage from Royal Air Force (RAF) spy flights that flew over Gaza on April 1, 2024, when British aid workers were killed in an Israeli attack.</p><p>A Prison Service spokesperson told Al Jazeera, “We do not recognise these claims. All prisoners are subject to the same national rules on post and communications, and legal visits and access to legal paperwork are never withheld from prisoners.”</p><p>But Prisoners for Palestine claimed that there were concessions, saying Khalid had met with the prison governor and has recently received previously withheld mail and clothes.</p><p>John McDonnell, a Labour MP, said the end of Khalid’s strike brought a sense of relief.</p><p class=\"p2\">“We were fearful for Umer’s health and life,” he said. “It demonstrated to me the absolute courage that he’s displayed along with others, based upon a commitment to the principles that he’s advocated in terms of peace and justice to the Palestinian people.</p><p class=\"p2\">“I pay tribute to them, but I fear for their ongoing health – being on hunger strike for this long can have permanent features.”</p><p>In recent days, dozens of demonstrators have gathered at the gates of Wormwood Scrubs, calling on the government to engage with Khalid’s demands.</p><p>On Saturday, police arrested 86 protesters, saying they allegedly blocked prison staff from entering and leaving the facility. Some “managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building”, the police said.</p><p>Described by friends and family as gentle, determined and a devout Muslim, Khalid told Al Jazeera last week that his strike “reflects the severity of my demands”.</p><p>Khalid’s trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he would have spent a year and a half in prison – far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

NABU does not report anything to the public because it says it needs time to work on charges against top-level people allegedly involved in the corruption scheme.</p><p>From the investigation’s perspective, this is the correct method because they don’t want to be accused of politicising this. They want to get this evidence, and this is not a very easy process.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Have you seen any concrete legal or institutional developments?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> Unfortunately not a lot.</p><p>There were primary charges made against the people allegedly involved in the scheme.</p><p>We know that Mindich, for instance, was charged in absentia because he’s not in the country. [Timur Mindich is the suspected mastermind of the Energoatom scheme.]</p><p>Most of the hearings were public, … so everything we know about this theme comes from these court hearings. Nothing else has happened.</p><p>So we anticipate in a few weeks there will be a renewal of this court hearing.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Who, if anyone, is now facing real legal jeopardy rather than just political consequences?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> We think the former minister of justice, German Galushchenko, could still be charged as he appears on recordings and there are indications he is part of this.</p><p>We expect he will be charged in the next few months or that the courts will find nothing against him.</p><p>We understand that it usually takes time to obtain all the testimonies and bank records.</p><p>For instance, just to compare, Rostyslav Shurma, former deputy chief of staff in the Presidential Office, was charged with involvement in a corruption scheme in the energy sector.</p><p>This process began in 2022, and we knew he had been dismissed from his position because of rumours of his involvement in 2024. Only now has he been charged because investigators gathered enough evidence. So we understand it takes a long time to get formal charges against people of such power.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: So this could take years?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> At least months.</p><p>On the other hand, there is significant pressure on the NABU to complete its work more quickly due to public interest.</p><p>There is this investigative logic, of course, because it wants to gather as much as possible, yeah, but there is a lot of pressure not just from politicians but from the general public.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: How independent are the NABU and SAPO in practice today?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> They really show they don’t have any party allegiance and are independent. I think, at least at the moment, that is for sure.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Has President Zelenskyy demonstrated political will beyond personnel changes?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> I think he wanted to show that he’s doing everything he can from his side.</p><p>He has also tried to distance himself from the scandal, saying he is independent and not involved.</p><p>He wants to show that he lets the agencies do their work.</p><p>This is his message. Otherwise, he’s busy with everything related to [US President Donald] Trump, the war and negotiations.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Does the removal of senior figures risk that it becomes a politically closed chapter even if the cases remain unresolved?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> I think the bigger question is for Ukrainians. OK, we just stopped one scheme involving an energy company, but if you change the people [from those implicated in the corruption scandal], and new people come, will those schemes just return?</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What message do you feel that the current situation sends to Western partners and donors?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> First of all, despite the war, corruption-related schemes remain in Ukraine. Unfortunately, even in the event of a war, the country can’t stop bad actors from benefitting from it.</p><p>But it also shows that systematic changes are happening in Ukraine at the same time, that change is possible. There are people and groups who are acting in good faith and capable of prosecuting and preventing corruption.</p><p>There is a huge push from people across Ukraine that actually generates the political will to do something and create change.</p><p>Criminal justice is a slow process.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: The energy sector is being targeted by Russia and people are suffering from a lack of heating. Does the corruption scandal, therefore, anger Ukrainians further?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> We are mad at Russia because we don’t have heating or electricity right now, but people are also asking questions about what the people in charge of our energy sector were busy with. It looks like they are not doing what they were mandated to do.</p><p>They didn’t act or consider the public benefit because they were busy stealing money.</p><p>So it’s beyond the term of political responsibility, which would mean firing someone from their position of power. Now people demand justice.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Where does the money seized in these anticorruption cases eventually end up?</strong></p><p><strong>Shevchuka:</strong> It goes to the state budget, but it also goes directly to the military.</p><p>In recent years, the state developed a scheme that collected money through plea bargaining, where the convict pays a certain amount to the state budget, showing goodwill by paying Ukrainian charity funds working directly with the military.</p><p>In recent years, a few hundred million dollars have been sent to the Ukrainian armed forces this way.</p><p><em><strong>Note: This interview was edited for clarity and brevity. </strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Over the past year, United States President Donald Trump has pursued “peace-making” all across the world. A prominent feature of his efforts has been the belief that economic threats or rewards can resolve conflicts. Most recently, his administration has put forward economic development plans as part of peace mediation for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Syria.</p><p>While some may see Trump’s “business” approach to “peace-making” as unique, it is not. The flawed conviction that economic development can resolve conflicts has been a regular feature of Western neoliberal peace initiatives in the Global South for the past few decades.</p><p>Occupied Palestine is a good example.</p><p>In the early 1990s, when the “peace process” was initiated, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres started advocating for “economic peace” as part of it. He sold his vision of the “New Middle East” as a new regional order that would guarantee security and economic development for all.</p><p>The project aimed to place Israel at the economic centre of the Arab world through regional infrastructure — transport, energy and industrial zones. Peres’s solution for the “Israeli-Palestinian conflict” was Palestinian economic integration. The Palestinians were promised jobs, investment, and improved living standards.</p><p>His argument was that economic development and cooperation would foster stability and mutual interest between Israelis and Palestinians. But that did not happen. Instead, as the occupation continued to entrench itself after the US-brokered Oslo Accords and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA), anger in the Palestinian streets grew and eventually led to the outbreak of the second Intifada.</p><p>This neoliberal approach was tested again by the Quartet – consisting of the United Nations, the European Union, the US and Russia – and its envoy Tony Blair in 2007. By then, the Palestinian economy had collapsed, losing 40 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in eight years and plunging 65 percent of the population into poverty.</p><p>Blair’s “solution” was to propose 10 “quick impact” economic projects and fundraise for them in the West. This went hand-in-hand with the policies of then-Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, in what came to be known as “Fayyadism”.</p><p>Fayyadism was sold to Palestinians as a pathway to statehood through institution-building and economic growth. Fayyad focused on generating short-term economic gains in the occupied West Bank while simultaneously rebuilding the Palestinian security apparatus to meet Israeli security demands.</p><p>This model of economic peace never addressed the root cause of Palestinian economic stagnation: the Israeli occupation. Even the World Bank warned that investment without a political settlement ending Israeli control would fail in the medium and long term. Yet the approach persisted.</p><p>There were Palestinians who benefitted from it, but they were not common Palestinians. They were a narrow elite: security officials who gained privileged access to financial institutions, contractors tied to Israeli markets, and a handful of large investors. For the wider population, living standards remained precarious.</p><p>Rather than preparing Palestinians for statehood, Fayyadism replaced liberation with management, sovereignty with security coordination, and collective rights with individual consumption.</p><p>This economic approach to conflict resolution merely gave Israel time to entrench its colonial enterprise by expanding its settlements on Palestinian land.</p><p>The latest economic plan for Gaza, presented by Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, is unlikely to bring economic prosperity to the Palestinians either. The project reflects two deeply contradictory dynamics: it foregrounds opportunities for investment and profit for global and regional oligarchies while systematically ignoring the fundamental national and human rights of the Palestinian people.</p><p>Security is framed exclusively around the needs of the occupying power, while Palestinians are compartmentalised, securitised, and surveilled — reduced to a depoliticised labour force stripped of social and national identity.</p><p>This approach views people as individuals rather than as nations or historically established communities. Under this logic, individuals are expected to acquiesce to oppression and dispossession once they obtain jobs and improve their living standards.</p><p>These strategies are failing to build peace not just in Palestine.</p><p>In the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the US has proposed expanding the demilitarised zone and converting it into a joint economic zone, featuring a ski resort. The US approach seems designed not only to pressure Syria to relinquish its sovereign rights over the territory, but also to recast it as a security project in ways that primarily benefit Israel. Under this framework, the US would act as the security guarantor. Its close alliance with Israel, however, puts its impartiality and true intentions in doubt.</p><p>In Ukraine, the US has proposed a free economic zone in parts of the Donbas region, from which the Ukrainian army would have to withdraw. This would allow Moscow to expand its influence without direct military confrontation, creating a buffer zone favourable to Russian security interests.</p><p>The Donbas has historically been one of Ukraine’s industrial bases, and transforming it into a free economic zone would deprive Ukraine of a critical economic resource. There are also no guarantees that the Russian army would not simply advance after the Ukrainian withdrawal and take the whole region.</p><p>These neoliberal “solutions” to the conflicts in Gaza, the Donbas and the Golan Heights are doomed to fail just like the economically-driven peace initiatives of the 1990s and 2000s in occupied Palestine.</p><p>The main problem is that the US cannot really provide credible guarantees that the areas would remain stable, so investors can secure returns on their investments. That is because no solid political settlement would be in place, given the fact that these proposals ignore the political, cultural and most importantly, national interests of the people living in these regions. As a result, no serious or independent investor would commit capital to such an arrangement.</p><p>Nations are not made up of consumers or labourers; they are made up of people with a common identity and national aspirations.</p><p>Economic incentives should follow, not precede, a political resolution that secures the self-determination of indigenous peoples. Any conflict-resolution framework that ignores collective rights and international law is therefore bound to fail. Political settlements must prioritise these rights, a requirement that stands in direct opposition to the logic of neoliberalism.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
