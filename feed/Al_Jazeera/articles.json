It added that the show “decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options”.</p><p>Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn’t want you to see”.</p><p>“I think Donald Trump is worried we’re about to flip Texas,” Talarico told Colbert during their interview. “This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”</p><p>Crockett, meanwhile, suggested that Colbert could have avoided an issue with the FCC by having her on the show, as he has in the past. Both she and Talarico have also appeared on The View.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Paramount Skydance, Carr or the White House.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"another-troubling-example\">‘Another troubling example’</h2><p>Until January, talk shows were deemed to have qualified for the equal opportunities exemption as genuine news interviews, ever since the FCC Media Bureau granted an exemption to the interview portion of Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show in 2006.</p><p>Networks have relied on the ruling as a precedent for recent interviews with political candidates.</p><p>FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, criticised CBS’s decision not to air the interview, calling it censorship.</p><p>She said the FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes, and that CBS has free speech rights to air the interview.</p><p>“This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech,” Gomez said. “It is no secret that Paramount, CBS’s parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.”</p><p>Paramount Skydance is <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/17/warner-bros-rejects-latest-paramount-bid-but-open-to-best-and-final-offer\">seeking to buy</a> Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the White House last year, CBS has been accused of seeking to appease the president by <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointing Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no television experience, to lead the storied broadcast network, as well as naming a former Trump appointee to oversee and address allegations of bias.</p><p>It also settled a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with his rival in the 2024 presidential race, Kamala Harris, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to benefit the Democratic Party before the election.</p><p>The FCC’s Carr, meanwhile, has faced bipartisan criticism after he pressured broadcasters to take ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel off the air in September, warning they could face fines or loss of licences.</p><p>Two major broadcasters said they would pull Kimmel off the air, and Disney briefly suspended Kimmel before restoring the show.</p><p>In December, Democratic US Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin told Carr, “You used your position within the federal government to take Jimmy Kimmel off the air in a clear attempt to chill free speech.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Zogby would later found the AAI.</p><p>Jackson’s campaign also actively courted Arab Americans and amplified calls for Palestinian self-determination in an era when unquestioning support for Israel was the default position in US politics.</p><p>Berry said Jackson always rejected pressure to disassociate from Arab Americans who view Palestine as a focal issue.</p><p>“He understood that the fight for justice was one that had to be done when it was both hard and easy. Our country has lost a giant,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-party-platform\">The party platform</h2><p>Jackson launched a second campaign for president in 1988, winning 13 states, including Michigan and much of the South, in the Democratic primary.</p><p>He ultimately lost the nomination to then-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Still, Jackson’s campaign catapulted Palestinian rights into the national discourse.</p><p>Zogby and other Jackson delegates at the Democratic National Convention rallied to include support for Palestinian statehood in the party’s platform that year.</p><p>While the push eventually fell short at the national level, 11 state parties adopted platforms expressing support for “the rights of the Palestinian people to safety, self-determination and an independent state”.</p><p>Jackson’s relative success in the primary also led to the appointment of an Arab-American activist, Texan Ruth Ann Skaff, to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the party’s executive board.</p><p>At the time, Skaff faced unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism for her pro-Palestinian stance, not to mention calls to be removed from the committee.</p><p>But in an interview with Al Jazeera, she said she was just a local organiser from Houston, Texas, not a high-level political operative.</p><p>She explained that Jackson’s embrace of the Arab-American community rang <span>“true to his message of wanting to empower those who do not have power or who are excluded”.</span></p><p>She also recalled him being humorous and approachable.</p><p>“We were learning how to organise, how to spread the message and then take it to the next step of being active politically at the very local level. And he guided us and inspired us the entire way,” Skaff said.</p><p>Born in South Carolina in 1941, under the racial segregation of the <a href=\"/features/2015/8/15/know-your-history-understanding-racism-in-the-us\">Jim Crow laws</a>, Jackson was dedicated to civil rights from a young age.</p><p>He was considered a talented public speaker, and as a pre-teen, he became a protege of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>A central part of his national platform was to stress the need for a broad coalition of communities to come together and demand equal rights.</p><p>Jackson moved to Chicago in 1965, where he founded the civil rights and community empowerment movement that became known as the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</p><p>Even after his presidential run, Jackson remained close with the Arab community.</p><p>Hatem Abudayyeh, the executive director of the Arab American Action Network (AAAN) in Illinois, praised Jackson as “a tried-and-true Chicagoan, one of us, who opened the doors to Rainbow/PUSH for Palestinians and Arabs in Chicagoland”.</p><p>“Under his leadership, Black, Latino, Asian, Arab and so many other communities worked together for racial, economic, and social justice,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“He never shied away from solid and principled solidarity with our Palestinian and Arab communities,” he added. “We mourn today with our friends in the Black community, and with all those who will carry on his fight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"support-for-gaza-protesters\">Support for Gaza protesters</h2><p>Nabih Ayad, the founder of the Arab American Civil Rights League (ACRL), said Jackson was one of the first leaders to shine light on the plight of Palestinians at the national stage.</p><p>He also worked on other issues related to the Arab community. In 2015, for instance, Jackson lobbied for the admission and resettlement of Syrian refugees, despite opposition from Republican governors.</p><p>The ACRL, based in the Michigan suburb of Dearborn, hosted Jackson on a panel to highlight the refugees’ plight. Ayad said Jackson’s message was that “justice is universal”.</p><p>“It was an honour to cross his path and be able to see a giant like Jesse Jackson really caring about the little people, the small guys, about injustice wherever it happens, no matter where it is around the world,” Ayad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This drive to address injustice drove Jackson to speak up for Palestinians even when it may have cost him politically, according to Ayad.</p><p>Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition organised an emergency summit in 2024 to call for a ceasefire during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Later that year, he voiced support for pro-Palestine protests on college campuses, writing in the University of Chicago’s newspaper, The Chicago Maroon, that the student leaders “represent the best of our nation”.</p><p>Matthew Jaber Stiffler, the director of the Center for Arab Narratives, a research institution, said Jackson helped the Arab community feel “seen”. He, too, highlighted the political costs of championing Palestinian rights.</p><p>“Even just saying, ‘I support the rights for Palestinians to exist in the national political sphere,’ could get you branded as a radical, could get you pushed to the margins,” Stiffler told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Mainstream candidates didn’t – and still don’t – really want that plank in their platform. And I think that’s why there was such love for Jesse Jackson and what he stood for, because he was not afraid.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"work-that-has-to-be-done\">‘Work that has to be done’</h2><p>In the decades since Jackson’s presidential campaigns, Palestine has become less of a taboo subject in US politics. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/rashida-tlaib-introduces-us-congress-resolution-to-recognise-gaza-genocide\">Congress members</a>, mayors and celebrities have become vocal in criticising Israeli abuses.</p><p>Still, the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties have avoided publicly supporting Palestinian rights. During the 2024 presidential race, for instance, both major parties adopted staunchly pro-Israel platforms.</p><p>The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris even refused to allow a Palestinian speaker at the party’s <a href=\"/news/2024/8/22/they-want-to-erase-us-how-dnc-rejected-demand-for-palestinian-speaker\">convention that year</a>.</p><p>The flow of US money and weapons to Israel has also continued uninterrupted, despite the <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/4/30/we-didnt-expect-to-find-bones-inside-one-gaza-familys-nightmare\">horrific atrocities</a> in Gaza.</p><p>Furthermore, since taking office in January 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump has led a <span>crackdown on Palestinian rights advocates, threatening foreign-born activists with deportation and other penalties.</span></p><p>Berry said that while the current conditions are challenging, Jackson taught the community to overcome barriers and build its power.</p><p>“I think that the lessons and the legacy of someone like Reverend Jackson teaches us that this is work that has to be done,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For her part, Skaff said Jackson wanted Arab Americans to stand up and let their message be known.</p><p>“We’re stronger when we’re united and when we exercise our rights and responsibilities as American citizens: to stand up, to speak out, to run for office, to vote, vote, vote, vote,” she told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he was also a visible member of the campus’s activist community, founding a Palestinian student society alongside fellow student Mahmoud Khalil.</p><p>Columbia became a hub for pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, and Trump campaigned for re-election, in part, on cracking down on the demonstrations.</p><p>Khalil became the first student protester to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March of last year, less than three months into Trump’s second term.</p><p>Then, on April 14, Mahdawi was arrested at a meeting set up by the government, allegedly to process his citizenship application.</p><p>ICE detained him in “direct retaliation for his advocacy of Palestinian rights”, the ACLU said in a statement at the time.</p><p>The Trump administration attempted to transfer Mahdawi out of state to Louisiana, but a court order ultimately blocked it from doing so.</p><p>Mahdawi was ultimately released on April 30, after US Judge Geoffrey Crawford accused the Trump administration of doing “great harm” to someone who had committed no crime.</p><p>Human rights advocates have described the Trump administration’s attempts to deport foreign-born student activists as a campaign to chill free speech.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>After his release last year, <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/columbia-protest-leader-mohsen-mahdawi-released-from-us-custody\">Mahdawi walked out of the court</a> with both hands in the air, flashing peace signs as supporters greeted him with cheers.</p><p>As he spoke, he shared a message for Trump. “I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said to Trump.</p><p>He also addressed the people of Palestine and sought to dispel perceptions that the student protest movement was anything but peaceful.</p><p>“We are pro-peace and antiwar,” Mahdawi explained. “To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering, and I see freedom, and it is very soon.”</p><p>Mahdawi’s arrest comes as part of a wider push by the Trump administration to target visa holders and permanent residents for their pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>Trump has also pressured top universities to crack down on pro-Palestine protests in the name of combating anti-Semitism. In some cases, the Trump administration has opened investigations into campuses where pro-Palestinian protests were prominent, accusing them of civil rights violations.</p><p>Last July, Columbia University entered into a $200m settlement with the Trump administration, with a further $21m given to end a probe into allegations of religious-based harassment.</p><p>The university, however, did not admit to wrongdoing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many people have been fighting against racism in football; Vinicius is one of them. I’m proud of him and his great game.”</p><p>The Associated Press news agency reported that television cameras picked up Vinicius Junior telling the referee that Prestianni had called him a “monkey”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Benfica began the game on the front foot, but the visitors gradually assumed control while the hosts appeared content to counterattack, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois producing a stunning one-handed save to keep out a 25th-minute strike from Fredrik Aursnes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Real finished the first half strongly, and only goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin’s brilliance kept ⁠the score goalless at the break as he produced stunning saves to deny Kylian ⁠Mbappe and Arda Guler.</p><p class=\"p1\">The breakthrough came five minutes after the restart. Mbappe burst forward and fed Vinicius on the left. The Brazilian cut diagonally towards the box, shifted inside and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot into the far top corner.</p><p class=\"p1\">Vinicius celebrated by dancing with the corner flag and ⁠was booked by Letexier for excessive celebration.</p><p class=\"p1\">As the forward argued with the referee, he became involved in a heated exchange with Prestianni, with Vinicius and several teammates suddenly running towards ⁠the referee.</p><p class=\"p1\">Letexier crossed his arms in front of his face to activate ⁠FIFA’s protocol and stopped the match. Real’s players threatened to leave the pitch as tensions flared, before play eventually resumed 11 minutes later.</p><p class=\"p1\">The atmosphere turned hostile, with Vinicius loudly booed whenever he touched the ball, and the broadcast camera appeared to show an outraged Mbappe calling Prestianni “a bloody racist” to ‌his face several times after the game resumed.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tempers flared again in the 85th minute, when Vinicius fouled Richard Rios. Benfica manager Jose Mourinho stormed towards the fourth official, demanding a second booking for the Brazilian, but was himself cautioned ‌for ‌his protests.</p><p class=\"p1\">An incensed Mourinho continued remonstrating, and was promptly shown a second yellow card.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320967\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320967\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320967\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_6994e1b47f-1771364788.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"LISBON, PORTUGAL - FEBRUARY 17: Jose Mourinho, Head Coach of Benfica, is shown a red card by referee Francois Letexier during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Knockout Play-off First Leg match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid C.F. at Estadio do SL Benfica on February 17, 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal.

He also shared multiple photos of himself and Jackson together at social events.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">“He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.’ He was very gregarious – Someone who truly loved people!” the president said.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">In the <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086206069142759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">post</a>, Trump also used his acquaintance with Jackson to defend himself against allegations of racism, after he shared a video depicting Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, as an ape earlier this month.</p><h3 id=\"barack-obama\">Barack Obama</h3><p>Obama released a statement explaining that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant”.</p><p>He said that he and his wife, Michelle, were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons’ kitchen table when she was a teenager.</p><p>“And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"joe-biden-former-us-president\">Joe Biden, former US president</h3><p>Biden remembered the civil rights activist as “determined and tenacious”.</p><p>“I’ve seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He’s done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just,” he shared on a post in X.</p><p>“Whether through impassioned words on the campaign trail, or moments of quiet courage, Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"kamala-harris-former-us-vice-president\">Kamala Harris, former US vice president</h3><p>Harris, who ran as the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential election, shared her own tribute on social media.</p><p>“His presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 electrified millions of Americans and showed them what could be possible,” she wrote.</p><p>“From Washington, DC to the Bay Area, from the Mississippi Delta to Appalachia, from South Africa to the South Side of Chicago, Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bill-and-hillary-clinton-former-us-president-and-former-secretary-of-state\">Bill and Hillary Clinton, former US president and former secretary of state</h3><p>In a social media statement, the Clintons said they became friends with Jackson after meeting him in 1977, during events marking the 20th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High School.</p><p>That effort was seen as a pivotal moment in the US civil rights movement.</p><p>Nine Black students, later known as the Little Rock Nine, had enrolled at the previously all-white high school during the country’s desegregation, but their arrival at the school faced such heated opposition that then-President Dwight Eisenhower deployed the Arkansas National Guard.</p><p>The Clintons said that after meeting Jackson at the anniversary event, they continued to maintain a relationship with him for nearly 50 years.</p><p>They remembered him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives”.</p><p></p><h3>Cyril Ramaphosa, South African president</h3><p>Ramaphosa expressed his condolences and described Jackson as a “global moral authority” who stood firm in the fight for justice and equality.</p><p>“Rev Jesse Jackson’s irrepressible campaigns against apartheid and his support for the liberation struggle was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” Ramaphosa wrote.</p><p>“He has fought a good fight and run the race which his Baptist ministry inspired him to run. He made the world a better place but he has also influenced us to maintain his good fight in places where injustice and inequality persist.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"david-lammy-uk-deputy-prime-minister\">David Lammy, UK deputy prime minister</h3><p>Lammy, a Labour Party politician, currently serves as deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, and the secretary of state for justice in the United Kingdom.</p><p>He is the first Black man to hold these roles, and in Tuesday’s remembrances, he cited Jackson as a source of support.</p><p>Lammy began his post with a reference to the wave of protests and violence that erupted in 2011 after the death of a mixed-race man in north London. Lammy was a member of parliament at the time, representing the Tottenham area, where the killing took place.</p><p>“Jesse Jackson was one of the first people to call after the riots of 2011,” Lammy wrote. “It was a privilege to share such precious time with him in Chicago and London over the years.”</p><p>“May his legacy live on.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"reverend-al-sharpton-us-civil-rights-and-social-justice-activist\">Reverend Al Sharpton, US civil rights and social justice activist</h3><p>Sharpton also paid tribute to Jackson on X. Their history together stretches back to the 1960s, when a 12-year-old Sharpton would meet Jackson for the first time.</p><p>He would later serve as a youth coordinator for Jackson’s Operation Breadbasket, and the two would continue to collaborate over the course of their careers as civil rights leaders.</p><p>“The Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson was not simply a civil rights leader; he was a movement unto himself. He carried history in his footsteps and hope in his voice. One of the greatest honors of my life was learning at his side,” Sharpton wrote.</p><p>“He reminded me that faith without action is just noise. He taught me that protest must have purpose, that faith must have feet, and that justice is not seasonal, it is daily work.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"diane-abbott-the-first-black-woman-to-be-a-british-member-of-parliament\">Diane Abbott, the first Black woman to be a UK member of parliament</h3><p>On social media, Abbott praised Jackson for the support he gave when she was first elected to the UK’s Parliament.</p><p>“He was very smart, warm and hugely charismatic. A direct connection to the great era of civil rights,” Abbott wrote on X.</p><p>Separately, in an interview with The Guardian, Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said that Jackson’s legacy was his uncompromising commitment to addressing racism.</p><p>She contrasted his fearless approach to the UK’s current leadership.</p><p>“Labour party and Keir Starmer don’t talk about racial equality at all,” she said.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"hakeem-jeffries-top-democrat-and-house-minority-leader\">Hakeem Jeffries, top Democrat and House Minority Leader</h3><p>Jeffries, the House of Representatives minority leader for the Democratic Party, called Jackson “a legendary voice for the voiceless, powerful civil rights champion and trailblazer extraordinaire”.</p><p>“For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,” he said.</p><h3>JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois</h3><p>Pritzker, a Democrat, called Jackson a “giant of the civil rights movement”.</p><p>Illinois, Pritzker’s state, had served as a base of operations for Jackson for decades, and it is where the civil rights leader died on Tuesday. Pritzker acknowledged his contribution to Illinois – and the US as a whole – in a social media post.</p><p>“He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive,” Pritzker wrote. “Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service.”</p><p>He ordered flags to fly half-staff across Illinois in honour of Jackson.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bernice-king-the-daughter-of-martin-luther-king-jr\">Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr</h3><p>King posted a photo of Jackson with her late father, Martin Luther King Jr. The two men were both icons of the US civil rights movement.</p><p>“Both now ancestors,” she wrote on social media.</p><p>Martin Luther King Jr and Jackson worked together as part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and it was with King’s backing that Jackson went on to lead programmes like Operation Breadbasket.</p><p>Jackson was also present at Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination in 1968.</p><p>In a separate post, Bernice paid tribute to those deep family ties: “My family shares a long and meaningful history with him, rooted in a shared commitment to justice and love. As we grieve, we give thanks for a life that pushed hope into weary places.”</p><p></p><h3>Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple</h3><p>Cook shared a post on X paying tribute to Jackson and recalling one of his quotes:</p><p>“Never look down on anybody unless you’re helping them up.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

These include: <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointing Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no television experience, to lead the storied broadcast network; appointing a former Trump appointee to oversee and address allegations of bias, and settling a lawsuit with Trump amid allegations that the network’s news magazine programme, 60 Minutes, doctored an interview with then-Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris.</p><p>On Monday, CBS late-night show host Stephen Colbert claimed that the network also barred him from airing an interview with Texas Democratic State Representative James Talarico, who is currently running for the Democratic nomination to represent the state in the US Senate.</p><p>“Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said on Monday’s broadcast of The Late Show.</p><p>The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission said last month that daytime and late-night television talk shows are no longer considered “bona fide” news programmes, exempt from equal time rules that require them to give airtime to the views of opposing candidates.</p><p>A merger between Warner Bros and Paramount “would also put CNN and CBS under the same parent company, along with dozens of additional TV stations, and that consolidation creates serious concerns about the types of content we will see in a more traditional TV format going forward,” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, an economic think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount’s revised offer, which included a personal guarantee on $40bn in equity from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, father to Paramount’s CEO, was turned down in early January. Larry Ellison has been a long-time supporter of Trump.</p><p>Congressional leaders have raised concerns about both deals.</p><p>“With either merger, another corporation will have that increased control over what we see, what we hear and what news we consume,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in a US Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing earlier this month.</p><p>“I will not be surprised if this gets thwarted,” Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also chairs the committee, told the outlet Semafor in December.</p><p>The Writers Guild raised concerns about the <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix deal in December</a>, when the potential merger was originally announced.</p><p>“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the guild said in a statement. “This merger must be blocked.”</p><p>“I think what I am seeing lost in the excitement around this bidding war and who is going to emerge victorious is that all of the parties seem to be vastly underestimating the regulatory risk,” Hepner said.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance stock is surging in midday trading. It is up 7.4 percent since the market opened. Netflix is also up slightly by 0.4 percent and Warner Bros Discovery is up 3.4 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it seems like they are disregarding all the realities and laws and trying to push through their anti-immigrant agenda by force,” he said.</p><p>Several Yemeni community leaders, particularly in Michigan, were outspoken supporters of Trump in the 2024 election.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week revoked TPS for Yemen, which shielded eligible Yemenis in the US from deportation due to the dangerous conditions in their homeland.</p><p>Trump had listed Yemen in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">a travel ban</a> he imposed last year and tightened immigration restrictions on the country.</p><p>But rescinding TPS was especially jarring for many in the community because beneficiaries of the status are already in the US, and it may not be safe for them to return to Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to DHS, a country may be designated for TPS due to conditions “that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely”.</p><p>Such conditions include political unrest, war, humanitarian crises and natural disasters. The status is granted for people who are not permanent US residents, such as tourists and visitors.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-in-yemen\">Conditions in Yemen</h2><p>Yemen was first designated for TPS in 2015 when the country’s civil war intensified, and the status had been repeatedly renewed.</p><p>“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest. TPS was designed to be temporary, and this administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. We are prioritising our national security interests and putting America first.”</p><p>As of September 2024 – the last time Yemen was redesignated for TPS – there were 2,300 Yemeni beneficiaries.</p><p>Noem’s announcement did not provide details on how allowing Yemenis, many of whom work and pay taxes, to retain their status counters US interests or how the conditions in Yemen were assessed.</p><p>A fragile ceasefire has been in place between Yemen’s Houthis and its internationally recognised government since 2022. But violence has continued to break out across the country.</p><p>Last year, Israel and the US <a href=\"/news/2025/4/28/at-least-8-killed-in-latest-us-air-attacks-on-yemens-capital-saana\">bombed Yemen repeatedly</a> as part of a campaign against the Houthis.</p><p>Clashes also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/five-killed-in-yemen-as-crowd-linked-with-stc-in-south-storm-govt-building\">continue to erupt</a> in the south of the country between the government and separatist forces.</p><p>According to United Nations data from last year, more than 4.5 million people are internally displaced in Yemen, and more than half of the population, 18.2 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><a href=\"/news/2024/9/23/mayor-of-only-muslim-governed-us-city-endorses-trump\">Amer Ghalib</a> – the former mayor of Hamtramck, a Muslim-majority city near Detroit, who campaigned for Trump in 2024 and was later nominated by the US president to serve as ambassador to Kuwait – called the TPS decision “very unfortunate”.</p><p>“I have spoken to multiple highly ranked White House officials and explained the situation to them, but it doesn’t seem that they took anything into consideration,” Ghalib told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“We hope the administration will reevaluate the situation in Yemen and consider the risk those individuals are facing if they are to be sent back at this time. They are just a few thousand compared to hundreds of thousands from some other countries.”</p><p>DHS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><h2 id=\"eople-are-very-devastated\">‘People are very devastated’</h2><p>Ghalib had helped lead the major shift in the Arab community towards Trump, which boosted the Republican leader’s popularity to win Michigan in 2024.</p><p>In the predominantly Yemeni American neighbourhood of the Southend <a href=\"/news/2024/11/1/as-trump-harris-woo-arab-americans-michigan-mayor-readies-to-up-pressure\">in Dearborn</a>, Michigan, Trump grew his share of the votes from less than 11 percent in 2020 to about 55 percent in 2024.</p><p>“People feel betrayed. They feel backstabbed,” Wali Altahif, a Yemeni American activist in Dearborn, said, adding that the decision to revoke TPS for Yemen will likely separate families in the community.</p><p>“There was hope that he was going to bring a different direction, different policy towards Yemen and the Yemeni community, but we’ve seen the opposite – absolutely the opposite.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Altahif expressed concern that, beyond the threat of war, TPS holders may experience harassment and persecution in Yemen due to regional divisions or perceived connection to the US.</p><p>He stressed the policy to revoke TPS for Yemen is unjustifiable. “It’s discriminatory. It’s racist. It’s un-American.”</p><p>The Trump administration has been rolling back TPS protections, including for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/trump-administration-nixes-temporary-immigration-protections-for-haitians\">Haiti</a>, which has been suffering from widespread gang violence.</p><p>However, some of Noem’s moves to nix immigration protections have been successfully challenged by the courts. And Yemeni community advocates said they are exploring legal avenues to reinstate TPS for Yemen.</p><p>Reyadh Nagi, an immigration lawyer <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/palestine-advocates-praise-nycs-mamdani-for-revoking-pro-israel-decrees\">in New York</a>, said a lawsuit would examine how DHS assessed conditions in the country and whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision to revoke TPS for Yemen.</p><p>He noted that the Department of State still has Yemen under a “do not travel” advisory “due to risk of terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping and landmines”.</p><p>Nagi told Al Jazeera that while the number of affected TPS holders may appear small, the effects of the Trump administration’s decision extend to their families, employers and broader community.</p><p>“A lot of people are very devastated,” he said. “I’m hearing from the TPS holders themselves. They’re very scared. They’re very concerned. They don’t know what lies ahead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

JFB builds commercial and residential properties, including multifamily communities and shopping centres.</p><p>Xtend touts its drones as “low cost per kill”, which has appealed to the US Department of Defense. In November, the firm said it had solidified a multimillion-dollar contract with the Pentagon but did not disclose the contract’s value.</p><p>This month, Xtend was among 25 companies selected to participate in the Defense Department’s Drone Dominance Program, an acquisition reform effort designed to rapidly field low-cost, attack drones at scale.</p><p>Xtend also secured contracts with the Pentagon before Trump’s second term, including an $8.8m deal in December 2024.</p><p>“I am incredibly proud to invest in companies I believe in. Drones are clearly the wave of the future. Xtend has unbelievable potential,” Eric Trump said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“By pairing XTEND’s operating system and advanced AI capabilities with JFB’s execution, infrastructure and buildout expertise, we see a clear opportunity to accelerate US manufacturing, scale production responsibly, and support a next-generation defense technology platform built in America and ready for the public markets,” Joseph F Basile III, chief executive officer of JFB, said in the news release.</p><p>JFB did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about the connection between its existing portfolio, which includes primarily commercial properties like a Courtyard by Marriott Hotel in Florida and an escape room in Indiana, and a defence contractor.</p><p>“By combining our platform with JFB, we are acquiring the resources we need to scale our manufacturing capabilities in the US and gaining access to the US public markets,” Xtend CEO Aviv Shapira said in the news release.</p><p>Xtend did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">Renewed conflict-of-interest concerns</h2><p>The deal is the latest in a series of conflict-of-interest concerns surrounding the Trump family’s personal investments and whether its members are using the Trump presidency to advance their own financial interests, according to ethics experts.</p><p>“The first thing that comes to mind is another example of the president’s family appearing to profit from the presidency,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.</p><p>“In the past, a president would avoid even the appearance that the family was benefitting from the office, and if that couldn’t be completely avoided, the president would make statements to reassure the public that there was no special treatment provided to the family that could lead to this benefit. Now, you don’t see anything like that.” Payne told Al Jazeera.</p><p>JFB Construction also appointed Stefan Passantino, a former White House attorney, to its board of directors amid the merger.</p><p>The investment comes even as the Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president’s name on airports but said it doesn’t plan on charging a fee at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he’s ever seen.</p><p>“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”</p><p>During former President Joe Biden’s term, Republicans rallied against his son Hunter Biden for using his connections with the White House to advance his personal business interests.</p><p>“When he [Hunter Biden] got a board position with a company overseas, there were concerns that he was using his name to secure a high-profile job. There were no ties to government contracts, but even the appearance that he had a position based on his name was controversial,” Payne said.</p><p>The Oversight Committee in the US House of Representatives alleged that the Bidens “participated or benefited from the business schemes” in a committee hearing in March 2024 about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</p><p>“We have learned that Joe Biden has taken action after action to further his family’s plans to get rich,” James Comer, the committee’s then-chairman, said at the time.</p><p>Comer did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about whether he shared the same concerns about the Trump family.</p><p>“We’re talking about something far more extreme: a child receiving benefits from government contracts, at least indirectly through a company he owns, including lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. That’s something we haven’t seen since Halliburton and Vice President [Dick] Cheney,” Payne said.</p><p>The White House and Trump Organization representatives did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under Boluarte’s administration, he received a concession to build a hydroelectric plant, which has experienced delays and faced questions about its transparency.</p><p>The meetings between Yang and Jeri also reportedly included a third Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was placed under house arrest for engaging in illegal activities.</p><p>At Tuesday’s congressional debate, Jeri also faced questions about late-night meetings he took with women who later received government contracts and other irregular interactions he had. Jeri has also faced accusations of sexual assault, stretching back to December 2024.</p><p>He faced a total of seven motions of censure against his presidency. Ultimately, 75 members of Peru’s Congress backed the measure to remove Jeri, while three abstained and a further 24 voted against the proposal.</p><p>A new interim president is set to be voted upon during Wednesday evening, around 6pm local time (23:00 GMT).</p><p>Jeri’s removal marks a new chapter in the turmoil facing Peru’s government. The country is less than two months away from an April 12 general election, which will help decide its next president.</p><p>If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in that election, the race will proceed to a run-off in June.</p><p>Currently, the field is packed, with at least 36 candidates vying for the presidency. Election observers fear that whoever wins could face the same quick-fire impeachment proceedings that their predecessors have endured.</p><p>Presidents in Peru have often faced accusations of “moral incapacity”, a pathway to impeachment that critics have denounced as overly vague.</p><p>Jeri’s impeachment comes within months of several high-profile court decisions against former presidents.</p><p>In November, former President Martin Vizcarra, who served from 2018 to 2020, was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of accepting bribes for government contracts.</p><p>Then, in December, Castillo received a sentence of 11 years and five months for his conviction on charges of rebellion and conspiracy against the state.</p><p>Castillo, a left-wing leader, had been facing a third impeachment attempt in December 2022, when he attempted what many describe as a self-coup. Within hours, members of his cabinet had resigned, and Congress had impeached him.</p><p>Prosecutors in Peru have said they plan to continue investigations into Jeri on corruption charges.</p></div></div></body></html>"
