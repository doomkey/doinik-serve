The trial in Washington, DC, included testimony from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>This week’s sentencing came after a federal jury convicted Michel on 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, in April 2023.</p><p>Michel obtained more than $120m from fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho – also known as Jho Low – and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama’s campaign.</p><p>Low is wanted for his leading role in the <a href=\"/economy/2024/6/14/malaysia-handed-back-156m-in-stolen-1mdb-funds-us-embassy-says\">1MDB scandal</a>, in which billions of dollars were pilfered from Malaysia’s state investment fund in one of the largest financial frauds in history.</p><p>Several senior financial figures and members of Malaysia’s government have been convicted for their role in the scandal, including disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was handed a <a href=\"/news/2024/2/2/malaysia-reduces-sentence-of-former-pm-najib-razak\">12-year prison sentence</a> in 2022, which was later halved.</p><p>Court documents, filed by Justice Department prosecutors on Thursday, said the 52-year-old Grammy-winning rapper “lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes” as he syphoned illegal payments from Low to the Obama campaign.</p><p>It is illegal in the US for foreigners to donate to election campaigns, as well as to pay someone else to make a campaign contribution.</p><p>“Prakazrel Michel betrayed his country for money. He funnelled millions of dollars in prohibited foreign contributions into a United States presidential election and attempted to manipulate a sitting president to serve a foreign criminal and a foreign power,” prosecutors said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Prosecutors also said Michel had attempted to end a Justice Department investigation into Low and the 1MDB scandal, as well as “tampered with witnesses and then perjured himself at trial”.</p><p>Judge Kollar-Kotelly was advised by prosecutors that federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for such crimes, urging her to take into account the “breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed”.</p><p>Michel’s lawyers downplayed the extent of his crimes, saying Low’s motivation for donating money was not to “achieve some policy objective”.</p><p>“Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,” Michel’s lawyers wrote.</p><p>Low – who remains in hiding and claims innocence – courted America’s rich and famous during a years-long spending spree allegedly financed by funds stolen from 1MDB.</p><p>Notably, he was one of the primary financiers of the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, starring DiCaprio.</p><p>Defence lawyer Peter Zeidenberg said Michel will appeal.</p><p>He labelled his client’s 14-year sentence “completely disproportionate to the offence” and “absurdly high” given such terms are typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders.</p><p>Instead, Zeidenberg recommended a three-year prison sentence for Michel.</p><p>Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the US from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. The group won two Grammy Awards during their peak in the 1990s and sold tens of millions of albums.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Because the painting sold on Thursday comes from a private collection, it is legally eligible for international sale. Sotheby’s said the owner who put the painting up for auction – and whose identity has not been disclosed – “astutely” purchased the piece also at auction in New York in 1980.</p><p>The buyer’s identity was also not disclosed.</p><p></p><p>Some art historians had scrutinised the sale for cultural reasons, while others had raised concerns that the painting, which was last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s, could again disappear from public view after the auction.</p><p>It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.</p><p>The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.</p><p>Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was altered by a bus accident at 18.</p><p>She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, and then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view painting as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.</p><p>“I’m very proud that she’s one of the most valued women, because really, what woman doesn’t identify with Frida, or what person doesn’t?” her great-niece, Mara Romeo Kahlo, told The Associated Press news agency before the auction.</p><p>“I think everyone carries a little piece of my aunt in their heart.”</p><p>Kahlo resisted being labelled a surrealist painter, a style of art that is dreamlike and centres on a fascination with the unconscious mind.</p><p>“I never painted dreams,” she once said. “I painted my own reality.”</p><p>The new record for Kahlo’s painting came hours after a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/gustav-klimt-portrait-breaks-modern-art-record-with-236m-sale\">Gustav Klimt portrait sold</a> for $236.4m, setting a new record for a modern art piece.</p><p>Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold after a 20-minute bidding war, also at Sotheby’s in New York, on Tuesday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf of Mexico that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.</p><p>The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 320km (200 miles) offshore in the Arctic Ocean.</p><p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the sales that it would take years for the oil from those parcels to get to market.</p><p>“By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come,” Burgum said in a statement.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute said in response that the announced plan was a “historic step” towards unleashing vast offshore resources. Industry groups have pointed to California’s history as an oil-producing state and say it already has infrastructure to support more production.</p><h2 id=\"political-pushback\">Political pushback</h2><p>Leaders in both California and Florida have pushed back on the deal.</p><p>Last week, Florida Republican Senator Ashley Moody and Rick Scott co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state that Trump signed in his first term.</p><p>“As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state’s economy, environment and way of life,” Scott said in a statement. “I will always work to keep Florida’s shores pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.”</p><p>A spokesman for California Governor Gavin Newsom said Trump officials had not formally shared the plan, but said “expensive and riskier offshore drilling would put our communities at risk and undermine the economic stability of our coastal economies”.</p><p>California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped launch the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.</p><p>Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.</p><p>A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp as the kind of project Trump wants to increase US energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The announcement comes as Governor Newsom attended the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COP30 climate conference</a> in Brazil.</p><p>“He [Trump] intentionally aligned that to the opening of COP,” Newsom said.</p><p>Even before it was released, the offshore drilling plan met strong opposition from Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic.</p><p>Newsom pronounced the idea “dead on arrival” in a social media post. The proposal is also likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers, including California Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling would hurt coastal economies, jeopardise national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put the health and safety of millions of people at risk.</p><p>“With this draft plan, Donald Trump and his Administration are trying to destroy one of the most valuable, most protected coastlines in the world and hand it over to the fossil fuel industry,” Padilla and Huffman said in a joint statement.</p><p>The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.</p><p>Since taking office for a second time in January, Trump has systematically reversed former President Joe Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls US “energy dominance” in the global market.</p><p>Trump, who recently called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high US energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and cancelled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israeli officials have said that they plan to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/despite-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-the-war-isnt-over-for-netanyahu\">remain indefinitely</a> in a “buffer zone” in the border region.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Israeli forces are not currently stationed in what remains of Khairallah’s farm, but the grove is fully exposed to Israeli positions in Menora, on the other side of the border.

But the [Israeli] occupation army has destroyed everything.”</p><p>Khairallah now has 10 olive trees left, but their yield is small for several reasons, most notably the lack of rainfall and the fact that he and his brothers had to abandon the orchard when war broke out between Hezbollah and Israel on October 8, 2023. Khairallah’s aim now is to begin the process of restoring and replanting his olive grove, the main source of livelihood for the 55-year-old and his four brothers.</p><p>The farm in Hula, which lies in the district of Marjayoun, once provided them with not just olives, but olive oil, and various other fruits. They also kept 20 cows on the land, all of which have died due to the war.</p><p>But with the presence of the Israelis nearby, getting things back to a semblance of what they once were is not easy, and involves taking a lot of risks.</p><p>“Last year, we couldn’t come to the grove and didn’t harvest the olives,” Khairallah said. “[Now,] the Israeli army might send me a warning through a drone or fire a stun grenade to scare me off, and if I don’t withdraw, I could be directly shelled.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Olive-trees-cut-down-as-a-result-of-the-bulldozing-operations-carried-out-by-the-Israeli-army-in-Khairallah-Yaacoubs-orchard-in-the-town-of-Houla.-AL-Jazeera-1763290623.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cut down olive trees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Olive trees cut down as a result of the bulldozing operations carried out by the Israeli army in Khairallah Yaacoub’s orchard in the town of Hula [Mounir Kabalan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"systematic-destruction\">Systematic destruction</h2><p>Like Khairallah, Hussein Daher is also a farmer in Marjayoun, but in the town of Blida, about five kilometres (3.1 miles) away from Hula.</p><p>Hussein owns several dunams of olive trees right on Lebanon’s border with Israel. Some of his olive trees, centuries old and inherited from his ancestors, were also uprooted. As for the ones still standing, Hussein has been unable to harvest them because of Israeli attacks.</p><p>Hussein described what he says was one such attack as he tried to reach one of his groves.</p><p>“An Israeli drone appeared above me. I raised my hands to indicate that I am a farmer, but it came closer again,” said Hussein. “I moved to another spot, and minutes later, it returned to the same place I had been standing and dropped a bomb; if I hadn’t moved, it would have killed me.”</p><p>The United Nations reported last month that Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the beginning of the ceasefire had killed <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">more than 270 people</a>.</p><p>The dangers mean that some farmers have still not returned. But many, like Hussein, have no choice. The farmer emphasised that olive harvest seasons were an economic lifeline to him and to most other farmers.</p><p>And they now have to attempt to recoup some of the losses they have had to sustain over the last two years.</p><p>According to an April study by the United Nations’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 814 hectares (2,011 acres) of olive groves were destroyed, with losses in the sector alone estimated at $236m, a significant proportion of the total $586m losses in the wider agricultural sector.</p><p>“We used to produce hundreds of containers of olive oil; today, we produce nothing,” said Hussein, who has a family of eight to provide for. “Some farmers used to produce more than 200 containers of olive oil per season, worth roughly $20,000. These families depended on olive farming, honey production, and agriculture, but now everything was destroyed.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"abandoned\">Abandoned</h2><p>The troubles facing the olive farmers have had a knock-on effect for the olive press owners who turn the harvested olives into Lebanon’s prized olive oil.</p><p>At one olive press in Aitaroun, also in southern Lebanon, the owner, Ahmad Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera that he had only produced one truckload of olive oil this year, compared with the 15 to 20 truckloads his presses make in a typical year.</p><p>“Some villages, like Yaroun, used to bring large quantities of olives, but this year none came,” Ahmad said. “The occupation destroyed vast areas of their orchards and prevented farmers from reaching the remaining ones by shooting at them and keeping them away.”</p><p>Ahmad, in his 70s and a father of five, established this olive press in 2001. He emphasised that the decline in agriculture, particularly olive cultivation in southern Lebanon, would significantly affect local communities.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-olive-press-in-the-southern-town-of-Aitaroun-closed-its-doors-on-Tuesday-after-a-very-poor-olive-oil-production-season.-AL-Jazeera-1763290632.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Olive oil comes out of an olive press\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The olive press in the southern town of Aitaroun has had to shut after a poor olive oil production season [Mounir Kabalan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Many of those areas are still scarred from the fighting, and the weapons used by Israel could still be affecting the olive trees and other crops being grown in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Hussein points to Israel’s alleged use of white phosphorus, a poisonous substance that burns whatever it lands on, saying the chemical has affected plant growth.</p><p>Experts have previously told Al Jazeera that Israel’s use of white phosphorus, which Israel says it uses to create smokescreens on battlefields, is part of the attempt to create a buffer zone along the border.</p><p>But if Lebanese farmers are going to push back against the buffer zone plan, and bring the border region alive again, they’ll need support from authorities both in Lebanon and internationally – support they say has not been forthcoming.</p><p>“Unfortunately, no one has compensated us, neither the Ministry of Agriculture nor anyone else,” said Khairallah, the farmer from Hula. “My losses aren’t just in the orchard that was bulldozed, but also in the farm and the house. My home, located in the middle of the town, was heavily damaged.”</p><p>The Lebanese government has said that it aims to support the districts affected by the war, and has backed NGO-led efforts to help farmers.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Agriculture Minister Hani said that the government had begun to compensate farmers – up to $2,500 – and plant 200,000 olive seedlings. He also outlined restoration projects and the use of the country’s farmers registry to help the agricultural sector.</p><p>“Through the registry, farmers will be able to obtain loans, assistance, and social and health support,” Hani said. “Olives and olive oil are of great and fundamental value, and are a top priority for the Ministry of Agriculture.”</p><p>But Khairallah, Hussein, and Ahmad have yet to see that help from the government, indicating that it will take some time to scale up recovery operations.</p><p>That absence of support, Hussein said, will eventually force the farmers to pack up and leave, abandoning a tradition hundreds of years old.</p><p>“If a farmer does not plant, he cannot survive,” Hussein said. “Unfortunately, the government says it cannot help, while international organisations and donors, like the European Union and the World Bank, promised support, but we haven’t seen anything yet.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The small business was forced to drastically reduce its production capacity after United States President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium.</p><p>“It affected us greatly,” Jose David Garcia Torres, chief of operations at Maquinados Bera, told Al Jazeera. “Many companies decided to halt production, and our services were no longer needed. We were stopped for months, literally doing nothing.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The US initially implemented 25 percent tariffs on steel imports in March and doubled that to 50 percent in June. In the first seven months of the year, the latest data available, Mexican steel and aluminium exports to the US fell 29 percent and 21 percent, in value, respectively, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.</p><p>Tariff negotiations are continuing after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump spoke by phone on October 25. A 90-day extension of tariff pause on most items other than steel, copper and aluminium, expected to expire on October 31, was <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/27/mexicos-sheinbaum-says-she-and-trump-agreed-to-extend-trade-deadline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extended for “a few more weeks”</a>, Sheinbaum said.</p><p>Belem Iliana Vasquez Galan, an economics professor at Colegio de la Frontera, a research institute in Monterrey, told Al Jazeera that these recent tariffs have a broad reach, encompassing all products containing steel and aluminium.</p><p>“It’s not just the steel industry but also the automotive industry, the production of electronic goods, machinery, everything that includes some steel, aluminium or copper,” she said.</p><p>Nuevo Leon’s governor, Samuel Garcia, declared at a September trade show that the state’s steel and aluminium industry has been affected by tariffs applied under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the US president to impose tariffs for national security interests. At the event, Garcia pledged support for major companies like Nemak and Ternium, which Al Jazeera couldn’t reach for comment.</p><p>In recent years, Nuevo Leon, known as Mexico’s industrial powerhouse, has grandly announced significant foreign investments, rebranding itself as a leading city in nearshoring. This was largely driven by the announcement of the construction of a Tesla Gigafactory in March 2023. This project, which brought immense pride to the region and the country, is now widely considered cancelled after Tesla CEO Elon Musk put it on hold in July 2024 due to uncertainty over trade policies between Mexico and the US and in the lead-up to the US elections that year. The Mexican government insists it is merely on hold.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This uncertainty has significantly impacted small companies that once believed the influx of foreign investment would benefit them directly.</p><p>“If they’re receiving all those investments, I think it’s more for larger companies. We, the workshops, are more abandoned,” Garcia Torres said.</p><p>Previously, high production demand in Nuevo Leon had benefitted small workshops like Maquinados Bera, even those not directly connected to large corporations. “Before, it was like, ‘I have so much work, I’m at capacity.’ People would call you to offer work, not to ask for it,” Garcia Torres added.</p><p>Jorge Rodriguez, who runs a metalworks workshop in Cadereyta, a predominantly agricultural and livestock municipality 40km (25 miles) southeast of Monterrey, agreed there was a slowdown in orders in the months leading up to the presidential elections in both countries. However, work came to a standstill at the beginning of this year after Trump’s tariff announcements and the resulting climate of uncertainty.</p><p>“Purchase orders have decreased significantly,” he said. “The companies I work for export their products. Their [exports] almost completely stopped, and I no longer manufacture anything for them.”</p><p>Emmanuel Loo, Nuevo Leon’s deputy economy secretary, insisted the impact on the state’s industry has been minimal. Loo told Al Jazeera he views this new climate as an opportunity to strengthen local supply chains and increase global competitiveness.</p><p>“What we’ve seen is a reorganisation of the steel production chain, in which Nuevo Leon industries have purchased from local industries,” Loo added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"made-in-nuevo-leon\">Made in Nuevo Leon</h2><p>For some small businesses, tariffs meant halting production for large companies, such as machining bushings, pins for hoppers or creating all the fixtures and tooling needed to bend and assemble products. These businesses had to shift their focus to local individual demand and, in some cases, lay off workers.</p><p>Rodriguez told Al Jazeera that local demand has always existed, but industrial demand was so high that small businesses like his never prioritised it. This year, these smaller orders became their lifeline.</p><p>“The money is in the industry, and it was good. But then the industry stopped, and we needed those people with smaller requests. They are smaller jobs, but ultimately they add up – 10, 15 orders – and then you can start paying salaries again,” he said.</p><p>Maquinados Bera also sustained itself through small orders. Garcia Torres explained that, like some other businesses, it had to diversify its production and make machine parts it wasn’t accustomed to. “There was a person who asked us to make grills, and so we made them,” he said.</p><p>The Nuevo Leon government promotes local products, job creation and entrepreneur connections through its Made in Nuevo Leon initiative. Loo emphasised that the state is promoting tax incentives for companies that use local supply chains as well as loans for small and medium-sized businesses to invest in equipment and integrate into global value chains of key sectors like the automotive and high-tech industries.</p><p>However, Vasquez said, integrating local small and medium-sized companies into global supply chains has always been challenging. Foreign companies’ high requirements in terms of both quantity and delivery time remain difficult for small businesses to meet.</p><p>“Integration generally occurs solely for employment. In other words, the only benefit foreign companies bring is job creation,” she said.</p><p>Made in Nuevo Leon has a lot in common with Plan Mexico, an initiative launched in January by Sheinbaum to boost Mexico’s global economic competitiveness and strengthen the domestic market. Analysts see a key challenge in ensuring domestic production finds a domestic market.</p><p>“So how are you going to tell a company that currently allocates, let’s say, half of its exports to other markets to now sell in Mexico when there’s no market or when prices aren’t competitive?” Vasquez asked.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The challenges of creating conditions for domestic market growth in Mexico are intensifying as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) comes up for review next year. Loo told Al Jazeera in early October that the Nuevo Leon government is working with the US government to ensure Mexican aluminium and steel are treated equally under USMCA rules of origin, allowing them to be exported to the United States “virtually tariff-free”.</p><p>“This is what we’re trying to do, not because the industry is being affected but because it’s a great area of ​​opportunity and competitiveness for Mexico as a country and region and for the steel and aluminium companies in our state,” he added.</p><p>Mexico’s integral role in US supply chains highlights the interwoven need for stronger supply chains.</p><p>“We are at a crucial point in US-Mexico relations because the Mexican economy has always depended on the US economy and, through it, on international trade and foreign investment,” Vasquez said.</p><p>To protect its domestic industry, Mexico has applied temporary tariffs of up to 25 percent on steel imports from countries without a free trade agreement, such as China, Mexico’s second biggest trading partner after the US, a move many view as an attempt to placate Trump, as the US has been involved in a deep trade war with China.</p><p>Vasquez asks, “But how can Mexico benefit if it is also closing its doors to trade with the United States? In other words, it is neither allowing an agreement with China nor increasing its trade relationship with the United States.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Garcia Torres and Rodriguez are beginning, albeit cautiously, to see glimmers of hope after months of uncertainty. All machines are now operating at Maquinados Bera. Although the orders are still minimal, they are starting to hear more about large companies returning to their previous production rhythms.</p><p>“They [the companies] are telling me that things are improving,” Rodriguez said, “but I’m not getting excited any more until I see the purchase order. That’s when I’ll get excited.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, following the fall of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel violated a 1974 agreement and again invaded its neighbour’s territory, occupying more land along the border as part of a “buffer zone”, including the strategically vital summit of Mount Hermon.</p><p>Israel was already bombing Syria before the fall of al-Assad, an ally of its regional enemy Iran. But instead of seeking to start on a new path with Syria, Israel has doubled down on its bombing campaign and increased the number of strikes this year, including in the capital Damascus, leading to the deaths of several Syrian soldiers and hitting the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>After the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">visit earlier this month</a> of Syria’s new President Ahmed al-Sharaa to Israel’s key ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, hopes were high that an agreement could be reached. Al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/talks-with-israel-could-lead-to-result-in-days-says-syrias-al-sharaa\">has previously confirmed</a> that direct talks with Israel were under way to secure a permanent settlement.</p><p>But earlier this week, Israel’s Kan broadcaster quoted an unnamed Israeli government official as saying the talks were at a dead end. So what went wrong and why? And does Netanyahu’s trip to the occupied Syrian territory signal that he has no intention to make a deal?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-israel-doing-in-syria\">What is Israel doing in Syria?</h2><p>When Israel’s tanks first entered Syria in December 2024, it <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/not-just-about-the-druze-israels-rationale-for-its-attacks-on-syria\">expanded</a> its territorial footprint within Syria by around 400 square kilometres (155 sq miles), including Mount Hermon, which offers a vantage point over southern Syria and northern Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu described the incursion as a “temporary defensive position”. However, as time has worn on, both Israel’s position on the Golan Heights and its rhetoric have grown more entrenched, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying in March that Israel would continue its occupation of parts of Syria for an “unlimited amount of time”.</p><p>Israel has also chosen to position itself as the defender of the Druze and Kurdish ethnic minorities against a government it has attempted to paint as “extremist”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-did-talks-break-down\">Why did talks break down?</h2><p>Neither government has issued a statement on why the talks have stalled.</p><p>However, citing anonymous government sources, Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, has claimed that talks broke down after Israel refused to withdraw its troops from Syrian territory without what it called a “comprehensive peace agreement”.</p><p>Details of what Israel might mean by a “comprehensive peace agreement” aren’t clear.</p><p>In September, leaked reports suggested that, as part of any peace agreement, Israel was demanding that Syria establish a demilitarised zone southwest of Damascus all the way up to the border with Israel. This would encompass a vast territory, including the governorates of Suwayda, Deraa, and Quneitra.</p><p>In return, Israel would gradually withdraw its forces from Syrian territory, apart from those on the summit of Mount Hermon.</p><p>But since then, it appears that Israel has hardened its stance, and reports in Israeli media indicate that the government’s position is that it will not withdraw from territory seized since December without a full peace deal with Syria – which is not on the table.</p><p>The news agency Reuters also reported that, at the last minute, Israel requested what negotiators termed a “humanitarian corridor”, allowing access between Israel and the heavily Druze populated southern governorate of Syria’s Suwayda.</p><p>According to one source, a central principle of the Israeli proposal was maintaining an aerial corridor to Iran via Syria, which would allow for future Israeli strikes on Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-why-did-netanyahu-and-others-visit-the-buffer-zone\">So, why did Netanyahu and others visit the buffer zone?</h2><p>Netanyahu told Israeli troops that their presence within Syrian territory was of “immense importance”, adding that their purpose there was vital in “safeguarding our Druze allies”, he said.</p><p>Syria’s Druze minority provided a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/not-just-about-the-druze-israels-rationale-for-its-attacks-on-syria\">pretext</a> for Israel’s last deployment to Syria in July, when Israel was accused of using the conflict between the group and local Bedouins to empower minority factions within the country as rival power centres to the recognised government in Damascus.</p><p>Expanding buffer zones with neighbouring states ahead of opening diplomatic channels or contributing towards reconstruction following the often devastating attacks by its military forces appears to have become a central tenet of Israel’s regional strategy.</p><p>In Gaza, where Israel has killed almost <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/20/live-israel-bombs-house-in-southern-gaza-kills-at-least-3-palestinians\">70,000</a> Palestinians, Israel is seeking to establish an extensive <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/map-of-gaza-shows-where-israeli-forces-are-positioned-under-ceasefire-deal\">buffer zone</a> as part of the US-imposed stabilisation deal that would reduce the already drastically limited space available to the enclave’s post-war population even further.</p><p>In Lebanon, where it killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/un-peacekeepers-say-israel-built-walls-inside-lebanese-territory\">4,000</a> people during its invasion of October 2024, Israel has been accused of laying the groundwork to create a buffer zone within Lebanese territory, similar to that it is trying to establish in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-did-syria-and-others-say-about-the-visit\">What did Syria and others say about the visit?</h2><p>The Syrian Foreign Ministry branded the visit “illegitimate” and “a grave violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p><p>“This visit represents a new attempt to impose a fait accompli that contradicts relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and falls within the occupation’s policies aimed at entrenching its aggression and continuing its violations of Syrian territory,” a ministry statement read.</p><p>Other nations, including Jordan, France and Qatar, have also condemned the Israeli prime minister’s visit, branding it a threat to regional stability.</p><p>In the UN, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/syria-condemns-israeli-pm-netanyahus-illegal-visit-to-seized-territory\">critical</a> of what he called Netanyahu’s “very public visit”, adding that it was “concerning, to say the least”.</p><p>Dujarric noted that UN Resolution 2799, recently passed by the UN Security Council, “called for the full sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-might-this-affect-negotiations\">How might this affect negotiations?</h2><p>It looks to have set them back and, to a degree, left Israel isolated.</p><p>On Wednesday, a senior UN official urged Israel to halt its activity in the occupied Golan Heights, cautioning that its actions were stoking regional tensions.</p><p>Najat Rochdi, the UN deputy special envoy for Syria, told the UN Security Council that Israel’s operations were weakening the 1974 agreement establishing the buffer zone.</p><p>“I received a strong appeal from [Syria’s] Foreign Minister [Asaad] al-Shaibani for the UN to act to put an end to these violations,” she said, urging the UN Security Council to assume its responsibilities under the 1974 agreement.</p><p>Israel’s principal ally, the US, along with many of the region’s powers, appears to have rejected Israeli characterisation of Syrian extremism.</p><p>Receiving al-Sharaa at the White House earlier this month, US President Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">praised</a> the Syrian leader, saying, “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf countries have also been providing economic <a href=\"/news/2025/9/7/saudi-arabia-announces-damascus-area-reconstruction-project-to-clear-rubble\">support</a> to Syria since al-Assad’s ousting, with Saudi Arabia, a key focus of Israel and the US’s normalisation efforts, announcing a reconstruction programme as recently as September.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-might-israel-s-ultimate-goals-in-syria-be\">What might Israel’s ultimate goals in Syria be?</h2><p>Israel appears to be following its standard playbook when dealing with its neighbours – use force, ask questions later, and refuse to compromise.</p><p>It knows it is the strongest military power in the region, but also believes it faces existential threats, and therefore largely does not want to make agreements that it believes will benefit rivals. In essence, Israel prefers to conduct business through force of arms rather than deal-making.</p><p>As well as maintaining its illegal occupation of Syrian territory, Israel has continued to occupy Lebanese territory and launch attacks against its neighbour despite entering into a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/despite-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-the-war-isnt-over-for-netanyahu\">ceasefire</a> in November 2024.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera earlier this year, writer, researcher, and founder of The Fire These Times podcast, Elia Ayoub, <a href=\"/features/2025/4/9/israel-pushes-on-with-strategy-to-keep-neighbours-weak-in-lebanon-and-syria\">said</a> that “The Israelis believe that having weaker neighbours, as in states that aren’t really able to function, is beneficial for them because, in that context, they’re the strongest actor.”</p><p>Whether that means dividing Syria, or simply retaining a large buffer zone, is unclear – and will perhaps be determined by how things pan out.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Passed down from our Founding Fathers, to ensure our military upholds its oath to the Constitution — not a king,” Slotkin <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1990961370431463785\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in response to Miller’s post. “Given you’re directing much of a military policy, you should buff up on the Uniformed Code of Military Justice.”</p><p>Crow, meanwhile, called out policies he considers to be in violation of US law, including Trump’s decision to deploy <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/us-federal-court-to-weigh-trumps-deployment-of-national-guard-to-chicago\">military troops</a> to police civilians and the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">recent bombing campaign</a> against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.</p><p>“The President is trampling on the Constitution,” Crow <a href=\"https://x.com/RepJasonCrow/status/1990907700285252007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “Stop politicizing our troops. Stop illegal military strikes. Stop pitting our servicemembers against the American people.”</p><p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and legal experts, including <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/un-human-rights-chief-says-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats-unacceptable\">at the United Nations</a>, have warned that the boat-bombing campaign runs afoul of the UN Charter, as well as international and domestic human rights laws.</p><p>“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” Volker Turk, the UN’s human rights chief, said last month.</p><p>He added that the “extrajudicial killings” of alleged drug smugglers on the boats “find no justification in international law”. At least 83 people have been killed in the attacks.</p><p>On Thursday, however, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that President Trump has stuck to the letter of the law in all his orders to the military.</p><p>“Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander-in-chief and through this chain of command — through the secretary of war — is lawful,” she told a news briefing.</p><p>“We do things by the books. And to suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do.”</p><p>She added that the Democrats “should be held accountable” for “ their dangerous rhetoric”.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-threats-against-rivals\">A history of threats against rivals</h2><p>Thursday’s threats against the Democratic lawmakers is not the first time Trump has dangled the prospect of imprisonment — or even death — in front of political rivals.</p><p>During his successful 2016 presidential campaign, Trump turned the possibility of jailing his political rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, into a popular rallying cry.</p><p>Crowds at his events would applaud him and chant, “Lock her up! Lock her up!”</p><p>Trump had claimed that Clinton’s use of a private email server merited her incarceration, framing her actions as corrupt. “For what she’s done, they should lock her up. They should. It’s disgraceful,” he told a 2016 campaign event in North Carolina.</p><p>Even after taking office, Trump continued to threaten his critics and perceived opponents with arrest. In 2020, for instance, he took to social media <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313842083606802435\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to push</a> for the jailing of those involved in a 2016 investigation into alleged Russian election interference, which he considers a “hoax”.</p><p>“Where are all of the arrests?” he <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313842083606802435\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asked</a>. “Long term sentences would have started two years ago. Shameful.”</p><p>During his most recent presidential bid, in 2024, he returned to the theme of incarceration, calling for the prosecution of then-President Joe Biden and his successor as Democratic nominee, Vice President <a href=\"/news/2024/9/30/trump-escalates-personal-attacks-on-rival-calls-harris-mentally-impaired\">Kamala Harris</a>.</p><p>“She should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions,” Trump said of Harris at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, blaming her for crimes committed by immigrants.</p><p>Trump’s threats have also targeted members of his own party that he perceives as disloyal.</p><p>Republican Liz Cheney, for instance, investigated Trump’s actions during the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. She was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives <a href=\"/news/2022/12/23/5-key-takeaways-from-january-6-panels-report-on-us-capitol-riot\">who recommended</a> criminal charges for his actions.</p><p>In the 2024 presidential race, Cheney ultimately backed Harris over Trump, her fellow party member. In response to her public criticisms, Trump openly mused about her <a href=\"/news/2024/11/1/cheney-slams-tyrant-trump-after-he-suggests-she-should-face-firing-squad\">facing a firing squad</a>.</p><p>“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said. His campaign later clarified he only meant to highlight Cheney’s hypocrisy.</p><p>Since Trump returned to office for a second term in January, critics say he has attempted to follow through with some of his threats.</p><p>In September, for instance, Trump used social media <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to demand</a> that Attorney General Pam Bondi prosecute three of his critics: Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/trump-adversary-letitia-james-pleads-not-guilty-in-mortgage-fraud-case\">Letitia James</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment\">James Comey</a>, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation,” he wrote. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p><p>Since that time, both James and Comey have faced criminal indictments. A third critic, former Trump adviser <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/john-bolton-pleads-not-guilty-to-mishandling-classified-information-in-us\">John Bolton</a>, was also charged last month.</p><p>All three have argued their cases are a form of political retribution and are currently seeking <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally\">to have the charges dismissed</a>.</p><p>Trump has long maintained that the greatest threat to the US is the “enemy from within”, an ambiguous phrase he has sometimes applied to Democratic rivals like Schiff.</p><p>Last month, he <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/key-takeaways-from-trumps-speech-to-us-military-generals\">told a gathering</a> of top military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, that the “big thing” they would be handling from here forward is “the enemy from within”.</p><p>“We have to handle it before it gets out of control,” he told the packed room of nearly 800 generals and admirals.</p></div></div></body></html>"
