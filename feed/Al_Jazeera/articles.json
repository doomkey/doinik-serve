That payment was a sign things are improving in Aden – the salaries are funded by Saudi Arabia as a way of backing the Yemeni government, which has recently arrived to take control of Aden after the defeat of secessionist forces.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But problems and instability are never far away in Yemen.</p><p>Just as soon as the children, Amjad, 10, and Mona, 7, began trying on their outfits, the sound of gunfire erupted. Shoppers froze. Amjad and Mona clutched their father, asking to leave.</p><p>About 3km (2 miles) away, security forces had opened fire on protesters who attempted to breach the gates of al-Maashiq Palace, where members of the Yemeni government have been based since they <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/new-yemen-government-formed-with-shaya-mohsin-al-zindani-as-prime-minister\">arrived</a> from Riyadh a week ago.</p><p>The gunfire shattered the family’s moment of joy.</p><p>“It ruins your joy when you see a person bleed and robs you of peace when you hear prolonged gunfire,” Abu Amjad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>After years of operating from exile, Yemen’s Saudi-backed, UN-recognised cabinet is spending Ramadan in Aden, a move that has coincided with improvements in basic services and a renewed sense of relief. Yet that relief was overshadowed by the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/one-killed-11-injured-in-yemen-after-security-forces-disperse-stc-storming\">deadly confrontation</a> between security forces and antigovernment protesters, in which at least one person was killed.</p><p>“That was the first clash after the return of the government to Aden. Our concern is that it may not be the last,” said Abu Amjad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"government-wins\">Government wins</h2><p>Yemen’s new Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/new-yemen-government-formed-with-shaya-mohsin-al-zindani-as-prime-minister\">Shaya al-Zindani</a> has said that stabilising Aden and other areas under government control was among the new government’s main priorities.</p><p>The Yemeni government is currently in its strongest position for years. An advance by the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) at the end of last year in eastern Yemen ultimately was a step too far for the United Arab Emirates-backed group.</p><p>Saudi Arabia considered the STC advance the crossing of a red line, and lent its full military backing to the Yemeni government, allowing it to take territory it had not controlled for years.</p><p>Now, the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia are focused on attempting to improve conditions in the southern and eastern areas of Yemen under government control, to attract more public support. That would in turn weaken support for both the STC and the Houthi rebels, who have controlled northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, since the country’s war began in 2014.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"lit-city-and-busy-markets\">Lit city and busy markets</h2><p>Abdulrahman Mansour, a bus driver and resident of Khormaksar in Aden, said Ramadan this year feels different.</p><p>“When I see the lights on and the markets busy on Ramadan nights in Aden, it feels like a different city. The improvement is undeniable,” Mansour, 42, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He noted that one distinct difference this Ramadan is the stable provision of electricity. “This reminds me of the pre-war time. We used to take that service for granted,” said Mansour.</p><p>“When the city is dark at night, it appears gloomy, and families prefer to stay home. The movement of people brings life to the city and helps small businesses keep afloat, especially in Ramadan,” Mansour added.</p><p>Yemeni Electricity Minister Adnan al-Kaf said last week that efforts to improve electricity services in Aden and other provinces continue, noting that Saudi support had contributed to improved service over the past two months.</p><p>Wafiq Saleh, a Yemeni economic researcher, said the improvement in the living standards of citizens in Aden and <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/20/is-southern-yemens-next-phase-being-decided-on-the-ground\">southern Yemen</a>, in general, was obvious, particularly after Saudi Arabia’s payment of public sector salaries and the supply of basic services such as water and electricity.</p><p>Saleh told Al Jazeera, “The recent Saudi financial support has been very generous, and it can help the government during this period by enabling it to work on reactivating dormant resources, resuming oil exports, combating corruption, and improving the efficiency of revenue collection with transparency and good governance.”</p><p>But Saleh emphasised that the progress achieved so far is not the result of economic reforms by the Yemeni government, but rather because of Saudi support.</p><p>Therefore, according to the economist, the improvement in the living situation and the currency’s value may not be sustainable, even if it is a positive indicator and may be the first step towards promised economic reforms in the country.</p><p>“There must be a comprehensive vision for developing revenue collection so that the government can implement sustainable economic reforms,” Saleh said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"search-for-cooking-gas\">Search for cooking gas</h2><p>While the distribution of electricity has improved in Aden, other essential services remain strained. Cooking gas shortages remain a major concern. The search for it remains a daily struggle for families in the port city, and the crisis has intensified in Ramadan.</p><p>Lines of vehicles queue at stations, while residents wait with cylinders for a few litres (quarts) of gas.</p><p>“Going from one station to another in search of cooking gas while fasting is exhausting,” said Fawaz Ahmed, a 42-year resident of Khormaksar district.</p><p>Fawaz describes the shortage of cooking gas as a cause of hunger in the city. “If I stay in [my home] village, I would resort to firewood. But in the city, that option is not available, and if we find firewood in the market, it is expensive.”</p><p>Gas distributors say the quantity of cooking gas supplied to them is not adequate, citing this as the root cause of the crisis. Supplies are transported from Marib province in northern Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tensions-to-continue\">Tensions to continue</h2><p>The cooking gas shortage is a sign that it will not be plain sailing for the Yemeni government in Aden.</p><p>And opponents will likely seize on any ongoing problems to foment more unrest.</p><p>Majed al-Daari, editor-in-chief of the independent Yemeni news site Maraqiboun Press, described the situation in Aden as “very worrying”.</p><p>“What happened to the demonstrators at the start of Ramadan underscores the fragility of the political and security situation. Tensions are set to continue,” al-Daari said.</p><p>“The STC will continue mobilising its supporters against the government. This is its last card that it will use to restore lost political interests,” al-Daari added.</p><p>The STC said in a statement last week that raids and arbitrary arrests had targeted people who had participated in the recent protests. These attacks, the statement emphasised, would only increase the determination of the southerner secessionists.</p><p>For Abu Amjad,  demonstrations in Aden give space to chaos, which he resents.</p><p>“At least, Ramadan should pass without protests. Political actors should spare us this month so we can fast and share some joy with our children,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Videos circulated of officers breaking the car windows of legal observers, pepper-spraying protesters and beating people.</p><p>Officers also engaged in the practice of entering homes forcibly without a judicial warrant, which advocates described as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Cases of unlawful arrests were also reported.</p><p>But a turning point came on January 7, when an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was caught on camera shooting into the vehicle of 37-year-old mother <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/who-is-renee-nicole-good-the-woman-killed-in-the-ice-minneapolis-shooting\">Renee Good</a>. She died, and her killing triggered nationwide protests.</p><p>Operation Pullup took place at Cities Church in St Paul less than two weeks later.</p><p>It was intended as a demonstration against the church’s pastor, David Easterwood, who serves as a local official for ICE.</p><p>Several protesters have indicated that they are prepared to fight the government’s charges over the incident, citing their First Amendment rights to free speech.</p><p>Some also said that they intended to remain vigilant towards government immigration operations, even after Trump administration officials announced Operation Metro Surge <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/12/us-border-chief-says-ending-ice-deportation-surge-in-minnesota\">was winding down</a> in mid-February.</p><p>“This is not the time to be Minnesota Nice,” one protester, civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, wrote on social media last week. “It’s time for truth, justice, and freedom to prevail.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump’s directive came during a weeks-long feud between the Pentagon and the San Francisco-based startup over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.</p><p>Spokespeople for Anthropic, which has a $200m contract with the Pentagon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Trump’s decision stopped short of threats issued by the Pentagon, including that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic’s compliance.</p><p>The Pentagon had also said it considered making Anthropic a supply-chain risk, a designation that previously targeted businesses tied to foreign adversaries.</p><p>Trump’s comments came just over an hour before the Pentagon’s deadline for Anthropic to allow unrestricted military use of its AI technology or face consequences – and nearly 24 hours after CEO Dario Amodei said his company <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-ai-pentagon-hegseth-dario-amodei-9b28dda41bdb52b6a378fa9fc80b8fda\" data-gtm-enhancement-style=\"LinkEnhancementA\">“cannot in good conscience accede”</a> to the Defense Department’s demands.</p><p>Calling the company “left-wing nut jobs”, the president said Anthropic made a mistake trying to strong-arm the Pentagon. Trump wrote on Truth Social that most agencies must immediately stop using Anthropic’s AI, but gave the Pentagon a six-month period to phase out the technology that is already embedded in military platforms.</p><p>“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump wrote.</p><p>At issue in the defence contract was a clash over AI’s role in national security. Anthropic had said it sought narrow assurances from the Pentagon that Claude won’t be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons. But after months of private talks exploded into public debate, it said in a Thursday statement that new contract language “framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will”.</p><p>Trump threatened further action if Anthropic did not cooperate with the phaseout. Trump warned he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow” if Anthropic did not help in the phaseout period.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threatening-move\">‘Threatening’ move</h2><p>The setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.</p><p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customised models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p><p>Its product, Claude, is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p><p>US Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticised the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p><p>“The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.”</p><p>The conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet’s Google protested the Pentagon’s use of the company’s AI to analyse drone footage, straining relations between Silicon Valley and Washington. A rapprochement ensued, with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jostling for defence business, and still more CEOs pledging cooperation last year with the Trump administration.</p><p>The dispute stunned AI developers in Silicon Valley, where a growing number of workers from Anthropic’s top rivals, OpenAI and Google, voiced support for Amodei’s stand in open letters and other forums.</p><p>“The Pentagon is negotiating with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” says the open letter from some OpenAI and Google employees. “They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in.”</p><p>And in a surprise move from one of Amodei’s fiercest rivals, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday sided with Anthropic and, in a CNBC interview, questioned the Pentagon’s “threatening” move, suggesting that OpenAI and most of the AI field share the same red lines. Amodei once worked for OpenAI before he and other OpenAI leaders quit to form Anthropic in 2021.</p><p>“For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety,” Altman told CNBC.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thirteen Afghan soldiers had been killed, he said, and another 22 wounded, while 13 civilians were also wounded.</p><p>Later on Friday, the Afghan government said that 19 civilians were killed and 26 others injured when Pakistan struck the provinces of Khost and Paktika in southeastern Afghanistan.</p><p>Casualty claims from both sides have not been independently verified by Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"relations-plunged\">Relations plunged</h2><p>The operation was Pakistan’s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Abdul Sayed, a Sweden-based analyst on conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan, says domestic factors in Pakistan constitute a significant constraint on its ability to initiate a full-scale war against Afghanistan.</p><p>“This limitation stems from the deep ties between the populations of both countries, particularly the tribes residing on either side of the Durand Line,” a 2,575-kilometre (1,600-mile) frontier that is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border but which Afghanistan does not recognise as legitimate.</p><p>“Consequently, despite its substantial military capabilities, Pakistan cannot sustain the large-scale bloodshed that an armed conflict with Afghanistan would entail,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Several rounds of negotiations between Islamabad and Kabul followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.</p><p>After repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.</p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned by the escalation of violence” between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the impact that is having on civilian populations, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told a news briefing. Russia, Iran and Iraq are among the countries that have called for an immediate end to the fighting.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have no money. They have no anything right now, but they’re talking with us,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>“And maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba.”</p><p>Trump has been pushing for regime change on the communist-led Caribbean island over the last two months, using economic and diplomatic pressure.</p><p>In Friday’s remarks, Trump reiterated his stance that Cuba is “a failing nation” teetering on collapse.</p><p>“Since I’m a little boy, I’ve been hearing about Cuba, and everybody wanted to change, and I can see that happening,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American known for his hawkish stance, is leading the initiative.</p><p>“Marco Rubio is dealing on it and at a very high level, and you know, they have no money. They have no oil, they have no food,” Trump said. “It’s really right now a nation in deep trouble. And they want our help.”</p><h2 id=\"increasing-pressure-on-cuba\">Increasing pressure on Cuba</h2><p>The US has long had strained relations with Cuba, an island just 145 kilometres, or 90 miles, from its shores. Since the 1960s, the US has imposed a full trade embargo on the island, weakening its economy.</p><p>But tensions have accelerated since January 3, when Trump authorised a military operation to abduct and imprison Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close ally of Cuba.</p><p>An estimated 32 Cuban soldiers were killed in the attack, alongside Venezuelan military personnel.</p><p>In the aftermath, Trump ratcheted up pressure against the island, publicly speculating that its government is “ready to fall”.</p><p>On January 11, he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115876460615555838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that no more Venezuelan oil or money would flow to Cuba. Then, on January 29, he issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> threatening tariffs on any country that supplies oil directly or indirectly to the island.</p><p>Cuba’s energy grid largely relies on fossil fuels to generate electricity, and the United Nations has warned of the potential for an imminent humanitarian “collapse” on the island if supplies are not restored.</p><p>A panel of UN human rights experts also cast doubt this month on Trump’s stated rationale that Cuba constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security, due to its relations with China, Russia and other US rivals.</p><p>The fuel blockade, they explained, served primarily as “an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion” that violated international law.</p><p>“There is no right under international law to impose economic penalties on third States for engaging in lawful trade with another sovereign country,” they wrote in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-vision-for-a-growing-nation\">Trump’s vision for a ‘growing nation’</h2><p>The Trump administration, however, has made little secret of its desire to spread US influence, particularly in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>In his inaugural speech in 2025, Trump pledged that the US “will once again consider itself a growing nation”, including through the expansion of its territory.</p><p>Since delivering that address, Trump has proposed to <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/donald-trump-teases-us-aims-to-take-over-gaza-during-netanyahus-visit\">“own” Gaza</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-after-nicolas-maduro-seized\">“run” Venezuela</a>, while pressuring countries like Greenland, Canada and Panama to cede sovereignty over their lands.</p><p>He has repeatedly referenced 19th-century expansionist policies like manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine to justify some of these efforts. He even married his personal brand to the latter, calling his plans for the Western Hemisphere the “Donroe Doctrine”.</p><p>During his State of the Union address this week, he touted his military action in Venezuela as a success and announced that more than 80 million barrels of Venezuelan oil had been transferred into the US government’s possession.</p><p>“We’re also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” Trump told the crowd.</p><p>The Cuban government, however, has repeatedly denounced Trump’s campaign against the island as evidence of US imperialism.</p><p>On January 30, for instance, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Trump of attempting “to strangle the Cuban economy” with the fuel blockade.</p><p>“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a cabal that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/2017219659955593370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Just this week, Diaz-Canel’s government announced there had been <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/cuban-border-agents-fire-upon-florida-tagged-speedboat-killing-four\">a deadly shootout</a> with a Florida-tagged speedboat close to its shores.</p><p>The US government has denied responsibility. But Cuba has described the boat as part of an “infiltration for terrorist purposes”.</p><h2 id=\"loosening-restrictions\">Loosening restrictions?</h2><p>Already, there have been signs that the US might seek to ease some of the pressure on Cuba, while maintaining its stiff opposition to the island’s communist government.</p><p>Earlier in February, the Trump administration announced $6m in humanitarian aid to the island, to be distributed through proxies like the Catholic Church, not the local government.</p><p>And on Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury revealed it would “implement a favorable licensing policy” for the resale of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, barring any transaction with the Cuban government or its military and intelligence services.</p><p>Critics have argued that a humanitarian crisis in Cuba could trigger consequences for Trump, who has campaigned on cracking down on immigration and slashing government spending.</p><p>Cuba has seen multiple waves of migration to the US, the most recent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when nearly 2 million people fled the island due to economic instability and political repression.</p><p>Diaz-Canel, meanwhile, repeated on Friday that his government would defend itself from any outside threat.</p><p>“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist or mercenary aggression that seeks to undermine its sovereignty and national stability,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/2027012778838348146\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

nuclear watchdog has said in a report that Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility, urging Tehran to allow inspections as it faces <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/how-trumps-2026-iran-war-script-echoes-and-twists-the-2003-iraq-playbook\">growing pressure</a> from the United States over its nuclear programme.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, which was circulated to members Friday, confirmed earlier findings that the country was enriching uranium up to 60 percent, which is a short step away weapons-grade purity, raising concerns over the IAEA’s lack of access to the Isfahan site, one of three facilities that the US claimed to have “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">obliterated</a>” in last year’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/iaea-warns-israel-iran-conflict-threatens-nuclear-facilities-diplomacy\">12-day war</a>.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The IAEA report also stated that its inspectors do not know the precise location of a fourth uranium enrichment facility that Iran said it was setting up in Isfahan prior to the 12-day war, adding that they were not aware of its operational status or whether it currently contains nuclear material.</p><p>The IAEA said it had observed in satellite imagery “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20% and 60% U-235 … was stored”, stressing the importance of being able to carry out inspections in Iran without further delay.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Iran.</p><p>The report comes a day after US and Iranian negotiators held a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/us-iran-talks-conclude-claims-progress-few-details\">third round</a> of indirect talks mediated by Oman in Geneva that yielded no breakthrough.</p><p>It will be discussed at a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s 35-country board commencing on Monday next week in Vienna, coinciding with further Oman-mediated meetings between technical teams in the same city.</p><p>There is uncertainty over the fate of Iran’s stockpile of more than 400kg (882 pounds) of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors last June 10.</p><p>Israel launched strikes on Iran later that month, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>Tehran suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem said the technical points up for discussion in the Oman-mediated talks on Monday would, he said, be “related” to extracting the 440.9kg (972 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent that the IAEA had reported prior to the 12-day war, in case there was “any tendency to go towards weaponisation of the programme”.</p><p>However, Hashem added, the IAEA is aware that “even the Iranians aren’t able to get into those facilities.” “So there’s been a lot of work around the facilities, at least this is what was shown in satellite imagery, but it doesn’t seem that the Iranians were able to get in,” he said.</p><p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said the stockpile of enriched uranium and the inspections were the main “sticking point” in US-Iran discussions.</p><p>After yesterday’s talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US should stop its “excessive demands”. He did not specify what those demands were, but the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He visited for the first time in February 2025, then in September and twice in October of last year.</p><p>No other details were provided about the latest diplomatic outing. But it comes at a delicate time for relations in the Middle East.</p><p>Just this week, the US and Iran held a third round of indirect talks, this time in Switzerland, as the two sides attempt to negotiate a deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>A new round of talks is slated to take place in Austria on Monday, the day Rubio arrives in Israel.</p><p>Still, Trump used a public appearance on Friday on the White House lawn to voice frustration at the slow pace of negotiations.</p><p>“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have. I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.</p><p>“We’ll have some additional talks today. But no, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”</p><p>Trump added that he was not averse to using the military to accomplish his aims. “I’d love not to use it, but sometimes you have to. We’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Upon his arrival in Texas, Trump added that he would not be satisfied with Iran merely reducing its enrichment of uranium, even for civilian energy projects.</p><p>“I say no enrichment,” Trump told reporters. “Not 20 percent, 30 percent.”</p><p>Trump’s latest comments are likely to feed ongoing fears of a military escalation with Iran, a conflict that could spill into the broader region.</p><p>His remarks coincided with an email from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee to embassy staff in Israel, giving them permission to leave the country, another signal that simmering tensions might boil over.</p><p>Huckabee emphasised that those who leave “should do so TODAY”, according to media reports. He added, however, that there is “no need to panic”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://x.com/usembassyjlm/status/2027312031133499902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public notice</a> from the US Embassy in Jerusalem acknowledged the authorisation to leave and cited “safety risks” due to “terrorism and civil unrest”.</p><p>“Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,” the notice said.</p><p>The State Department also issued a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/iran-designated-as-a-state-sponsor-of-wrongful-detention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> from Rubio designating Iran a “state sponsor of wrongful detention”. He also urged US citizens to not “travel to Iran for any reason” or leave immediately, if they were already there.</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-iran-attack\">Threat of Iran attack</h2><p>Concerns have been mounting, though, that the US may seek to take military action against Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel and the US.</p><p>Since <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January</a>, the administration of US President Donald Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">deployed a “massive armada”</a> to the waters near Iran, including two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Trump has also hinted on several occasions that he is prepared to launch an attack, either to force a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities or intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters.</p><p>On January 1, for instance, Trump responded to a deadly crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in Iran by <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posting</a> a message on Truth Social.</p><p>It said that the US military was “locked and loaded and ready to go” to “rescue” any protesters who might be killed.</p><p>More recently, during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Trump described his military threats as a successful tactic in stopping the execution of protesters.</p><p>“We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that he would not be afraid to act. “I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must,” Trump said in the primetime speech, which accused Iran of having “spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate”.</p><p>On Friday, however, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk signalled that <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2026/02/our-choices-our-voices-our-votes-determine-our-future-says-turk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight protesters</a> have nevertheless been sentenced to death, and 30 more are at risk of receiving the same penalty.</p><p>Turk also warned against the possibility of military action, highlighting the risk of civilian harm.</p><p>“I am extremely alarmed about the potential for regional military escalation and its impact on civilians, and I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration cited human rights</p><h2 id=\"pushing-for-a-deal\">Pushing for a deal</h2><p>But the protesters have not been the only motive Trump has cited for his sabre-rattling.</p><p>Trump has also indicated that military intervention may be necessary should Iran fail to agree to a nuclear deal.</p><p>On February 19, the president told reporters aboard his jet, Air Force One, that Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much maximum” to strike a deal with US negotiators.</p><p>Should it fail to, Trump indicated he would take his “maximum pressure” campaign a “step further”, appearing to imply military action.</p><p>“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump had said earlier in the day at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace panel.</p><p>Iran, meanwhile, has said its position is “close” to that of the US on many issues, but it has called for the Trump administration to drop what it considers “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iran-says-us-must-drop-excessive-demands-in-nuclear-negotiations\">excessive demands</a>“.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that the US government not only wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear programme, but it also seeks to curtail its ballistic missile arsenal and sever its relations with regional allies and proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>Iran, however, has largely dismissed those demands as unrealistic, and it has argued that its nuclear enrichment programme is designed to produce civilian energy, not weaponry.</p><p>It has also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds with another military strike.</p><p>Last June, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facility, as part of a 12-day war initiated by an Israeli attack. The Trump administration dubbed the campaign “Operation Midnight Hammer”.</p><p>The latest negotiations seek to mint a new nuclear deal following the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a multilateral agreement that saw Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>But Trump’s decision, during his first term, to withdraw the US caused the deal to fall apart. As part of his withdrawal, Trump renewed US sanctions against Iran.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-always-a-risk\">‘There’s always a risk’</h2><p>But the pressure on Iran has increased in recent days, particularly as media reports emerged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has been blocked from accessing the three sites targeted in Operation Midnight Hammer.</p><p>The agency has indicated that <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iaea-eyes-isfahan-nuclear-complex-as-it-urges-iran-to-allow\">it cannot confirm</a> whether Iran has suspended nuclear enrichment at the sites, nor can it estimate the size of Iran’s nuclear stockpile.</p><p>That news is likely to fuel the Trump administration’s efforts: It has long warned that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, a claim Tehran denies.</p><p>Still, the government of Oman, which is mediating the talks, issued a statement striking a positive note, following a meeting between its top diplomat and US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>“His excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clarified that the negotiations have thus far achieved significant, important and unprecedented progress, which could form the cornerstone of the desired agreement,” the statement said.</p><p>It added that Oman would continue “its efforts in supporting dialogue and facilitating rapprochement between the concerned parties” and that diplomatic efforts could resolve the impasse.</p><p>Still, as Trump prepared to travel to Texas on Friday, he was asked about the prospect of a military strike sparking a wider, drawn-out regional war with Iran.</p><p>He largely shrugged off the possibility, citing successes with Operation Midnight Hammer as well as his decision to order the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020.</p><p>“I guess you could say there’s always a risk. When there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad. We’ve had tremendous luck,” Trump replied. “Everything’s worked out, and we want to keep it that way.”</p><p>He called on Iran to negotiate in “good faith and conscience”. Still, he ended with a note of scepticism: “They are not getting there.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Palestinians.</p><p>Aid agencies – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities in December that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian staff.</p><p>The organisations say

Norwegian Refugee Council, said the decision was welcome, but pointed to the difficulties that aid agencies continue to face in Gaza.</p><p>“The injunction pauses immediate closure. It does not restore visas, reopen access or resolve the wider restrictions that continue to affect aid delivery.</p><p>“Despite a ceasefire agreement, conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, and humanitarian needs in the West Bank continue to grow,” said Low.</p><p>Athena Rayburn, executive director for the Association of International Development Agencies, said they were “still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate,” adding that the situation inside Gaza remained “catastrophic”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-attacks-continue-in-gaza\">Israeli attacks continue in Gaza</h2><p>In Gaza, at least six Palestinians were killed in Israeli drone attacks targeting two police posts in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Strip and the al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis in the south on Friday.</p><p>Medical sources at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis reported the arrival of four bodies and several wounded individuals following an Israeli military strike on a police checkpoint at the al-Maslakh intersection in al-Mawasi.</p><p>The sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.</p><p>In the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed, and others were injured, in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.</p><p>The attacks overnight into Friday were condemned by Hamas as undermining mediator efforts during a “ceasefire” phase that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">Israel has violated almost daily</a> since October 10.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said it was a “bloody night. Israeli forces carried out a series of deadly air strikes, this time primarily focusing on police checkpoints that have been deployed too close to areas where armed militias are operating in the eastern communities of the Gaza Strip, in particular in … Khan Younis and Bureij refugee camp.</p><p>“Six police members have been killed as a result … But also here, the timing and location are critically reshaping the whole equation between both sides.

That came on the heels of Netflix’s decision on Thursday evening that it would not match Paramount’s latest $31 per share bid or raise its offer of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros’s studio and streaming assets, stating that the deal was “no longer financially attractive”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Warner had given Netflix four business days to come up with a counteroffer for Paramount’s latest bid — but Netflix, instead, responded less than two hours later, declining to raise its proposal. It said the new price it would have to pay made the deal “no longer financially attractive”.</p><p>“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><p>The decision was welcomed by investors. Shares of the streaming giant had shed more than 18 percent since Netflix announced its deal with Warner Bros on December 5.</p><p>The latest move is a “tick in the box” for discipline, said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot.</p><p>“What you want from a management team is an ability to look at acquisitions, value them, pay what they think is a fair price, but to not overpay.”</p><p>Analysts and investors had questioned whether Netflix’s bid was a defensive attempt to block a future competitor or an offensive shift away from its historically disciplined build-versus-buy approach.</p><p>“A positive turn of events in our view, as we believe NFLX’s withdrawal from the race will leave it free to refocus on its business, while its closest competitors grapple with long and distracting regulatory approval and merger integration processes, and with PSKY saddled with sizable deal debts,” HSBC analysts said.</p><h2 id=\"hollywood-and-ego\">‘Hollywood and ego’</h2><p>Shares of the David Ellison-led Paramount, meanwhile, were up 17 percent.</p><p>Paramount’s deal, valued at $110bn, including debt, represents nearly 13 times Warner Bros’ EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or core profits – this year, according to estimates from LSEG. That is well above what Paramount is worth on the same basis, which is 7 times its estimated earnings.</p><p>A tie-up with Warner Bros would allow Paramount’s storied Hollywood studio to tap into Warner’s deep trove of intellectual property – including franchises such as Fantastic Beasts and The Matrix – across film, television and streaming.</p><p>“WBD’s largest asset is declining, and the company is still under debt from its last failed merger. But this deal is more about Ellison taking over Hollywood and ego than it is about good business sense,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer.</p><p>For Paramount’s streaming unit, a combination with HBO Max and Discovery+ would reshape its position in a streaming era long dominated by Netflix.</p><p>“Paramount was the streaming market laggard, and it needs Warner Bros’ content and capabilities to play catch-up. It will need more than Harry Potter for the deal to work its magic and enable Paramount to fight off Netflix, Disney and Amazon in the streaming wars,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium – backed by Larry Ellison, billionaire and ally of United States President Donald Trump, and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison – also boosted its termination fee to $7bn and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7bn in equity.</p><p>“There is a right price and wrong price for any acquisition, and the pressure is now on Paramount to prove the big financial outlay is worth it,” said Coatsworth.</p><h2 id=\"concerns-of-editorial-shifts\">Concerns of editorial shifts</h2><p>The proposed combination, which will still need the green light from both Warner shareholders and regulators, poses both antitrust concerns and questions of political influence.</p><p>A merger between the two companies would put CNN under the same roof as CBS, which has already seen significant editorial shifts under new Skydance ownership. Paramount took steps to appeal to more conservative viewers in its news operations, notably with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. And if the company’s takeover bid of Warner is successful, critics warn similar shifts could happen to CNN, a network that has long attracted ire from Trump.</p><p>“Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get‑go,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.</p><p>Top Democratic lawmakers have also sounded the alarm about the Republican president’s ties to companies, such as Paramount, and potential consequences of growing corporate power.</p><p>“A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime antitrust hawk, said in a statement on Thursday night. She also called a potential Paramount-Warner combo an “antitrust disaster”.</p><p>How regulators will respond to a Warner-Paramount deal remains to be seen. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so, too.</p><p>Warner shareholders will have to be convinced, too. But Paramount is taking on billions of dollars in debt to finance its offer — something critics have warned could only increase the likelihood of potential job losses and other restructuring down the road. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have also provided equity for the offer, drawing added scrutiny.</p></div></div></body></html>"
