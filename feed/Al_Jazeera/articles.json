To the right of the main entrance is a supply room with diminishing medical supplies. On the other side is an ambulance that Makata says is now rarely used.</p><p>Health posts like this were set up to serve remote communities and alleviate pressure on district hospitals. They were crucial in providing communities with basic healthcare, antenatal care, family planning and vaccines.</p><p>The clinic in Mulanje used to see dozens of women a day, providing maternal care, including helping women give birth, dispensing medicines and, when needed, transport to the hospital. But now, since funds were cut, it is open only around once every two weeks, stretching its supplies for as long as it can and unable to regularly transport visiting healthcare workers.</p><p>Health posts like this are facing closure – 20 have already shuttered in the country – due to the Trump administration cutting United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding in February. This is forcing the country’s health system to withdraw critical services, placing further stress on hospitals, and leaving thousands of women and children without needed care in a region burdened by poverty and long distances to hospitals.</p><p>Makata, a nursing officer specialising in maternal and newborn care, usually based at the district hospital, says she used to visit the post two or three times a week. Now she rarely comes and no longer sees most of the patients she used to care for.</p><p>“Most of the women who relied on this post now find the distance to access a district hospital too far,” she tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>It would take a large chunk of a day, travelling on the bumpy dirt roads of Mulanje district, to reach one. That long visit “takes them away from their day-to-day activities, which bring income or food to their table,” she explains.</p><p>Many cannot afford to do that and now go without care.</p><p>“They are failing to get the ideal treatment for antenatal care services, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy,” Makata says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121840\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121840\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3665-1763738869-rotated-e1765274404509.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ireen Makata, a nursing officer and safe motherhood coordinator at Musa Community Health Post in Mulanje [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"baby-and-mother-in-jeopardy\">‘Baby and mother in jeopardy’</h2><p>USAID funding was all-encompassing. It funded remote medical outposts, covering everything from the training of new staff and the provision of drugs and supplies for pregnant women to petrol for ambulances.</p><p>The US government provided close to 32 percent of Malawi’s total health budget before the cuts.</p><p>USAID funded the health posts through a programme called <a href=\"https://imaworldhealth.org/momentum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MOMENTUM</a> in 14 of Malawi’s 28 districts, starting in 2022, helping strengthen existing clinics and set up new ones. As of 2024, there were 249 posts. The programme also provided medical outreach to communities and equipment. About $80m was being invested in the programme by Washington.</p><p>Early this year, US President Donald Trump issued stop-work orders on USAID-funded programmes as part of an executive order to pause and re-evaluate foreign aid.</p><p>With that move, MOMENTUM was shelved, and the two dozen mobile posts were shuttered as a result. Medical trainees were left in limbo, and life-saving equipment was sold off in fire sales by Washington.</p><p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) still provides technical and financial support to several remote districts for maternal and newborn health, but the available resources are not enough to cover the sites funded by MOMENTUM. There are fears that the UNFPA sites will run out of resources and supplies in the coming months.</p><p>In the wake of Trump’s funding cuts, health experts in Malawi have raised urgent concerns that new mothers and children will face the greatest impact, with many lives potentially lost as a result.</p><p>Makata has set up a WhatsApp group for women to contact her with concerns and questions, but she is frustrated that she cannot work as she used to.</p><p>“We would go to where people resided and give them permanent and long-term care,” she says, referring to the posts. “It’s not easy for me to see this. We can’t help those who need the services the most.”</p><p>Massitive Matekenya, a community leader for the Musa community in Mulanje district, dressed in a black blazer and oversized chequered-green tie, is at the vacant Mulanje health post.</p><p>These days, he says, it is hard to put on a brave face for the people he represents.</p><p>“Women in our community are now giving birth on the way to the district hospital since it’s such a long distance away,” says Matekenya. “That puts baby and mother in jeopardy with the potential of the mother bleeding out.”</p><p>Matekenya struggles to boost morale as he is constantly faced with community anger over the fact that medical outreach has ended.</p><p>He says a 40-year-old woman from his community recently died from malaria. “She had no quick referral to the nearest health facility due to issues of transport,” Matekenya says, noting that the community reached out to a politician but that his assistance came too late.</p><p>“I’m worried,” he says. “With family planning services not being offered any more, we are expecting to see a spike in pregnancies, and we are anticipating a possible rise in maternal deaths.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121825\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121825\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121825\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3520-1763738700-rotated-e1765274778184.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121825\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Female patients recovering or awaiting treatment for obstetric fistula at the Bwaila Fistula Centre in Lilongwe [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"impact-on-fistula-care\">Impact on fistula care</h2><p>In a health clinic in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe, a woman dressed in black with a golden brooch shuffles from hall to hall. Margaret Moyo is tending to her daily responsibilities as head coordinator at the Bwaila Fistula Centre.</p><p>Obstetric fistula occurs when a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum is formed during an obstructed and extended labour. Women who do not receive medical treatment can be left incontinent.</p><p>Beyond the physical pain, women suffering from obstetric fistula also face social stigma due to the constant leaking and are often ostracised from their communities.</p><p>The Bwaila Fistula Centre receives more than 400 patients a year from all over the country, as well as from districts in neighbouring Mozambique. It has 45 beds, one doctor and 14 specialised nurses, and some 30 patients were at the centre when Al Jazeera visited in August.</p><p>With fewer resources, individuals will not be seen as often during pregnancy, which could lead to undetected maternal health issues, including more cases of fistula, Moyo argues. She is also concerned that conversations around prevention and education will take a backseat.</p><p>“The focus should be on training midwives, access to care and education to delay pregnancy in younger women since they are often most at risk of fistula,” says Moyo.</p><p>Before the USAID cuts, Malawi’s government had already forecast a $23m shortfall for reproductive, maternal, and newborn health funding for 2025 owing to drops in foreign aid.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3578-1763738815-rotated-e1765274691904.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Margaret Moyo, head coordinator at the Bwaila Fistula Centre in Lilongwe [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-am-able-to-help-them\">‘I am able to help them’</h2><p>For the past five years, Moyo has been running what she calls an “ambassador” programme at her facility. Patients who undergo successful fistula repair and are reintegrated into their communities are trained and sent out into their communities.</p><p>So far, 120 fistula survivors have become patient ambassadors who educate through community outreach to bring in new patients for treatment.</p><p>One such ambassador is Alefa Jeffrey. Wearing a grey “Freedom from Fistula Foundation” T-shirt, the 36-year-old mother of four crosses her arms and gazes towards the floor as she talks about being ostracised after she gave birth and developed a fistula.</p><p>“I wasn’t allowed to go to church because the other girls made fun of me and said I smelled bad because I was leaking urine and stool,” she says. “My family told me to go to a traditional healer, but he wasn’t able to help.”</p><p>Jeffrey could deal with the physical pain, but she was tormented by the negative interactions with friends and family.</p><p>“I got used to dealing with fistula, but it was what people were saying that was giving me the most pain,” recounts Jeffrey, who says she even contemplated suicide.</p><p>But she also started looking for answers, asking the traditional healer and then eventually meeting an ambassador who came to her community to speak to women.</p><p>Having successfully undergone treatment, involving surgery and follow-up patient and educational care, Jeffrey now advocates for fistula education.</p><p>She has set up a WhatsApp group for people to chat with her for information about the condition. She has also brought in 39 mothers from her community to the clinic.</p><p>“I’m an expert now. I’m able to convince people to come, which isn’t easy,” says Jeffrey. “Some women have lived with a fistula for so long they don’t believe they can be repaired, and they have already given up, but I am able to help them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3893-1763738989-rotated-e1765274144588.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patients await treatment for various ailments at the Nsanje District Hospital [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"lessons-from-the-past-we-didn-t-panic\">Lessons from the past: ‘We didn’t panic’</h2><p>Although health experts are worried about the future of a system without USAID in a country where more than 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, government leaders say they have been there before.</p><p>Back in 2017, during his first presidency, Trump halted funding for the <a href=\"/news/2017/4/4/us-ends-funding-for-united-nations-population-fund\">UNFPA and several groups</a> that provided family planning. Malawi’s government approached NGOs and other countries to alleviate the gaps in funding.</p><p>Through community and grassroots innovations, they believe they can weather the storm again.</p><p>“We didn’t panic when we heard about the USAID cuts,” says Dr Samson Mndolo, Malawi’s secretary of health. “Instead, we looked at how to be more efficient and get more services for our money.</p><p>“We looked at areas where we could maximise resources, so for example if an officer goes to a community to do immunisations, they can now provide family planning services in the same trip too.”</p><p>Sitting in his office in the Lilongwe City Council building behind an organised desk, Mndolo discusses the challenges.</p><p>“As soon as the stop-work orders came out, we lost close to 5,000 health workers. The majority of these are what we call HIV diagnostic assistants,” he says, referring to the fallout from the USAID cuts. “We are looking now to push towards a health system that is more community-based and not necessarily hospital-based.” In such a system, doctors and health workers from central hospitals would be dispatched more to remote communities, and regular community outreach would become part of their remit, requiring them to perform a wider array of services.</p><p>Mndolo and his colleagues are setting up online initiatives and WhatsApp chat groups to field questions from remote patients. He remains optimistic about Malawi’s health system and says the worst thing the country can do now is to lose hope.</p><p>“Each crisis is an opportunity. This gives us a chance to strengthen the system and retrain our workforce and digital health systems,” he says.</p><p>“We are not naive. This will take some time, but once we get a hold of that as a nation, we can be better with time; that is the opportunity that is there for us.”</p><p>Despite such reassurance, those in remote communities say they feel isolated.</p><p>Tendai Kausi, a 22-year-old mother from the Musa community in the Mulanje district, still goes to the remote health post for help with her four-year-old son, Saxton. But because of the cuts and closures, many women from her community do not, and she has seen new mothers carry pregnancies in their isolated villages – far from healthcare and without routine checks.</p><p>“This is not good for the development of our country,” she says.</p><p>“My child will be affected because the services here will not get better,” Kausi says. “I feel very sad for my community.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121831\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121831\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3531-1763738771.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patients at the Bwaila Fistula Centre [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

The wealthiest are not necessarily the highest earners, highlighting the persistent divide between what people earn and what they own.</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong> includes the total value of a person’s assets-such as savings, investments or property, after subtracting their debts.</p><p>In 2025, the wealthiest 10 percent of the world’s population owned 75 percent of global wealth, the middle 40 percent held 23 percent, and the bottom half controlled only 2 percent.</p><p>Since the 1990s, the wealth of billionaires and centi-millionaires has grown by about 8 percent each year, almost twice the rate of the bottom half of the world’s population.</p><p>The wealthiest 0.001 percent – fewer than 60,000 multimillionaires – now control three times more wealth than half of humanity. Their share has climbed from almost 4 percent in 1995 to more than 6 percent today.</p><p>The poorest have made small gains, but these are overshadowed by the rapid accumulation at the very top, resulting in a world where a tiny minority holds extraordinary financial power, while billions still struggle for basic economic security.</p><p><strong>Income</strong> is measured using pre-tax earnings, after accounting for pension and unemployment insurance contributions.</p><p>In 2025, the richest 10 percent of the world received 53 percent of global income, the middle 40 percent received 38 percent, and the bottom 50 percent earned just 8 percent.</p><p>For example, if the world comprised 10 people and total global income was $100, then the richest person would receive $53, the next four people would collectively earn $38, and the remaining five people would divide $8 among them.</p><h2 id=\"how-is-wealth-and-income-divided-regionally\">How is wealth and income divided regionally?</h2><p>Inequality looks very different around the world. A person’s birthplace remains one of the strongest factors in determining how much they earn and the wealth they can build. However, the regions also include poor and wealthy countries, and figures in the report are averages.</p><p>In 2025, the average wealth of people in North America and Oceania, which the report has grouped together, stood at 338 percent of the world’s average, making it the wealthiest region globally. Income share stood at 290 percent of the world’s average, also the highest in the world.</p><p>Europe and East Asia followed, remaining above the world average, while vast parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East remained far below the global average.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4162591\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4162591\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4162591\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Income-and-wealth-inequality-across-regions-Dec9-2025-1765292712.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE- Income and wealth inequality across regions-Dec9-2025-1765292712\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4162591\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Global inequality paints a stark picture, but the scale of wealth and income gaps can vary widely from one country to another.

The top 10 percent earn 66 percent of total income, while the bottom half receives only 6 percent.</p><p>Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia show a similar trend, where the richest 10 percent receive nearly 60 percent of earnings.</p><p>European countries offer a more balanced picture. In Sweden and Norway, the bottom 50 percent earn about 25 percent of total income, while the top 10 percent receive less than 30 percent.</p><p>Many developed economies, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, fall in the middle. The top 10 percent earn roughly 33-47 percent of total income, while the bottom half takes 16-21 percent.</p><p>In Asia, income distribution is mixed. Countries like Bangladesh and China have a more balanced structure, whereas India, Thailand, and Turkiye remain top-heavy, with the richest 10 percent earning more than half of all income.</p><p>The table below shows where income is divided most unequally.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-the-highest-wealth-inequality\">Which countries have the highest wealth inequality?</h2><p>When it comes to wealth inequality, once again, South Africa tops the list. The top 10 percent control 85 percent of personal wealth, leaving the bottom 50 percent with negative shares – meaning their debt exceeds assets.</p><p>Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia show a similar pattern, with the richest grabbing 70 percent or more, while the poorest receive barely 2–3 percent.</p><p>European countries such as Italy, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands are relatively more balanced. Here, the middle 40 percent capture about 45 percent, and the bottom half takes a slightly larger share, though the top 10 percent still dominate. However, Sweden and Poland’s bottom 50 percent have negative shares in wealth.</p><p>Even wealthy nations like the United States, UK, Australia, and Japan are far from equal. The top 10 percent earn more than half of the total income, while the bottom half is left with just 1–5 percent.</p><p>Emerging economies in Asia – including China, India and Thailand – also show stark inequalities.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The catastrophic violence in Gaza has unfolded within an international system that was never designed to restrain the geopolitical ambitions of powerful states. Understanding why the United Nations has proved so limited in responding to what many regard as a genocidal assault requires returning to the foundations of the post–World War II order and examining how its structure has long enabled impunity rather than accountability.</p><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"1054\">After World War II, the architecture for a new international order based on respect for the UN Charter and international law was agreed upon as the normative foundation of a peaceful future. Above all, it was intended to prevent a third world war. These commitments emerged from the carnage of global conflict, the debasement of human dignity through the Nazi Holocaust, and public anxieties about nuclear weaponry.</p><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"1054\">Yet, the political imperative to accommodate the victorious states compromised these arrangements from the outset. Tensions over priorities for world order were papered over by granting the Security Council exclusive decisional authority and further limiting UN autonomy. Five states were made permanent members, each with veto power: the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and China.</p><p data-start=\"1056\" data-end=\"1951\">In practice, this left global security largely in the hands of these states, preserving their dominance. It meant removing the strategic interests of geopolitical actors from any obligatory respect for legal constraints, with a corresponding weakening of UN capability. The Soviet Union had some justification for defending itself against a West-dominated voting majority, yet it too used the veto pragmatically and displayed a dismissive approach to international law and human rights, as did the three liberal democracies.</p><p data-start=\"1056\" data-end=\"1951\">In 1945, these governments were understood as simply retaining the traditional freedoms of manoeuvre exercised by the so-called Great Powers. The UK and France, leading NATO members in a Euro-American alliance, interpreted the future through the lens of an emerging rivalry with the Soviet Union. China, meanwhile, was preoccupied with a civil war that continued until 1949.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Three aspects of this post-war arrangement shape our present understanding.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">First, the historical aspect: Learning from the failures of the League of Nations, where the absence of influential states undermined the organisation’s relevance to questions of war and peace. In 1945, it was deemed better to acknowledge power differentials within the UN than to construct a global body based on democratic equality among sovereign states or population size.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Second, the ideological aspect: Political leaders of the more affluent and powerful states placed far greater trust in hard-power militarism than in soft-power legalism. Even nuclear weaponry was absorbed into the logic of deterrence rather than compliance with Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which required good-faith pursuit of disarmament. International law was set aside whenever it conflicted with geopolitical interests.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Third, the economistic aspect: The profitability of arms races and wars reinforced a pre–World War II pattern of lawless global politics, sustained by an alliance of geopolitical realism, corporate media, and private-sector militarism.</p><h2 id=\"why-the-un-could-not-protect-gaza\">Why the UN could not protect Gaza</h2><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">Against this background, it is unsurprising that the UN performed in a disappointing manner during the two-plus years of genocidal assault on Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">In many respects, the UN did what it was designed to do in the turmoil after October 7, and only fundamental reforms driven by the Global South and transnational civil society can alter this structural limitation. What makes these events so disturbing is the extremes of Israeli disregard for international law, the Charter, and even basic morality.</p><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">At the same time, the UN did act more constructively than is often acknowledged in exposing Israel’s flagrant violations of international law and human rights. Yet, it fell short of what was legally possible, particularly when the General Assembly failed to explore its potential self-empowerment through <a href=\"https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/uniting-for-peace-and-the-role-of-the-general-assembly-in-armed-conflict/\">the Uniting for Peace resolution</a> or the <a href=\"/opinions/2023/10/31/where-is-the-responsibility-to-protect-in-gaza\">Responsibility to Protect norm</a>.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">Among the UN’s strongest contributions were the near-unanimous judicial outcomes at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on genocide and occupation. On genocide, the ICJ granted South Africa’s request for provisional measures concerning genocidal violence and the obstruction of humanitarian aid in Gaza. A final decision is expected after further arguments in 2026.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">On occupation, responding to a General Assembly request for clarification, the Court issued a historic advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, finding Israel in severe violation of its duties under international humanitarian law in administering Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. It ordered Israel’s withdrawal within a year. The General Assembly affirmed the opinion by a large majority.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">Israel responded by repudiating or ignoring the Court’s authority, backed by the US government’s extraordinary claim that recourse to the ICJ lacked legal merit.</p><p data-start=\"4913\" data-end=\"5489\">The UN also provided far more reliable coverage of the Gaza genocide than was available in corporate media, which tended to amplify Israeli rationalisations and suppress Palestinian perspectives. For those seeking a credible analysis of genocide allegations, the Human Rights Council offered the most convincing counter to pro-Israeli distortions. A Moon Will Arise from this Darkness: Reports on Genocide in Palestine, containing the publicly submitted reports of the special rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, documents and strongly supports the genocide findings.</p><p data-start=\"5491\" data-end=\"6286\">A further unheralded contribution came from UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, whose services were essential to a civilian population facing acute insecurity, devastation, starvation, disease, and cruel combat tactics. Some 281 staff members were killed while providing shelter, education, healthcare, and psychological support to beleaguered Palestinians during the course of Israel’s actions over the past two years.</p><p data-start=\"5491\" data-end=\"6286\">UNRWA, instead of receiving deserved praise, was irresponsibly condemned by Israel and accused, without credible evidence, of allowing staff participation in the October 7 attack. Liberal democracies compounded this by cutting funding, while Israel barred international staff from entering Gaza. Nevertheless, UNRWA has sought to continue its relief work to the best of its ability and with great courage.</p><p data-start=\"6288\" data-end=\"6495\">In light of these institutional shortcomings and partial successes, the implications for global governance become even more stark, setting the stage for a broader assessment of legitimacy and accountability.</p><h2 id=\"the-moral-and-political-costs-of-un-paralysis\">The moral and political costs of UN paralysis</h2><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">The foregoing needs to be read in light of the continuing Palestinian ordeal, which persists despite numerous Israeli violations, resulting in more than 350 Palestinian deaths since the ceasefire was agreed upon on October 10, 2025.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">International law seems to have no direct impact on the behaviour of the main governmental actors, but it does influence perceptions of legitimacy. In this sense, the ICJ outcomes and the reports of the special rapporteur that take the international law dimensions seriously have the indirect effect of legitimising various forms of civil society activism in support of true and just peace, which presupposes the realisation of Palestinian basic rights – above all, the inalienable right of self-determination.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">The exclusion of Palestinian participation in the US-imposed Trump Plan for shaping Gaza’s political future is a sign that liberal democracies stubbornly adhere to their unsupportable positions of complicity with Israel.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">Finally, the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 2803 in unacceptably endorsing the Trump Plan aligns the UN fully with the US and Israel, a demoralising evasion and repudiation of its own truth-telling procedures. It also establishes a most unfortunate precedent for the enforcement of international law and the accountability of perpetrators of international crimes.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">In doing so, it deepens the crisis of confidence in global governance and underscores the urgent need for meaningful UN reform if genuine peace and justice are ever to be realised.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

We know the rolling hills to be unpredictable, and from time to time, there have been mudslides and homes destroyed by the rainfall. Now the roads are impassable. We do not have the essentials, nor any hope of overcoming the cyclone’s impact,” Muttupillai told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"homes-and-livelihoods-gone\">‘Homes and livelihoods gone’</h2><p>Tea is a key Sri Lankan export and the second largest source of its export revenue after apparels. Ranked the world’s fourth-largest tea exporter by value, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Sri Lanka is globally known for its unique tea blends and value-added products such as tea bags and packaged tea, often commanding higher prices.</p><p>Despite economic challenges and political upheavals, the country’s tea industry has retained an annual revenue of $1.3bn in recent years, with a projected revenue of $1.5bn by the end of the year.</p><p>However, the cyclone-induced floods and landslides uprooted many fully grown tea plantations, destroyed roads and railway lines, and affected the delivery of essentials, such as fertilisers for crops. Thousands of plantation workers have been rendered homeless.</p><p>“Nothing we ever faced could have prepared us for what we endured last week. It has killed our hopes of being able to continue living and working in the plantations. Our homes and livelihoods are gone,” said Muttupillai.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Senthilnathan Palansamy, 34, who works at a tea plantation in Badulla in Uva province, says the cyclone buried entire hamlets under the soil, forcing him to consider a shift in his livelihood.</p><p>“The plantations are unsafe. There will not be any work for several months. We will have to snap out of plantation lives and work somewhere else,” he told Al Jazeera from a government shelter where he has taken refuge along with his 30-year-old wife Mariappan Sharmila, also a tea plucker, and their two children.</p><p>Prabath Chandrakeerthi, Sri Lanka’s commissioner general of essential services, last week estimated the total economic losses caused by the cyclone to be approximately $6bn, which is almost 3.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>In the tea industry, preliminary estimates predict an output decline of up to 35 percent, according to a member of a presidential committee on cyclone recovery, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. He said the plantation community would be especially hit.</p><p>“The plantation sector has faced many challenges in recent years. The cyclone’s impact will take some time to recover.

On Friday, the global lender said it was considering a request by the Sri Lankan government for a $200m fund on top of the $347m tranche due later this month for post-cyclone relief works.</p><p>Moreover, Sri Lanka’s current public debt stands at nearly $100bn, 99.5 percent of its GDP, leaving barely any room for further financial shocks. But the cyclone has exacerbated the country’s economic vulnerabilities, which threaten its exports and domestic food availability, say the experts.</p><p>Dhananath Fernando, chief executive at Advocata Institute, an independent think tank in Sri Lanka, believes the economic devastation caused by Ditwah is at par with what happened during the catastrophic <a href=\"/gallery/2024/12/26/memorials-held-across-asia-to-mark-20-years-of-devastating-tsunami\">2004 tsunami</a>, which killed more than 35,000 people.</p><p>However, Fernando says, the impact of the cyclone is likely to be harsher as he predicts a sharp increase in consumer prices due to the disruption of supply chains.</p><p>“The cyclone has dealt a heavy blow, and this shock will significantly reduce overall growth, not just our export capacity, but also local consumption. The export basket will reflect the shock, reducing foreign earnings, vital to keep the economy afloat,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4144758\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4144758\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4144758\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Severe-floods-across-Asia-kill-Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Sri-Lanka-December-2-1764667162.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Severe floods across Asia kill Indonesia Malaysia Thailand Sri Lanka December 2-1764667162\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4144758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Fernando warned that tea plantation workers would be forced to shift to other professions – “inevitable, considering the level of shock”, as he put it – adding that the shift would not be good for the economy.</p><p>“Sri Lanka’s approach to debt sustainability is founded on economic development. Our focus is to repay debt by growing the economy. For this to happen, we cannot afford people to shift from the plantations in search of other options,” he said.</p><p>In October, the Tea Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (TEASL) had set a target of $1.5bn in export earnings for 2025, a slight increase from $1.43bn in 2024. The projection was supported by a global rise in demand for more value-added products such as tea packs and bags.</p><p>But a source at TEASL told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity that the target may not be feasible now due to the cyclone’s impact on tea-growing highlands. “Destruction to the sector is so vast, and it has dealt a huge blow to an industry that was picking up. Rebuilding will require both time and resources,” he said.</p><p>Omar Rajarathnam, executive director of Factum, another think tank based in Colombo, said the government should consider external shocks, given the island’s high vulnerability to extreme weather and climate crisis, before setting up revenue targets in sectors like tea.</p><p>“Even if we did not face a disaster of this magnitude, extreme weather should be factored in as part of industry preparedness, and projections should include multiple scenarios and mitigation methods,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As the South Asian country recovers from the deadly cyclone, many tea plantation workers say they are lucky to be alive.</p><p>“The tea plantations are now like wastelands. The crops are devastated, homes destroyed, and we have lost so many people. I don’t know whether we would ever recover,” Palansamy’s wife, Sharmila, told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Venezuela’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/nobel-peace-prize-2025-maria-corina-machado\">Maria Corina Machado</a> ultimately received the prize.</p><p>FairSquare said it wants FIFA’s independent committee to review Infantino’s actions.</p><p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch also criticised FIFA’s awarding of the prize to Trump, saying his administration’s “appalling human rights record certainly does not display exceptional actions for peace and unity”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Disciplinary action from the FIFA Ethics Committee can include a warning, a reprimand and even a fine. Compliance training can also be ordered, while a ban can be levied on participation in football-related activity. But it remains unclear if the ethics committee will take up the complaint.</p><p>Infantino has not immediately responded, and FIFA said it does not comment on potential cases.</p><p>Current FIFA-appointed ethics investigators and judges are seen by some observers to operate with less independence than their predecessors a decade ago, when FIFA’s then-president, Sepp Blatter, was removed from office.</p><p>Trump was on hand for the World Cup 2026 draw ceremony on Friday, along with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p><p>But it was Trump who received the most attention during the event at the Kennedy Centre in Washington, DC.</p><p>During the event, Infantino presented Trump with a gold trophy, a gold medal and a certificate.</p><p>“This is your prize; this is your peace prize,” Infantino told Trump.</p><p>FIFA also played a video that touched on some of Trump’s efforts towards so-called peace agreements.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I know that all the questions will still be about Mo on Friday, ahead of the next game.”</p><p>Liverpool skipper van Dijk said it was an important victory for the players amid intense scrutiny and criticism.</p><p>“Winning is a good feeling, especially in the period we are in – trying to find consistency, something to build in,” the Liverpool defender told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“It was always going to be tough here. It nearly ended 0-0, but it ended positively for us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayern Munich’s 17-year-old midfielder Lennart Karl produced an audacious bit of skill to continue his high-scoring start to life in the Champions League in a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chelsea were beaten in the Champions League for the first time in nearly three months as Belgium forward Charles De Ketelaere set up the equaliser and scored an 83rd-minute winner, and Atalanta came from behind to win 2-1 in Bergamo.</p><p class=\"p1\">Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-2 away on Tuesday and move up to the seventh spot in the Champions League standings, all but ensuring their progress to the knockout stages.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two headers by Jules Kounde, three minutes apart, gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tottenham Hotspur moved up to ninth after beating Slavia Prague 3-0 on an own goal and two penalties, and Marseille held on for a 3-2 win over Union Saint-Gilloise – whose players and fans twice celebrated what they thought were goals to level the score late on, only for both to be ruled out for narrow offsides on video review.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olympiakos broke through a determined Kairat Almaty defence to take a 1-0 win in Kazakhstan and boost their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Such designations can only be made at the federal level.</p><p>Moreover, CAIR is a domestic group with dozens of chapters across the country and hundreds of employees and contributors who are US citizens. It therefore cannot be labelled a foreign group.</p><p>“Material support to terrorism” is a serious criminal charge that would require legal proceedings, and the civil rights group has not yet faced any formal accusations.</p><p>But DeSantis’s announcement echoes a similar move taken by Texas Governor <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation\">Greg Abbott</a>, another Republican, last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desantis-welcomes-lawsuit\">DeSantis ‘welcomes’ lawsuit</h2><p>Founded in 1994, CAIR describes itself as the largest Muslim American civil liberties organisation. The group says it supports “free enterprise, freedom of religion and freedom of expression” and opposes all violence against civilians.</p><p>CAIR has been involved in <a href=\"/news/2019/9/5/us-judge-terrorist-watchlist-violates-constitutional-rights\">major lawsuits</a> defending Muslim civil rights, including cases that made it to the US Supreme Court.</p><p>The group has also filed legal challenges to protect the free speech of US citizens involved in advocacy for Palestinian rights.</p><p>In his executive order on Monday, DeSantis — who launched an unsuccessful <a href=\"/news/2023/5/24/us-elections-2024-who-is-the-republican-contender-ron-desantis\">bid for president</a> last year — also designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a “terrorist” group.</p><p>Israel is mentioned throughout the decree, which says that Hamas is seeking “the eradication of Jews from their historic homeland of Judea and Samaria”, another term for the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">occupied West Bank</a>, a Palestinian territory.</p><p>CAIR has long been a target for right-wing, pro-Israel advocates. The Israeli government itself has asked its Ministry of Defence to consider designating the US nonprofit as a terrorist group.</p><p>In Tuesday’s interview, Rahim criticised DeSantis for pursuing “Israel First” policies, instead of protecting US citizens who might be affiliated with CAIR.</p><p>She underscored that, in 2019, DeSantis held his first official cabinet meeting as Florida governor in Israel, a sign of his close relationship with the country.</p><p>Rahim also slammed the governor for failing to speak out about the plight of his Palestinian American constituents.</p><p>In July, Israeli settlers in the West Bank <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/the-love-he-gave-family-vows-to-keep-sayfollah-musallets-memory-alive\">beat to death</a> Florida ice cream shop worker Sayfollah Musallet, and 16-year-old Florida teen Mohammed Ibrahim was jailed by Israel for more than eight months this year without any public protest from the governor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What type of priorities is he showing the people of Florida when he elevates an ‘Israel First’ policy and ignores the needs of the Floridian people?” Rahim told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, Rahim told reporters that CAIR is proud to be “America First”, highlighting the patriotism of the Muslim group while questioning DeSantis’s loyalties. She said CAIR’s mission was to defend the rights enshrined in the US Constitution.</p><p>The Florida governor has said he would welcome a lawsuit against CAIR’s “terrorist” designation, arguing that a legal challenge would give the state “discovery rights to be able to subpoena” the group’s bank records.</p><p>However, if CAIR were indeed suspected of any criminal activity, state officials should be able to seek a search warrant to investigate its activities, without waiting for a lawsuit.</p><p>Rahim appeared unfazed by the prospect of having the group’s records made public. “We welcome it as well, and we will see him in the courtroom,” she told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"islamophobia-on-the-rise\">Islamophobia on the rise</h2><p>The targeting of CAIR comes amid a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/mamdanis-new-york-victory-sparks-islamophobic-backlash-in-us\">spike in Islamophobia</a> across the country, with politicians, including allies of President Donald Trump, sharpening their anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>Earlier this year, several right-wing Congress members, including Chip Roy and Tommy Tuberville, introduced bills against the establishment of Islamic law — measures that critics consider a red herring.</p><p>Rather than addressing a real issue, rights advocates say the legislation is instead aimed at demonising the Muslim community and portraying Islam as a threat to the Constitution.</p><p>Last month, anti-Muslim activists also marched on the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to a large Muslim community. There, they hurled racist insults at residents and tried to burn the Quran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Muslim American activist Ahmed Bedier, who hosts a radio show in Florida’s Tampa Bay area, said there appears to be a concerted effort by right-wing and pro-Israel advocates to paint Muslims as a threat to distract from the atrocities in Gaza.</p><p>“This definitely feels like there is a coordinated campaign to convince Americans that somehow Muslims are the real enemies — that there’s this Muslim scare: ‘The Muslims are taking over. Sharia is conquering,'” Bedier told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added that targeting CAIR is a “political stunt masquerading as a security policy”.</p><p>So far, the federal government has not commented on DeSantis’s move against CAIR. The US State Department, which has the authority to label groups as “terrorist”, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>But Trump himself has been intensifying his anti-immigrant rhetoric, recently calling the largely Muslim <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">Somali community</a> in the US “garbage”.</p><p>As far back as 2015, when he was campaigning for his first term as president, Trump has called to ban all Muslims from entering the US.</p><p>However, during his re-election campaign last year, Trump actively courted the Muslim community, <a href=\"/news/2024/11/2/why-many-arab-voters-in-michigan-are-flocking-to-trump-ahead-of-us-election\">visiting Dearborn</a> and inviting imams to join him onstage at one of his rallies in Michigan.</p><p>On Tuesday, Rahim called on the US president to side with CAIR against DeSantis.</p><p>“Every person and every politician has a chance and an opportunity to make the right decision,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Even in this case, despite all of President Trump’s history, his remarks, his comments, his bigotry, we would invite him to study the facts and to take a position based on facts and justice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
