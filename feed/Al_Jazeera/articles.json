However, the lawsuit on Friday is the first formal effort to halt construction.</p><p>“The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognised symbol of our powerful American ideals,” Carol Quillen, the president of the organisation, said in a statement.</p><p>“As the organisation charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” she said.</p><p>The filing charges that the Trump administration has violated several laws in beginning construction of the ballroom, including failing to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission; failing to prepare an environmental assessment; and failing to obtain congressional approval for construction in a federal park.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It further states that the totality of the administration’s actions violates the property clause of the US Constitution, which “reserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States”.</p><p>The organisation had previously sent a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts calling for a pause in construction.</p><p>The Trump administration has not immediately responded to Friday’s lawsuit but has maintained that planning and construction of the ballroom have been conducted in compliance with the law.</p><p>In October, Trump aide Steven Cheung, in a post on X, accused the organisation of being “run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games”.</p><h2 id=\"presidential-priority\">Presidential priority</h2><p>Trump, a real estate magnate known for a personal taste that tends toward the garish and gilded, has championed the construction of a new ballroom.</p><p>The president began demolishing a portion of the White House’s east wing in October. He said the ballroom will seat nearly 1,000 people, up from the 650 seats the administration had previously announced.</p><p>The price has ballooned from $200m to $300m, although the administration has maintained that the funding is coming from <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/who-are-the-private-donors-funding-trumps-white-house-ballroom\">private donors</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Trump has sought to transform the powers of the executive office and reshape the wider US government, the construction would be the most lasting physical change in Washington, DC, since he took office.</p><p>Critics have said the ballroom would dwarf the White House’s current 55,000-square-foot (16,764-square-metre) footprint and disrupt the balance of the smaller east and west wings.</p><p>While presidents have made internal renovations and changes to the White House grounds, the building’s exterior has remained largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the early 1800s.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Eindhoven in the UEFA Champions League on November 26.</p><p>The Egyptian forward was benched for the following three Premier League games and, following fierce criticism of the club’s treatment of him, was then dropped from the squad that travelled to Italy to face Inter Milan on Tuesday – a game <a

and the squad before kickoff against Brighton on Saturday.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-liverpool-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Liverpool’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>The Reds have lost six of their games in the Premier League this season – part of a run that saw them lose nine of 12 games in all competitions.</p><p>The struggling title holders have taken five points from their last three league games, however, starting with a 2-0 win at West Ham – the first game of Salah’s exile from the starting lineup.</p><p>The last two matches, though, have seen the Reds held to a 1-1 home draw by newly promoted Sunderland, before the draw at Leeds that led to Salah’s outburst.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-brighton-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Brighton’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>Brighton’s solid season sees them sit two places above Liverpool on goal difference.</p><p>A win for either side could result in them climbing as high as fourth.</p><p>One league win in five to begin the season left the Seagulls sitting slightly perilously, but a run of only two defeats in 11 in the English top flight followed, with six wins in that time.</p><p>That form had expectations flying high on the south coast before two home games,

Liverpool played Brighton?</h2><p>Brighton were 3-2 winners in a Premier League fixture on May 19, in the last encounter between the sides.</p><p>Liverpool twice took the lead in the first half of the game at Amex Stadium through Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai.</p><p>Yasin Ayari’s 31st-minute goal kept the Seagulls in the game at the break before Kaoru Mitoma and Jack Hinshelwood, who netted five minutes from time, turned the game around in the second period.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-the-corresponding-fixture-between-liverpool-and-brighton-last-season\">What happened in the corresponding fixture between Liverpool and Brighton last season?</h2><p>Liverpool were 2-1 winners in the preceding match at Anfield last season, but were forced to come from behind after Ferdi Kadioglu gave the away team the lead in the 14th minute.</p><p>The Seagulls held the lead until the 70th minute, when Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah scored twice in three minutes to set up the win.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This is the 44th meeting between the sides, with Liverpool winning 23 of those encounters and Brighton emerging victorious on 8 occasions.</p><p>The fixture dates back to 1907 and an FA Cup tie at Anfield, where Brighton secured a 1-1 draw. Liverpool made no mistake in the reply, however, winning 3-0 on the south coast.</p><p>Brighton would have to wait a further six games for their first win against Liverpool, a 3-1 victory in the old second division of English football (now known as the Championship).</p><h2 id=\"liverpool-team-news\">Liverpool team news</h2><p>There is a question mark over Alexander Isak’s status for Saturday, with Slot saying the forward picked up a knock in the first half against Inter Milan, and that he will be evaluated on Friday before they decide whether or not he can start.</p><p>Slot is pleased with how Isak and Hugo Ekitike have played together, saying their partnership will continue to improve.</p><p>“The more they play together, the more they will adapt to each other and the better they will cooperate,” Slot said. “I saw promising things from the both of them, it’s only the second time they’ve played together. We will see more of them playing together in the future.”</p><p>Slot will have Federico Chiesa available on Saturday after he recovered from illness, while Wataru Endo and Cody Gakpo are expected to be out for a “few weeks”.</p><h2 id=\"brighton-team-news\">Brighton team news</h2><p>Stefanos Tzimas, Solly March, Adam Webster are all absent with knee injuries, while James Milner is also out for several months with a muscle problem.</p><p>Kaoru Mitoma will have a fitness test as he attempts a comeback from an ankle problem which has kept him out since September.</p><p>Yasin Ayari and Tom Watson could both return from knocks, but both are still being monitored at this stage.</p><h2 id=\"predicted-liverpool-starting-lineup\">Predicted Liverpool starting lineup:</h2><p>Alisson; Gomez, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez; Jones, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Szoboszlai, Isak, Wirtz</p><h2 id=\"predicted-brighton-starting-lineup\">Predicted Brighton starting lineup:</h2><p>Verbruggen; Wieffer, Dunk, van Hecke, Kadioglu; Baleba, Ayari; Minteh, Rutter, De Cuyper; Welbeck</p></div></div></body></html>"

Russian funds held in Europe to help Ukraine defend itself against Moscow.</p><p>The bloc’s governments agreed on Friday to immobilise 210 billion euros ($246 billion) worth of Russian sovereign assets for as long as needed, thus removing the need to vote every six months on extending the asset freeze.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The indefinite freeze eliminates the risk that Hungary and Slovakia, which have better relations with Moscow than other EU states, might in future refuse to roll over the freeze, forcing the EU to return the money to Russia.</p><p class=\"p1\">EU Council President Antonio Costa said on Friday that European leaders had delivered on their “commitment” to immobilise Russian assets “until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused”.</p><p>The indefinite asset freeze is intended to convince a sceptical Belgium to support the EU’s plan to use the frozen Russian cash to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine\">extend a loan of up to 165 billion euros</a> to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027.</p><p>The vast majority of the 210 billion euros in Russian assets, which were frozen as a result of EU sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.</p><p>It is expected that EU leaders gathering at the European Council on December 18 to finalise details of the reparations loan will offer guarantees to Belgium that it will not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Moscow lawsuit prove successful.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/12/4/why-is-belgium-opposed-to-using-russian-assets-to-support-ukraine\">Belgium</a> has said in the past that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks”.</p><h2 id=\"orban-slams-move\">Orban slams move</h2><p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the Kremlin’s closest ally in Europe, railed against the expected decision earlier on Friday, accusing the European Commission, which prepared the measure, “of systematically raping European law”.</p><p>He said the anticipated move means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”</p><p>“It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia’s Central Bank said on Friday that it had filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it claims were caused due to the stripping of Russian control of the frozen billions.</p><p>Euroclear has been subject to Russian lawsuits in Moscow courts since the EU froze the assets in 2022.</p><p>In a separate statement, the Central Bank said the wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine were “illegal, contrary to international law”, and in breach of “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets”.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision meant that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"diplomatic-push\">Diplomatic push</h2><p>The legal battle over frozen funds is taking place as the United States pushes for a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv, which would consist of a framework for peace and separate documents on security guarantees and rebuilding Ukraine.</p><p>This week’s flurry of diplomatic efforts saw Ukraine send back a revised version of the US-drafted framework, which was initially criticised as a Russian wishlist that bowed to Moscow’s maximalist demands and territorial claims in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the US was proposing that a “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/zelenskyy-talks-security-with-us-as-it-pushes-for-free-economic\">free economic zone</a>” be established in the Kyiv-held parts of the eastern Donetsk region, located in the Donbas, that Moscow wants to control.</p><p>He said that Ukrainian troops would have to withdraw from the area, which Moscow has previously described as a “demilitarised zone”.</p><p>On Friday, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said in comments published in Russian business daily Kommersant that it was possible that no troops would be positioned in the Donbas, whether Ukrainian or Russian.</p><p class=\"p1\">But, he added, “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organise life.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Ushakov also expressed the Kremlin’s doubts over efforts to amend the US framework. “We have an impression that this version, which is being put forward for discussion, will be worsened,” he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">On Friday, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that Kyiv had held a new round of talks on reconstruction with US representatives Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, as well as World Bank chief Ajay Banga and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.</p><p class=\"p1\">And the stage was set for more diplomatic activity next week, with Zelenskyy planning to attend the German-Ukrainian business forum in Berlin on Monday, where he will meet numerous European leaders, as well as the heads of the EU and NATO, according to German government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Zelenskyy announced on Telegram on Friday that a working group on security guarantees for Ukraine will meet in Germany, without specifying a date. The group will be headed by Lieutenant-General Andriy Hnatov, with representatives from the army, intelligence services and security forces.</p><p>A French presidency official told reporters on Friday that security guarantees could resemble a NATO Article 5-type clause involving Washington that would seek to reassure Kyiv in case it was once again attacked by Russia.</p><p>The official was cited by Reuters as saying that Ukraine, European powers and the US were still working to outline the contours of a peace deal that could be taken to Russia. “Our goal is to have a common foundation that is solid for negotiation. This common ground must unite Ukrainians, Americans and Europeans,” said the official.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"fighting-continues\">Fighting continues</h2><p>As the push for a deal intensifies, fighting continues to rage on the battlefield. Ukrainian forces said they had retaken parts of the front-line town of Kupiansk in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, and had encircled Russian troops there.</p><p>Zelenskyy released a video visiting the area, where he praised the troops’ efforts and said their results were strengthening Kyiv’s hand diplomatically, as Washington pushes Kyiv to make major territorial concessions to end the nearly four-year war.</p><p>“Today, it is extremely important to achieve results on the front lines so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the clip, which showed him wearing a bulletproof vest at the entrance to Kupiansk.</p><p>Ukraine’s Khartiia Corps of the National Guard said it had liberated several northern districts of Kupiansk, while Russian supply routes had been cut off and several hundred Russian troops were surrounded.</p><p>In other movements on the battlefield, Ukraine said it had retaken the settlements of Kindrashivka and Radkivka in the northern Kharkiv region.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-claims-strikes-in-caspian-sea\">Ukraine claims strikes in Caspian Sea</h2><p>As the warring neighbours intensified their attacks far beyond the front line, Ukraine’s special forces have claimed to have hit two Russian ships transporting weapons and military equipment in the Caspian Sea, in an operation they said was carried out in coordination with a “local resistance movement”.</p><p>The statement on Friday, posted on Telegram, said two vessels – the Composer Rakhmaninoff and the Askar-Sarydzha – had been struck off the coast of the Russian republic of Kalmykia. Both vessels had been sanctioned by the US for transferring military loads between Iran and Russia, it said.</p><p>The statement said the operation had been carried out with the assistance of a resistance movement it named as “Black Spark”, which it said had provided detailed information on the ships’ movements and cargoes.</p><p>It did not provide details on the location and nature of the strike, or the extent of any damage.</p><p>The claim was made a day after a Ukrainian official said the country’s drones had hit a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea for the first time.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels captured a strategic city despite a recent United States-brokered peace agreement.</p><p>M23 has cemented control over Uvira, a key lakeside city in DRC’s South Kivu province that it seized on Wednesday, despite a peace accord that President Donald Trump had called “historic” when <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/trump-hails-great-day-for-the-world-as-drc-rwanda-finalise-peace-deal\">signed</a> in Washington just one week earlier.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Al Jazeera, which is the first international broadcaster to gain access to the city since M23’s takeover, saw residents tentatively returning home after days of violence, amid a heavy presence of rebel fighters on Friday.</p><p class=\"p1\">The day before, M23 fighters combed the streets to flush out remaining Congolese forces and allied militias – known as “Wazalendo” – after taking over key parts of the city.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Nyarushishi refugee camp in Rwanda’s Rusizi district, Akilimali Mirindi told the AFP news agency she fled South Kivu with just three of her 10 children after bombs destroyed her home near the border.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“I don’t know what happened to the other seven, or their father,” the 40-year-old said, describing corpses scattered along escape routes as about 1,000 people reached the camp following renewed clashes this month.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Regional officials said more than 413 civilians have been killed since fighting escalated in early December, with women and children among the dead.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The offensive has displaced about 200,000 people, and threatens to drag neighbouring Burundi deeper into a conflict that has already uprooted more than seven million across eastern DRC, according to United Nations figures.</p><p>Uvira sits on Lake Tanganyika’s northern shore, directly across from Burundi’s largest city, and serves as South Kivu’s interim government headquarters after M23 seized the provincial capital, Bukavu, in February.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Alain Uaykani, who gained access to the city on Friday, reported a tenuous calm and the heavy presence of M23 soldiers but described harrowing scenes on the journey there.</p><p>“Here in Uvira, we have seen different groups of the Red Cross with their equipment, collecting bodies, and conducting burials across the road,” Uaykani said.</p><p>He added that the Al Jazeera crew saw abandoned military trucks destroyed along the road to Uvira, and the remains of people who were killed.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Residents who fled Uvira told AFP of bombardment from multiple directions as M23 fighters battled Congolese forces and their Burundian allies around the port city.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“Bombs were raining down on us from different directions,” Thomas Mutabazi, 67, told AFP at the refugee camp. “We had to leave our families and our fields.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"even-children-were-dying\">‘Even children were dying’</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Refugee Jeanette Bendereza had already escaped to Burundi once this year during an earlier M23 push in February, only to return to DRC when authorities said peace had been restored. “We found M23 in charge,” she said.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">When violence erupted again, she ran with four children as “bombs started falling from Burundian fighters”, losing her phone and contact with her husband in the chaos.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Another refugee, Olinabangi Kayibanda, witnessed a pregnant neighbour killed alongside her two children when their house was bombed. “Even children were dying, so we decided to flee,” the 56-year-old told an AFP reporter.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka announced on Wednesday that Uvira had been “fully liberated” and urged residents to return home.</p><p>Fighting had already resumed even as Trump last week hosted Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame at a widely attended signing ceremony.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The December 4 Washington <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/rwanda-drc-presidents-sign-washington-accord-peace-deal\">agreement obliged</a> Rwanda to cease supporting armed groups, though the M23 was not party to those negotiations and is instead involved in separate Qatar-mediated talks with Kinshasa.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">DRC’s government accused Rwanda of deploying special forces and foreign mercenaries to Uvira “in clear violation” of both the Washington and earlier Doha agreements.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The US embassy in Kinshasa urged Rwandan forces to withdraw, while Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner called for Washington to impose sanctions, saying condemnation alone was insufficient.</p><p>On Friday, the US ambassador to the UN accused Rwanda of leading the region toward war.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Instead of progress toward peace, as we have seen under President Trump’s leadership in recent weeks, Rwanda is leading the region toward more instability and toward war,” Mike Waltz told a Security Council meeting.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We call on Rwanda to uphold its commitments and to further recognise the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s right to defend its territory and its sovereign right to invite Burundian forces onto its territory,” Waltz told the 15-member council. “We are engaging with all sides to urge restraint and to avoid further escalation,” he added.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Rwanda denies backing M23 and blames Congolese and Burundian forces for ceasefire violations.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In a statement on Thursday, President Kagame claimed that more than 20,000 Burundian soldiers were operating across multiple Congolese locations and accused them of shelling civilians in Minembwe.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the escalation “increases the risk of a broader regional conflagration” and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p></div></div></body></html>"
