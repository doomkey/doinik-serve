But the party’s reformist platform, which includes promises to curb the influence of the military and the courts, as well as breaking up economic polices, remains unpalatable to its rivals, who may freeze it out by joining forces to form a government.</p><p>The party is the successor to the Move Forward Party, which won the most seats in the House of Representatives in 2023, but was blocked from power by a military appointed Senate and later dissolved by the Constitutional Court over its call to reform Thailand’s strict royal insult laws.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/will-pro-military-message-bring-thailands-most-hawkish-party-to-power\">The Bhumjaithai</a>, headed by caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, is seen as the main defender and preferred choice of the royalist-military establishment.</p><p>Anutin has only been the prime minister since last September, after serving in the Cabinet of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was forced out of office for an ethics violation regarding the mishandling of relations with Cambodia.

The ultraconservative politician has pledged to “work, work, work” and her style – seen as both playful and tough – has resonated with younger voters.</p><p>She has said she will step down if the LDP fails to win a majority.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Takaichi has put the rising cost of living at the centre of her campaign. The issue is voters’ main concern, with prices rising while real wage growth lags behind inflation, leaving households worse off. Japan also faces longstanding problems with sluggish economic growth. The economy expanded just 1.1 percent last year and is on track to grow by only 0.7 percent in 2026, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Takaichi has promised to suspend the 8 percent sales tax on food for two years to help households cope with rising prices.</p><p>The pledge follows the approval last year of Japan’s largest stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic, a 21.3 trillion yen ($136bn) injection into the economy heavily focused on cost-of-living relief measures, including energy bill subsidies, cash handouts and food vouchers.</p><p>Takaichi has also pledged to revise security and defence policies by December to bolster Japan’s offensive military capabilities, lifting a ban on weapons exports and moving further away from the country’s post-war pacifist principles.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Patrick Fok, reporting from Tokyo, said Takaichi, who is popular with young voters, is hoping to capitalise on her “tremendous popularity” and secure a landslide victory for her coalition.</p><p>“That result – if indeed that’s how it turns out – will mark a remarkable turnaround really for the LDP. Months ago, it was a party in disarray. It had lost its parliamentary majority and was embroiled in a slush fund scandal. So, this turnaround has very much been engineered by Takaichi and what some describe as an almost cult-like popularity,” Fok said.</p><p>Sunday’s vote comes amid record snowfall in parts of the country. With up to 70cm (27.5 inches) of snow forecast in northern and eastern regions, some voters will have to battle blizzards to cast their ballots. The vote is only the third post-war election held in February, with polls typically called during milder months.</p><p>Fok said the heavy snowfall could affect voter turnout, but “there’s no suggestion that’s going to impact the outcome of the election”.</p><p>“A lot of people feel that the opposition parties are not offering anything substantially different. And perhaps they feel that Takaichi’s economic agenda will boost the country in the long term. She has a growth oriented strategy. She wants to develop sectors like AI, and semi conductors, and accelerate defence spending. Voters are perhaps betting on that unlocking the keys to stagnant wage growth in this country, and in turn counter rising inflation that they are experiencing here,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those unable to make the trip are still expected to spend heavily on food, drinks and watch parties across the United States.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Historically, the Super Bowl has been a major economic boon for host cities. For the Bay Area, the event is part of a stretch of three major sporting spectacles lifting the regional economy.</p><h2 id=\"a-local-boost\">A local boost?</h2><p>In 2024, the Bay Area Host Committee commissioned a report forecasting the economic impact of the 2025 NBA All-Star Game, the 2026 Super Bowl, and the FIFA World Cup, all taking place in the region. The report estimated that Sunday’s game alone would generate between $370m and $630m in economic output for the Bay Area.</p><p>Last year’s Super Bowl was hosted in New Orleans, Louisiana. State officials reported the event brought in 115,000 visitors who spent $658m in the city.</p><p>For consumers, Bank of America estimates a 77 percent jump in spending near the stadium. A study analysing spending patterns from Super Bowl games between 2017 and 2025 found that, on game day, spending surged in the postal code closest to the stadium, with the biggest surge in food and parking costs.</p><p>Hosting the game does come with its own expenses for cities.</p><p>In the case of Santa Clara, it is small compared with the forecasted output. Last year, it was projected the city would cost them $6.3m, which includes training personnel for the influx of visitors and other logistical needs. However, other games have cost municipalities much more. When Atlanta hosted the Super Bowl in 2019, it cost the city an estimated $46m.</p><p>In 2023, the day after the game, which was played in Glendale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, was the single busiest at Phoenix Sky Harbor international airport in its history, with more than 200,000 passengers passing through the airport, which is a hub for American Airlines and where budget carriers Southwest Airlines and Frontier maintain a large presence.</p><p>Other cities have used major sporting events to kick off large-scale infrastructure projects. In 2004 – ahead of the Super Bowl in Houston, Texas – METRO, the city’s transit authority, launched its first light rail line just a month before the game. The line, now one of three in the system, runs from downtown Houston to the city’s football stadium.</p><p>Prior to its launch, Houston was the only major metropolitan city in the US without a rail system.</p><p>But not all infrastructure projects paid off. Las Vegas built Allegiant Stadium in the neighbouring suburb of Paradise when the city acquired the Raiders football team from Oakland during the 2020 season. A year later, in 2021, Las Vegas won the bid to host the 2024 Super Bowl. The stadium cost $1.9bn. Nearly $750m came from hotel taxes, but the rest was shouldered by local taxpayers.</p><p>“The economic benefits are relatively short-term, not just in duration, but also in scope. They’re limited to certain industries and specific locations,” Michael Edwards, a professor of sport management at North Carolina State University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The NFL [National Football League] often uses the Super Bowl as a carrot to encourage cities to invest taxpayer money in new stadiums. You’re seeing that dynamic play out in places like Chicago and Cleveland, where officials are considering domed stadiums. Part of that push is almost certainly driven by the possibility of hosting a Super Bowl, which the league dangles as an incentive,” Edwards said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"food-spending\">Food spending</h2><p>For those who can’t make it to the game itself, there is still a surge in Americans heading to bars and restaurants to watch the game or spending money throwing a watch party.</p><p>The National Retail Federation, which has been tracking Super Bowl spending for the last decade, expects that Americans will spend a record $20.2bn, or $94.77 per person, on the big game with 79 percent of that on food.</p><p>Spending has skyrocketed since 2021 when consumers spent $13.9bn, or $74.55 per person. However, that dropped from $17.2bn in 2020 when the Super Bowl happened about a month before the COVID-19 lockdowns in the US began.</p><p>For those hosting a Super Bowl watch party at home, it will cost more than last year to stock up on the quintessential game-day foods. Wells Fargo estimates that hosting 10 people will cost about $140 per person, up from $138 last year.</p><p>Chicken wings, a staple for football fans, are a bright spot for wallets; prices are down 2.8 percent compared with this time last year. Potato chip prices are flat, but dips like salsa have jumped 1.7 percent.</p><p id=\"healthier-options-are-getting-more-expensive-as-well-for-those-opting-for-a-veggie-platter-cherry-tomatoes-are-up-2-percent-celery-has-risen-2-6-percent-and-both-broccoli-and-cauliflower-are-up-4-percent-beer-prices-are-also-climbing-up-1-3-percent-from-a-year-ago\">Healthier options are getting more expensive as well for those opting for a veggie platter. Cherry tomatoes are up 2 percent, celery has risen 2.6 percent, and both broccoli and cauliflower are up 4 percent. Beer prices are also climbing, up 1.3 percent from a year ago.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"advertising-hits-records\">Advertising hits records</h2><p>The Super Bowl is airing on NBC with the network getting a boost in advertising spending for the big game. NBC sold out of advertising spots for the Super Bowl in September for a record $10m on average for a 30-second spot – up from $8m on average last year when the games aired on Fox.</p><p>NBC also benefits from a collection of sporting events all taking part in February that drive up advertising revenue, including from the Winter Olympics. The opening ceremony is on Friday and will run until February 22. NBC has exclusive broadcasting rights for the Olympics in the US.</p><p>“With the resurgence of the Olympic movement, our strongest Sports Upfront in history, the early sell-out of Super Bowl LX, and the remarkable return of the NBA, NBCUniversal has solidified itself as a sports powerhouse, and brands have taken notice,” Mark Marshall, chairman of NBCUniversal’s global advertising and partnerships, said in a release.</p><p>The last time the games were in the same year, back in 2024, the two events were the most-watched events on linear television.</p><p>On Wall Street, the looming sporting events set to air on NBC have sent parent company Comcast’s stock surging up more than 4 percent over the past five days.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I think you will have a new policy in the first half of this year. Don’t hold me to it, but that is roughly the timescale.”</p><p>In September, Coventry set up the “Protection of the Female Category” working group, made up of experts as well as representatives ‌of international federations, to look into how best to protect the female category in sport.</p><p>Before Coventry’s decision, the IOC had long baulked at any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games, instructing international federations in 2021 to come up with their own ‌guidelines. Under current rules, still in force, transgender athletes are eligible to take part in the Olympics once cleared by their respective federations.</p><p>Only a handful of openly ‌transgender athletes have taken part in the Games. New Zealand’s Laurel ⁠Hubbard became the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that assigned at birth when the weightlifter took part in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</p><p>Currently, for example, World Aquatics allows transgender athletes who have transitioned before the age of ‌12 to compete. World Rugby bans all transgender athletes from elite-level competitions.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump has banned transgender athletes from competing in school, college and pro events in the female category in the US, as Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.</p><p>Trump, who signed the “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” order in February, has said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the LA Games.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The fighting created a surge in nationalist sentiment in Thailand during two rounds of armed conflict in July and December, while the clashes also inflicted reputational damage on Anutin’s rivals in Thai politics.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Chief among those who suffered on the political battlefield was the populist Pheu Thai Party, the power base of Thailand’s former prime minister Thaksin and his family.</p><p>Pheu Thai sustained a major hit to its popularity in June when a phone call between its leader, then-Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn, and the strongman of Cambodian politics, Hun Sen, was made public.</p><p>In the June 15 call, Paetongtarn referred to Hun Sen, an erstwhile friend of her father, as “uncle” and promised to “take care” of the issue after the first early clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops, according to Reuters news agency.</p><p>For factions in Thailand’s politics and Thai people, Paetongtarn’s deference to Hun Sen was beyond the pale of acceptable behaviour for a prime minister, especially as she appeared to also criticise Thailand’s military – a major centre of power in a nation of more than 70 million people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hun Sen later admitted to leaking the call and claimed it was in the interest of “transparency,” but it led to the collapse of Paetongtarn’s government. She was then sacked by the constitutional court at the end of August last year, paving the way for Anutin to be voted in as Thailand’s leader by parliament the following month.</p><p>The border conflict with Cambodia has given a major boost to Thailand’s armed forces at a time of “growing popular discontent with the military’s involvement in politics, and with the conservative elite”, said Neil Loughlin, an expert in comparative politics at City St George’s, University of London.</p><p>Anutin’s government focused its political messaging when fighting on the border re-erupted in early December. Days later, he dissolved parliament in preparation for the election.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Bhumjaithai has leaned into patriotic, nationalist messaging,” said Japhet Quitzon, an associate fellow with the Southeast Asia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.</p><p>“Anutin himself has promised to protect the country at campaign rallies, signalling strength in the face of ongoing tensions with Cambodia. He has vowed to retaliate should conflict re-emerge and will continue protecting Thai territorial integrity,” Quitzon said.</p><h3>‘War against the scam army’</h3><p>During the fighting, Thailand took control of several disputed areas on the border and shelled Cambodian casino complexes near the boundary, which it claimed were being used by Cambodia’s military.</p><p>Bangkok later alleged some of the casino complexes, which have ties to Cambodian elites, were being used as centres for online fraud – known as cyber scams – a major problem in the region, and that Thai forces were also carrying out a “war against the scam army” based in Cambodia.</p><p>Estimates by the World Health Organization say the conflict killed 18 civilians in Cambodia and 16 in Thailand, though media outlets put the overall death toll closer to 149, before both sides signed their most recent ceasefire in late December.</p><p>While the fighting has paused for now, its impact continues to reverberate across Thai politics, said the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s Napon.</p><p>Pheu Thai is still reeling from the leaked phone call between Paetongtarn and Hun Sen, while another Thai opposition group, the People’s Party, has been forced to temper some of its longstanding positions demanding reform in the military, Napon said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293938\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293938\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293938\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-07T040833Z_1037875837_RC2AGJAYT47T_RTRMADP_3_THAILAND-ELECTION-1770447115.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra shakes hands with Pheu Thai Party supporters during a major rally event ahead of the February 8 election, in Bangkok, Thailand, February 6, 2026.

It is genocide.” He added that the violence has “wounded the conscience of humanity” and exposed the inability of global powers to prevent attacks on civilians.</p><p data-start=\"4230\" data-end=\"4870\">Araghchi warned that the consequences extend far beyond the Palestinian territories. “We are witnessing not only the tragedy of Palestine, but the transformation of the world into a place where the law is replaced by force,” he said, adding that impunity for attacks on civilians risks normalising military domination as a guiding principle of international relations.</p><p data-start=\"4230\" data-end=\"4870\">He also described Israel’s policies as part of a broader Israeli regional strategy, saying the “expansionist project” aims to weaken neighbouring states and enforce “permanent inequality” across the region while allowing Israel to expand its arsenal without meaningful oversight.</p><p data-start=\"4230\" data-end=\"4870\">Israel carried out <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/12/29/all-the-countries-israel-attacked-in-2025-animated-map\">attacks on six countries in 2025</a>: Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Qatar and Iran. It also carried out strikes in Tunisian, Maltese and Greek territorial waters on aid flotillas heading for Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"4872\" data-end=\"5389\">Calling for coordinated international action, Iran’s top diplomat urged governments to impose “comprehensive and targeted sanctions against Israel, including an immediate arms embargo,” alongside the suspension of military and intelligence cooperation, and legal accountability for violations of international law.</p><p data-start=\"4872\" data-end=\"5389\">He stressed that the Palestinian issue is “not only a humanitarian issue … It is a strategic issue,” arguing that regional stability depends on ending occupation and building a system grounded in sovereignty and equality.</p><p data-start=\"4872\" data-end=\"5389\">Speaking to Al Jazeera Arabic exclusively after the forum about talks with the US, Araghchi said the sides have agreed to hold a second round of talks, but the date is not set yet.</p><p>However, he said Tehran and Washington believe it must be held “soon.”</p><p>When asked about the possibility of the war with the US, he said the possibility always exists, but Iran is ready for both peace and war.</p><p>One of his critical statements was a reassurance to the region. Araghchi said Tehran was telling the Americans and countries in the region that Iran would only target US forces stationed in the region in case of a US attack, not the countries themselves.</p><p>“We will not attack neighbouring countries; rather, we will target US bases stationed in them. There is a big difference between the two.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-seeks-to-prevent-the-establishment-of-a-palestinian-state\">Israel seeks to ‘prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state’</h2><p data-start=\"936\" data-end=\"1513\">Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer bin Mohammed Al Thani, chairman of the board of the Al Jazeera Media Network, said in his opening speech that Israel’s assault has become a turning point for the Palestinian issue, warning that the occupation is attempting to permanently alter realities on the ground.</p><p data-start=\"936\" data-end=\"1513\">Addressing the forum, he warned that the “Israeli occupation seeks to reoccupy Gaza by displacing its people … settling parts of it and … the West Bank … to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state”.</p><p data-start=\"1515\" data-end=\"1955\">He also emphasised the heavy toll paid by <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/here-are-the-names-of-the-journalists-israel-killed-in-gaza\">journalists</a> covering the war, saying Al Jazeera “has sacrificed… and paid a heavy and dear price of its correspondents,” noting that reporters “were targeted only because they wanted to report the truth to the world”.</p><p data-start=\"1515\" data-end=\"1955\">Despite the risks, the network remains committed to “reporting the truth to the world,” he said, honouring journalists who “provided the ultimate price … for the sake of the truth”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-threat-to-the-red-sea\">Israeli threat to the Red Sea</h2><p data-start=\"1957\" data-end=\"2403\">Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, also speaking at the forum, warned that Israel’s Gaza war and escalating tensions in the Red Sea are unfolding alongside a broader breakdown in the international system.</p><p data-start=\"1957\" data-end=\"2403\">He said the Palestinian crisis represents “another level of inhumane engagement in the history of the world,” cautioning that the failure to secure an “equitable … durable solution based on the two-state solution” risks prolonging instability across the region and beyond.</p><p data-start=\"2405\" data-end=\"2841\">Placing the conflict within a wider geopolitical context, Mohamud warned that the foundations of global governance are weakening.</p><p data-start=\"2405\" data-end=\"2841\">“Key among the global concerns is the weakening of the established rules based on international order. That order is not intact any more,” he said, adding that the institutions created after World War II “are under grave threat” as “the mighty is right” increasingly replaces adherence to international law.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3505\">He also linked regional instability to tensions in the Red Sea, warning that interference “like in the case of Israel … interfering with Somalia’s sovereign and territorial integrity” threatens trade routes and African security.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3505\">Calling Israel’s recognition of <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/what-does-israel-want-in-somaliland\">Somaliland</a> “reckless and fundamentally wrong and illegal action under international law,” he said the move “undermines stability, security and trade in a way that affects the whole of Africa, the Red Sea and the wider world”.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3505\">In an exclusive <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/1/somali-president-israel-deal-with-somaliland-tied-to-hosting-palestinians\">interview with Al Jazeera in January</a>, Mohamud said that the breakaway region of Somaliland had agreed to accept displaced Palestinians being relocated there in exchange for recognition. Somaliland officials rejected the allegations.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3505\">Mohamud on Saturday urged governments and international institutions to “return to the path of common purpose and agreed universal rules” to prevent the erosion of multilateral cooperation.</p><h2 id=\"historic-global-rupture\">Historic global rupture</h2><p data-start=\"5391\" data-end=\"5766\">Burhanettin Duran, Turkiye’s head of the Directorate of Communications, said Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza reflects a deeper transformation of global politics, warning that the erosion of international institutions has enabled atrocities to unfold with limited accountability.</p><p data-start=\"5391\" data-end=\"5766\">“[The] world is not just transitioning, it has already transitioned. We are living through the consequences of a historic rupture,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"5768\" data-end=\"6102\">Describing Gaza as the clearest manifestation of this breakdown, Duran said: “Genocide, in the case of Israeli genocide … has returned to the centre of international politics, not as an exception, but as a tolerated reality.” He added that institutions designed to prevent such crimes now “fail publicly, repeatedly, and structurally”.</p><p data-start=\"6104\" data-end=\"6579\">Duran also warned that modern conflicts increasingly extend beyond the battlefield, noting that “wars are no longer confined to physical battlefields” but are fought through narratives and digital platforms that shape “what is visible, what is credible, and what disappears”.</p><p data-start=\"6104\" data-end=\"6579\">He argued that justice must become the organising principle of the international system, stressing that “justice produces legitimacy” and that durable stability cannot be imposed through power alone.</p><p data-start=\"6581\" data-end=\"7089\">Outlining Turkiye’s diplomatic approach, Duran said Ankara is pursuing a strategy of “regional ownership,” insisting that “regional problems demand regional solutions,” while highlighting mediation and stabilisation efforts across several conflict zones.</p><p data-start=\"6581\" data-end=\"7089\">“In Gaza, this wave of insecurity is visible in its starkest form – mass devastation, deep trauma, genocide and humanitarian collapse,” he said, urging regional powers to prioritise ending the war and preventing any forced displacement of Palestinians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
