Still, his release has been once again delayed for a period of 30 days, at the request of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who fear he could be deported.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously on Wednesday, a second court hearing was unfolding in Maryland under US District Judge Paula Xinis.</p>\n<p>She has been hearing arguments about Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to El Salvador, as part of a lawsuit filed by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura.</p>\n<p>Given that Trump officials have signalled they plan to deport Abrego Garcia if he is released, Xinis issued a ruling requiring that immigration officials to give him notice of three business days if they initiate removal proceedings.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration, Xinis wrote, has “done little to assure the court that, absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected”.</p>\n<p>Xinis also ordered the government to restore the legal status that Abrego Garcia had previously been under, which allowed him to live and work in Maryland.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring him from being sent back to his home country.</p>\n<p>His lawyers have maintained that Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador as a teenager to avoid gang threats.</p>\n<p>The government acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador had been the result of an “administrative error”.</p>\n<p>Judge Xinis — and later the US Supreme Court — ultimately ruled that the Trump administration had a responsibility to “facilitate” his return to the US.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration doubled down, arguing that Abrego Garcia’s removal was lawful and painting him as a member of MS-13.</p>\n<p>Trump even posted a picture of himself to social media holding a photo of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, with the letters and numbers for “MS-13” digitally superimposed on each finger, next to real tattoos of a smiley face and marijuana leaf.</p>\n<p>“He’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114361211919694573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, falsely, on April 18.</p>\n<p>Judge Xinis had threatened to find the Trump administration in contempt of court for failing to adequately facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, or provide meaningful updates. Officials had argued that they had little power to bring him back, given that he was held in El Salvador.</p>\n<p>But in early June, the Trump administration abruptly announced Abrego Garcia’s return to the US. At the same time, the Justice Department revealed it had obtained an indictment to criminally charge Abrego Garcia.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the government’s case is a video from a November 2022 traffic stop, showing Abrego Garcia driving a Chevrolet Suburban SUV with three rows of seats. A police officer heard in the footage speculates that the nine passengers could be involved in human smuggling, but no charges were brought at that time.</p>\n<p>His lawyers have dismissed the government’s case as “preposterous”.</p>\n<p>Still, before Xinis’s ruling, the lawyers had requested Abrego Garcia remain in custody as he awaits trial, for fear that he might be immediately deported if released.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>While Abrego Garcia cannot be sent to El Salvador again, the Trump administration has maintained he can be legally deported to a third country, even one where he has no personal ties.</p>\n<p>Last month, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could, at least in the short term, continue to deport individuals to such <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/supreme-court-lets-trump-restart-deporting-migrants-to-third-countries\">third-party countries</a> while legal challenges proceed against the practice.</p>\n<p>Some of those third-party countries have included <a href=\"/news/2025/7/5/trump-administration-completes-contentious-deportations-to-south-sudan\">South Sudan</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/us-deports-immigrants-to-african-country-of-eswatini-amid-rights-concerns\">Eswatini</a>, formerly known as Swaziland, both of which have faced accusations of human rights abuses in their prisons.</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security took to the social media platform X on Wednesday to criticise Xinis’s latest ruling.</p>\n<p>“The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] they can’t arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin <a href=\"https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1948104840896266500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, reiterating unproven claims.</p>\n<p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, however, applauded Wednesday’s court decisions.</p>\n<p>“These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government’s lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar’s due process rights,” lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

A 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent known as Humphrey’s Executor holds that the president cannot fire members of an independent board without providing a legitimate justification.</p>\n<p>The commission members also said that their firing would deprive the public of vital expertise and oversight.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice, however, has maintained that preventing the president from firing members of the executive branch undercuts his constitutional authority.</p>\n<p>Even independent agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission fall under the executive branch, the Justice Department pointed out.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s argument was dealt a defeat on July 2, when US District Judge Matthew Maddox issued an order blocking the dismissal of the three Democratic appointees while their case proceeded.</p>\n<p>But Trump’s Justice Department made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority sided with the president in a brief, unsigned order.</p>\n<p>The majority wrote that the government risked greater harm by allowing fired employees to remain in the executive branch than by removing them, even wrongfully, while their court cases proceeded.</p>\n<p>The court’s three left-leaning justices, however, issued a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a11_2cp3.pdf#page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dissent</a> that denounced the ruling as an erosion of the separation of powers. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created by an act of Congress and answers both to the legislature and the president.</p>\n<p>“By allowing the President to remove Commissioners for no reason other than their party affiliation, the majority has negated Congress’s choice of agency bipartisanship and independence,” Kagan wrote.</p>\n<p>She added that the court’s decision on Wednesday was part of a series of rulings that amounted to “an increase of executive power at the expense of legislative authority”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has sought to exercise greater control over federal agencies created and funded by Congress, often using a maximalist interpretation of presidential powers to do so. The Supreme Court, which has six conservative members, has mostly <a href=\"/news/2025/6/27/explosive-us-supreme-court-deals-blow-to-those-challenging-trumps-power\">ruled in favour</a> of such efforts.</p>\n<p>In a similar case in May, the court allowed Trump to remove Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board as their cases moved forward.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court also ruled earlier this month that the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out the Department of Education through a campaign of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/us-supreme-court-gives-nod-to-trumps-push-to-gut-federal-education-agency\">mass firings</a> could move forward.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It will also promote production of new data centres around the US. It will scrap federal regulations that “hinder AI development”, although it is not clear which regulations are in question.</p>\n<p>In a statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the plan will “ensure America sets the technological gold standard worldwide, and that the world continues to run on American technology”.</p>\n<p>The president is expected to announce a series of executive orders which will outline key parts of the plan around 5pm in New York (21:00 GMT).</p>\n<p>“We believe we’re in an AI race … and we want the United States to win that race,” White House AI czar David Sacks told reporters on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The White House says the plan will “counter Chinese influence in international governance bodies” and also will give the US more control over exports of AI technology.</p>\n<p>However, the administration did not offer any details on how it plans to do that.</p>\n<p>The plan outlined by the Trump administration will also include a framework to analyse models built by China to assess “alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship”.</p>\n<p><strong>Free speech in the spotlight </strong></p>\n<p>The plan says that it will also uphold free speech in models that will allow systems to be “objective and free from top-down ideological bias” for organisations wanting to do business with the federal government.</p>\n<p>A senior White House official said the main target was AI models that consider diversity and inclusion, according to The Wall Street Journal, which, experts say, signals the concern is the government’s perceived liberal bias as opposed to an overall bias.</p>\n<p>“The government should not be acting as a Ministry of AI Truth or insisting that AI models hew to its preferred interpretation of reality,” Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“The plan is highly unbalanced, focusing too much on promoting the technology while largely failing to address the ways in which it could potentially harm people.”</p>\n<p>Conservatives have long accused AI chatbots of having a liberal bias, comparable to their comments on legacy media for providing critical coverage of the administration. However, it comes as users of GrokAI, former Trump ally and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk’s AI platform, have accused it of having <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/11/as-millions-adopt-grok-to-fact-check-misinformation-abounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a right-wing lean</a>. Musk’s X AI is part of a $200m package with the Pentagon that has other AI companies, including OpenAI.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p><strong>Building out data centres</strong></p>\n<p>A key focus of the new plan will be to build out new data centers for AI technology as the industry rapidly expands. The administration said that will include streamlining permits for new centre development and the energy production facilities used to power these data centres.</p>\n<p>The plan sidesteps environmental concerns that have been a major criticism of the AI industry. AI “challenges America to build vastly greater energy generation than we have today”, the plan said.</p>\n<p>AI data centres have been tied to increased power consumption and, in turn, greenhouse gas emissions. According Google’s 2024 sustainability report, there was a 48 percent increase in power greenhouse gas emissions since 2019 which, it says, will only become more prevalent.</p>\n<p>“This result was primarily due to increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions. As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,’ <a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the report said</a>.</p>\n<p>The streamlining of permits also comes as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to reverse its scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. That change would remove the legal framework that climate regulations are based on, the Reuters news agency has reported, citing two unnamed sources.</p>\n<p>The reversal would remove the “endangerment finding”, making it easier for the EPA to undo legislation limiting greenhouse gas emissions on energy-producing facilities, including those used to power AI data centres.</p>\n<p>The administration has created environmental review exceptions for data centre construction and will allow expanding access to federal lands for AI development.</p>\n<p>“AI will improve the lives of Americans by complementing their work — not replacing it,” the plan says.</p>\n<p>It, however, comes as employers across the country scrap jobs because of AI. Earlier this month, Recruit Holdings, the parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor, cut 1300 jobs which it directly attributed to AI.</p>\n<p>In June, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that AI is doing 30 to 50 percent of the company’s workload. In February, the tech giant laid off 1,000 employees.</p>\n<p>Analysts say the plan looks promising for investors in the AI sector.</p>\n<p>“This is a watershed moment in the AI revolution, and Trump recognises this AI arms race between the US and China. A big step forward,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>As of 4pm in New York (20:00 GMT), stocks of AI-focused companies had mixed results. NVIDIA was up 2.1 percent; Palantir up 3.6 percent, Oracle up 1.5 percent and Microsoft was up 0.3 percent. On the other hand, Google’s parent company Alphabet was down 0.5 percent.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The Foreign Ministry statement notes that the decision to intervene in the case is based on the “plausibility that the rights of Palestinians to protection against acts of genocide are being irreversibly impaired”.</p>\n<p>The Israeli Embassy in Brasilia said the Brazilian statement used “harsh words that do not fully portray the reality of what is currently happening in Gaza”, while Brazil had also “completely ignored” the role of Hamas.</p>\n<p>Brazil’s National Israeli association CONIB said in a statement in response to Wednesday’s decision: “The breaking of Brazil’s longstanding friendship and partnership with Israel is a misguided move that proves the extremism of our foreign policy.”</p>\n<p>The ICJ has yet to rule on whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, but <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/icj-fails-to-order-ceasefire-but-says-israel-must-prevent-genocide-in-gaza\">issued an order</a> in January 2024, demanding that Israel take action to prevent genocide in the Strip through acts such as allowing greater access to humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>However, pressure has had little impact, and the United States and other Western allies have remained firmly supportive of Israel despite a growing chorus of experts and rights groups warning of systematic rights abuses in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Israel initiated a full blockade in March that barred all aid from Gaza for several months, before allowing a limited resumption of assistance through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group closely tied to Israel and the US.</p>\n<p>Israeli forces have killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">1,000 Palestinians</a> waiting for aid at GHF distribution sites since May, as reports of Palestinians dying of starvation continue to mount.</p>\n<p>United Nations officials have <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/4/ghf-suspends-aid-timeline-of-a-death-trap-in-gaza\">denounced the sites</a> as “death traps”, and said they will not cooperate with the GHF, which supplanted existing international aid groups that Israel has largely barred from operating in Gaza.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Critics say the law strips the agencies of their independence and could allow political interference.</p>\n<p>While Zelenskyy has defended the law as a necessary response to suspected “Russian influence” within the agencies, European Union officials and rights groups say that it contains no specific provisions to target Kremlin-linked operatives and warn it could derail any Ukrainian accession bid to the European Union.</p>\n<p>“I have analysed all concerns,” Zelenskyy wrote on X following a meeting with top government and law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p>Writing about the proposal of the new bill, he said: “We will prepare and submit a bill to the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] that ensures the strength of the rule-of-law system. There will be no Russian influence or interference … and all the norms for the independence of anti-corruption institutions will be in place.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"public-anger-and-european-backlash\">Public anger and European backlash</h2>\n<p>On Tuesday night, thousands of Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv and other major cities in rare wartime protests. More than 1,000 demonstrators defied martial law, which bans large public gatherings, to express their anger at the government, while on Wednesday, more protests took place in the capital.</p>\n<p>“This is complete nonsense from the president’s office,” 20-year-old student Solomiia Telishevska told the news agency Reuters, referring to the law signed by Zelenskyy on Tuesday. “This contradicts what we are fighting for and what we are striving for, namely to [join] the European Union.”</p>\n<p>Cleaning up systemic corruption has long been a core requirement for Ukraine’s EU membership and for unlocking billions in foreign aid. The law’s passage risks alienating Kyiv’s Western allies as the war grinds on.</p>\n<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has demanded “explanations” from Zelenskyy, with a spokesperson confirming on Wednesday that she conveyed “strong concerns about the consequences of the amendments”. Germany’s Johann Wadephul, deputy leader of the Christian Democratic Union, warned on X that the restrictions were “hampering Ukraine’s path to the EU”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anticorruption-bodies-targeted\">Anticorruption bodies targeted</h2>\n<p>The storm erupted days after law enforcement raided NABU offices and arrested an employee on suspicion of spying for Russia. Another employee was accused of illegal business ties to Moscow. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) agency also carried out searches and arrests related to other alleged infractions, including a traffic incident.</p>\n<p>Zelenskyy suggested these incidents justified the law passed on Tuesday, but Ukrainian analysts have warned the changes could erode public trust in Zelenskyy’s leadership during a critical phase of the war.</p>\n<p>NABU was created in 2015 after Ukraine’s 2014 pro-European revolution to tackle deep-rooted government corruption. The agency has investigated multiple high-profile cases, including figures close to Zelenskyy’s administration.</p>\n<p>Transparency International Ukraine denounced the raids as “an attempt by the authorities to undermine the independence of Ukraine’s post-Revolution of Dignity anti-corruption institutions”.</p>\n<p>Some Ukrainians believe the government is protecting loyal insiders at the expense of transparency. “Those who swore to protect the laws and the constitution have instead chosen to shield their inner circle, even at the expense of Ukrainian democracy,” said veteran Oleh Symoroz, who lost both legs in 2022 fighting Russian forces.</p>\n<p>The political firestorm risks creating deeper rifts within Ukraine at a time when unity is vital in Kyiv’s war against Russia. Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties, warned the law could play directly into the Kremlin’s hands. “This is a gift to Putin,” she said.</p>\n<p>Russian officials have already seized on the controversy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov remarked there was “a lot of corruption” when asked about the protests in Kyiv.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

But as his trial date approached in August, he and his defence lawyers reached an agreement that would see his legal jeopardy lowered.</p>\n<p>In exchange for having Plasencia plead guilty to four counts of illegally distributing ketamine, prosecutors dropped three additional counts of illegal distribution and two counts of falsifying records.</p>\n<p>When questioned by Judge Garnett, Plasencia indicated his lawyers had exhausted all their options for pleas and sentencing: “They’ve considered everything.”</p>\n<p>In a statement afterwards, one of his lawyers, Debra White, conveyed Plasencia’s regrets and indicated the doctor would no longer practice medicine professionally.</p>\n<p>“Dr Plasencia is profoundly remorseful for the treatment decisions he made while providing ketamine to Matthew Perry,” White said.</p>\n<p>“He is fully accepting responsibility by pleading guilty to drug distribution. Dr Plasencia intends to voluntarily surrender his medical license, acknowledging his failure to protect Mr Perry, a patient who was especially vulnerable due to addiction.”</p>\n<p>Perry — best known for his role as Chandler Bing on the show Friends — <a href=\"/news/2023/10/29/friends-actor-matthew-perry-dies-at-54\">died on October 28, 2023</a>, in a hot tub at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles, California. He was 54 years old.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"/news/2023/12/16/friends-star-matthew-perry-died-of-ketamine-overdose-autopsy-finds\">autopsy report</a> released in December of that year credited Perry’s death to the “acute effects” of ketamine, while acknowledging other factors. Perry’s coronary artery disease, for example, likely contributed to his death, as well as his long-term struggles with drug use.</p>\n<p>Perry had been legally using ketamine to treat his depression. But faced with limits to the amount he could be prescribed, Perry reportedly started to seek additional sources of the drug outside of legal channels.</p>\n<p>Plasencia did not supply Perry with the fatal dose of ketamine, according to prosecutors.</p>\n<p>But in court on Wednesday, he did acknowledge he provided Perry with ketamine in the month leading up to his death, including 20 vials that contained a total of 100 milligrammes of the drug.</p>\n<p>The doctor also admitted to administering one injection and watching Perry’s blood pressure spike. He also said he left some for Perry’s assistant to inject.</p>\n<p>In court filings from a separate case, fellow <a href=\"/news/2024/10/3/doctor-pleads-guilty-over-overdose-death-of-friends-star-matthew-perry\">doctor Mark Chavez</a> accused Plasencia of recruiting him to supply ketamine to sell to Perry.</p>\n<p>“I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia allegedly said in a text message to Chavez. Prosecutors said the ketamine sale netted $4,500.</p>\n<p>Plasencia is the fourth defendant to plead guilty to charges related to Perry’s death.</p>\n<p>A fifth defendant, Jasveen Sangha, has pleaded not guilty. Authorities have accused Sangha of giving Perry his fatal dose and say she was a drug dealer known as the “ketamine queen”. Her trial will begin in August.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
