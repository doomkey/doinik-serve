But the STC also seeks to carve out a separate nation in southern Yemen, and in December, expanded its military operations in Hadramout and al-Mahra provinces that border Saudi Arabia, setting off a rapid escalation in tensions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has accused the United Arab Emirates – also a part of the anti-Houthi coalition – of arming the STC and of encouraging the separatist group to expand into Hadramout and al-Mahra, which Riyadh has said threatens its national security. The UAE has denied those allegations, insisting that it supports Saudi Arabia’s security.</p><p>However, while the UAE has since agreed to demands from Yemen’s Riyadh-backed Presidential Leadership Council and Saudi Arabia to withdraw its troops from Yemen, the STC has refused to pull back from Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>On Thursday, the STC-aligned Transport Ministry within the internationally recognised government claimed that the stoppage at the airport was a result of Saudi Arabia imposing new requirements mandating that flights to and from Aden airport undergo inspection in Jeddah.</p><p>The ministry said it was “shocked” by the move, adding that Saudi authorities later clarified the restriction only applied to flights operating between Aden and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>A Saudi source denied to the Reuters news agency that it was involved in restricting flights, saying Yemen’s internationally recognised government, led by the Presidential Leadership Council, was behind the requirement for UAE-bound flights.</p><p>Yemeni presidential adviser, Thabet al-Ahmadi, confirmed to Al Jazeera that it had imposed a requirement that applied to one flight route departing from Aden airport. He said the move was meant to prevent STC money smuggling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al-Ahmadi said the government did not support a complete halt to flights, adding it wanted to ensure air traffic continued unimpeded.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UAE announced it was voluntarily withdrawing its remaining “counterterrorism” forces from Yemen. That came after Riyadh <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemeni-port-over-unauthorised-weapons-shipment\">struck</a> what it claimed to be a UAE-linked weapons shipment in the southern port city of Mukalla.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Wednesday, Rashad al-Alimi, the head of the internationally recognised government in Yemen, warned that any moves by the STC to further entrench their position in the provinces would have severe consequences.</p><p>The STC has, however, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/yemens-separatist-stc-refuses-to-withdraw-from-provinces-near-saudi-arabia\">remained defiant</a>, saying it would remain in the provinces.</p><p>However, STC spokesperson Mohammed al-Naqeeb said the group was coordinating its movements with the Homeland Shield forces, which had been the main security force in the provinces prior to the STC offensive. The Homeland Shield is affiliated with the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since Houthi forces took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014. The group continues to control large swaths of the country’s northwest, with the STC and government contesting the southern and eastern flanks.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But, as he had in his campaign for the mayoralty, Mamdani flipped the script with his swearing-in events.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In act one, just after midnight, as the ball dropped in Times Square to ring in 2026, Mamdani took the oath of office in a small ceremony on the steps of the landmark New York City Hall subway station.</p><p>New York State Attorney General Letitia James administered the oath as Mamdani stood beside his wife, Rama Duwaji, on a staircase inside the transit hub, which has not been used for passenger service since 1945. He used a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-mayor-with-historic-quran\">historic Quran</a> borrowed from the New York Public Library for his swearing in, and a second one that belonged to his grandfather.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The public celebration arrived later, on New Year’s Day, when Mamdani repeated the oath on the steps of City Hall before a crowd that spilled across the surrounding plaza and into the streets. Despite the blistering cold, tens of thousands of supporters streamed into Lower Manhattan to watch the new mayor – along with the city’s comptroller, Mark Levine, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams – formally assume office.</p><p>National political heavyweights, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, flanked the city’s new leadership and delivered speeches outlining the progressive movement’s governing ambitions in New York and the national reverberations the race has already sent to lawmakers across the country.</p><p>“The most important lesson that can be learned today is that when working people stand, when they don’t let them [the ultra-wealthy] divide us up, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish,” Sanders said before swearing in Mamdani.</p><p>While guests and the press gathered inside the City Hall grounds, the city staged a seven-block-long public block party – a new twist on the traditionally ticketed inauguration format. In addition to a closed event capped at a few thousand attendees, anyone willing to RSVP and endure the frigid air and blustering winds after a night of snowfall could try their luck at getting in.</p><p>And many did, bundled New Yorkers shuffled through security checkpoints, hoping to glimpse the swearing-in of a 34-year-old democratic socialist now charged with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/zohran-mamdani-elected-as-new-york-mayor-in-historic-win\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running the largest city</a> in the United States, streaming on large monitors stationed throughout the surrounding area outside City Hall.</p><p>Some supporters told Al Jazeera they waited in line for hours, and many never made it through the checkpoints in time. While crowds cheered and horns blasted in solidarity from a distance, a handful of protesters lingered behind police barricades.</p><p>The block party in and of itself was symbolic in its effort to reach more New Yorkers who have normally been left out of the political process, Democratic strategist Nomiki Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was a way of opening up something that hasn’t been accessible for anybody, you know, that wasn’t part of the inner circle of New York politics and media,” Konst told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It was an opportunity to give back to the people who helped him get into office.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209134\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4209134 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6332-1767314647.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"New Yorkers gathered in a first of its kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New Yorkers gathered in a first-of-its-kind inauguration open to the general public [Andy Hirschfeld]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-message-of-unity-and-affordability\">A message of unity and affordability</h2><p>Mamdani, Williams and Levine spoke about unity for all New Yorkers, delivering remarks in English, Spanish, Hebrew and Greek, and appearing alongside faith leaders of <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/29/zohran-mamdanis-unlikely-coalition-winning-over-nycs-jewish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several different </a>faiths, including Islam, Christianity and Judaism.</p><p>“We have three swearings-in. One by a leader using a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-mayor-with-historic-quran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quran,</a> one by a leader using a Christian Bible, and one using a Hebrew Bible. I am proud to live in a city where this is possible,” Levine said after taking the oath of office.</p><p>Mamdani echoed that sentiment.</p><p>“We will draw this city closer together. We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism. If our campaign demonstrated that the people of New York yearn for solidarity, then let this government foster it,” Mamdani said in his address.</p><p>“We will deliver nothing less as we work each day to make this city belong to more of its people than it did the day before.”</p><p>But the core message, voiced repeatedly by Mamdani, Levine, Williams, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, was the same one that defined the campaign: that the ultra wealthy should pay higher taxes.</p><p>“Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes is not radical. It is exactly the right thing to do,” Sanders said, as supporters chanted, “Tax the rich.”</p><p>One of <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/21/will-zohran-mamdani-help-or-hurt-new-yorks-economy\">Mamdani’s core promises</a> was to raise the corporate tax rate in New York City from 7.25 percent to 11.5 percent, equivalent to that of neighbouring New Jersey, as well as a 2 percent increase in taxes on those who make more than $1m a year. Any tax plan would need the approval of the governor to move forward.</p><p>“This movement came out of eight-and-a-half million somewheres – taxi cab depots and Amazon warehouses, DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] meetings and curbside domino games. The powers that be had looked away from these places for quite some time – if they’d known about them at all – so they dismissed them as nowhere. But in our city, where every corner of these five boroughs holds power, there is no nowhere and there is no no one,” Mamdani said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Housing policy has been central to that affordability message for Mamdani. One of his signature campaign promises was to freeze the rent on the city’s rental stabilised apartments, which represent about half of the city’s rental housing stock.</p><p>“Those in rent-stabilised homes will no longer dread the latest rent hike – because we will freeze the rent,” Mamdani said in his remarks.</p><p>Only hours later, Mamdani introduced a slate of executive orders all aimed at housing.</p><p>“On the first day of this new administration, on the day when so many rent payments are due, we will not wait to deliver action,” Mamdani said at a news conference.</p><p>He announced three executive orders inside a rent-stabilised building in Brooklyn, including the creation of two new city task forces on housing policy: one to take inventory of city-owned land that could be used for housing, and another to identify ways to spur development.</p><p>“The housing crisis is at the centre of our affordability crisis. There are a number of things we are going to be focused on: protecting tenants, going after bad landlords, and building more housing. A huge part of how we get out of our housing crisis is to build more affordable housing across the city,” Leila Bozorg, the Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning, told Al Jazeera on the steps of City Hall hours before announcing the new policies.</p><p>“These are policy decisions we can address if we have the political will and if we put the resources behind it. And that is what he [Mamdani] is committed to doing.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In its pages, the Wall Street Journal reporters confronted Trump with questions about his age, fitness and statements about his recent health treatments.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The US president appeared to respond with some mild irritation at points. “Let’s talk about health again for the 25th time,” Trump told the interviewers at the outset of their conversation.</p><p>Trump is currently 79 years old. Should he complete his second term in full, he will be 82 years old by its conclusion.</p><p>That would make him the oldest sitting president in US history, breaking the record set by his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p><p>But just as Biden faced scrutiny for his ageing mind and body, so too has Trump. Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has been recorded appearing to nod off during public appearances, and close-up images of his hand as recently as December show thick patches of makeup.</p><p>Trump himself also raised alarm in October when he told reporters that he had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a procedure commonly used to diagnose and monitor serious conditions such as cancer, heart disease and other disorders that affect soft tissue.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208831\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208831\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-08-22T182704Z_1306233954_RC2ICGA8J1R3_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1767297115.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A closeup of Trump's hands, with one covered in makeup\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makeup covers the back of Trump’s right hand as he holds a public appearance in the Oval Office on August 22, 2025 [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nothing-s-wrong-trump-insists\">‘Nothing’s wrong,’ Trump insists</h2><p>In Thursday’s interview, Trump backtracked, clarifying that he had not received an MRI scan but rather a computed tomography (CT) scan, which offers less detail and is faster.</p><p>One of his doctors had previously identified the procedure as a CT scan instead of an MRI, too.</p><p>When discussing the mix-up, Trump told The Wall Street Journal he regretted getting any procedure at all, as it fuelled his critics as well as media speculation.</p><p>“In retrospect, it’s too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,” Trump told the newspaper.</p><p>“I would have been a lot better off if they didn’t, because the fact that I took it said, ‘Oh gee, is something wrong?’ Well, nothing’s wrong.”</p><p>He denied having any ailments whatsoever. “My health is perfect,” he told the reporters.</p><p>Trump also rejected the idea that he had dozed off at public meetings. In one instance — Trump’s December 2 cabinet meeting — the president’s eyelids appeared to droop, and he slouched forward, as if nodding off.</p><p>But in his Wall Street Journal interview, Trump blamed the media for creating false rumours. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink,” he said of the alleged sleeping incidents.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged to the newspaper that he had asked White House staff to slim down his schedule to focus on more important meetings, though he emphasised the decision had nothing to do with his alertness or stamina.</p><p>“I’ve never been a big sleeper,” Trump said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-02T184316Z_717141069_RC2H8IAHK1PY_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1767297319.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump closes his eyes while attending a cabinet meeting\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump attends a cabinet meeting at the White House on December 2, 2025 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"high-dose-of-aspirin\">High dose of aspirin</h2><p>One of the big revelations from the Journal’s interview was the high volume of aspirin Trump admitted to taking.</p><p>“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.”</p><p>Daily aspirin therapy is sometimes recommended to prevent a heart attack or stroke, particularly in older people.</p><p>But while the typical dosage starts at approximately 75mg, according to the Mayo Clinic, Trump told the Journal he consumes about 325mg per day — on the higher end of the spectrum.</p><p>“They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” Trump said of his doctors. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years.”</p><p>Trump credited the high aspirin regimen for causing easy bruising on his hands, another source of persistent public scrutiny. He explained that he turns to makeup to conceal when he has been “whacked again by someone”.</p><p>“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,” he said, citing a past incident when Attorney General Pam Bondi accidentally cut his hand with her ring.</p><p>Trump, an avid golfer, also confirmed to the Journal that he does not share the enthusiasm for exercise and fitness that cabinet members like Robert F Kennedy Jr or Pete Hegseth share.</p><p>“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump said. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”</p><p>Nevertheless, last August, Trump announced he would be relaunching the Presidential Fitness Test — a nationwide physical fitness test for grade-school students — in public schools. The test had been phased out in 2013 in favour of more inclusive fitness standards.</p><p>Members of Trump’s administration have also been criticised for fatphobic comments, particularly those directed at top military leaders with decorated service.</p><p>At a meeting in Quantico, Virginia, in October, Hegseth told hundreds of military leaders that “it’s tiring to look out at combat formations” and “see fat troops”, or enter the Pentagon and “see fat generals and admirals in the halls”.</p><p>Presidential fitness has been an increasingly pressing concern in the US political sphere, particularly since the tumult of the 2024 presidential election, which saw Biden drop his re-election bid less than four months before the vote due to questions about his age.</p><p>In a particularly disastrous June 2024 presidential debate, the then-81-year-old Biden appeared to struggle to complete his thoughts.</p><p>Trump, who has faced similar criticisms, blasted Biden as “Sleepy Joe” on the campaign trail and continues to invoke his Democratic rival’s competency as a contrast to his own.</p><p>Questions about ageing presidents, though, have long been a concern as older candidates take office.</p><p>Republican Ronald Reagan famously faced rumours about his competency, particularly as he ran for a second term in the 1980s. He was 77 years old when he left office, and by 1994, he announced he had Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>But Trump has consistently denied feeling the ravages of age, and in Thursday’s interview, he once again took the opportunity to credit his genes for his success: “I have very good genetics.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

I had 10,000 Sudanese pounds [$16], and it was gone in the market in an instant just to buy these few things.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-bottomless-displacement\">‘A bottomless displacement’</h2><p>Many Sudanese, like Aziza, have fled to Kosti, located in the White Nile state south of the capital, Khartoum, from the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/drone-attacks-kill-over-100-civilians-across-war-torn-sudans-kordofan\">Kordofan</a> region, also in central Sudan, and Darfur, in the west.</p><p>The current front lines of Sudan’s war, now more than two and a half years old, have been focused on those regions in recent months, with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) making several gains that their Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) opponents are trying to reverse.</p><p>The RSF has been accused of committing crimes against civilians, particularly when it seized the North Darfur city of el-Fasher in late October, where the paramilitary force was reported to have killed <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/horrific-violations-arab-nations-slam-rsf-killings-in-sudans-el-fasher\">at least 1,500 civilians</a>, according to monitoring groups.</p><p>The killings, many of them recorded on videos, as well as sexual assaults, robberies, and other attacks on civilians, have sent tens of thousands of people fleeing away from RSF areas of control.</p><p>Many of those who have fled are women and children, with men often targeted for killing by fighters, or forced to flee in a different direction from their families to avoid running into the RSF.</p><p>Kosti is currently considered to be relatively stable compared with the front lines and is witnessing a new surge of displaced people arriving.</p><p>According to local officials, more than 3,500 displaced Sudanese have arrived in Kosti in recent days, and Lamia Abdullah, White Nile’s humanitarian aid commissioner, said the city is receiving approximately 25 families – 100 to 150 individuals – every day.</p><p>Some have been housed in larger canvas tents, but many of the more recent arrivals have had to find whatever they can until better shelters are provided.</p><p>The surge of displaced people into Kosti is emblematic of what is happening across Sudan as a result of the wave of displacement from Darfur and Kordofan.</p><p>According to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 100,000 people are estimated to have fled el-Fasher and its surrounding villages between late October and early December, following the RSF attacks. Three-quarters of those displaced from el-Fasher had already been displaced previously during the war.</p><p>The IOM also reports that more than 50,000 people were displaced from Sudan between October 25 and December 17. In total, the IOM has recorded more than 9.3 million internally-displaced people (IDPs) in Sudan, with 55 percent of them children.</p><p>Nearly a third of the displaced households reported “at least one member going a whole day and night without eating within the past month due to insufficient food”, according to an IOM <a href=\"https://dtm.iom.int/reports/sudan-displacement-and-return-overview?close=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208628\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208628\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-01-111820-1767284589.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C327&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Drone view of a displacement camp \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Displaced Sudanese arriving in Kosti have pitched up tents on the outskirts of town [Screengrab/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-loom-as-needs-rise\">Aid cuts loom as needs rise</h2><p>Reporting from Kosti camp, Al Jazeera’s Almardi described a grim reality as the humanitarian response is collapsing just as needs skyrocket.</p><p>Despite the influx, international humanitarian organisations have announced reductions in aid starting this month due to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/un-rights-office-in-survival-mode-amid-deep-funding-cuts\">funding shortages</a> as donor governments cut spending. This comes as the camps face a severe lack of medical facilities.</p><p>“The biggest challenge is health,” Almardi reported. “There is a significant shortage of medical staff to monitor the displaced, a lack of medicine, and a desperate need for field hospitals.”</p><p>That is particularly important considering the journeys made by the people arriving in Kosti.</p><p>Many of the new arrivals trekked for up to 20 days, some crossing into South Sudan before looping back into Sudan’s White Nile state to find safety. They arrive exhausted, malnourished, and terrified of the approaching winter.</p><p>“The displaced are waiting for the unknown in harsh conditions,” Almardi said. “And the war has not yet ended.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
