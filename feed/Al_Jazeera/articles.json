The committee added that the men were located the following morning and exchanged fire with Tajik border guards. Five people, including the three intruders, were killed, it said.</p><p>Tajik officials did not name the armed men or specify which group they belonged to. The officials, however, said they seized three M-16 rifles, a Kalashnikov assault rifle, three foreign-made pistols with silencers, 10 hand grenades, a night-vision scope and explosives at the scene.</p><p>Dushanbe said this was the third attack originating from Afghanistan’s Badakhshan province in the past month that has resulted in the deaths of its personnel.</p><p>These attacks, Tajik officials said on Thursday, “prove that the Taliban government is demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security … and to combat members of terrorist organisations”.</p><p>The Tajik statement called on the Taliban to “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take effective measures to ensure security along the shared border”.</p><p>Tajikistan has not suggested what the motive for the attacks may be, but the assaults have appeared to target Chinese companies and nationals working in the area.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196761\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196761\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196761\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20250924__763A3T3__v1__MidRes__TajikistanMetalsMiningTrade-1766749275.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"china\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers of Talco Gold, a joint Tajik-Chinese mining firm, speak in front of a poster of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon at the Saritag antimony mine in western Tajikistan [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-china-involved-in-all-this\">How is China involved in all this?</h2><p>Beijing is Tajikistan’s largest creditor and one of its most influential economic partners with a significant footprint in infrastructure, mining and other border-region projects.</p><p>China and Tajikistan also share a 477km (296-mile) border running through the high-altitude Pamir Mountains in eastern Tajikistan, adjacent to China’s Xinjiang region.</p><p>Two attacks were launched against Chinese companies and nationals in the last week of November. On November 26, a drone equipped with an explosive device attacked a compound belonging to Shohin SM, a private Chinese gold-mining company, in the remote Khatlon region on the Tajik-Afghan border, killing three Chinese citizens.</p><p>In a second attack on November 30, a group of men armed with guns opened fire on workers employed by the state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation, killing at least two people in Tajikistan’s Darvoz district.</p><p>Tajik officials said those attacks had originated from villages in Afghanistan’s Badakhshan province but did not disclose any affiliation or motive behind the attacks.</p><p>Chinese nationals have also come under attack in Pakistan’s Balochistan province and along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.</p><p>China’s embassy in Dushanbe advised Chinese companies and personnel to evacuate the border area.

We have passed the test of confrontation. We may be weak in resources, but our faith and will are strong,” he said, adding that security had improved to the extent that Taliban officials now travel across the country without weapons.</p><p>The Taliban insists that no “terrorist groups” are operating from Afghanistan. However, in a recent report, the United Nations sanctions-monitoring committee cited the presence of multiple armed groups, including ISKP, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, al-Qaeda, the Turkistan Islamic Party, Jamaat Ansarullah and Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan.</p><p>Jamaat Ansarullah is a Tajik group linked to al-Qaeda-aligned networks and active primarily in northern Afghanistan near the Tajik border.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196763\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196763\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20240517__34PH83M__v1__MidRes__TajikistanAfghanistanDiplomacyTrade-1766749395.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghans travel along a border road as seen from Tajikistan’s Darvoz district [File: Amir Isaev/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-are-relations-between-tajikistan-and-the-taliban\">How are relations between Tajikistan and the Taliban?</h2><p>For decades, the relationship between Tajikistan and the Taliban has been defined by deep ideological hostility and ethnic mistrust with Dushanbe one of the group’s fiercest critics in Central Asia.</p><p>In the 1990s, Tajikistan aligned with the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, led by Afghan military commander and former Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud.</p><p>After the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Tajikistan stood as the lone holdout among its neighbours in refusing to officially recognise the new government.</p><p>However, pragmatic diplomatic engagement quietly began about 2023, driven by economic necessity and shared security fears over the presence of ISKP. Stepping up the restoration of relations, a high-level Tajik delegation visited Kabul in November, the first such visit since the Taliban’s return to power.</p><p>But the two governments continue to trade accusations that the other is harbouring “terrorists”, the major thorn remaining in their bilateral relationship, and that drug smuggling is occurring across their border.</p><p>The Tajik-Afghan border has long been a major trafficking route for Afghan heroin and methamphetamine into Central Asia and onwards to Russia and Europe, exploiting the area’s rugged terrain and weak policing.</p><p>“The rising frequency [of the clashes] is new and interesting and raises a point: whether we might be seeing a new threat emerging,” Bahiss said.</p><p>Badakshan province, from which Tajik authorities said the attacks on Chinese nationals originate, presents a complex security situation for the Taliban as it has struggled to stem the threat from armed opposition groups, Bahiss added.</p><p>This security issue has been further complicated by the Taliban’s crackdown on poppy cultivation in the province, he said. The Taliban has faced resistance to this policy from farmers in the north. This is largely because the terrain of Badakshan means poppies are the only viable cash crop.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196745\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196745\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-13T143010Z_997153299_RC20BHA2RDCP_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AFGHANISTAN-1766748858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called his Tajik counterpart early this month to express regret about the attacks on Chinese nationals and say his government was prepared to boost cooperation between their border forces [Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-taliban-faring-with-other-neighbours\">How is the Taliban faring with other neighbours?</h2><p>Since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, some of its neighbours have maintained a pragmatic transactional relationship while others have not.</p><p>Relations with Pakistan, previously its patron, have <a href=\"/news/2024/12/28/analysis-why-have-pakistans-ties-with-the-afghan-taliban-turned-frigid\">particularly deteriorated</a>. Islamabad accuses Kabul of harbouring fighters of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistan Taliban.

However, both sides have engaged in fighting since, blaming each other for breaking the fragile truce.</p><p>The Taliban denies Islamabad’s allegations and has blamed Pakistan for its “own security failures”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Taliban is now invested in <a href=\"/features/2025/1/11/why-is-india-courting-the-taliban-now\">developing a new relationship</a> with Pakistan’s archrival, India, with delegations visiting Indian cities for trade and security discussions. New Delhi was earlier part of the anti-Taliban alliance. However, that approach has changed with the deteriorating ties between Pakistan and the Taliban.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Photos shared on social media by residents there appear to confirm the location, with some posting what appear to be fragments of a bomb and others posting videos of a large fire on a farm. The information could not be independently verified by Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There were no casualties as of this morning,” Adamu said, adding that it’s unclear why Jabo was chosen, as there are no known ISIL-linked terror cells there.</p><p>Locals on social media also questioned why their town had been targeted.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Nigerian Foreign Ministry told Al Jazeera that the strikes had been carried out based on intelligence provided by Nigeria.</p><p>“The air strikes covered a precise area, and what people are seeing are fragments that fell in Jabo,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"is-isil-operating-in-nigeria\">Is ISIL operating in Nigeria?</h2><p>Yes, about six ideological armed groups exist in Nigeria, all of them linked to either ISIL (ISIS) or al-Qaeda.</p><p>They have targeted both Christian and Muslim communities in their areas of operation in the country’s predominantly Muslim northeast and northwest regions.</p><p>The strikes on Thursday likely targeted a faction called Lakurawa, which has recently emerged, and whose profile is still not fully known.</p><p>Here are some of the factions explained:</p><p><strong>Boko Haram:</strong> The most recognised armed group is Boko Haram, which is based in Borno State, northeast Nigeria.</p><p>The group gained international notoriety for kidnapping 300 school girls from their dormitory in Chibok, Borno State, under the leadership of Ibrahim Shekau in 2014.</p><p>It was most active between 2012 and 2015. At the height of its activities, the group targeted military installations and civilians around Borno and the neighbouring Yobe and Adamawa states. It also spread across porous borders into Cameroon, Niger and Chad.</p><p>Boko Haram used suicide bombing and mass kidnapping tactics against both Christian and Muslim communities, attacking churches and mosques alike. Its main hideout was the Sambisa Forest in Borno, but it also controlled large swaths of rural territory where it taxed locals and operated as a government.</p><p>At least 30,000 people died, and millions were displaced at the height of Boko Haram’s operations. The group has been largely deflated by infighting and pressure from the Nigerian military. Since 2015, it has lost much of the territory it controlled.</p><p><strong>ISWAP:</strong> The ISIL-affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP) broke away from Boko Haram in 2016 following disagreements between top military leaders. The two groups have maintained a violent rivalry.</p><p>ISWAP is believed to have between 8,000 and 12,000 fighters, according to the United Nations. It is currently active around the Lake Chad basin area in northeast Nigeria, and has active cells in the northwest of the country.</p><p>It controls local communities, where it attempts to win support by providing basic amenities while taxing local farmers and fishermen.</p><p><strong>Lakurawa:</strong> A newly emerged faction, the group operates in remote parts of the country’s northwest Sokoto State, including in the Tangaza, Gudu, Illela, Binji and Silame local governments. It is also present in northwest Zamfara and Kebbi states.</p><p>Jabo, which is located in Sokoto and was struck on Thursday, is known for harbouring bandits, but analysts say there’s no strong presence of Lakurawa or other ISIL cells in the town.</p><p>Nigerian officials confirmed the group’s existence in November 2024 and designated it a terror group in January.</p><p>Before its emergence, ragtag bandit groups had been targeting remote communities in Sokoto and neighbouring Zamfara. In 2017, local leaders invited armed fighters from Mali and Niger, mostly from the Fulani pastoral ethnic group, to fight the bandits, as government presence was failing to deter them, according to researchers James Barnett and Vincent Foucher. However, some of the arriving fighters were affiliated with armed groups operating in Niger and Mali, including the ISIL in Sahel Province (ISSP), also known as Islamic State Greater Sahara (ISGS).</p><p>By 2018, the fighters had moved on from rescuing victims from bandits to enforcing Islamic law on villages.</p><p>Lakurawa elements have since grown bolder and more lethal in recent years, targeting security outposts.</p><p>Researchers do not believe there is a single, homogenous Lakurawa group, but suggest that many factions are being clumped together by the government, potentially hampering an effective response. Some also say the group’s alllegiance could be to al-Qaeda, rather than ISIL.</p><p>In 2024, a United Nations Security Council report confirmed the presence of ISGS affiliates in northwest Nigeria’s Sokoto State. It’s unclear to what extent ISWAP and Lakurawa coordinate.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-trump-administration-targeting-nigeria-now\">Why is the Trump administration targeting Nigeria now?</h2><p>President Trump maintains that the US strikes have been carried out to protect Christian communities in Nigeria.</p><p>United States Senator Ted Cruz first accused Nigeria’s government of enabling a “massacre” against Christians in October 2025, citing a rising number of <a href=\"/news/2025/4/19/herder-farmer-clashes-in-nigeria-kill-at-least-17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacks</a> against the community in the country’s central Middle Belt region, which is separate from the violence in the north. He claimed, without proof, that 50,000 Christians had been killed since 2009. In September, he introduced the Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability Act which, if it passes Congress, would sanction Nigerian officials seen as complicit in the killings of Christians.</p><p>Cruz was echoing claims from within the Christian political right in the US of a Christian genocide in Nigeria for the past few years.</p><p>Then, in November, Trump also accused Nigeria of a Christian genocide, referring to ISIL, and appearing to link the two separate issues. He also referred to Nigeria as a “Country of National Concern”.</p><p>But while Cruz and other far-right US voices identified the Middle Belt region of Nigeria as the site of the alleged “Christian genocide”, the US strikes on Thursday targeted a town in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north. Jabo is a largely Muslim town, and Muslim communities there have been the targets of bandits who kidnap them for ransom.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-really-happening-in-nigeria\">What is really happening in Nigeria?</h2><p>The situation in Nigeria is far more complex than has been presented by the Trump administration, which appears to conflate two separate issues.</p><p>Nigeria is a vast country of 200 million people from more than 250 ethnic groups. It suffers not just at the hands of the ideological armed groups but also as a result of ethnoreligious violence.</p><p>The fertile Middle Belt region of the country, which Cruz referred to, has long been a hotbed of violence between predominantly Muslim herders from the majority Fulani ethnic group and Christian farming communities from different minority ethnic groups who have repeatedly clashed over land and water resources.</p><p>The violence has grown in scale and weaponry over the past few years, and has largely targeted Christian farming communities.</p><p>The farmers say herder groups attack their communities in lethal raids using sophisticated weapons, burn whole villages to the ground and massacre civilians. They also target infrastructure like schools, clinics, grain reserves, churches and boreholes.</p><p>In May, Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/05/nigeria-mounting-death-toll-unchecked-attacks-armed-groups/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that close to 10,000 people had been killed since 2023, including children, in the worst-affected states of Benue and Plateau, and that more than 500,000 people have been displaced.</p><p>Nigeria’s government has long termed this a “local farmer-herdman crisis”, but the affected communities reject this classification, saying it oversimplifies the problem and means an inadequate response. One community leader in Benue called recent killings a “full-scale genocidal invasion and land-grabbing campaign by herder terrorists and bandits”.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-of-a-say-did-nigeria-have-in-the-us-strikes\">How much of a say did Nigeria have in the US strikes?</h2><p>The Nigerian Foreign Ministry said the strikes had been carried out with the consent of Nigeria. Locally, however, Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has come under fire from opposition politicians who say the US strikes represent a violation of the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>“Judging by the nature of the confirmed strike on a village in Sokoto, it is clear that the US President under whose authority this operation occurred neither understands nor genuinely cares about Nigeria or Nigerians,” Omoyele Sowore, a former presidential candidate and leader of the African Action Congress, said in a statement on X.</p><p>“It is deeply troubling that Nigeria [Africa’s most populous nation] lacks the capable and sovereign leadership required to protect its people and its territory.”</p><p>Analyst Owolade told Al Jazeera it is unlikely that the US would launch strikes without Nigeria’s green light, but pointed out that the way the US has referred to the cooperation is quite different from how Nigeria is wording it.</p><p>“This suggests a cooperative but unequal partnership, shaped by Nigeria’s dependence on external intelligence and military capacity, and the US’s desire to frame the tension in Nigeria as genocide against Christians and project counter-ISIS resolve in West Africa,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-history-of-us-nigeria-security-collaboration\">What’s the history of US-Nigeria security collaboration?</h2><p>The US has cooperated with Nigeria and other West African countries to combat the regional threat of armed groups, mainly through training and weapons sales. This is the first time the US has directly conducted air strikes in Nigeria, however.</p><p>During the peak of the Boko Haram crisis, the US intensified training cooperation and supported Nigeria with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, especially under the joint Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). The group includes Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin, which are all connected by Lake Chad, and which are all experiencing armed incursions.</p><p>However, the joint task force has begun to break down. Niger’s military government has been at odds with Nigeria since June 2023, when the military there seized power. Niger is also at odds with the US and other Western partners like France. In August 2024, the US military began withdrawing from its important bases in the country, from where it monitored armed groups in the Sahel.</p><p>Niger pulled out of the MNJTF in April, and Chad is threatening to withdraw. Analysts from the Institute for Security Studies link the coalition’s breakdown to increased armed group activity across the region.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Any excess cash resulting from this is expected to be doled out to low-income Iranians in the form of <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/irans-coupons-and-taxes-giving-with-one-hand-taking-with-the-other\">electronic coupons</a> that can be used to buy essential items like food.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s5\">For the first time, the budget is drafted in new rials as four zeros are expected to be removed from the ailing national currency by the time the budget is operational for next year.</p><p class=\"s5\">After years of back and forth, the parliament in October approved the government plan to lop off four zeros.

When the coup leaders seized power in 2021, Diallo welcomed the move and pledged his willingness to work with them in restoring democracy.</p><p>However, Doumbouya’s government launched corruption proceedings against him in relation to the sale of Air Guinee, the national carrier, back in 2002, when Diallo was transport minister. Diallo, who accused the military ruler of a witch-hunt to block him from elections, has since been forced into exile in neighbouring Senegal and in France. In August, his party was one of three suspended because documents they submitted had “substantial deficiencies”, according to the Ministry of Territorial Administration, which is in charge of the elections, as opposed to an independent elections commission. Diallo was also disqualified based on his residency, as the new constitution adopted in September requires that presidential candidates have their primary residence in the country.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1220691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1220691\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1220691\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-24T122237Z_381428548_RC20PJ9VYYMV_RTRMADP_3_GUINEA-ELECTION-1.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alpha Conde\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1220691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guinea’s then-president Alpha Conde laughs as he addresses a conference in Berlin, Germany, on November 19, 2019 [John MacDougall/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"alpha-conde-87\">Alpha Conde, 87</h2><p>Conde’s decision to run for a third term in 2021, after serving two five-year terms, threw Guinea into chaos and led to the September coup.</p><p>A longtime opponent of military regimes in the country, Conde promised to strengthen democracy upon his election in 2010, after polls that, despite being turbulent, were also a chance for the country to depart from decades of dictatorship. He was the first Guinean president to be elected in a free election. His government oversaw improvements in the mining sector and managed the 2014 Ebola epidemic, but is also accused of gross corruption and mismanagement.</p><p>In March 2020, he pushed through a referendum that allowed him to seek two more terms, claiming it reset his limit. The move led to widespread protests across the country that turned violent as the police and army attempted to shut them down, leading to dozens of deaths. The elections in October 2020 were held amid the turmoil, and at least 30 people were killed during the polls. In September 2021, Conde was deposed and arrested by a group of soldiers led by Doumbouya, whom he had appointed in 2018 as head of the elite Special Forces Group. He is believed to be in exile in Turkiye. Conde’s Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) was one of the parties suspended in August because it had “not fulfilled the obligations required,” according to the authorities.</p><h2 id=\"sidya-toure-80\">Sidya Toure, 80</h2><p>The former prime minister (1996-1999) is another well-known opposition figure who has been sidelined.

He promised to end the chaos and return the country to democratic rule.</p><p>The regional ECOWAS bloc has pressured Doumbouya to present a fast transition timeline. The military ruler initially promised an 18-month transition, but then remained largely uncompliant, missing two deadlines. However, ECOWAS, while keeping up pressure, has not been overly critical. Doumbouya has remained open to staying in the bloc, unlike his compatriots in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, who, under pressure to hold elections after their coups, rebuffed ECOWAS by leaving the alliance and creating a new union in January. ECOWAS is wary of antagonising Doumbouya and possibly causing Guinea to join the rival alliance.</p><p>Doumbouya’s government has, since 2022, banned protests, restricted local news organisations, and targeted activists in arrests, according to local news reports and civil society groups. A week before the elections, authorities also blocked Facebook.</p><p>Supporters of the military ruler say he has boosted infrastructure, with more than 2,250 kilometres of new roads built, schools renovated, and new hospitals built. They also point to the launch of the mega Simandou iron ore mine project, which saw its first iron ore exports this year, 30 years after it was licensed to operate.</p><p>The project has attracted international interest. Analysts say that’s partly why Western governments, with whom Doumbouya has maintained a friendly stance even as Conakry ramps up trade with China, are careful not to criticise his hold on power.</p><p>With campaign posters of the smiling Doumbouya splashed across Conakry’s streets and in the city of Kankan, his political stronghold, the president has promised to improve the infrastructure gains in the past four years. He has also pledged to build better democratic institutions; fight corruption; boost health and education access; and support women and youth. He is running under the Generation for Modernity and Development, or GMD movement.</p><p><strong>Others are:</strong></p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Aboulaye Yero Balde – a former education minister under Alpha Conde and ex-World Bank economist.

Literacy levels are low and about half of the working population is unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.</p><p>Much hope for change hinges on restructuring in the mining sector to unlock lucrative deals for the country. The Simandou mine, which Chinese and Australian firms own stakes in, is of particular importance, as Doumbouya’s government is banking on it to provide enough money to bankroll more infrastructure and amenities. The first shipment from the mines left for China early in December, after a newly constructed railway allowed for ore to be transported out of the remote Simandou highlands to the port of Conakry. While many Guineans are hopeful about the proceeds, there are also fears that persistent government corruption could drain the revenue. Many are also concerned about the fate of the thousands of construction workers employed at the mine once building projects are complete.</p><h2 id=\"justice-for-september-28-stadium-massacre\">Justice for September 28 stadium massacre</h2><p>In 2009, former military leader Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in 2008, oversaw the massacre of protesters who gathered in their tens of thousands at a stadium in Conakry to call for democratic rule. Camara’s forces opened fire on the demonstrators in an attempt to suppress them. Many were shot, while others were crushed in the ensuing stampede. At least 156 people were killed, and 109 women and girls were raped during the massacre. It was one of the country’s most tragic events.</p><p>Many Guineans have long hoped for justice and a trial against Camara, who fled to Burkina Faso after a coup and assassination attempt months later. Doumbouya’s government launched a 22-month-long trial against him, and a court convicted Camara and seven of his military commanders in July 2024. Rights groups hailed the verdict as a historic moment for justice. Camara was handed a 20-year sentence, and he and the others were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the massacre. However, this March, just a year later, Doumbouya pardoned Camara on alleged health grounds – to the disappointment of victims and rights campaigners.</p><p>Although the government has taken on the task of compensation, with a first phase of reparations under way, there’s a lingering feeling among many victims that justice has not been fully served.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The group faced competition from a rival consortium led by Lucky Cement, as well as Air Blue, a private airline.</p><p>The auction, widely publicised and broadcast live by the government, marked the second formal attempt to privatise PIA. A previous effort in October 2024 collapsed when a single bid of $36m from a private real estate firm fell far short of the government’s $305m floor price.</p><p>The privatisation of PIA followed pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which urged Islamabad to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises. Pakistan, currently under a <a href=\"/news/2024/9/26/imf-loan-offers-pakistan-relief-but-long-term-reforms-remain-a-challenge\">$7bn IMF loan programme</a>, had committed to completing the airline’s privatisation by the end of this year.</p><p>Here is what is known so far about the sale, the winning consortium, and why the deal has drawn criticism from opposition parties and other quarters.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-winning-bid\">What do we know about the winning bid?</h2><p>On Tuesday, bidding took place in a packed five-star hotel in Islamabad and lasted about 90 minutes, with several breaks. Three parties submitted initial bids for a 75 percent stake in the national carrier.</p><p>To attract investors, the government restructured PIA last year by hiving off long-term liabilities worth more than $2.3bn into a separate entity. It also offered policy continuity guarantees and tax relief, measures approved by the IMF.</p><p>In the first round, Air Blue was disqualified from open bidding after offering $94.59m, well below the government’s minimum price of $356.9m.</p><p>Once the two remaining consortia cleared the floor price, open bidding began. The AHL-led group emerged victorious with a final offer of $482m for the 75 percent stake.</p><p>At a news conference a day later, Muhammad Ali, the government’s adviser on privatisation, said 92.5 percent of the winning bid, amounting to about $446m, would be reinvested into PIA itself. The remaining $36m would go to the government, which will also retain a 25 percent share valued at roughly $160.6m.</p><p>Arif Habib later told a private television channel that the consortium intends to buy the remaining 25 percent stake as well, with the aim of relaunching the airline by April next year.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, the consortium must pay two-thirds of the purchase price within three months, with the remaining one-third due within a year. A decision on acquiring the remaining 25 percent stake must also be made within three months.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-need-to-privatise-pia-arise\">Why did the need to privatise PIA arise?</h2><p>Once regarded as Pakistan’s most prestigious brand, PIA operated flights across the world and even boasted uniforms designed by Pierre Cardin. Founded in 1955 with a fleet of 13 aircraft, the airline quickly expanded its footprint.</p><p>PIA operated its first international flight to London via Cairo and Rome and went on to achieve several milestones. It became the first Asian airline to acquire a jet aircraft, the Boeing 707, opened new international routes, and is credited with helping launch Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, in the 1980s.</p><p>More than two decades later, however, the airline is widely viewed as a debt-ridden burden on the state. Successive governments attempted to offload PIA but failed amid resistance from opposition parties and protests by employee unions.</p><p>According to Ali, PIA accumulated more than $1.7bn in liabilities between 2015 and 2024, while long-term liabilities exceeded $2.3bn.</p><p>“This time, the process was carried forward with lessons from the past and completed with extensive preparation and accountability,” he said at Wednesday’s news conference.</p><p>Ali said PIA once operated about 50 aircraft and served nearly 40 international destinations. Today, only 18 aircraft are operational out of a fleet of 33.</p><p>He added that the airline currently serves about 30 destinations, operates roughly 240 weekly round-trip flights, and holds more than 30 percent of the domestic market. That share has fallen sharply from at least 60 percent in earlier decades with the rise of private carriers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-24T080843Z_1648099475_RC2WMIAZCA86_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-PRIVATISATION-PIA-1766710000.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C503&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali speaks at his office in Islamabad, Pakistan December 24, 2025.

Over the years, that number gradually reduced to fewer than 7,000 employees.</p><p>PIA was also barred from flying to the United Kingdom and Europe in June 2020, a month after one of its aircraft plunged into a Karachi street, killing 97 people. The disaster was attributed to human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and was followed by allegations that nearly a third of the licences for its pilots were fake or dubious.</p><p>However, the four-year ban from Europe was lifted in December 2024 by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and the Pakistani state-owned carrier resumed flights to the continent in January. Then, in July, the UK, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/uk-lifts-restrictions-on-pakistan-airlines-after-five-year-ban\">too, lifted its ban</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-criticism-against-the-auction-and-how-do-analysts-view-the-sale\">What is the criticism against the auction and how do analysts view the sale?</h2><p>While the government hailed the transaction as the “best possible outcome” with “great symbolic value”, opposition parties condemned the deal.</p><p>The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), an opposition alliance led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, rejected the privatisation, warning that disposing of a national asset without public mandate, parliamentary oversight, transparency and constitutional legitimacy would be unacceptable.</p><p>Other commentators questioned the bidding process, describing it as an act of “obfuscation” that raised more questions than answers. Some accused the government of effectively selling the 75 percent stake for just $36m — since the rest is to be invested back into an airline that its new, private owners will now benefit from.</p><p>Ali dismissed those claims.</p><p>“Our structuring was such that we get 10 billion rupees ($36m) in cash, and the value of our equities is 45 billion rupees ($160m). So, the government will get a value of 55 billion rupees ($196m) in total, and 125 billion rupees ($446m) will flow back into the airline,” he said.</p><p>Several economists and aviation analysts argue that the outcome was the best deal possible, regardless of which government was in power.</p><p>Fahd Ali, an economist and assistant professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), described the agreement as watertight.</p><p>“Critics have also been talking about the lucrative landing rights and routes that it holds and how the new owner may sell these to recover its costs. But people fail to understand that PIA’s destinations are the geese that lay the golden eggs,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The airline was unable to capitalise on those routes because it required additional investment that the state could not provide, he said, adding that selling them would hurt future earnings.</p><p>“Given these constraints, the deal seems all right,” he said.</p><p>Karachi-based economic commentator Khurram Husain said the transaction was unconventional, driven less by profit than by the need to stem losses.</p><p>“You can cut your losses two ways. Either you shut it all down, denotify and delist the company, with PIA ceasing to exist. Or the other was to hand it over to private sector, and have them run it,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Husain, a former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said PIA’s long-term liabilities of $2.3bn would have continued to grow had the government not acted.</p><p>“At what point does one stop? That was the government’s calculus. They were not looking to bring down losses, but to control it,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-part-of-the-consortium-and-why-is-the-military-s-inclusion-raising-questions\">Who is part of the consortium and why is the military’s inclusion raising questions?</h2><p>The consortium is led by Arif Habib, whose business interests span brokerage services, fertilisers, steel and real estate. He has previously served as a member of the Privatisation Commission.</p><p>Other partners include Fatima Fertilizer, part of the Fatima Group and Arif Habib Group, City Schools, founded in the late 1970s and now operating more than 500 campuses with at least 150,000 students, and Lake City Pakistan, a Lahore-based real estate developer. AKD Holdings, led by businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi, is also part of the group.</p><p>But the post-sale decision by the Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) to join the consortium has triggered debate. FFC, which is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, is a subsidiary of the military-run Fauji Foundation, which owns more than 40 percent of its shares.</p><p>As Pakistan’s largest fertiliser producer with interests in energy, food and finance, FFC’s move is seen by some as an expansion of the military’s footprint into the aviation sector.</p><p>Pakistan’s military remains the country’s most powerful institution, having directly ruled for more than three decades and retaining deep influence over political, social, and economic affairs.</p><p>Critics point to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as an example of the <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/25/elite-capture-how-pakistan-is-losing-6-percent-of-its-gdp-to-corruption\">military’s growing role</a> in economic decision-making. Established in June 2023 during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s first term, the SIFC is a high-powered body of civilian and military leaders tasked with promoting investment by cutting through bureaucracy. It has faced sustained criticism over transparency.</p><p>Husain said FFC’s presence in the consortium could prove “very significant” over the long term.</p><p>“It’s possible that under this deal, what has really happened is that PIA has moved from one arm of the state to another,” he said.</p><p>Ali Khizar, a Karachi-based economic analyst, said FFC’s inclusion could provide long-term security assurances for private investors.</p><p>“Historically, we have seen in Pakistan with policies taking 180-degree turn with changing government, so perhaps they needed to ensure to have military presence for providing investor security. But if FFC ends up with more shares than AHL, then that could change their influence and decision-making,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Fahd Ali said military-run businesses tend to operate differently from other state-owned enterprises (SoEs).</p><p>“They remain shielded from the political interference that besets other SoEs. However, those who think that the state will now be able to wash its hands of PIA might be mistaken,” he said.</p><p>Khizar added that while the transaction marks a breakthrough after two decades of failed attempts at privatising the carrier, concerns will persist if one airline — now backed by significant private capital and the military’s clout — ends up controlling the aviation market.</p><p>“There is a fear for other domestic airlines,” he acknowledged. “But then there is a lot of potential. PIA’s main opportunity is the international market and that is where it must compete,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His first trial for embezzlement of funds began in April 2019. In 2020, he was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust, and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment over the misappropriation of $9.9m in 1MDB funds. His sentence was later cut in half in a partial pardon.</p><p>In all, investigators said they believe some $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private accounts, including Najib’s. Legal proceedings for both his trials have spanned seven years and seen lawyers call 76 witnesses to the stand, including Najib himself.</p><p>Najib and his supporters – dozens of whom gathered at the court on Friday – claim the charges against him are politically motivated and that he was misled by his advisers.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in his verdict: “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused ‍his own powerful position in ⁠1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-1mdb\">What is 1MDB?</h2><p>1MDB is an abbreviation used for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. Berhad is the Malay term for “public limited company”.</p><p>The fund was set up in 2009 to promote development in Malaysia through foreign partnerships and investment.</p><p>Najib, who served as both prime minister and finance minister between 2009 and 2018, was also the chairman of 1MDB.</p><p>Prosecutors claimed that Najib abused his position as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move large amounts of money from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund to his personal accounts more than a decade ago.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-najib-now\">Where is Najib now?</h2><p>Najib is in Kajang Prison in Malaysia’s Selangor state, having been found guilty of embezzlement in the first, separate case in 2020. His sentence was later <a href=\"/news/2024/2/2/malaysia-reduces-sentence-of-former-pm-najib-razak\">commuted from 12 years to six years</a> after he received a partial royal pardon.<strong> </strong>He was due to be released on August 23, 2028.</p><p>During this second trial, which resulted in the verdict on Friday this week, investigators found that Najib used the 1MDB funds to buy his superyacht Equanimity and high-end properties, as well as to finance the production of the film, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-najib-said\">What has Najib said?</h2><p>Najib, who was defeated in the 2018 general election by Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister who had helped him come to power, has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the 1MDB scandal.</p><p>In October 2024, he apologised for mishandling the scandal, but maintained that he had no knowledge of the illegal fund transfers to his personal bank account. During the trial, Najib said he believed the money he received was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah – a claim that the judge rejected on Friday.</p><p>Najib also claimed that he had been deceived by advisers and other officials affiliated with 1MDB, including <a href=\"/features/2020/11/16/how-1mdb-fugitive-jho-low-tried-to-bargain-for-his-freedom\">Jho Low</a>, a Malaysian financier alleged to be the mastermind behind the scandal but who remains at large.</p><p>“It pains me every day to know that the 1MDB debacle happened under my watch as minister of finance and prime minister,” Najib said in a letter.</p><p>“For that, I would like to apologise unreservedly to the Malaysian people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Venezuela and the United States teeter on the brink of war, China has been vocal in condemning US actions. In Beijing’s view, Washington’s escalation – which includes seizing Venezuelan oil tankers, striking alleged drug-smuggling boats and imposing a blockade off the Venezuelan coast – is a textbook example of American unilateralism, infringing on another country’s sovereignty and violating the United Nations Charter.</p><p>During a December 17 call with his Venezuelan counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced opposition to US “unilateral bullying” and expressed his support for Venezuela’s right to “defend its sovereignty and national dignity”.</p><p>Yet, Beijing has failed to offer Caracas anything beyond rhetoric. China is clearly wary of falling into a geopolitical trap and its inaction demonstrates the limits of its influence in Latin America.</p><h2 id=\"engagement-with-latin-america\">Engagement with Latin America</h2><p>For more than two decades, China has pursued an expansion of economic relations with Latin American countries. As a result, today it is South America’s top trading partner; it is also the second-largest trading partner of Mexico, one of the US’s closest allies in the region.</p><p>China’s engagement with Latin American countries is fuelled by the high degree of complementarity between their economies. Agricultural goods – notably soya beans from Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay – have improved China’s food security, especially during its trade war with the US. Meanwhile, minerals such as lithium carbonate from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have become indispensable to China’s rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) industry.</p><p>In recent years, Chinese EV exports to Latin America have surged, growing by 55 percent in 2023 alone. The region has not only alleviated China’s overcapacity problem, but has also offered Chinese telecommunication technology, such as Huawei’s 5G  – which has long been<a href=\"/economy/2018/12/7/why-are-countries-banning-huawei\"> spurned </a>by Western countries – a market. Currently, Huawei’s 5G equipment is present in most Latin American countries.</p><p>The US, traditionally viewing Latin America as its back yard, has been naturally suspicious and hostile towards China’s growing influence in the region. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – an outspoken China hawk who has previously labelled the Communist Party of China an “evil, genocidal regime” – embarked on a diplomatic blitz across the region. Declaring that he was on a mission to “counter the [CPC’s] influence in the Western Hemisphere”, he sought to persuade several Latin American countries to scale back ties with China.</p><p>Despite being unable to offer a compelling alternative model of economic cooperation and opting for extortion tactics through tariffs, Washington nonetheless holds the upper hand in this battle for influence. For example, although most countries in the region have been economically enticed to adhere to the one China policy, recognising that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, the region continues to be the last bastion of diplomatic support for Taiwan, with seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan over China.</p><p>This week, the US achieved a resounding victory when Trump-backed conservative <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-backed-conservative-nasry-asfura-wins-honduras-election-authorities\">Nasry Asfura</a> won the presidential elections in Honduras; during his campaign, he pledged to sever diplomatic ties with China and re-establish formal relations with Taiwan.</p><p>Over the past year, under the Trump administration, several Latin American countries have yielded to US pressure to limit economic ties with China.</p><p>In February, Panama formally <a href=\"/news/2025/2/7/china-blasts-us-as-panama-quits-belt-and-road-initiative\">withdrew</a> from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Then in March, the Panama Canal’s Hong Kong-based operator <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/china-scrutinising-hong-kong-firms-sale-of-panama-canal-ports\">announced</a> that it was selling most of its stake to a consortium of American companies – a move that followed Trump’s allegation that the vital waterway was controlled by China. In December, Mexico announced it would slap tariffs of up to 50 percent on Chinese goods, starting on January 1.</p><p>In Venezuela, US pressure is not related to its close ties to China, as it has more to do with US domestic politics: Rubio is seeking to fulfil a long-held political agenda to please opposition-minded Venezuelan and Cuban American constituencies.</p><p>Nevertheless, any regime change in Caracas would certainly hurt China’s interests. As the biggest customer of Venezuelan crude oil, China has a vested interest in maintaining Venezuela’s peace and stability. While China itself is not dependent on Venezuelan oil – with Venezuela not even ranking among its top 10 crude suppliers – the US’s interception of Venezuelan oil tankers nonetheless undermines China’s energy strategy, which aims to avoid becoming over-reliant on any single energy supplier.</p><h2 id=\"monroe-doctrine-2-0-or-a-trap\">Monroe Doctrine 2.0 or a trap?</h2><p>China views the escalation in Venezuela not only through the economic lens, but also through a geopolitical one. The larger context of US global power projection is important.</p><p>In the recently released National Security Strategy (NSS), the Trump administration declared that the days of the US acting as the world’s policeman are over, advocating instead for a return to the principles of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy strategy which sought to block any outside interference in the Americas that could infringe on US interests.</p><p>Although notably, the NSS does not designate China as the greatest threat to the US, it nonetheless states that the US government will maintain a military capable of deterring Chinese ambitions on Taiwan by military means.</p><p>This document, along with escalating US-Venezuela tensions, has sent mixed signals to China. On the one hand, the US appears to deprioritise competition with China and instead focus on reasserting its hegemony over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>On the other hand, it has not made any significant steps to indicate disengagement in Asia; for example, its military bases in South Korea and Japan remain fully operational.</p><p>Beijing fears that Washington might be trying to lure it into a false sense of security with its rhetoric and an ostensible geopolitical shift; thus, it remains cautious.</p><p>Following the NSS’s release, China put out a policy paper on Latin America and the Caribbean. Likely a response to recent events, the paper reflects Beijing’s attempt to bring the fight to the US’s doorstep.</p><p>However, the policies and strategies laid out in the document share the same shortcomings that Chinese foreign policy has always had: they offer support that is more symbolic than substantive. China’s attempt to rally the Global South under the banner of opposing US hegemony and to foster grievance-based unity, seriously falls short of its mark when confronted with American military might.</p><p>In this context and given Venezuela’s limited economic value to China and its geopolitical distance, the Chinese government would not commit any resources to defending the Latin American country.</p><p>In the event of a US invasion, China would likely leverage it to promote its vision of a multipolar world, and position itself as the champion of international law and the UN Charter. While it would consider the US being bogged down in a protracted war a positive development, China would almost certainly not come to Venezuela’s aid.</p><p>A US toppling of the Venezuelan government, however, would expose the limits of Chinese power in the region. Such a scenario would undoubtedly prompt many Latin American countries to reconsider whether aligning themselves with China is a good idea when an aggressive US is so close by.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
