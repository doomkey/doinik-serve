The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, a rate that has remained unchanged since July 2009.</p><p>About one in six American adults holds student loan debt, which totals about $1.6 trillion. As of April, more than 5 million borrowers had not made a payment in at least a year, according to the Education Department.</p><p>The garnishments are planned as economic pressure mounts for many Americans amid rising prices and a cooling labour market. According to consulting firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, more than 1.1 million people lost their jobs in 2025 as job growth slowed. Federal data also showed mixed employment trends in recent months with job losses reported in October followed by modest gains in November.</p><p>In the months of October and November, the unemployment rate <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/16/us-unemployment-hits-highest-level-since-2021-as-labour-market-cools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased to 4.6 percent,</a> the highest since 2021, according to the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>“Families are being forced to choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table. The Trump administration’s decision to begin garnishing wages takes even that meagre choice away from student loan borrowers who are living on the brink,” Julie Margetta Morgan, former deputy undersecretary at the Education Department under former President Joe Biden, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Instead of solving the affordability crisis that’s leaving Americans unable to pay their student loans, the president is further punishing families and forcing them to forgo the very basics.”</p><p>In addition to wages, the federal government has the authority to garnish income from tax refunds, Social Security benefits and certain disability payments.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Tuesday, the Israeli parliament <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-extends-law-that-banned-al-jazeera-for-two-more-years\">approved the extension of the law</a> for two years after it was introduced during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza to essentially stop Al Jazeera’s operations in Israel.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Separately, the government is also moving to shut down the popular Army Radio network, one of two publicly funded Israeli news outlets. The radio station is often criticised by the Israeli right wing, which views Army Radio as being biased against it.</p><p>Israelis are still reliant on receiving their news from traditional outlets with about half relying on broadcast news for information on current affairs and about a third similarly relying upon radio stations.</p><p>The tone of the media that is allowed to publish and broadcast is important. According to <a href=\"/features/2025/6/26/israels-media-amplifies-war-rhetoric-ignores-gazas-suffering\">analysts</a> inside Israel, the selective broadcasting of Palestinian suffering during Israel’s war on Gaza has helped sustain the carnage and reinforced a sense of grievance that allows for Israel’s continued assaults on Gaza as well as regional countries, such as Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.</p><p>Despite what observers characterise as a media environment firmly rigged in its favour, the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which contains ministers convicted of “terrorism” offences and others who have repeatedly called for the illegal annexation of the occupied West Bank, is looking nevertheless to bypass legal checks on its control of the media and bring more of Israel’s information feed under its control.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Because the government believes it is too critical.</p><p>Israeli politicians have long complained about how the war in Gaza has been covered in both the international and domestic media.</p><p>But the government added a new accusation in November, partly blaming the media for the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>“If there hadn’t been a media entirely mobilised to encourage refusal [to volunteer to reserve duty] and reckless opposition to the judicial reform, there wouldn’t have been such a rift in the nation that led the enemy to seize the opportunity,” Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said as he introduced a bill to increase government control of the news environment, referring to attempts by the Israeli government to <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/israels-parliament-passes-law-to-expand-coontrol-over-judge-appointments\">reduce the independence of the judiciary</a><span>.</span></p><figure id=\"attachment_2880252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2880252\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2880252\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP23191634215187-1714906834.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, speaks to Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi at the Knesset, Israel's parliament\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2880252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, speaks to Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi in the Knesset in West Jerusalem [File: Maya Alleruzzo/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the ‘Al Jazeera Law’, there are three items of legislation under way: a plan to privatise Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, the move to abolish Army Radio, and an initiative to bring the media regulator under government control.</p><p>Both Army Radio and Kan, the other state-funded outlet with editorial independence, have carried numerous reports critical of the government.</p><p>This week, Kan aired an interview with Netanyahu’s former spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who told the broadcaster that the prime minister had instructed him to develop a strategy to help <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/netanyahu-finally-announces-october-7-inquiry-why-are-israelis-furious\">evade responsibility</a> for the October 7 attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, justifying the move to shut down Army Radio, said on Monday that the outlet had become a platform to attack the Israeli military and its soldiers.</p><p>Israel is also potentially changing the way it regulates its media. In November, the Israeli parliament pressed ahead with a bill that would abolish existing media regulators and replace them with a new authority appointed by the government, potentially allowing for even greater state interference.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3872363\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3872363\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3872363\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-06-05T152912Z_1505392990_RC2358AH1Y5M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-POLITICS-1754322142.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel's Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara listens on as she attends a cabinet meeting at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem on June 5, 2024.

The minister can also shut the broadcaster’s offices, confiscate equipment used to produce its content and block access to its website.</p><h2 id=\"have-the-moves-been-criticised\">Have the moves been criticised?</h2><p>The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the United Kingdom’s National Union of Journalists have criticised Israel’s decision to legislate against foreign media platforms it deems a security threat.</p><p>In a statement, IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said: “Israel is openly waging a battle against media outlets, both local and foreign, that criticise the government’s narrative: that is typical behavior of authoritarian regimes. We are deeply concerned about the Israeli parliament passing this controversial bill, as it would be a serious blow to free speech and media freedom, and a direct attack on the public’s right to know.”</p><p>The attempt to shutter Army Radio has also been heavily criticised with Israeli Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara declaring the move unlawful and accusing Netanyahu’s coalition of making public broadcasting “weakened, threatened and institutionally silenced and its future shrouded in mist”.</p><p>Baharav-Miara has also criticised the move to place media regulation under government control, saying the bill “endangers the very principle of press freedom”.</p><p>Not very.</p><p>The Israeli media have overwhelmingly been a consistent cheerleader of the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza, where more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel, and in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The suffering of Palestinians is rarely shown, and when it is, it is often justified.</p><p>Even as Israel has killed <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/here-are-the-names-of-the-journalists-israel-killed-in-gaza\">more than 270 journalists and media workers</a> in Gaza, the Israeli media have provided cover for the actions of its government and military.</p><p>That means Israelis often don’t recogise the hypocrisy of their government’s statements.</p><p>An example came in June after Iran struck an evacuated hospital during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. The Israeli government called the incident a war crime, and the Israeli media reflected that outrage.</p><p>But the attack came after Israel had been accused by a variety of organisations, including the United Nations, of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system with medical workers targeted for arrest and frequently tortured despite their protection under international law.</p><p>“The Israeli media … sees its job as not to educate – it’s to shape and mould a public that is ready to support war and aggression,” journalist Orly Noy <a href=\"/features/2025/6/26/israels-media-amplifies-war-rhetoric-ignores-gazas-suffering\">told</a> Al Jazeera from West Jerusalem in the wake of the strike on the Israeli medical centre. “It genuinely sees itself as having a special role in this.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Among those were at least four flights on which Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell was also on board.</p><p>Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping late financier Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.</p><p>In a social media post in 2024, Trump said he “was never on Epstein’s Plane, or at his ‘stupid’ Island”. There was no allegation in the prosecutor’s email that Trump had committed any crime. The White House did not immediately respond to a request by the Reuters news agency for comment on the email.</p><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a statement on Tuesday saying some documents included “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump and had been submitted to the FBI after the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost, but it did not provide further details.</p><p>“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the DOJ said in a social media post.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration had fought against the release of the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/21/epstein-files-whose-names-and-photos-are-in-the-latest-document-drop\">Epstein-related documents</a> and has been accused of subverting the law passed in November when a tranche of documents released last week included <a href=\"/news/2025/12/21/slap-in-the-face-epstein-victims-slam-release-of-heavily-redacted-files\">heavy redactions</a>. The latest release includes about 8,000 files, which include video and audio recordings and 30,000 pages of documents.</p><p>Many names and details in the recent release are redacted. Some of the redactions appear to obscure the names of prosecutors and government officials, going beyond an exemption in the Epstein files law that allows for limited redactions to protect details about Epstein’s victims.</p><p>“On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case,” the document said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On one flight, the only three passengers were Trump, Epstein and a 20-year-old woman whose name is redacted.</p><p>Some videos were said to show the inside of a federal detention centre where Epstein died in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide, but speculation around the circumstances of his death has continued to swirl.</p><p>Trump has played down the significance of the Epstein files, stating on Monday that they were being used by his political rivals to “deflect against tremendous success” by his administration.</p><p>A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll suggested 52 percent of people in the US disapprove of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, while 23 percent approve. About 70 percent said they believed the government is hiding details about Epstein’s relationships with powerful associates who may have participated in sex trafficking of teenage girls.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans have continued to push for the release of further materials. Trump’s right-wing base has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-blasts-maga-focus-on-jeffrey-epstein-after-memo-causes-uproar\">been divided</a> over his handling of Epstein-related documents, which members of his administration had promised to release before entering the White House.</p><p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie accused Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday of “working fervently to redact, omit and delete Epstein files she is legally required to release under our bill”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Israeli media reported that US officials were displeased with Katz’s initial comments and demanded clarification.</p><p>Nahal units are military formations that combine civilian service with army enlistment and have historically played a role in the creation of Israeli communities.</p><p>Katz was speaking at a ceremony in the occupied West Bank marking the approval of 1,200 housing units in the illegal Israeli settlement of Beit El.</p><p>Addressing settlement expansion in the West Bank, Katz said: “Netanyahu’s government is a settlements government … it strives for action.

These homegrown systems intercept high-altitude suicide drones at a fraction of conventional missile costs, revolutionising modern air defence strategies.</p><p>Field technicians swiftly assemble equipment, attaching antennas and sensors to light stands and unpacking monitors and controls from protective cases as they prepare these game-changing weapons for immediate deployment.</p><p>The Sting with its thermos-like appearance exemplifies Ukraine’s innovative interceptor fleet. According to a unit commander, these systems neutralise Russia’s evolving suicide drones, which now operate faster and at higher altitudes.</p><p>“Every destroyed target is something that did not hit our homes, our families, our power plants,” said the officer, known only by the call sign “Loi” in line with Ukrainian military protocol. “The enemy does not sleep, and neither do we.”</p><p>Night-time bombardments of Ukrainian cities and power facilities have compelled Kyiv to transform its air defence strategy by developing affordable drone interceptors costing as little as $1,000. These systems have progressed from prototype to mass production within months during 2025, marking a pivotal evolution in contemporary warfare.</p><p>Ukraine’s defensive success now depends on mass manufacturing, rapid adaptation and integration of cost-efficient systems into existing networks rather than relying on traditional weapons that are limited, expensive and cannot be readily replaced.</p><p>Interceptors such as the Sting, produced by the volunteer-driven start-up Wild Hornets, and the newly introduced Bullet can rapidly accelerate before colliding with enemy drones. Pilots operate these systems with viewing displays or first-person-view goggles.</p><p>The economic advantage is proving decisive. Andrii Lavrenovych, who serves on the strategic council of the expanding start-up General Cherry, which develops the Bullet, said the drones it neutralises cost $10,000 to $300,000 each.</p><p>“We are inflicting serious economic damage,” he said.</p><p>Russia predominantly deploys the Iranian-designed Shahed suicide drone and has developed numerous variants of this triangle-winged aircraft equipped with jammers, cameras and turbojet engines in an ongoing innovation race.</p><p>“In some areas, they are one step ahead. In others, we invent an innovative solution, and they suffer from it,” Lavrenovych said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p><p>She added: “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”</p><h2 id=\"abuses-at-mega-prison\">‘Abuses’ at mega-prison</h2><p>The story – circulated online on Monday after it appeared to have streamed on Canada’s Global TV app – included allegations that Venezuelan deportees sent to the mega-prison had been tortured, and raised questions about how the United States characterised them.</p><p>Located on the edge of a jungle 75km (47 miles) southeast of San Salvador, <a href=\"/gallery/2025/8/26/el-salvador-cecot-prison-and-the-uss-school-of-the-americas\">CECOT</a> is a huge, maximum-security facility touted by El Salvador’s right-wing President Nayib Bukele as the centrepiece of his attempt to tackle narcotics gangs.</p><p>The facility has been at the centre of a major US legal case since March, when the Trump administration sent <a href=\"/news/2025/3/16/venezuelan-immigrants-deported-to-el-salvador-despite-us-court-ban\">hundreds of Venezuelan and other migrants</a> there, despite a judge’s order that they be returned to the US.</p><p>Several deportees who have since been released have described repeated abuse at the facility, where human rights activists say inmates are treated brutally.</p><h2 id=\"push-for-varied-perspectives-at-network\">Push for ‘varied perspectives’ at network</h2><p>The broadcaster’s decision to postpone the story follows growing criticism that it is increasingly pivoting towards an editorial line more in step with the conservative Trump administration.</p><p>Skydance Media, run by David Ellison – the son of Larry Ellison, a key donor to President Donald Trump ahead of his election last year – acquired Paramount in August, with regulatory approval for the deal helped along by a pledge that CBS News would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of US viewers.</p><p>In October, the company <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/conservative-writer-bari-weiss-named-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news\">named conservative media figure Bari Weiss</a>, known for her pro-Israel positions and frequent criticism of “woke” politics, as the editor-in-chief of CBS News, as part of what critics said was a push to steer the network in a direction more aligned with the Trump administration.</p><p>The outcry over the pulled story comes as Paramount Skydance is in a multibillion-dollar bidding war with Netflix to buy Warner Bros Discovery – a merger Trump has signalled he is watching closely, and which will likely require regulatory approval.</p><p>In a statement to The New York Times, Weiss said the network would be “airing this important piece when it’s ready” and downplayed the significance of the decision to postpone its airing.</p><p>“Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom.”</p><p>The executive producer of 60 Minutes, Tanya Simon, told fellow employees that she had resisted Weiss’s order, but “ultimately had to comply”.</p><p>“We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes,” Simon was quoted as saying by The Washington Post, in a transcript of the producer’s private meeting with colleagues.</p><h2 id=\"a-free-press-doesn-t-kowtow\">‘A free press doesn’t kowtow’</h2><p>The network’s decision to postpone the story has drawn widespread criticism across the US political and media spheres, with many voices expressing concerns that CBS News was already forgoing its journalistic obligations by censoring to curry favour with the Trump administration.</p><p>In an X post on Monday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “and his billionaire buddies ‌are trying to shape what people see and hear to create their own alternative reality”.</p><p>“The Trump administration doesn’t have a veto on what stories get told,” he added. “A free press doesn’t kowtow to the president – it holds him accountable.”</p><p>Liberal magazine The New Republic posted that the episode showed that political censorship of the media under the Trump administration was “already happening”, while Norm Ornstein, political scientist and contributing editor to The Atlantic magazine, wrote that the incident was “beyond monstrous”.</p><p>“There goes CBS,” posted podcaster and activist Amy Suskind. “All it took was Trump posting on social media about Warner Bros takeover. Weak capitulation!”</p><p>Columnist Matthew Yglesias wrote that it was “hilarious” that the report had leaked online despite it being blocked by CBS News executives.</p><p>“Canceling a news broadcast to curry favour with the regime and then accidentally releasing it in Canada anyway is genuinely hilarious,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I oppose genocide.” Thunberg has called Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide and has twice joined flotilla campaigns to try to break Israel’s siege of the territory.</p><p>The City of London Police, which polices the financial district, confirmed that a 22-year-old woman, a description corresponding to Thunberg, was arrested for displaying a placard “in support of a proscribed organisation (in this case Palestine Action) contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000”.</p><p>This is the latest protest in solidarity with activists from the Palestine Action group, five of whom are currently on <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-are-dying-in-prison-uk-doctor-warns\">hunger strike</a> in British prisons. The direct action group has been proscribed as a “terrorist organisation” by the United Kingdom’s government.</p><p>Defend Our Juries said Tuesday’s protest was held to draw attention to Aspen Insurance’s “complicity in genocide” and to express solidarity with prisoners affiliated with Palestine Action.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4191584\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4191584\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4191584\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image16-1766491732.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Greta Thunberg arrested at pro-Palestinian protest in London\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4191584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thunberg is seen after her arrest for holding a placard expressing support for Palestinian Action prisoners and condemnation of Israel’s genocide [Handout/Defend Our Juries]</figcaption></figure><p>Two others, a man and a woman, were also arrested at the protest although they had “glued themselves nearby”, according to the City of London Police, which described damage with “hammers and red paint” to “a building on Fenchurch Street”, where the offices of Aspen Insurance are located.</p><p>Defend Our Juries confirmed the damage, saying in a news release that two activists “covered the front of the building with symbolic blood-red paint, using re-purposed fire extinguishers” before attaching themselves to the front of the building in the aim of “drawing attention to Aspen’s complicity in Genocide, disrupting their business, and closing down the building”.</p><p>The group said Aspen Insurance, a global insurer and reinsurer, was targeted because of its affiliation with Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of Elbit Systems, which is Israel’s largest arms producer.

There are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/increasingly-likely-potential-of-palestine-action-hunger-strikers-dying\">rising fears</a> that one or more of them could soon die in jail.</p><p>In recent days, their relatives and loved ones have told Al Jazeera of their deteriorating health and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/two-palestine-action-hunger-strikers-in-uk-prisons-admitted-to-hospital\">repeated hospital admissions</a>.</p><p>Their lawyers have long called for a meeting with Justice Secretary David Lammy to discuss welfare and prison conditions, believing such an intervention could be <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-are-dying-in-prison-uk-doctor-warns\">life-saving</a>.</p><p>But the government has so far refused, saying hunger strikes are not an unusual phenomenon in prisons and that policies to provide adequate medical care to anyone refusing food are being followed.</p><p>“Our clients’ food refusal constitutes the largest co-ordinated hunger strike in British history since 1981,” the lawyers wrote, referring to the Irish Republican inmates led by Bobby Sands. Sands and nine others died of starvation, one on day 46 of the protest.</p><p>“As of today’s date, [the current] strike has lasted up to 51 days, nearly two months, and poses a significant risk to their life with each passing day,” the lawyers wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The detainees are being held in five prisons over their alleged involvement in break-ins at the United Kingdom’s subsidiary of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Bristol and a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire. They deny the charges against them, such as burglary and violent disorder.</p><p>Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Kamran Ahmed are on day 52, 51, 45 and 44 of their protests, respectively. Lewie Chiaramello, who is diabetic and refuses food every other day, began his protest 30 days ago.</p><p>Qesser Zuhrah, Jon Cink and Umer Khalid have ended their strike.</p><p>All eight will have spent more than a year in prison before their trials take place, well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>The hunger strikers’ five demands include immediate bail, the right to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action, which accuses the UK government of complicity in Israel’s war crimes in Gaza. The UK government banned Palestine Action in July, branding it a “terror” group, a label that applies to groups such as ISIL (ISIS). The protesters have called for an end to alleged censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books. They are also urging that all Elbit sites be closed.</p><h2 id=\"engage-with-each-one\">‘Engage with each one’</h2><p>Leading human rights barrister Michael Mansfield has backed calls for the government to intervene.</p><p>“It’s a simple proposition, engage with each one,” he told Al Jazeera. “That’s your job [as government], that’s what you’re there for. You are safeguarding people’s health, welfare and life.”</p><p>In a letter addressed to Lammy, he wrote, “Fundamental human rights in the United Kingdom are being destroyed in this quagmire of disinterest and populist politics, the most important being the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial by means of preparation and due process.</p><p>“There has to be an equality of arms which can hardly be achieved when a defendant is held in oppressive and lengthy periods of remand.”</p><p>Families of the prisoners have alleged mistreatment in prison, saying some detainees have been verbally abused and left without care in dangerous health conditions. The Ministry of Justice has denied these accusations and says it cannot comment on individual cases.</p><p>“Government takes action when it chooses to,” Mansfield wrote. “There could be no more appropriate time than now with the life-endangering protest by the hunger strikers. The delay is grotesque in some cases, up to two years with trial dates being set in 2027.”</p><p>Nida Jafri, a friend of hunger striker Amu Gib, plans to deliver Mansfield’s letter – and one of her own – in hand to the Ministry of Justice on Tuesday.</p><p>“These people are on remand – not convicted, still awaiting full legal process,” reads Jafri’s letter. “They are weak, in pain, and visibly wasting away. The absence of adequate medical observation or humane treatment under prison or hospital care is not only unacceptable; it breaches fundamental rights to health, dignity, and life.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
