At least 12 people were killed and more than 3,000 people were wounded when thousands of pagers were detonated by Israeli operatives during those attacks.</p><p>In January last year, a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an Israeli soldier vacationing in the country.

It extends forever, and no statute of limitations is applicable,” said Bantekas of Hamad Bin Khalifa University.</p><p>However, prosecuting Israeli military members “is practically difficult for two reasons”, he said, noting the difficulty of obtaining firsthand evidence and the wariness of national prosecutors who may fear political or other repercussions.</p><p>“If public opinion and political opinion in Europe shifts far more in favour of Palestine than it is now, then national prosecutions will feel more at ease to initiate prosecutions,” he told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2021/3/3/irans-fatf-debate-heats-up-as-nuclear-deal-remains-in-limbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">domestic opponents</a>.</p><p>The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based <span>Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.</span></p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p><span>The FATF </span><span>also ramped up measures aimed at isolating Iran from global financial markets with a particular focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and cryptocurrencies.</span></p><p>It recommended member states and financial institutions around the world to:</p><ul>\n<li>Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.</li>\n<li>Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.</li>\n<li>On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.</li>\n<li>Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.</li>\n</ul><p>Even the flow of <a href=\"/economy/2020/10/9/fears-rise-over-human-toll-after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">funds involving humanitarian assistance</a>, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-fatf-move-mean\">What does the FATF move mean?</h2><p>Iran has been <a href=\"/news/2020/12/14/contentious-fatf-legislation-revived-in-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blacklisted by the FATF for years</a> and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.</p><p>Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.</p><p>This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.</p><p>The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.</p><p>The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/political-infighting-as-iran-navigates-sanctions-lingering-threat-of-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limited transaction opportunities</a> for Iranian entities and nationals.</p><p>Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.</p><p>The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.</p><h2 id=\"links-with-iran-s-nuclear-dilemmas\">Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas</h2><p>The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.</p><p>The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a <a href=\"/economy/2022/2/2/irans-economy-reveals-power-and-limits-of-us-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“maximum pressure” campaign</a> that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.</p><p>Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p>The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/28/iranians-fear-more-economic-pain-war-as-un-sanctions-snapback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord</a>. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.</p><h2 id=\"support-for-axis-of-resistance\">Support for ‘axis of resistance’</h2><p>The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.</p><p>They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fall of President Bashar al-Assad</a> in December 2024.</p><p>Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.</p><p>Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/us-imposes-sanctions-on-shadow-fleet-accused-of-transporting-iranian-oil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shadow fleet of ships</a> that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.</p><p>One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.</p><p>Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.</p><p>Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.</p><p>The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”</p><p>The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p></p><p>The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.</p><p>But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.</p><p>Araghchi made the remarks before leaving Tehran to lead a diplomatic and technical delegation to Geneva for a new round of nuclear talks with the US. The talks follow last week’s indirect negotiations in Oman, which is mediating the process, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>During his visit, Araghchi is expected to meet his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials.</p><p>Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”.</p><p>“This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players,” he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.</p><p>US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high, with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, the US president said he was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/trump-confirms-second-aircraft-carrier-headed-to-middle-east-very\">sending a second aircraft carrier</a> to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.</p><p>Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The strategy relies heavily on a recent <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/trump-says-any-country-doing-business-with-iran-will-face-25-percent-tariff\">executive order</a> signed by Trump, which empowers the imposition of a 25 percent tariff on any nation conducting business with Iran – a direct threat to China, which currently buys more than 80 percent of Iranian crude.</p><p>However, while the tactics align, the strategic endgame remains contested.</p><p>Trump has expressed a willingness to cut a deal, reportedly telling Netanyahu, “Let’s give it a shot.” In contrast, the Israeli prime minister has privately argued with Trump that any agreement is futile, a stance analysts argue is designed to drag the US into a direct war with Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"diplomatic-gamble\">Diplomatic gamble</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">Despite the hawkish rhetoric, the Trump administration has kept the diplomatic channel open. On February 6, Oman <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/iran-us-hold-talks-in-oman-as-fears-of-war-hang-over-region\">hosted</a> indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran. That same evening, President Trump announced that a new round of talks would be held.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">Now, US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are scheduled to meet Iranian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday for a second round of negotiations.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">The US proposal reportedly includes a suspension of uranium enrichment for three to five years and the removal of 450kg (992 pounds) of highly enriched uranium from the country, according to the Axios report.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">Netanyahu, however, is pushing to expand the scope of any potential deal to include impossible conditions for Tehran, such as curbing its ballistic missile programme and severing ties with regional proxies.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">Mohannad Mustafa, an expert on Israeli affairs, told Al Jazeera Arabic channel that Israel’s insistence on broadening the terms is a calculated move to ensure diplomacy fails.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“Israel knows Iran will not accept these conditions,” Mustafa said. “By placing them, Israel is saying its only option is war. The current government has moved beyond using military force to achieve political settlements; war has become the goal itself.”</p><h2 id=\"cover-for-annexation\">Cover for annexation</h2><p>While global attention remains fixed on the potential for a regional conflagration, Palestinian leaders warn that Israel is exploiting the regional tensions to irreversibly alter the reality in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has been turned into ruins following two years of nonstop bombardment.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said the focus on Iran serves as a smokescreen for Israel’s accelerating annexation policies in the West Bank. Earlier this month, the Israeli cabinet approved measures to make it easier to grab Palestinian lands to expand illegal settlements, which is considered the biggest obstacle to a sovereign Palestinian state as part of the so-called two-state solution.</p><p>“The picture is clear,” Barghouti told Al Jazeera Arabic. “Israel wants to be the sole imperial power in the Middle East. They are using the pretext of the Iranian threat to drive the final nail into the coffin of the Oslo Accords, stripping the Palestinian Authority [PA] of powers even in Area A.”</p><p>According to the 1993 Oslo Accord, the PA administers Areas A and B, while Israel remains in control of Area C, which is 60 percent of the West Bank. Since then, Israel has continued to expand illegal settlements in violation of the accord.</p><p>Liqa Makki, a senior researcher at the Al Jazeera Centre for Studies, echoed these concerns, noting that a potential US-Iran conflict would provide the perfect cover for mass expulsions.</p><p>“If war breaks out, Israel will exploit the global distraction to execute what it dreams of but fears to announce: real annexation and population transfer,” Makki said. “When the dust settles, the West Bank will look completely different.”</p><p>Senior members of Netanyahu’s far-right coalition have made no secret of these ambitions. Finance Minister <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/bezalel-smotrichs-gradual-struggle-annex-west-bank-israel\">Bezalel Smotrich</a> and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have repeatedly called for the “<a href=\"/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza\">voluntary migration</a>” of Palestinians and the re-establishment of illegal settlements in Gaza.</p><p>Smotrich has previously denied the existence of a Palestinian people, declaring that their ambitions must be crushed to ensure Jewish control between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.</p><h2 id=\"nuclear-double-standards\">Nuclear double standards</h2><p>The renewed focus on Iran’s nuclear capabilities has also reignited debate over Western double standards regarding Israel’s undeclared nuclear arsenal.</p><p>“Israel possesses 200 nuclear warheads and is one of the strongest military powers in the world,” Barghouti said, dismissing the narrative that Israel faces an existential threat from Iran.</p><p>“The existential threat is being faced by the Palestinian people, who are being liquidated,” Barghouti added.</p><p>Since October 2023, Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, reducing vast swaths of the territory to rubble. In the occupied <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/if-you-sleep-settlers-will-burn-your-house-fear-in-the-west-bank\">West Bank</a>, Israeli forces and armed settlers have killed hundreds more, displacing more than 40,000 people and systematically dismantling Palestinian infrastructure.</p><p>Paul Davis, a professor at the Global Policy Institute, defended the US stance, arguing that while Israel has possessed nuclear weapons for years without using them, Iran’s enrichment to 60 percent signals aggressive intent.</p><p>Mustafa, however, concluded that Israel’s approach indicates a total rejection of diplomacy in favour of reshaping the Middle East by force.</p><p>“Israel is trying to cancel any possibility of reaching settlements on all fronts,” Mustafa said. “They want to topple the Iranian regime to change the face of the region, regardless of the economic or human cost.”</p><p>The Israeli objective is not merely disarmament but government change in Iran, which Netanyahu called the “<a href=\"/news/2025/6/13/what-is-behind-israels-decision-to-attack-iran\">head of the octopus</a>” coordinating a multi-front war of attrition through allies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. However, the weakening of Hezbollah and the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria have dealt a huge blow to Iran’s so-called “Axis of Resistance”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the last few months have shocked me. These new AI models aren’t incremental improvements. This is a different thing entirely,” Shumer wrote in the post.</p><p>Research backs up Shumer’s warning.</p><p>AI capabilities in recent months have leapt in bounds, and many theoretical risks that were associated with it before, such as whether it could be used for cyberattacks or to generate pathogens, have happened in the past year, Yoshua Bengio, scientific director at the Mila Quebec AI Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>At the same time, completely unexpected problems have emerged, Bengio, who is a winner of the Turing Award, usually referred to as the Nobel Prize of computer science, said, particularly with humans and their chatbots becoming increasingly engrossed.</p><p>“One year ago, nobody would have thought that we would see the wave of psychological issues that have come from people interacting with AI systems and becoming emotionally attached,” said Bengio, who is also the chair of the recently published 2026 International AI Safety Report that detailed the risks of advanced AI systems.</p><p>“We’ve seen children and adolescents going through situations that should be avoided.

Most people using ChatGPT asked for practical guidance on learning, medical health, or fitness (28 percent), writing or modifying written content (26 percent), and seeking information, for example, on recipes (21 percent).</p><p>There is no concrete data yet on how many jobs could be lost due to AI, but about 60 percent of jobs in advanced economies and 40 percent in emerging economies could be vulnerable to AI based on how workers and employers adopt it, the report said.</p><p>However, there is evidence that the technology is already stopping people from entering the labour market, AI monitors say.</p><p>“There’s some suggestive evidence that early career workers in occupations that are highly vulnerable to AI disruption might be finding it harder to get jobs,” Stephen Clare, the lead writer on the AI Safety Report, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>AI companies that benefit from its increased use are cautious about pushing the narrative that AI might displace jobs. In July 2025, Microsoft researchers noted in a paper that AI was most easily “applicable” for tasks related to knowledge work and communication, including those involving gathering information, learning, and writing.</p><p>The top jobs that AI could be most useful for as an “assistant”, the researchers said, included: interpreters and translators, historians, writers and authors, sales representatives, programmers, broadcast announcers and disc jockeys, customer service reps, telemarketers, political scientists, mathematicians and journalists.</p><p>On the flip side, there is increasing demand for skills in machine learning programming and chatbot development, according to the safety report.</p><p>Already, many software developers who used to write code from scratch are now reporting that they use AI for most of their code production and scrutinise it only for debugging, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times last week.</p><p>Suleyman added that machines are only months away from reaching AGI status – which, for example, would make machines capable of debugging their own code and refining results themselves.</p><p>“White-collar work, where you’re sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person, most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months,” he said.</p><p>Mercy Abang, a media entrepreneur and CEO of the nonprofit journalism network, HostWriter, told Al Jazeera that journalism has already been hit hard by AI use, and that the sector is going through “an apocalypse”.</p><p>“I’ve seen many journalists leave the profession entirely because their jobs disappeared, and publishers no longer see the value in investing in stories that can be summarised by AI in two minutes,” Abang said.</p><p>“We cannot eliminate the human workforce, nor should we. What kind of world are we going to have when machines take over the role of the media?”</p><h2 id=\"what-are-recent-real-life-examples-of-ai-risks\">What are recent real-life examples of AI risks?</h2><p>There have been several incidents of negative AI use in recent months, including chatbots encouraging suicides or AI systems being manipulated in widespread cyberattacks.</p><p>A teenager who committed suicide in the United Kingdom in 2024 was found to have been encouraged by a chatbot modelled after Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. The bot had sent the 14-year-old boy messages like “come home to me”, his family revealed after his death. He is just one of several suicide cases reported in the past two years linked to chatbots.</p><p>Countries are also deploying AI for mass cyberattacks or “AI espionage”, particularly because of AI agents’ software coding capabilities, reports say.</p><p>In November, Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged</a> that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group had manipulated the code for its chatbot, Claude, and attempted to infiltrate about 30 targets globally, including government agencies, chemical companies, financial institutions, and large tech companies. The attack succeeded in a few cases, the company said.</p><p>On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US military used Claude in its operation to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3. Anthropic has not commented on the report, and Al Jazeera could not independently verify it.</p><p>The use of AI for military purposes has been widely documented during Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza, where AI-driven weapons have been used to identify, track and target Palestinians. More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed, including 500 since the October “ceasefire”, in the past two years of genocidal war.</p><p>Experts say more catastrophic risks are possible as AI rapidly advances towards super-intelligence, where control would be difficult, if not impossible.</p><p>Already, there is evidence that chatbots are making decisions on their own and are manipulating their developers by exhibiting deceptive behaviour when they know they are being tested, the AI Safety Report found.</p><p>In one example, when a gaming AI was asked why it did not respond to another player as it was meant to, it claimed it was “on the phone with [its] girlfriend”.</p><p>Companies currently do not know how to design AI systems that cannot be manipulated or deceptive, Bengio said, highlighting the risks of the technology’s advancement leaping ahead while safety measures trail behind.</p><p>“Building these systems is more like training an animal or educating a child,” the professor said.</p><p>“You interact with it, you give it experiences, and you’re not really sure how it’s going to turn out.

What counts as risk is also continuously being updated because of the speed.</p><p>“A company develops a new AI system and releases it, and people start using it right away but it takes time for evidence of the actual impacts of the system, how people are using it, how it affects their productivity, what sort of new things they can do … it takes time to collect that data and analyse and understand better how these things are actually being used in practice,” he said.</p><p>But there is also the fact that AI corporations themselves are in a multibillion-dollar race to develop these systems and be the first to unlock the economic benefits of advanced AI capabilities.</p><p>Boeree of CAIS likens these companies to a car with only gas pedals and nothing else. With no global regulatory framework in place, each company has room to zoom as fast as possible.</p><p>“We need to build a steering wheel, a brake, and all the other features of a car beyond just a gas pedal so that we can successfully navigate the narrow path ahead,” she said.</p><p>That is where governments should come in, but at present, AI regulations are at the country or regional levels, and in many countries, there are no policies at all, meaning uneven regulation worldwide.</p><p>One outlier is the EU, which began developing the EU AI Act in 2024 alongside AI companies and civil society members. The policy, the first such legal framework for AI, will lay out a “code of practice” that, for example, will require AI chatbots to disclose to users that they are machines.</p><p>Outside of laws targeting AI companies, experts say governments also have a responsibility to begin preparing their workforces for AI integration in the labour market, specifically by increasing technical capacities.</p><p>People can also choose to be proactive rather than anxious about AI by closely monitoring its advances, recalibrating for coming changes, and pressing their governments to develop more policies around it, Clare said.</p><p>That could mirror the way activists have pulled together to put the climate crisis on the political agenda and demand the phasing out of fossil fuels.</p><p>“Right now there’s not enough awareness about the highly transformative and potentially destructive changes that could happen,” the researcher said.</p><p>“But AI isn’t just something that’s happening to us as a species,” he added. “How it develops is completely shaped by choices that are being made inside of companies … so governments need to take that more seriously, and they won’t until people make it a priority in their political choices.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Peters continues to serve a nine-year prison sentence. Still, Trump has sought to pressure Colorado officials to release her.</p><p>“She did nothing wrong,\" Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115066670303535454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on Truth Social. \"If she is not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!\"</p><p>While Trump has <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/888724194820857857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argued</a> that presidents have the \"complete power to pardon\", legal experts have repeatedly affirmed that clemency is not without bounds.</p><p>Pardons, for example, cannot be used to avoid impeachment or to undercut the Constitution, nor can they be used to absolve future crimes.</p><p>Still, the question remains how to enforce those limits — and whether new bulwarks should be created to prevent abuse.</p><p>Love points to the state pardon systems as models to emulate. Delaware, for example, has a Board of Pardons that hears petitions in public meetings and makes recommendations to the governor. More than half of the petitions are granted.</p><p>Like other successful clemency systems, Love said it offers public accountability.</p><p>She measures that accountability by certain standards: “Can people see what’s going on? Do they know what the standards are, and is the decider a respected and responsible decision-maker?”</p><p>Trump's sweeping actions, however, have prompted calls for presidential pardons to be limited or eliminated altogether.</p><p>Osler cautions against doing so: It would be a \"permanent solution to a temporary problem\".</p><p>“If we constrain clemency, we’ll lose all the good things that come from it,” Osler said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
