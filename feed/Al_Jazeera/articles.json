Viktor Gyokeres also scored twice for the leaders.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">Eze came close to joining Tottenham in the summer, only for Arsenal – his boyhood club – to swoop in and sign him instead for a reported 60 million pounds ($80m). Spurs are suffering even more now – his only goals since the start of November have come against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">Arsenal rebounded after two straight draws that have let second-place Manchester City back in the title race.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Gunners regained their five-point lead but City has a game in hand and still has to host Mikel Arteta’s team in the league in mid-April. They also meet in the English League Cup final on March 22.</p><p class=\"p1\">It proved to be a tough start to life as Tottenham manager for Igor Tudor, who has made a habit of picking up good results early in his tenures at previous clubs.</p><p class=\"p1\">Not this time, though. Tottenham did equalise two minutes after conceding the opener to Eze when Randal Kolo Muani dispossessed Declan Rice and drilled home a finish for 1-1 in the 34th.</p><p class=\"p1\">Gyokeres made it 2-1 with a shot from the edge of the area in the 47th and Eze stretched the lead in the 61st with a rebound after Bukayo Saka’s shot was saved. Gyokeres scored again in stoppage time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Arsenal has 10 league games remaining in their bid for a first top-flight title since 2004.</p><p>Eze has scored six league goals this season, of which five have been against Spurs. Asked why he holds that record against their rivals, he told Sky Sports: “I don’t know. I try to score every single game. It seems to work quite a lot against Tottenham. It’s a feeling you get.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Premier League on Sunday, ‌Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister struck a winner deep into ⁠stoppage-time as ⁠his side snatched a scarcely-deserved 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest in their Premier League clash.</p><p class=\"p1\">After a pedestrian ⁠90 minutes in which they barely managed a shot on target, Mac Allister lit the fuse with a stoppage-time effort that was ⁠ruled out for handball before rifling home a rebound in the 97th minute to snatch the win.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, with doubts swirling around the future of Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, his team dug out a 1-0 win over last-place Wolverhampton thanks to a last-minute goal.</p><p class=\"p1\">Evann Guessand prodded home a far-post finish after coming on as a substitute.</p><p class=\"p2\">Fulham climbed above Sunderland into the top half of the table after becoming just the second visiting side to win at the Stadium of Light this season.</p><p class=\"p2\">Raul Jimenez’s double secured a 3-1 victory for Marco Silva’s men.</p></div></div></body></html>"

South Africa in their first cricket match of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup and now must win their next two games to have a chance of reaching the semifinals.</p><p>The defending champions were bowled out for 111 in 18.5 overs while chasing a target of 188 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Sunday.</p><p>It was the cohosts’ first loss of the tournament and also ended their 12-match winning streak in the T20 World Cup that they had carried on from their title-winning run in 2024.</p><p>South Africa’s bowlers put on a near-perfect display against a strong Indian batting lineup, and were backed by their fielders to leave the pre-tournament favourites reeling.</p><p>India lost their in-form opener Ishan Kishan on the fourth ball of the innings to the offspin bowling of South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram while trying to hit against the spin.</p><p>One-down batter Tilak Varma was the next to fall as he was caught behind off the first ball of Marco Jansen’s over.</p><p>India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav and out-of-form star batter Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild their innings until Sharma fell in the fifth over after scoring 15 runs off 12 deliveries.</p><p>Incoming batter Washington Sundar and Yadav were the next two wickets to fall as India failed to build a big partnership in front of a large home crowd.</p><p>A 35-run partnership between all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube lifted the Indian run chase briefly, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and near-faultless fielding resulted in regular dismissals for the home side.</p><p>When Dube fell for 42 off 37, India’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Jansen’s superb bowling earned him four wickets for 22 runs off 3.5 overs , while left-arm spin bowler Keshav Maharaj took three for 24 in his four overs.</p><p>All of South Africa’s bowlers were economical, with Lungi Ngidi leading the way by conceding only 15 runs in his four wicketless overs.</p><p>Earlier, player of the match David Miller’s crucial innings of 63 runs off 35 balls stabilised South Africa’s innings after they were reduced to 20-3 in four overs.</p><p>He shared a 97-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who scored 45 off 29 balls, as the pair resurrected the Proteas after Markram decided to bat first after winning the toss in the first Super Eight match in Group 1.</p><p>Despite Miller’s dismissal in the 16th over, South Africa were able to post a formidable total of 187-7, thanks to a 24-ball 44 not out by Tristan Stubbs at the end of the innings.</p><p>Jasprit Bumrah picked up 3-15 off his four overs.</p><p>The loss propels South Africa to the top of Group 1 in the Super Eight stage, with India at the bottom with a net run rate of -3.80.</p><p>The defending champions must win their remaining two games to have a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.</p><p>West Indies and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in their group and will face each other on Monday.</p><p>South Africa face the West Indies on Thursday, while India play Zimbabwe on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is roughly 50km (31 miles) wide at its entrance and exit and narrows to about 33km (20 miles) at its tightest point. It forms the only maritime link between the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.</p><p data-start=\"1757\" data-end=\"2003\">Despite its narrow width, the channel accommodates the world’s largest crude carriers. Major Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters rely on it to move supplies to international markets while importing nations depend on its uninterrupted operation.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3794723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-Strait-of-Hormuz-Map-Iran-Israel-1750677677.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Strait of Hormuz Map Iran Israel-1750677677\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-and-gas-pass-through-the-strait\">How much oil and gas pass through the strait?</h2><p data-start=\"2056\" data-end=\"2326\">According to the US <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65504\">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), about 20 million barrels of oil transited through the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024. That equates to nearly $500bn in annual energy trade, underlining the waterway’s central role in the global economy.</p><p data-start=\"2328\" data-end=\"2564\">The crude passing through the strait originates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2508\">Any prolonged disruption would rattle producers and the economies that depend on their exports.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2803\">The strait also plays a critical role in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. In 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes, according to EIA <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65584\">data</a>.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-it-all-go\">Where does it all go?</h2><p data-start=\"2832\" data-end=\"3009\">The strait handles LNG flows in both directions. Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the US and West Africa.</p><p data-start=\"3011\" data-end=\"3257\">The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asia.</p><p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3516\">China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year.

At its narrowest stretch, the Strait of Hormuz and its designated shipping lanes fall entirely within the territorial waters of Iran and Oman.</p><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"518\">That legal reality gives Tehran geographic leverage. About 3,000 vessels transit the strait each month.

He cautioned: “Oil prices have been highly reactive to geopolitical tensions in recent weeks, and as a result, prices could spike to well over $100 per barrel if there were to be a major disruption.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325065\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325065\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325065\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-15T190353Z_1949412274_RC27GJAEQ307_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-USA-CARRIER-1-1771517393.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Frank E.

Several major Asian economies depend heavily on shipments transiting through the strait.</p><p data-start=\"5872\" data-end=\"6128\">Almost half of India’s crude oil imports and about 60 percent of its natural gas supplies move through the Strait of Hormuz.

The court said tariffs are a form of taxation, and under Article I of the Constitution, the power to tax belongs exclusively to Congress.</p><p>The court’s ruling, however, does not apply to Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium, lumber and automotives since these were imposed under a different law – Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.</p><p>Following the verdict, a furious Trump called the Supreme Court judges “fools and lapdogs” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution”. He immediately signed an executive order under Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to impose a blanket 10 percent tariff on all countries the US trades with, starting on February 24. On Saturday, he raised the tariff to 15 percent, the highest rate allowed under this trade law.</p><p>So, what is this new trade law that Trump has used to impose tariffs? What does this mean for trade deals the US has already signed with countries around the world?</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-new-trade-law-trump-is-using\">What is the new trade law Trump is using?</h2><p>Under US law, Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 empowers the president to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/20/tariff-refunds-could-take-years-amid-us-supreme-court-ruling-experts-warn\">impose tariffs</a> of up to 15 percent to address “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits”.</p><p>Tariffs can be imposed under this law only for 150 days unless the US Congress agrees to extend it. Trump is the first president to use this law to impose tariffs.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-a-temporary-import-duty-to-address-fundamental-international-payment-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Friday, the White House said some goods, such as certain agricultural products like beef, tomatoes, natural resources and fertilisers that cannot be grown or produced in the US, aerospace products, among others, will not be subject to the temporary levy.</p><p>Shantanu Singh, an international trade lawyer, noted that since this is the first time this legal authority has been used by any US president, it could likely be litigated.</p><p>“But the government has considerable leeway to determine this as trade deficits can form part of balance-of-payments deficits,” he told Al Jazeera. Trump has justified the tariffs as a way to balance the US’s trade deficits of more than $900bn.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-to-the-trade-deals\">What happens to the trade deals?</h2><p>Several countries had signed trade deals to cushion themselves from Trump’s punishing tariffs last year. The United Kingdom, India and the European Union, among others, had entered into deals to lower tariffs on their exports to the US.</p><p>But the ongoing tariff spectacle has thrown the future of those trade deals into doubt. Will they be charged the new 15 percent tariff or the agreed rate signed in the trade deals? Will India be tariffed at 18 percent, as per the trade deal, or 15 percent as announced by Trump on Saturday?</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said some of these trade agreements will stand.</p><p>“The trade deals, because they are international, will likely remain in place,” Singh, the international trade lawyer, said.</p><p>However, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, he said, the big incentive for doing trade deals with the Trump administration, which was to get a lower reciprocal tariff rate before competitors, has vanished.</p><p>“That reduces the incentive for trade partners to comply with their part of the deal for the time being,” he said.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the trade agreements and what their future looks like.</p><h3 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h3><p>The UK was one of the first to sign a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/8/us-uk-trade-deal-how-are-trumps-global-tariff-talks-shaping-up\">trade deal</a> with the US last May after being hit by 5 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts.</p><p>Under their <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/1/us-uk-agree-to-zero-tariffs-on-medicines-uk-commits-to-higher-spending\">agreement</a>, the US agreed that there would be zero tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the UK, and for other goods, it was set at 10 percent. Last December, the two nations also agreed to zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals and medical products.</p><p>After Friday’s Supreme Court ruling, William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said in a <a href=\"https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/news/2026/02/new-tariff-rate-a-further-blow-to-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> that the ruling does “little to clear the murky waters for business”.</p><p>On Friday, a spokesperson told the media that the British government was “working with the US” to understand more about how the court’s ruling will affect the UK.</p><p>The court ruling will not impact the UK’s deal on steel, aluminium and pharmaceutical exports.</p><p>But Bain said the new 15 percent global tariff rate, which has been imposed under Section 122 of the Trade Act 1974, “will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses and weaken global economic growth”.</p><h3 id=\"china\">China</h3><p>Trump had imposed one of the highest tariffs on China, and the world’s two largest economies were engaged in a trade war. At one point, they had slapped reciprocal tariffs exceeding 100 percent on some goods.</p><p>The two countries have yet to sign a trade deal, but they agreed to lower the tariffs as part of a trade truce.</p><p>After several rounds of trade talks and a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the two countries agreed to a one-year truce with a 10 percent baseline tariff. Trump also slashed the so-called fentanyl tariff to 10 percent.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will lift tariffs imposed on chemicals used in fentanyl. However, tariffs on other Chinese exports, such as electric vehicles, aluminium and steel, will remain.</p><p>Following the court’s ruling, Chinese Embassy spokesperson in the US, Liu Pengyu, told journalists that tariffs and trade wars serve neither the US nor China’s interests. He called on Beijing and Washington to work together to “provide greater certainty and stability for China-US economic and trade cooperation and the global economy”.</p><p>Trump is scheduled to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/trump-to-make-three-day-visit-to-china-next-month-white-house-says\">travel</a> to China from March 31 to April 2 to meet Xi and discuss trade.</p><p>But Singh, the trade lawyer, said countries like China that did not negotiate deals with the US are quite well placed because, as a result of the court’s ruling and repeal of the reciprocal tariffs, they have achieved a lower rate of tariff without having to make concessions.</p><p>“China will definitely feel it has the upper hand going into negotiations with the US,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"south-east-asia\">South East Asia</h3><p>Last year, South East Asian countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia entered into trade agreements with the Trump administration to lower tariffs.</p><p>Malaysia reduced its tariff from 25 percent to 19 percent, while Cambodia’s tariff dropped from 49 percent to 19 percent after their respective trade agreements with the US last year. Vietnam and Indonesia also signed deals, reducing their tariffs to 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively.</p><p>After ⁠the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News that US imports from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate was fixed at 15 percent on Saturday.</p><p>Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, also said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent remains in force despite the court decision.</p><h3 id=\"india\">India</h3><p>At 50 percent, India faced among the highest US tariffs. The US first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent citing the country’s purchases of Russian oil as the reason.</p><p>Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\">trade deal</a>. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.</p><p>An Indian trade delegation, which was scheduled to travel to the US to finalise details of the trade agreement, has been postponed.</p><h3 id=\"european-union\">European Union</h3><p>Last July, the EU and the US struck a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">deal</a> to avert a transatlantic trade war after Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imports from the 27-member bloc. Under the agreement, EU exports to the US would face a 15 percent tariff.</p><p>The deal, however, had not yet come into effect since EU lawmakers paused its ratification after Trump threatened to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, last month.</p><p>The European Parliament’s trade committee is set to vote on the EU’s trade deal with the US on February 24, but the Supreme Court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs have made the future of the deal uncertain.</p><p>An EU commission spokesperson told journalists after the court’s ruling that the bloc is in “close contact” with the US administration to seek more clarity.</p><h3 id=\"mexico\">Mexico</h3><p><a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/mexicos-tariffs-on-india-are-a-double-whammy-after-us-tariffs\">Mexico</a> was one of the first countries to be targeted by Trump’s tariffs last year. It was hit by a 25 percent tariff on some pharmaceuticals, and an additional 25 percent “fentanyl tariff” over what Trump said is the flow of drugs across the Mexican border into the US.</p><p>Approximately 85 percent of Mexican exports to the US were exempt from tariffs because of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into force in July 2020.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will reduce the tariffs on Mexico’s exports.</p><p>However, the USMCA is set to be reviewed again later this year, and it is uncertain whether products exempt from US tariffs under it will face levies if the agreement lapses.</p><p>Mexico’s Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said he will travel to the US in the near future to discuss the issue.</p><h3 id=\"canada\">Canada</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/canadas-carney-hails-new-trade-deals-expects-us-to-respect-sovereignty\">Canada</a> faces 35 percent tariffs on goods from certain sectors, like steel and aluminium, and most of its goods have also been impacted by a 50 percent levy on imported metals and a 25 percent duty on non-US cars.</p><p>Most of its goods are exempt under the existing USMCA.</p><p>Following the court verdict, Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told journalists that significant work remains as Washington-imposed tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber and automobiles remain in place.</p><p>Moreover, with the USMCA review coming up later this year, some Canadian leaders are also worried about what Trump could do next.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Countries are waiting to hear how exactly the top court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs will play out.</p><p>Singh, the trade lawyer, said the US administration will likely use the 150-day period during which the 15 percent Section 122 global tariffs will be effective.</p><p>“During this period, the United States trade representative will swiftly conduct investigations under another legal authority – Section 301 – to make findings on unfair trade practices of its trade partners and try to reinstate the reciprocal tariff rates which were invalidated,” he said.</p><p>“The trade deals could then be adjusted to reflect this new reality.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The conflict triggered an exodus of nearly one million Lebanese people that included many Muslims and Christians.</p><p>Some settled in cities like Maicao, where one of the largest mosques in Latin America was built and completed in 1997.</p><p>The continued migration into Colombia has contributed to the diversity of its Muslim community.</p><p>In Bogota, Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi speaks proudly of the range of nationalities in his jamaat, or congregation, at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in the west of the city.</p><p>“There are people of different nationalities, approximately 10 or 15 different countries, and we find great diversity in this centre,” Qurtubi explained after delivering the Taraweeh prayer marking the first night of Ramadan.</p><p>Though there are no official statistics on the origins of Colombia’s Muslim population, Qurtubi has noticed an increase in Muslim converts.</p><p>He estimates that roughly 100 to 200 worshippers in his jamaat are new to the religion.

I’m in shock,” said Andrey, a 30-year-old Muscovite.</p><p>“It’s just like Europe – everybody’s complaining about the prices there too. Even if you only buy some beer, cigs and chocolate, you still wind up spending at least 1,000 roubles [$13] at the store. But in Moscow, people’s purchasing power hasn’t obviously fallen much. Kids are crowded in lines at supermarket cafes. The whole city is full of taxi drivers and endless delivery drivers.”</p><p>Some things have changed.</p><p>“It became very problematic to find some brands that you used to buy before,” said Kirill F, a 39-year-old photographer from St Petersburg who requested that his full name not be disclosed.</p><p>“They can be found from resellers, but they’ve become more expensive, and they’re no longer sold in stores,” he said. Some South Korean brands have returned to Russia, he said. LG washing machines and refrigerators are now available again.</p><p>Chinese brands are also available, but they are “not as good quality as the tech we used to get from Germany or Poland”, Kirill said.</p><p>To get around overseas payment restrictions because of Western sanctions, for example on apps, Kirill opened a bank account in Kyrgyzstan. It’s not an insurmountable obstacle but an annoyance, he said.</p><p>But Kirill is less sanguine about the restrictions imposed by his own government. Since 2022, the Kremlin has introduced <a href=\"/news/2023/3/24/activists-everyday-russians-and-a-soldier-punished-for-war-talk\">strict laws</a> penalising what it calls “fake news” about the invasion. Additionally, the authorities have blocked social media such as Instagram and Facebook and made it harder to use WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube, promoting state-backed alternatives such <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/28/nuum-we-hardly-knew-ye\">RuTube</a> and the messaging app <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/19/russia-s-national-messenger-was-billed-as-a-platform-for-the-people-it-s-dominated-by-state-run-channels\">Max</a> instead.</p><p>“At first, we were blocked from using Facebook, but we had few people using it and they just installed VPNs, and then YouTube was banned,” Kirill recounted.</p><p>“For ordinary citizens, this blockage just worsens life.

The Russian military now attracts <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/despite-huge-manpower-losses-how-is-russia-replenishing-its-military\">plenty</a> of recruits through generous pay packets rather than relying on conscripts.</p><p>“At first, I thought [the war] was wrong, like what ‘denazification’ are you talking about?” Vladislav told Al Jazeera via Telegram before hastily deleting his messages. The Kremlin has described the Ukrainian leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as pro-Nazi, and has insisted that its military operation is driven by a desire to “denazify” Ukraine.</p><p>“But then the Ukrainian side started posting photos of swastikas, SS skulls and other symbols of fascist ideology,” Vladislav said, referring to symbols that have appeared on some Ukrainian soldiers’ uniforms and unit flags. “… Both my grandparents were WWII veterans; may they rest in peace.”</p><p>Now, he said, he agrees with Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Zelenskyy and his entire fascist fraternity must be destroyed, no more prisons. … I hope my brother will make a huge contribution,” he added. “He’s a great guy, an excellent driver, and the fact that he spent so much time playing simulation games will help him defeat every Nazi scum in Ukraine.”</p><p>Kirill, too, had his doubts about the invasion, considering the outbreak of war a failure of Russian diplomacy, and still shakes his head when he sees Russian pro-war symbols in public.</p><p>But as time went on, his attitude towards both peace and liberals grew more jaded.</p><p>“We read both the foreign press and the liberal analysts, who told us the Russian economy had two weeks left, yet here we are four years later, and everything’s fine. What do you think our attitude will be towards the people who told us such things?” he asked rhetorically.</p><p>“I believe that since it’s already begun, we need to go all the way to victory,” Kirill added. “If you started a fight, you can’t just say ‘I’m sorry’ and stop. That is to say, I don’t support [the invasion], but I also don’t support reparations, all this nonsense. No one will go for it. Even among those who are against the war, they don’t want to lose completely because their lives will be adversely affected.”</p><p>Then there’s the question of apathy. Historically, many Russians have concerned themselves more with day-to-day survival than the machinations of power, a trend that has continued with the “special military operation”.</p><p>“Everyone’s in denial. Almost everyone in my circles is staunchly apolitical and tries to ignore the news,” Andrey observed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329297\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329297\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24222450478643-1771759053.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Emergency workers and soldiers push a damaged car after a Russian missile hit a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 9, 2024.

Having completed both his national service, a 12-month mandatory draft, and a previous deployment to Syria, the 38-year-old trucker from Kemerovo in Siberia was mobilised into the elite Ural Battalion, where he was assigned the post of machinegunner in a support platoon.</p><p>“We’d been told for years that everything in Ukraine was steeped in Nazism and hatred of Russia and Russians,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“At the time, I thought and assumed this was a punitive operation aimed at the regime in that country than at the Ukrainian people as a whole.”</p><p>By January 2023, Medvedev’s unit entered the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, setting up base in an abandoned mine. Medvedev considered himself lucky to have been assigned to a support platoon because the assault squads “suffered 60 or 70 percent casualties in an hour of combat”.</p><p>Travelling through war-torn Ukrainian villages and speaking with the locals, Medvedev began questioning his mission. “The realisation that I was fighting a war that no one needed, that would bring no good to anyone in this world but would only produce a mountain of corpses, widows, orphans and miserable mothers and fathers haunted me,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On July 7, 2023, he went AWOL and tried to return to his hometown.</p><p>“For the first few months after returning, I didn’t understand what was going on around me at all.

Among them were young men fearing they would be conscripted and sent to the front lines as well as those with deeply held anti-Putin convictions, such as 35-year-old Mike* from Russia’s fourth largest city.</p><p>Mike packed one small bag and decided “to get the hell out of Yekaterinburg”.</p><p>Mike has since settled in Berlin, where he’s involved in an activist community helping those still in the country.

Rising anti-immigrant sentiment, including in Germany, isn’t helping.</p><p>“Life is good, but I’m more and more conscious of my immigration status,” Mike said. “I didn’t plan on leaving [Russia], but I’m not fantasising about returning.”</p><p><em>*Some names have been changed for the security of interviewees while others requested that their full name not be disclosed.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On February 16, a group of Palestinian footballers, clubs and advocacy groups referred the heads of FIFA and UEFA to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 120-page filing accuses Gianni Infantino and Aleksander Čeferin of “aiding and abetting war crimes (specifically, the transfer of civilian population into occupied territories) and crimes against humanity (specifically, apartheid)”.</p><p>This historic case marks the first time sports leaders are being accused of these crimes and sends a warning to presidents of all other corporate entities in and beyond athletics. It offers a perfect opportunity to challenge the impunity of Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide.</p><p>Football is the world’s most popular form of cultural expression, with some five billion fans across the planet. Therefore, the stakes of this charge are immense in terms of the spectacle of accountability and legal precedent.</p><p>In the course of its campaign in Gaza, of genocide generally and “athleticide” particularly, Israel has killed 1,007 Palestinian sportspeople and destroyed 184 sports facilities, while damaging 81 others.</p><p>Although this “athleticide” cannot be directly attributed to the Israel Football Association (IFA), its activities linked to clubs from illegal Israeli settlements located on the occupied Palestinian territory and their participation in domestic and international tournaments can be seen as abetting Israeli crimes of occupation and apartheid.</p><p>Despite facing demands for the suspension of these clubs or the IFA, UEFA and FIFA leadership have taken no action. In a recent <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/fifa-president-sorry-for-british-football-fan-remarks-and-criticises-football-bans-and-boycotts-13502326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a>, FIFA chief Infantino said he opposed a ban on Israeli teams from participation in global football, calling it “a defeat”. He went on to add that he was in favour of enshrining in FIFA statutes that no country should ever be banned from “playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.</p><p>Ironic, when you consider he is the very person who oversaw the <a href=\"/news/2022/2/28/russia-expelled-from-world-cup-clubs-banned-from-competitions\">suspension of Russia</a> from FIFA in 2022 and the banning of Crimean clubs from playing in the Russian league, linked to UEFA, after the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.</p><p>The complaint is filed against Infantino and Čeferin because private organisations cannot be defendants before the ICC, but those individuals responsible for their policies can be.</p><p>The focus of the complaint is the fact that the IFA has been permitted to materially support, recognise, and include in domestic and international competitions clubs that are based in the stolen settlement land of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Article 64(2) of FIFA Statutes prohibits member associations and their clubs from playing on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.</p><p>The complaint alleges that by allowing the IFA to oversee clubs that operate on stolen land, Infantino and Čeferin are accountable for normalising illegal Israeli settlements, in direct contravention of a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">2024 pronouncement</a> by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly, which found the settlements to be “unlawful” and required Israel to “cease immediately all new settlement activities, and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.</p><p>The existence of sanctioned Israeli clubs in West Bank settlements, the referral argues, contributes to the transfer of the civilian population into the occupied territory, contrary to the Rome Statute Article 8(2)(b)(viii), by normalising colonisation.</p><p>Likewise, because Israeli clubs in the occupied territory prohibit Palestinians from spectating matches or playing for or managing these teams, the continued sanction of these organisations falls under the definition of aiding and abetting apartheid (a crime against humanity pursuant to Rome Statute Article 7(1)(j).</p><p>In continuing to allow the membership of these clubs and the IFA in global and European sport, the filing alleges that Infantino and Čeferin have acted in full knowledge that they have participated in the violation of international law based on the fact that they have deliberately ignored numerous reports and letters advising them to intervene.</p><p>Now that the complaint has been formally filed, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC will conduct a preliminary examination to confirm that the elements of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the interests of justice have been satisfied. They will then have the option to either decline to open the investigation or proceed to investigate the legal issues raised in the complaint.</p><p>If an investigation does ensue, evidence-gathering will occur and arrest warrants or summonses may ultimately be issued. If that happens, this would set an important precedent and give momentum to the campaign for justice for Palestine.</p><p>It is notable that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been able to dodge an ICC arrest warrant by cowering away from Rome Statute signatory states, it would be impossible for Infantino and Čeferin to do so while still fulfilling their roles, assuming it is enforced.</p><p>Football is, without question, one of the most popular sports on the planet. When such a cultural juggernaut is connected to business, what emerges is an industry like no other. FIFA and UEFA are global <a href=\"https://studentbriefs.law.gwu.edu/ilpb/2022/04/20/the-fifa-legal-monopoly-can-fifa-be-fixed/\">regulatory monopolies</a>, meaning their rules and regulations act the same way a country’s legislation acts on its population. They also preside over a huge, lucrative industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Given the amount of eyeballs and money at stake, the impact of a ban on participation is enormous, as Russia understands all too well after being subjected to suspension. This is no doubt exactly why the presidents of these organisations have refused to act against Israel under the guise of “political neutrality”.</p><p>As former UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Michael Lynk, told us: “When an occupying power is blatantly committing war crimes by creating civilian settlements in occupied territory, the rest of the world – including states, corporations and international sporting organisations – is required to ensure the enforcement of international law by doing everything in their power to bring the violations to a swift end. Yet, FIFA and UEFA are sportswashing the illegal Israeli occupation by allowing the Israeli Football Association to include clubs based in the illegal settlements to participate in their domestic leagues. Nothing could be further from the rules of fairness and equity.”</p><p>The bottom line is that sport is and has always been political. The veneer of “political neutrality” conceals the reality that politics is the name of the game for FIFA and UEFA.</p><p>Nobody is entitled to stand above international law. It is time for the ICC to prove it.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
