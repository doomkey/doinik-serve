We have nothing to eat,” the distraught father told Al Jazeera, breaking down in tears with his wife under the blue tarpaulin where they are sheltering.</p><p>Khaled reported his son’s disappearance to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and every official body he could reach, to radio silence. To this day, he has received no answers on Ahmed’s whereabouts.</p><p>Khaled’s story is all too common under Israel’s ongoing punishing blockade of Gaza, where the largely displaced population faces a stark choice between starvation and braving the bullets fired by Israeli soldiers and United States security contractors in a bid to get food from Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sites. These distribution points have been dubbed “death traps” and “human slaughterhouses” by the United Nations and rights groups.</p><p>It is a life-or-death gamble that has taken the lives of nearly 1,400 people, shot dead mainly by the Israeli army, at the aid sites since they started operations in late May and along food convoy routes, according to figures released by the UN last week. That is, without counting the untold numbers of missing aid seekers, like Ahmed.</p><p>Human rights monitors have been collecting harrowing firsthand accounts of people who have gone missing in Gaza, only to be found later, killed by Israeli forces.</p><p>“In many cases, those who went missing are apparently killed near the aid distribution points, but due to the Israeli targeting, their bodies remained unreachable,” Maha Hussaini, the head of media at the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Many Palestinians left home with empty hands, hoping to return with a bag of flour.

Israel’s Channel 12 cited an official as saying that Netanyahu was tending towards expanding the offensive.</p><p>The announcement came on another bloody day in the Strip, with at least 74 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks since dawn on Monday, including 36 aid seekers, according to medical sources.</p><p>Among the attacks, at least three people were killed by an Israeli strike on a house in Deir el-Balah, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.</p><p>A source at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City reported that seven people were killed in Israeli shelling on multiple areas in the Shujayea neighbourhood, east of Gaza City.</p><p>Emergency services said that two were killed in an Israeli bombing of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza.</p><p>It also emerged on Monday that a nurse at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah was killed when he was hit by an airdropped box of aid.</p><p>This week, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, described the dangerous airdrops as a “distraction” and smokescreen.</p><p>On Monday, UNICEF warned that 28 children – essentially an entire “classroom” – are dying each day from Israeli bombardment and lack of aid.</p><p>“Gaza’s children need food, water, medicine and protection.

Starvation is always something that is done by one person to another. It’s intended to be protracted and to maximise suffering,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Soon, metabolism slows, the ability to regulate temperature is lost, kidney function becomes impaired and, critically in Gaza, the immune system begins to falter and the body’s ability to heal from injury is reduced.</p><p>Once the body’s reserves are used up, it loses the ability to channel nutrients to vital organs and tissues. As a result, essential organs like the heart and lungs become less effective.

The loss of muscle and fat occurs almost immediately. Equally, those in older age groups will also die quicker,” Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a Palestinian British surgeon who spent 43 days working in Gaza, said.</p><p>“However, it isn’t just age. There are social differences, too,” he continued.</p><p>“There are currently thousands of orphans roaming Gaza. There is no one to feed them or risk their lives to get food for them, so they’re also more likely to die,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-people-who-are-dying-of-hunger-in-gaza\">Who are the people who are dying of hunger in Gaza?</h2><p>There is overwhelming evidence that, through the various blockades Israel has imposed on Gaza, the threat of death by starvation has spread from the vulnerable to everyone in Gaza.</p><p>In February 2024, five months into Israel’s war on Gaza, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six children under the age of two, especially in Gaza’s north –  at the <a href=\"/news/2024/2/22/israeli-siege-turns-gazas-nasser-hospital-into-a-place-of-death\">time under Israeli siege </a>–  were acutely malnourished.</p><p>As of August 2025, 82 adults have starved to death over the last five weeks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-has-been-limiting-gaza-s-food-for-years-how-has-that-affected-the-people-there\">Israel has been limiting Gaza’s food for years.

But Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told analysts last week that the impact from a strike by the machinists who build fighter jets, weapons systems and the US Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft would be much less than a walkout last year by 33,000 workers who assemble the company’s commercial jetliners.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,” Ortberg said. “So we’ll manage through this. I wouldn’t worry too much about the implications of the strike.”</p><p>The 2024 strike shut down Boeing’s factories in Washington state for more than seven weeks at a bleak time for the company. Boeing came under several federal investigations last year after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.</p><p>The <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/23/boeing-reaches-deal-with-us-doj-to-avoid-prosecution-over-737-max-crashes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Aviation Administration</a> put limits on Boeing plane production that it said would last until the agency felt confident about manufacturing quality safeguards at the company. The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the planes crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.</p><p>Ortberg told analysts that the company has slowly <a href=\"/economy/2024/12/6/us-judge-rejects-boeing-plea-deal-in-fatal-max-737-crashes\">worked its way up</a> to an FAA-set 737 Max production cap of 38 per month and expects to ask regulators later this year for permission to go beyond it.</p><p>Last week, Boeing reported that its second-quarter revenue had improved and its losses had narrowed. The company lost $611m in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $1.44bn during the same period last year.</p><p>Boeing’s stock tumbled on the news of the strike.

But modern life has long been characterised by a lack of proper sleep – an activity that happens to be fundamental to life itself.</p><p>I personally cannot count the times I have awakened at one or two o’clock in the morning to work, unable to banish from my brain the capitalist guilt at engaging in necessary restorative rest rather than being, you know, “productive” 24 hours a day.</p><p>And yet mine is a privileged variety of semi-self-imposed sleep deprivation; I am not, for example, being denied adequate rest because I have to work three jobs to put food on the table for my family.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States, approximately one-third of US adults and children under the age of 14 get insufficient sleep, putting them at increased risk for anxiety, depression, heart disease, and a host of other potentially life-threatening maladies. As per CDC calculations, a full 75 percent of US high schoolers do not sleep enough.</p><p>While the recommended amount of sleep for adults is at least seven hours per day, a 2024 Gallup poll <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">reported</a> that 20 percent of US adults were getting five hours or less – a trend attributable in part to rising stress levels among the population.</p><p>To be sure, it’s easy to feel stressed out when your government appears more interested in sending billions upon billions of dollars to Israel to assist in the ongoing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/28/israeli-human-rights-group-israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">genocide of Palestinians</a> in the Gaza Strip than in, say, facilitating existence for Americans by offering <a href=\"/opinions/2024/12/9/no-surprise-americans-are-rooting-for-the-unitedhealthcare-ceos-killer\">healthcare</a>, education, and housing options that don’t require folks to work themselves to death to afford.</p><p>Then again, pervasive stress and anxiety work just fine for those sectors of the for-profit medical establishment that make bank off of treating such afflictions.</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking of the Gaza Strip, residents of the occupied territory are well acquainted with acute sleep deprivation, which is currently a component of the Israeli military’s genocidal arsenal for wearing Palestinians down both physically and psychologically. Not that a good night’s sleep in Gaza was ever really within the realm of possibility – even prior to the <a href=\"/opinions/2023/10/15/israel-and-the-weaponisation-of-empathy\">launch</a> of the all-out genocide in 2023 – given Israel’s <a href=\"/opinions/2022/8/12/israel-normalising-terror-one-dawn-at-a-time\">decades-long terrorisation</a> of the Strip via periodic bombardments, massacres, sonic booms, the ubiquitous deployment of buzzing drones, and other manoeuvres designed to inflict individual and collective trauma.</p><p>A study on trauma and sleep disruption in Gaza – conducted in November 2024 and published this year in the peer-reviewed journal BMC Psychology – notes that, in the present context of Israel’s round-the-clock assault, “the act of falling asleep is imbued with existential dread”. The study quotes one Gaza mother who had already lost three of her seven children to Israeli bombings: “Every time I close my eyes, I see my children in front of me, so I’m afraid to sleep.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Of course, Israel’s penchant for killing entire families in their sleep no doubt exacerbates the fear associated with it. The study observes that children in Gaza have been “stripped of the simple peace that sleep should offer, forced to endure nightmares born from real-life horrors”, while overcrowded shelters have rendered the pursuit of shut-eye ever more elusive.</p><p>Furthermore, mass forced displacement in the Gaza Strip “has deprived families of their homes, severing the link between sleep and security”.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/sleep-human-right-and-its-deprivation-torture/2024-10\">article</a> in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics argues that sleep is a human right that is integral to human health – and that its deprivation is torture. It seems we can thus go ahead and add mass torture to the list of US-backed Israeli atrocities in Gaza.</p><p>Naturally, the US has engaged in plenty of do-it-yourself torture over the years, as well, including against detainees in Guantanamo Bay – where sleep deprivation was standard practice along with waterboarding, “rectal rehydration”, and other so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques”.</p><p>In her 2022 <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3927&amp;context=mlr\">study</a> of sleep deprivation as a form of torture, published by the Maryland Law Review, Deena N Sharuk cites the case of Mohammed Jawad, an Afghan teenager imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay in 2003 and subjected to what was “referred to as the Frequent Flyer Program”, whereby detainees were repeatedly moved between cells in order to disrupt their sleep.</p><p>According to Sharuk, Jawad was moved “every three hours for fourteen consecutive days, totaling 112 moves”. The young man subsequently attempted suicide.</p><p>Now, the ever-expanding array of immigration detention facilities in the US offers new opportunities to withhold sleep, as victims of the country’s war on refuge seekers are crammed into cages illuminated at all hours by fluorescent lights.</p><p>And while a well-rested world would surely be a more serene one, such a prospect remains the stuff of dreams.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
