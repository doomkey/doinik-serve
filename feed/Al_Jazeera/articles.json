Earlier this year, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/handshake-in-dhaka-can-india-and-pakistan-revive-ties-in-2026\">attended</a> the funeral of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose son Rahman is set to be the next Bangladeshi prime minister.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311348\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311348\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311348\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jaishankar-Rahman-1770981508.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C627&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met BNP chief Tarique Rahman on December 31 last year to condole on the passing of his mother, former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia.

Now that the elections are over, that has become a reality.”</p><p>Asif Bin Ali, a geopolitical analyst at Georgia State University, said an elected government in Bangladesh would have “strong incentives to move back to a working relationship with India, even if it cannot and should not reproduce the level of political closeness seen under Sheikh Hasina”.</p><p>“I expect a more cautious middle position that stresses mutual respect, reciprocal sovereignty and noninterference in each other’s domestic politics, while keeping space for Dhaka’s own strategic autonomy,” Ali told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Still, major irritants persist besides Hasina – the unresolved water sharing disputes over rivers such as Teesta, deadly border shootings by Indian forces and a large trade deficit in India’s favour.</p><p>The new government will also face pressure at home to adopt a firmer tone towards New Delhi, particularly amid anti-India sentiment among a large section of Bangladeshi youth, who allege “excessive Indian interference” in the country’s internal affairs.</p><p>Saleh Shahriar of North South University in Dhaka questioned how far the BNP would go in its dealings with India. “Tarique Rahman’s BNP is different from Khaleda Zia’s BNP,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"the-pakistan-pivot\">The Pakistan pivot</h2><p>Where India confronts uncertainty, Pakistan has seen an opportunity.</p><p>Under Bangladesh’s interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct flights, exchanged high-level civilian and military visits, and eased visa procedures, among various other <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">confidence-building steps</a>.</p><p>Analysts say that momentum could gather pace under a BNP government.</p><p>Former Pakistani foreign secretary and diplomat Salman Bashir told Al Jazeera the Bangladesh election “marks the end of Awami League’s long dalliance” with India and “a reopening of close relations” with Pakistan.</p><p>“Bangladesh does not have to balance its relations with India and Pakistan,” Bashir said. “Ties with Pakistan have improved.

Ties with China would be strengthened. In short, it means a reversal of India’s dominant posture in the region,” he said.</p><p>Other analysts, however, urge caution. “Bangladesh’s economic interests and geography ensure India remains its primary neighbour,” said Ali, the analyst at Georgia State University.</p><p>Praveen Donthi of the International Crisis Group thinks Dhaka will try to balance relations with both Beijing and New Delhi, with possible outreach to Islamabad as well. He said India pursues a pragmatic approach to its strategic and foreign policy, “though it may sometimes take time to reorient itself”.</p><p>Shahab Enam Khan, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said the BNP will pursue a “more transactional approach” towards both Islamabad and Delhi.</p><p>“Pakistan, as a natural regional neighbour, will benefit from more transparent and structured cooperation,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"new-chapter-with-china\">New chapter with China?</h2><p>Perhaps the most consequential relationship for the incoming Bangladesh government will be with China.</p><p>Beijing maintained strong ties with Hasina, while also cultivating links across Bangladesh’s political spectrum, positioning itself regardless of the domestic political dynamics.</p><p>Under Hasina’s long rule, China expanded its economic footprint through its Belt and Road Initiative, deepening infrastructure investments and military cooperation with Dhaka.</p><p>The interim government that succeeded Hasina also secured about $2.1bn in Chinese investments, loans and grants, alongside high-level visits to Beijing, including by Yunus.</p><p>On Friday, the Chinese embassy congratulated the BNP on its victory, expressing readiness to work with the new government on “writing new chapters of China-Bangladesh relations”.</p><p>Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said the BNP would likely “further deepen its relations with China, hearkening back to the past experience of friendly ties” under the previous governments led by the party.</p><p>At the same time, he noted, Bangladesh will face a “growing American opposition to China’s increased presence” in the region.</p><p>Ali of the Georgia State University argued that Dhaka’s most viable path would be to “keep Chinese investment and connectivity projects where they serve Bangladesh’s interests, while making foreign policy more predictable and rules-based” in relation to China, India and the US.</p><p>“If Dhaka can be transparent about its red lines and priorities and keep the China file focused on economics rather than security symbolism, it will have a better chance of avoiding being dragged into major power rivalries while protecting its own strategic space,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"dhaka-s-delicate-balancing-act\">Dhaka’s delicate balancing act</h2><p>As Rahman prepares to assume office, he faces what Shahriar, professor at North South University in Dhaka, describes as a “great power competition in the Bay of Bengal region”.</p><p>The BNP manifesto emphasised a “Bangladesh First” policy, which called for all international relations and engagements to prioritise national sovereignty, security and the welfare of the people.</p><p>“The reality is, as a sovereign country, Bangladesh needs to develop its relations with all the countries, including China, Pakistan, Myanmar.

criminal operations,” the lawmakers said in their letter.</p><p>“While you no longer serve as British Ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that

The camps are also the primary targets of Israeli military operations in the West Bank.</p><p>Without the prospect of a normal childhood for their occupants, the lure of fighting Israel can often prove irresistible.</p><p>Nablus-based psychologist, Nisreen Bsharat, said “martyrdom”, particularly for those in the camps, is viewed as the ultimate demonstration of faith and resilience.</p><p>Bsharat, who works with young people and grieving mothers from Balata, said martyrdom is seen as a “’heroic’ contribution to Palestine”, and that martyrs and their families are celebrated as such.</p><p>Those who fight against Israel are seen as “role models” when so few opportunities exist in refugee camps, Bsharat added.</p><p>“Historically, martyrdom is tied to our national identity,” she said. “It’s seen as the least we can offer our homeland, and part of our duty.”</p><p>Though far from an exclusively Islamic concept, Palestinians often refer to those who are killed by Israeli forces as martyrs, believing they sacrifice their lives fighting for their nation, Islam, and the Holy Land – and believe that God promises them their place in paradise.</p><p>Bethlehem-based clinical psychologist and academic, Amanda Manasra, who was born in Aida refugee camp, and focuses on trauma in Palestine, told Al Jazeera the vast majority of camp residents live with untreated complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which is significantly more difficult to cure.</p><p>The harsh environment of the camps creates a revolutionary fervour that is far less common in wealthier areas, Manasra added.</p><p>“The idea of martyrdom is related to how Palestinians find meaning to deal with hardship, individually and collectively,” she said.</p><p>“Many of my cases are adolescent men from the camps – many former prisoners – who have lost so many friends and family members.</p><p>“Joining the resistance is about taking control – it can feel like a reward for experiencing hardship, and can satisfy feelings of retribution.</p><p>“The fighters feel they have survived, persisted, and beaten the occupation war machine.”</p><p>Camps in the northern West Bank came under even more relentless attack since Israel launched “Operation Iron Wall” in January 2025, which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees in nearby Jenin and Tulkarem, and killed hundreds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312021\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312021\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/A-side-street-with-tributes-to-martyrs-above-1771005091.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A side street in Nablus\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tributes to Palestinians killed fighting Israel are visible across Balata [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2>Psychological toll</h2><p>Belal, who spent eight years in Palestinian Authority (PA) prison during Wael’s childhood, feels the pain of his son’s loss deeply.</p><p>They both had only ever known the narrow, labyrinthine streets and decrepit buildings of Balata, the most populous refugee camp in the West Bank. But Belal feels that he wasn’t able to be there to guide Wael through them.</p><p>“I didn’t get the chance to see Wael growing up, or spend time with him as all other fathers do,” he said, unable to fight back his tears.</p><p>“I envy his mother and brother because at least they lived with him. They have beautiful and plentiful memories with him, shared moments.</p><p>“Do you know what it feels like to carry your son on your shoulders, place him in his grave, and bury him with your own hands? It is the hardest thing in the world.”</p><p>Belal, whose brother was also killed by Israel when he was younger, said he and his son had so many plans for when he would be released from prison.</p><p>In the end, Belal was freed only on compassionate grounds so he could see Wael for the final time before he was buried.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Israel’s actions breed hatred</h2><p>For those in Nablus’s refugee camps, violent incidents like Wael’s killing are nearly a weekly reality – and a doom-laden reminder that death lurks around every corner.</p><p>Belal recalled Wael becoming deeply affected as a child by the 20-year imprisonment of his closest uncle, after whom he was named. Later, he became preoccupied with avenging those close to him whose lives he says Israel had stolen. Four of Wael’s cousins had been killed in the 12 months preceding his death.</p><p>“Of course, it was also the constant invasions and the violence he grew up around, and the barbaric way the soldiers treat us,” Belal told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every night, we experience the atmosphere of Israel’s raids. We’re forced to accept this life – we have no choice but to adjust.”</p><p>Belal said that when Wael was growing up, there were no youth clubs or even parks that could take his mind off the harsh life in the camp. He added that soldiers had once raided the family’s house and destroyed “literally everything”.</p><p>“It’s actions like these that breed hatred toward them.”</p><p>Belal specifically remembered Wael, who had just begun high school, being enraged by footage of Israeli soldiers beating women in Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites.</p><p>“Wael couldn’t accept that soldiers would beat women and girls,” he said. “It was intolerable for him.”</p><p>Wael’s surviving family live in a crowded second-floor apartment near the centre of the camp, and his father, two of his brothers, his little sister, and his grieving mother took turns tearfully eulogising him.</p><p>His mother, Hanadi, was beaten, and his brother, Ibrahim, was also detained as soldiers broke into their apartment late at night to arrest Wael.</p><p>Hanadi was shocked by Wael’s condition once he was released from prison.</p><p>“The marks of torture remained on his body even after his release,” she said. “Burn scars from extinguished cigarettes were visible on his back and hands.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Refugee camps under siege</h2><p>Balata has often been a target for the Israeli military, and, according to the UN, 30 people have been killed in the camp since Israel intensified its attacks on the West Bank following Hamas’s October 7 attacks.</p><p>The pictures of Palestinians killed fighting Israel are emblazoned, like shrines, on the camp’s walls.</p><p>About 33,000 people are crammed into Balata’s narrow streets. It spans an area of 0.25 square kilometres (0.1sq miles), and has one of the highest rates of unemployment and food insecurity anywhere in the territory, according to UNRWA.</p><p>On August 15, Wael and two other fighters rushed to confront an incursion of Israeli soldiers when they were struck by a drone on the camp’s main street. Wael and fellow fighter Ahmad Khalil were killed instantly, while four others, including children, were injured.</p><p>Hanadi described the camp being surrounded by soldiers while gunshots rang close by, as she comforted her younger children.</p><p>“The moment I heard the sound of the missile, I knew he had been martyred,” she said.</p><p>“I started praying for God to accept him and to give me strength to bear this calamity.</p><p>“I also prayed that his face would remain unharmed because he always wished his face wouldn’t be disfigured so we could say our goodbyes to him properly.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Tsunami of trauma</h2><p>Manasra said there is a tsunami of untreated mental health problems across the West Bank, while services remain hopelessly stretched, underfunded, and inaccessible for most.</p><p>She says the glorification surrounding resistance to Israel and martyrdom also obscures a more difficult reality of unprocessed grief and trauma that lingers with individuals and families forever.</p><p>Supporting families in the camps like Belal’s is nearly impossible when services are so costly and restricted, she says.</p><p>Without any such mental health support, Belal spoke of his suffering and told Al Jazeera that, since his son’s death, “joy has not entered our house”.</p><p>“We may smile or laugh at each other to show politeness, but inside, it’s different,” he added.</p><p>“Inside, there’s only fire – and pain.”</p><p>Too often, the burden of resistance falls on the poorest residents of the West Bank’s refugee camps.</p><p>In each case, the reason for resisting is different. But there are nearly always similarities: Hardship, piety, retribution, and a sense of duty to one’s country.</p><p>The pride found in resisting only briefly distracts from the deep scars left by Israel’s occupation, which is tightening its grip over the West Bank – particularly in the refugee camps.</p><p>The surviving families of those killed are left somewhere between terrible grief and hopeful adulation.</p><p>“When I sit alone, I imagine Wael beside me,” Belal added.</p><p>“Sometimes, I feel like hugging his picture tightly to my chest as I cry my heart out.</p><p>“He was a role model even for me. I bid him farewell with complete serenity – I know God will accept him as a martyr.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Critics have questioned whether Jeri’s outfit — which had a deep hood that rendered him nearly unrecognisable — was meant to be a disguise.</p><p>Additional footage placed Jeri at another one of Yang’s businesses days later. Jeri also allegedly met a second Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was reportedly under house arrest for illegal activities.</p><p>Jeri has dismissed some of the off-the-books meetings as planning for an upcoming Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. Others, he said, were simply shopping trips for sweets and other food. He has denied wrongdoing but has acknowledged taking the meetings was a “mistake”.</p><p>“I have not lied to the country. I have not done anything illegal,” Jeri told the news outlet Canal N.</p><p>But critics have accused Jeri of using his position for influence-peddling at the unregistered interactions.</p><p>Similar accusations erupted earlier this month when Peruvian media highlighted the irregular hiring of several women in Jeri’s administration and contracts he awarded as possible evidence of bribery.</p><p>The debate over Jeri’s removal comes as Peru hurtles towards a general election on April 12, with the presidency up for grabs.

I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”</p><p>It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration.</p><p>That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate.</p><p>In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p><p>Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally.</p><p>But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term.</p><p>Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment.</p><p>He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November.</p><p>“Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote.</p><p>A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote.</p><p>The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation.</p><p>But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures.</p><p>They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity.</p><p>That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot.</p><p>Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness.</p><p>Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections.</p><p>The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level.</p><p>But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process.</p><p>“We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.”</p><p>His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month.</p><p>The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack.</p><p>That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional.</p><p>The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act.</p><p>But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber.</p><p>Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday.</p><p>“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote.</p><p>He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”.</p><p>But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push.</p><p>“These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement.</p><p>“Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>‘The only safety net they have’</h3><p>Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters.</p><p>“Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained.</p><p>“They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said.</p><p>Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls.</p><p>That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha.</p><p>Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism.</p><p>Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend.</p><p>History also appears to be repeating.</p><p>Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/will-pro-military-message-bring-thailands-most-hawkish-party-to-power\">Nationalism also played a big part</a> in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia.</p><p>Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"politicians-buy-the-poverty-of-rural-people\">‘Politicians buy the poverty of rural people’</h2><p>Now, as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/as-thais-head-to-polls-can-the-reformist-peoples-party-break-the-cycle\">election analysts assess the results</a>, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc.</p><p>“Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok.</p><p>“When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said.</p><p>Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote.</p><p>Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy.</p><p>For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty.</p><p>“These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said.</p><p>The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say.</p><p>The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say.</p><p>“The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong.</p><p>“A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere.</p><p>“They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then, on June 6, it abruptly announced Abrego Garcia had been returned, only to file criminal charges against him and seek his deportation a second time.</p><p>Another case involved a Guatemalan man, identified only by his initials OCG.</p><p>He had been under a court protection order that barred him from being returned to Guatemala, for fear that his identity as a gay man would subject him to persecution.</p><p>But the Trump administration detained and deported him instead to Mexico, which in turn sent him back to Guatemala. He subsequently went into hiding for his safety.</p><p>In June, OCG was returned to the US after a court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. It also noted that OCG’s deportation “lacked any semblance of due process”.</p><p>Lopez Belloza continues her studies at Babson College remotely from Honduras as she awaits the outcome of her legal proceedings.</p></div></div></body></html>"
