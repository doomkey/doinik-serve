There were no injuries as a result of the attacks, the administration said on Telegram, quoting Governor Andrei Bocharov.</li>\n<li>Russia downed 99 drones overnight over 12 Russian regions, the Crimean Peninsula and the Black Sea, the Russian Ministry of Defence said.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles in an overnight attack that killed three people in Ukraine’s Dnipro and the nearby region on Saturday, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted 183 drones and 17 missiles, but hits from 10 missiles and 25 drones were recorded in nine locations.</li>\n<li>Drones once again targeted Moscow, said the city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and an industrial facility in the Penza oblast southeast of the capital, according to the region’s governor, Oleg Melnichenko. In the Rostov region, officials said, Ukrainian drones killed two people, and another in Russia’s Kursk region on the country’s border, regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein said.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Saturday its forces captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, Zelenyi Hai in the Donetsk region and Maliivka just inside the Dnipropetrovsk region.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian drones hit a radio and electronic warfare equipment plant in Russia’s Stavropol region in an overnight attack on Saturday, an official from the SBU security service told the Reuters news agency. “Each such attack stops production processes and reduces the enemy’s military potential. This work will continue,” the official told the agency. Attacks targeting the plant continued on Sunday.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"weapons-and-military-aid\">Weapons and military aid</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Indian firm Ideal Detonators Private Limited, which shipped $1.4m worth of the explosive compound octogen with military uses to Russia in December, said on Saturday it complies with Indian rules and the substance it had shipped was for civilian industrial purposes. The US government has identified the compound as “critical for Russia’s war effort” and has warned financial institutions against facilitating any sales of the substance to Moscow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"diplomacy\">Diplomacy</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Russia will launch direct passenger flights from Moscow to North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, on Sunday, Russian authorities said, as the two former communist bloc allies move to improve ties following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The start of regular flights between the capitals for the first time since the mid-1990s, according to Russian aviation blogs, follows the resumption of Moscow-Pyongyang passenger rail service, a 10-day journey, in June.</li>\n<li>Pope Leo discussed the war in Ukraine on Saturday with Metropolitan Anthony, a senior cleric in the Russian Orthodox Church, in a possible effort to ease ties between the churches strained by Russia’s invasion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ceasefire\">Ceasefire</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Peace talks and a settlement in Ukraine have never been on the real agenda of the West, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Saturday, in her first comments on negotiations since Russian and Ukrainian officials held talks on Wednesday. If the West wanted “real peace” in Ukraine, it would stop supplying Kyiv with weapons, Zakharova said in comments reported by the TASS news agency.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></body></html>"

He was so tough, so durable. Heavy f****** hands.”</p>\n<p>The Dutch fighter had to survive a brutal knockdown in round three when Whittaker dropped him with a right hand to the chin in the opening minute.</p>\n<p>De Ridder managed to survive the attack, and consolidated his overall superiority in strikes – de Ridder landed 169 in total, compared with 100 for Whittaker, according to official UFC statistics – and recovered to win the final two rounds by wearing down the 34-year-old with repeated knees to the body and constant grappling.</p>\n<p>Throughout the five-round fight, there was little to separate the pair. When the final bell sounded, the split decision reflected the closeness of the contest.</p>\n<p>De Ridder’s victory was his fourth Ultimate Fighting Championship career victory. Whittaker (27-9) has now lost two straight and three of his five most recent fights.</p>\n<p>Following his victory, de Ridder, ranked 13th heading into the Whittaker fight, called for a title shot against the winner of the middleweight championship bout between Dricus Du Plessis and Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319 on August 16.</p>\n<p>“I want to finish a guy in the first round, so maybe it would be better if I fought Khamzat [Chimaev] or Dricus [Du Plessis].

half.</p>\n<p>Esther Okoronkwo played a key role in the Super Falcons’ victory: scoring the first goal, creating the second and delivering the free-kick that Echegini finished to stun the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Morocco, backed by a vibrant capacity crowd at the 21,000-seat Stade Olympique in the capital, took the lead on 12 minutes as Nigeria conceded for the first time in open play at the

doubled 12 minutes later as the ball flew across the Nigerian goalmouth to Sanaa Mssoudy, who ended a five-match goal drought by steering a low shot into the far corner of the net.</p>\n<p>Nigeria had more possession in the opening half than the host nation, but managed only one shot on target, and it did not trouble goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi.</p>\n<p>But the Moroccan lead halved after 64 minutes as Okoronkwo sent Er-Rmichi the wrong way from a penalty after a VAR review showed a Folashade Ijamilusi cross striking Nouhaila Benzina’s hand.</p>\n<p>The goal lifted the spirits of increasingly assertive Nigeria, and they equalised seven minutes later, when Okoronkwo turned creator with a pull-back that Ijamilusi pushed into the net from close range.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>On Friday, Ghana finished third, winning a penalty shootout 4-3 against outgoing champions South Africa after a 1-1 playoff draw in regular time in Casablanca.</p>\n<p>After two weakly struck spot kicks in a row by South Africa were saved to give Ghana the advantage, 19-year-old Nancy Amoh converted the decisive penalty with a low shot into the corner of the net.</p>\n<p>A blunder by Ghana goalkeeper Cynthia Konlan gifted South Africa the lead on 45 minutes as she lost control of the ball just outside the box, and Nonhlanhla Mthandi struck it into the net.</p>\n<p>Persistent Ghanaian pressure finally paid off on 68 minutes when an Alice Kusi header came off the crossbar and long-serving South Africa shot-stopper Andile Dlamini conceded an own goal.</p>\n<p>Victory was particularly sweet for the Black Queens as they were outplayed when losing 2-0 to Banyana Banyana (The Girls) in the group stage.</p>\n<p>Ghana have won the four third-place playoffs they qualified for, while South Africa have lost four of five bronze medal matches.</p>\n<p>The next Women’s Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled for March 2026, also in Morocco, and will double as a qualifying competition for the

The victims include 85 children.</p>\n<p>With anger across the world mounting <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/israel-says-its-distributing-aid-in-gaza-so-why-are-people-starving\">over the crisis</a>, Israel announced late on Saturday that it would implement a pause to its assault “in civilian centers and in humanitarian corridors to enable the distribution of aid supply” on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not specify which specific areas would see a “humanitarian pause”.</p>\n<p>The ministry also again blamed the United Nations for failing to distribute assistance in Gaza, a claim that has been rejected by both the UN and multiple aid and rights groups.</p>\n<p>UN officials have said that this Israeli talking point is false, stressing that they have not received the necessary permits to safely distribute aid in the besieged enclave.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"airdrops-effect-is-equivalent-to-none\">Airdrops’ effect is ‘equivalent to none’</h2>\n<p>The Israeli military also said it carried out airdrops of international aid over Gaza. The United Arab Emirates, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Israel, also said it will begin airdropping aid into Gaza “immediately”.</p>\n<p>But humanitarian experts have been warning since last year that airdrops are dangerous to people on the ground and cannot serve as a substitute for safe land routes to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/we-are-dying-palestinians-slam-worlds-inaction-as-hunger-ravages-gaza\">distribute food</a> and medical supplies.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, called airdrops an expensive, inefficient “distraction” that would “not reverse the deepening starvation”.</p>\n<p>Lazzarini called for Israel to “lift the siege, open the gates [and] guarantee safe movements [and] dignified access to people in need”.</p>\n<p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud raised questions over the newly announced Israeli steps.</p>\n<p>He said the airdrops’ effect is “equivalent to none”.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about only seven pallets of aid filled with flour and other basic necessities. That’s almost the load of one truck, or half of a truck, coming from the crossings into the Gaza Strip,” Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>He cited witnesses who said the airdrops took place near a restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/7/20/israel-issues-forced-displacement-order-in-central-gaza-in-new-campaign\">military area</a> in northern Gaza, making retrieving them in the dark especially difficult.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Equally, Israel’s plan to allow for so-called “humanitarian pauses” in Gaza starting on Sunday will have no major effect on the starvation crisis, Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>“Again, this is not a solution when we talk about passing the tipping point of this enforced starvation, and according to medical sources we spoke to earlier today, they confirmed that at this point we’re going to see mass scale starvation mortality,” he said.</p>\n<p>As starvation spreads, Israel has pressed on with its daily bombardment of Gaza.</p>\n<p>At least six people were killed in an Israeli drone attack on a tent camp in al-Mawasi near Khan Younis on Saturday. The area designated as a safe zone by Israel has come under constant deadly attack by its forces.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Civil Defence agency in Gaza says none of its vehicles will be able to offer lifesaving services soon due to disrepair and lack of fuel, calling on the international community to act.</p>\n<p>“We stress the need for an urgent intervention to pressure the Israeli occupation authorities to allow fuel and repair parts for vehicles to enter,” the Civil Defence said in a statement.</p>\n<p>While some Western countries have made strongly-worded statements against Israel’s policies in Gaza, advocates have been calling for <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/uk-threatens-further-action-against-israel-if-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-fails\">real consequences</a> to ensure accountability and deter further Israeli abuses. Punitive sanctions against Israel have been raised as possibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"handala-ship-intercepted\">Handala ship intercepted</h2>\n<p>Shortly after making its airdrops announcement, the Israeli military raided a ship of international activists carrying baby formula, food and medical supplies to Gaza.</p>\n<p>A livestream showed Israeli soldiers boarding and intercepting the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/18/who-is-handala-the-inspiration-behind-latest-gaza-flotilla-ship\">Handala vessel </a>with 19 activists onboard. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the aid ship, said the vessel was violently seized in international waters.</p>\n<p>“The unarmed boat was carrying life-saving supplies when it was boarded by Israeli forces, its passengers abducted, and its cargo seized,” the coalition said in a statement. “The interception occurred in international waters outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international maritime law.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not clear what will happen to the advocates. Last month, Israel intercepted the Madleen aid ship and towed it to an Israeli boat before detaining the activists, and then interrogating and deporting them.</p>\n<p>Ann Wright, a member of the Freedom Flotilla Steering Committee, called for the protection of the international activists by their home countries.</p>\n<p>“Protect innocent international people who are merely accompanying a small amount of aid – medical and food – as a symbol of the international outrage at what Israel is doing,” Wright told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>The Gaza Government Media Office called the interception of Handala a <a href=\"/features/2025/6/9/what-happens-next-to-the-gaza-flotillas-madleen-and-its-crew\">crime of piracy</a>.</p>\n<p>“This blatant aggression represents a major violation of international law and the rules of maritime navigation, and it shows once more that the [Israeli] occupation acts like a bully outside the authority of the law,” the office said in a statement.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

His physicality, intelligence and work ethic make him a perfect fit for our vision,” said Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta.</p>\n<p>The 27-year-old striker joins Arsenal after establishing himself after two outstanding seasons in Portugal, in which he fired Lisbon to back-to-back league titles with 97 goals, including 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions in the 2024-25 season, outscoring the likes of superstars Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah.</p>\n\n<p>A top-class striker has long been considered the missing element for Arsenal, which came runner-up in each of the last three Premier League seasons. The failure to bring one in during the January transfer window badly undermined its attempts to challenge Liverpool for the title last term.</p>\n<p>“The consistency he has shown in his performances and availability have been outstanding, and his goal contributions speak for themselves,” said manager Mikel Arteta. “He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.”</p>\n<p>Gyokeres returns to England after joining Brighton as a youth player and later emerging at second-tier Coventry, where his 22 goals helped the team reach the playoff final in 2023.</p>\n<p>His record of 40 goals in 97 games for Coventry caught the attention of Lisbon and led to a 20.5 million pounds ($25m) move to the Portuguese club.</p>\n<p>His explosive form over the past two seasons has seen frequent speculation about a move to one of European football’s giants, including Manchester United. But Arsenal has won the race for his signature, and the transfer represents a remarkable rise for a player who was first developed at Brommapojkarna, a Swedish club with a reputation for guiding the careers of some of the country’s best emerging talents.</p>\n<p>“He was a late developer because he was not the best striker or the best player in Brommapojkarna at age 16, 17, 18, 19,” Dalibor Savic, his former youth coach at the Swedish club, told The Associated Press in November. “If he aims at something, he will achieve it.”</p>\n<p>Gyokeres will have to prove he can make the step up to the Premier League after failing to break through at Brighton, a club known for unearthing players like Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister in recent years. He only made eight appearances for the club and was loaned to St Pauli in Germany and Swansea before his permanent move to Coventry.</p>\n<p>His performances for Sweden and in the Champions League suggest he will be able to continue that form at Arsenal.</p>\n<p>He was the leading scorer in the Nations League, with nine goals, outscoring Cristiano Ronaldo and Haaland, and hit six in eight appearances in the Champions League for Lisbon last season.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3858692\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3858692\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3858692\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2197645616-1753563080.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Viktor Gyokeres in action.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3858692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting runs with the ball during the Liga Portugal Betclic match between FC Porto and Sporting Clube de Portugal at Estadio do Dragao on February 7, 2025, in Porto, Portugal [Pedro Loureiro/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Instead, the group says it is seeking a permanent end to the war, while several Israeli officials <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-netanyahu-meet-for-a-second-time-to-discuss-a-gaza-ceasefire\">have said</a> that Israel will proceed with its military campaign in Gaza even if a short-term truce is reached.</p>\n<p>Congressman Adam Smith called on Israel to take the “steps necessary to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza, but he focused his criticism on Hamas, echoing unfounded Israeli arguments about the group <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/hamas-says-israel-rejected-ceasefire-deal-releasing-all-captives-in-gaza\">blocking ceasefire</a> deals and stealing the aid.</p>\n<p>“I believe we can both continue to support Israel in their effort to defend themselves against Hamas, Iran and others in the region who continue in their efforts to attack and destroy Israel, and work immediately to relieve the suffering of the people in Gaza,” Smith said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Senator Cory Booker released a 172-word statement on the starvation crisis in Gaza that mentioned the word “Israel” only once – in calling for a strategy to “strengthen Israel’s security.”</p>\n<p>“It is our collective moral duty to ensure that humanitarian relief reaches those who need it most urgently,” Booker said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"criticising-trump\">Criticising Trump</h2>\n<p>At the same time, some Democrats invoked the crisis to rebuke Trump – their political rival – without denouncing Israel.</p>\n<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries set the tone for that approach with a statement late on Friday that focused on Trump but failed to explicitly criticise Israel.</p>\n<p>“The starvation and death of Palestinian children and civilians in an ongoing war zone is unacceptable,” Jeffries said. “The <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/bomb-first-trumps-approach-to-us-war-making-in-his-second-term\">Trump administration</a> has the ability to bring an end to this humanitarian crisis. They must act now.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>For his part, Congressman Tim Kennedy underscored that Trump has failed to deliver his promise of ending the war on Gaza.</p>\n<p>“His strategic and moral failure has led to deteriorating conditions, with new reports and images of mass starvation of Palestinians,” Kennedy said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump’s Republican Party has been largely silent about the worsening hunger in Gaza.</p>\n<p>But Congressman Randy Fine – <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/trump-backs-staunchly-anti-muslim-florida-lawmaker-to-run-for-us-congress\">a close ally</a> of the US president – appeared to at once endorse Israel’s starvation campaign in Gaza while dismissing it as “Muslim terror propaganda”.</p>\n<p>“Release the hostages,” he wrote in a social media post earlier this week. “Until then, starve away.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

food convoys at risk of being overwhelmed by starving, desperate crowds, the UN says.</p>\n<p>To deliver aid to where it is needed, the UN would need the support of the Israeli military.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said half of the 16 food distribution requests submitted to the Israeli military had been refused.</p>\n<p>“Bureaucratic … and other operational obstacles imposed by Israeli authorities; ongoing hostilities and access constraints within Gaza; and incidents of criminal looting, and more shooting incidents that have killed and injured people gathering to

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In Gaza, we see death in every aspect of life. Death has become an inseparable companion, lingering in the streets, the skies, and even in our homes. It is no longer a shock – it is a grim daily reality which we have been forced to adapt to.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to die in Gaza, although one does not have the luxury to choose.</p>\n<p>You may be killed in a bombing, or be struck by a sniper’s bullet as you try to collect food to stave off hunger, or starvation itself may claim your life. The Health Ministry says 116 people have died because of malnutrition, many of them babies and children.</p>\n<p>In Gaza, the simplest, most basic necessity can also be lethal. Water is one of them. Every aspect of it can be dangerous: providing it, seeking it, drinking it, swimming in it.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has relentlessly targeted Gaza’s water infrastructure. More than 85 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation structures are inoperable – including pipelines, wells, and treatment facilities.</p>\n<p>Israel has <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/gazas-water-infrastructure-desperately-needs-be-rebuilt\">blocked</a> the entry of water-related materials to the Strip, making repairs difficult. It has also targeted the warehouse of the water utility authority, destroying equipment and spare parts.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, workers trying to make repairs or operate water infrastructure have been directly targeted and killed. Working in the water sector has now become a deadly job.</p>\n<p>Most recently, on July 21, the Israeli occupation forces <a href=\"https://aje.io/zs9y5d?update=3848795\">attacked</a> a desalination plant in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City, killing five people at the site. This was one of the few functioning water stations in the city.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the water infrastructure in Gaza has forced us to go out in search of water on a daily basis. There are some war entrepreneurs who charge exorbitant amounts of money for delivering water to homes; the vast majority of people cannot afford such services.</p>\n<p>So Palestinians are forced to walk long distances and wait in long queues, plastic jugs in hand, to fetch a daily ration of water.</p>\n<p>The wait under the scorching sun is not just exhausting, but it can also turn deadly.</p>\n<p>On July 13, 11 Palestinians – seven of them children – were killed and dozens more injured when an Israeli missile struck civilians as they queued to get water from water trucks in Nuseirat refugee camp, not far from my own home.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, water trucks are not available, so people are forced to drink water that is unfit for human consumption from local wells. It is contaminated with bacteria, chemicals and other contaminants and can trigger outbreaks of waterborne diseases.</p>\n<p>I myself felt victim to one. Months ago, after drinking from a local well, I contracted hepatitis A. My skin and the whites of my eyes turned a haunting shade of yellow. Waves of nausea left me unable to eat, and a persistent fever made every breath feel difficult. But the worst was the searing pain in my abdomen – a constant, twisting ache as if my insides were being wrung out by invisible hands. For weeks, I was bedridden, my body weak, my mind consumed with fear.</p>\n<p>A visit to a clinic brought me no relief – just a prescription for a painkiller and a “salamtek” (get well). I had to fight the infection on my own.</p>\n<p>I survived, but others are not so lucky. Hepatitis, like other infectious waterborne diseases running amok in Gaza, kills.</p>\n<p>Amid the unbearable summer heat, one would think that at least the water of the sea could bring Palestinians some relief, but that too is deadly.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, the Israeli military has declared Gaza’s entire coastline a prohibited zone, effectively banning Palestinians from swimming, fishing, or even approaching the water. Anyone who gets near the sea is shot at.</p>\n<p>Even before the ban, the Israeli army was attacking Palestinians who would try to get into the sea to fish and alleviate their families’ hunger. As of December 2024, some <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/building-to-starvation-systematic-attacks-on-fishing-in-gaza-and-implications-for-livelihoods-and-protection-may-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200 fishermen</a> had been killed, according to the UN; many more have died since then.</p>\n<p>While we are banned from the only place that used to bring us relief from the heat, just a few kilometres north, Israelis freely enjoy the same Mediterranean waves, sunbathing and swimming in peace. They also enjoy long showers and the privilege of running water. They use the luxurious 247 litres (65 gallons) per day per person.</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, a person <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza\">needs</a> 100 litres (26 gallons) of water per day to cover their basic needs. People in Gaza now get between two and nine litres (0.5 – 2.3 gallons) per day.</p>\n<p>The struggle for water is just one of the many battles Palestinians in Gaza fight daily. There is no food to feed one’s starving family, no electricity to power fans, and no medicine to treat the diseases that plague us. Every aspect of life here is a test of endurance. There is, quite literally, nothing to ease the weight of these brutal circumstances – no relief, no respite, not even the smallest comfort.</p>\n<p>I still can’t comprehend how, in the 21st century, a world of more than 7 billion people, where global leaders talk about prosperity, dignity and rule of law, we are still deprived of the most basic human necessities.</p>\n<p>In December 2024, Human Rights Watch openly declared that Palestinians in Gaza are being subjected to a “genocide,” and it based this conclusion on establishing Israel’s “water deprivation as a deliberate act”. It pointed out that “thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have died as a result of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease as of August 2024”.</p>\n<p>It has been a year since then. Countless people have died because of Israel’s weaponisation of water – numbers that are not included in the official death toll because the health authorities simply lack the capacity to track them.</p>\n<p>The truth is out in the open. It is broadcast on international media. It is visible on social media. And yet, the world remains idle, refusing to take action and stop Israel.</p>\n<p>To this world, I want to say: Your silence echoes louder than the bombs that fall on us every day. You must act now, or go down in history with your complicity in the slaughter and starvation of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It felt, to put it bluntly, like a waste of time,” Torrejon said. “The level of practice and the level of physical training both plummeted compared to what we had [at Barcelona]. It was like taking a step back.</p>\n<p>“I am told that isn’t the case now, and I am very glad to hear that.”</p>\n<p>Torrejon said she saw steps in the right direction under former Spain coach Jorge Vilda, who replaced Quereda, but felt there was still more untapped potential in the team when she retired.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3486539\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3486539\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3486539\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1622660427-1738579828.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Luis Rubiales kisses Jenni Hermoso.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3486539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Luis Rubiales, right, kisses Jennifer Hermoso of Spain, left, during the medal ceremony of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 final against England [Noemi Llamas/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-was-the-rubiales-controversy-for-spain\">What was the Rubiales controversy for Spain?</h2>\n<p>After Torrejon quit the team, some players announced in 2022 that they would no longer play for Vilda unless he ran a more professional operation.

The Barcelona contingent includes Bonmati and Putellas, who have split the last four Ballon d’Or awards between them.</p>\n<p>Former Barcelona official Xavier Vilajoana oversaw the women’s team and the club’s training academy from 2015-2020. During that time, the club dramatically increased its funding for women’s football and built a training programme for girls.</p>\n<p>Vilajoana said one critical decision was having the same coaches train the boys’ and girls’ teams. That way, the Barcelona style was instilled in all the kids, and that ball-possession, short-passing and pressure became fundamentals of the women’s teams as well.</p>\n<p>“Let’s not fool ourselves, we spent many years in a very sexist society, and that was reflected in women’s football. So clearly the change in the mentality of society has helped,” Vilajoana said. “But I also believe that Barca’s style of play has helped us see women players in the same way [as men].”</p>\n<p>In the background, Spain’s strong feminist movement helped get the public behind the players as they made strides for equality and success.</p>\n<p>“There were many of us players who gave it our all for the national team but weren’t able to get this far,” Torrejon said. “The one thing we knew is that we had talent.

But in essence, this is what it is about,” he says.</p>\n<p>RO also claims to stand for conservative moral and religious values, and steadfastly supports the Kremlin, including in its invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>“These points define their entire ideology… There have always been nationalists, but the fact that the largest and most prominent Russian nationalist organisation is fully loyal to the government – this is an unusual situation.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857893\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857893\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857893\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2022189386-1753521317.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Novosibirsk\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An aerial view of Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia with the Church of the Archangel Michael [Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"folk-singing-and-a-stream-of-anti-immigrant-messages\">Folk singing and a stream of anti-immigrant messages</h2>\n<p>RO was founded five years ago by Omsk politician Andrey Tkachuk, anti-abortion rights activist Yevgeny Chesnokov and Andrey Afanasyev, a host on the TV channel Spas, which is owned by the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>\n<p>One member told the BBC last year that the idea was to create solidarity among Russians themselves, as other, tightly-knit ethnic communities in Russia already look out for each other, for example, Chechens or Armenians.</p>\n<p>As such, many of the Community’s activities are benign: Helping each other out with flat tyres, or organising festivities on Orthodox holidays such as Maslenitsa (Butter Week), with folk singing and dance performances in the run-up to Easter.</p>\n<p>But an examination of RO’s various Telegram groups reveals a narrow focus on ethnic Russian interests, to the exclusion of Russia’s other non-Slavic groups – although there are a handful of minority members – and a stream of anti-immigrant content.</p>\n<p>“The blacks will devour everything in their path if the Slavs do not unite to somehow defend their borders and values,” a young female follower of the Community’s Saratov branch, who can’t be named for fear of repercussions, told Al Jazeera, using a derogatory slur.</p>\n<p>The group’s other activities include vigilantism, often with the open or tacit support of the authorities, observers say.</p>\n<p>According to Verkhovsky, there are a number of tactics to target immigrants and other minorities. One is filing official complaints and making denunciations to authorities against what it deems immoral, such as homosexuality or abortion or “Russophobic behaviour”. Neither of the former are technically illegal in Russia, but there are laws against “propaganda” related to LGBTQ and “childfree” themes.</p>\n<p>Another tactic is raids, such as the one on watermelon sellers in Novosibirsk. “In the case of migrants, these are places where migrants live or work,” Verkhovsky explains.</p>\n<p>Members of the Russian Community or similar vigilante groups, for example, the smaller group Northern Man, typically appear where immigrants are working and find some sort of “violation” – in the case of the Novosibirsk watermelon stall, unlicensed trading. They then detain the alleged violators and hand them over to the police.</p>\n<p>“In principle, more or less any citizen can complain to the Russian Community and say he’s been offended by some ‘bad’ people,” says Verkhovsky.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, these ‘bad’ people are not Russian, and the person complaining is Russian. And then the Russian Community will go to protect him.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the group accompanies police on joint operations as “volunteers”, though this is rarer. Verkhovsky noted that attitudes towards RO by different police departments vary, and, while some seem to welcome the group, in other cases, officers have brought charges against Community members – only for prosecutors to drop them.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857909\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857909\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857909\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2594443521-1753522191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russian Community\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857909\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The flag of the Russian Community (RO) features at a street festival in the city of Borovsk, Russia, on August 24, 2024 [Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"standing-up-to-a-crime-wave\">Standing up to a ‘crime wave’?</h2>\n<p>The vigilantes claim they are standing up to an “immigrant crime wave”.</p>\n<p>There is crime among foreigners in Russia: For instance, Georgians make up more than half of the “thieves-in-law”, an elite fraternity in the criminal underworld. Brawls and beatings involving gangs of young immigrant men often make headlines.</p>\n<p>However, these well-publicised incidents and individuals contribute only a small part of the overall crime statistics in Russia. According to Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, foreigners committed just 2 percent of all reported crime nationwide last year, while comprising roughly 4 percent of the population.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Valentina Chupik, a lawyer who offers free legal help to migrants, told Al Jazeera that a substantial portion of these offences are related to improper paperwork, rather than victimising Russians.</p>\n<p>“These crimes [missing paperwork] are the inevitable consequence of the organisation of illegal migration, which are committed by homeowners who rent apartments to migrants, but do not fulfil the obligation established by law to register them there,” she says.</p>\n<p>As well as immigrants, RO campaigns against alleged immorality and “fifth-columnists” in Russian society. As a human rights advocate, Chupik is considered to be one of these fifth-columnists and has become used to receiving threats and obscenities, including from RO supporters.</p>\n<p>“They threaten me regularly,” she says.</p>\n<p>“My employees are also threatened, as well as volunteers. They sometimes have posts in their Telegram groups mentioning me. After that, they write to me and call me.”</p>\n<p>Messages seen by Al Jazeera tell Chupik, “there’s a special spot for you in hell” and to “wait for the bottle”, alluding to sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera contacted multiple representatives of RO for comment, but did not receive any response.</p>\n<p>Since a <a href=\"/news/2024/3/23/moscow-concert-hall-attack-why-is-isil-targeting\">deadly attack</a> on a Moscow music venue last year by ISIS-affiliated gunmen, there has been an <a href=\"/features/2024/4/9/after-deadly-attack-russias-central-asian-workers-report-rising-racism\">upswing</a> in xenophobia. The police have ramped up arrests and other restrictions on immigrants, especially those from Central Asia. Verkhovsky says it is hard to tell to what extent the public is actively hostile towards immigrants, but polling indicates concerns about immigration have sharply escalated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-the-war-gain-acceptance\">Support the war; gain acceptance</h2>\n<p>In the 2000s, Russia suffered a <a href=\"/features/2015/9/23/behind-russias-ultra-nationalist-crackdown\">scourge</a> of far-right-wing violence, peaking in 2008 when skinhead gangs carried out 110 racist murders nationwide. In one particularly grisly episode, a Tajik and a Dagestani were shot dead and beheaded on camera in a woodland near Moscow. In 2022, two men were finally convicted of the double homicide after a third suspect, already imprisoned, incriminated them in his suicide note.</p>\n<p>For a time, available outlets for xenophobic sentiment dried up somewhat.</p>\n<p>“In the 2010s, the authorities greatly suppressed this movement and almost all these organisations either stopped their activities or were simply eradicated,” Verkhovsky explained.</p>\n<p>“And people who wanted to share these ideas and wanted to take part were either afraid or just did not know where to go at all.”</p>\n<p>Some far-right activists moved to Ukraine, where they found <a href=\"/news/2022/2/16/the-russians-going-against-putin-in-ukraine\">common cause</a> with like-minded locals.</p>\n<p>But RO is a new phenomenon. It prefers to work alongside the authorities, largely forsaking the thuggery of old. And its brand of nationalism aligns with the Kremlin, supporting the invasion of Ukraine and actively fundraising for soldiers and their families. In interviews, founder Andrey Tkachuk has even denied the existence of Ukraine’s national identity.</p>\n<p>“The state’s tolerance towards any groups that support the [war] has grown very much,” says Verkhovsky. “In general, the authorities don’t like any grassroots initiatives, but here they’ve quite notably tolerated it. This is possible only during a wartime situation.”</p>\n<p>While the Russian Community stays relatively within the confines of the law – acting as more of an unofficial auxiliary to law enforcement than the skinheads of the past, who eagerly filmed their brazen assaults – Verkhovsky points out “many of the activists are, shall we say, inclined towards violence, and the leadership can’t always hold them back.”</p>\n<p>In May, for instance, activists armed with pepper spray and a Taser allegedly burst into an apartment near St Petersburg where two men and a woman were drinking and taking illicit drugs. A fire broke out in the scuffle, and one of the men, of Armenian origin, died in the blaze, while the woman suffered serious injuries after jumping from a seventh-storey window.</p>\n<p>“Let him burn,” the activists reportedly told witnesses, accusing the man of being a “pusher”.</p>\n<p>And last week, a mass brawl erupted between dozens of RO members and Chechen and Ingush workers on a building site northeast of Moscow, after an Ingush security guard reportedly evicted a drunk man from the premises.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the group revealed it had been branded an “undesirable organisation” by local authorities in the Chelyabinsk region of west-central Russia on the grounds of “extremism”.</p>\n<p>But RO has friends in high places: according to reports in Russian media, Alexander Bastrykin, the chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee, has intervened on members’ behalf several times, including filing charges against police officers who arrested them on various charges. And, in June, sources within the security services told reporters from the independent Russian news site, Meduza, that they use RO as a tool for managing “interethnic conflicts”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blessed-by-a-vicar\">Blessed by a vicar</h2>\n<p>Another difference from the old, racist gangs is the influence of the Orthodox Church. The group has campaigned against mosques, requires its members to profess Orthodoxy, and has been blessed by a vicar on behalf of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, himself.</p>\n<p>“Primarily the Russian Community, but also other organisations of the same type, have a very good relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church,” says Verkhovsky.</p>\n<p>“And I mean not just individual priests who sympathise with them, but at the level of high-ranking officials. This is quite unusual. How far it will go, it’s hard to say, but it’s very noticeable.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
