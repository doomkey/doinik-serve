He wrote that Trump was “playing the ultimatum game with Russia”.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump responded: “Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-done\">What has Trump done?</h2><p>On Friday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that he had ordered two US “Nuclear Submarines” to be repositioned to “appropriate regions”.</p><p>Trump cited what he regarded as threatening comments made by former Russian President  Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council. He called Medvedev’s statements “highly provocative”, adding that his actions were a precaution.</p><p>“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump wrote.</p><p>In the run-up to his presidential campaign, Trump promised to end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours; however, several discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin have since not yielded any results.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3698434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3698434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3698434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-04-26T120300Z_400437346_RC2L5EAM2BY8_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-TRUMP-1746789400.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C568&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3698434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump meet while they attend the funeral of Pope Francis, at the Vatican, April 26, 2025 [Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-submarines-trump-says-he-will-reposition\">What do we know about the submarines Trump says he will reposition?</h2><p>Not much – and we do not know which submarines Trump is referring to. Trump did not say if he had ordered the repositioning of submarines with nuclear engines or submarines carrying nuclear missiles.</p><p>Trump did not reveal the location of the submarines, either, as mandated by US military protocol.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>However, Trump’s statement is so far being viewed as a rhetorical threat, rather than a military one, as security analysts noted that the US already has nuclear-powered submarines that are deployed and capable of striking Russia as a deterrent.</p><h2 id=\"what-prompted-trump-s-submarine-move\">What prompted Trump’s submarine move?</h2><p>Mostly, his frustration over the lack of progress of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. But, in this case, the social media spat with Medvedev seems to have tipped him over into action.</p><p>Trump and the Russian military leader have been engaged in mud-slinging on social media platforms for some time.</p><p>Earlier, responding to Trump’s new deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Medvedev wrote in a post on X that Trump was playing an “ultimatum game” with Russia.</p><p>“Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!” Medvedev had said.</p><p>Earlier in the week, while announcing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\">trade tariffs for India</a> – along with an extra penalty for buying Russian oil – Trump stated that he did not care if India and Russia “take their dead economies down together”.</p><p>In a Telegram post on Thursday, Medvedev wrote that Trump should “revisit his favourite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical ‘Dead Hand’ can be”.</p><p>Russia’s “Dead Hand system” is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear retaliation mechanism designed to launch a counterstrike even if the Russian leadership is wiped out in a first strike.</p><p>Trump replied: “Tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!”</p><p>Speaking to reporters after his post about the nuclear submarines, Trump said on Friday: “We just have to be careful. And a threat was made and we didn’t think it was appropriate, so I have to be very careful.</p><p>“A threat was made by a former president of Russia, and we’re going to protect our people.”</p><h2 id=\"who-has-more-nuclear-power-russia-or-the-us\">Who has more nuclear power: Russia or the US?</h2><p>Combined, the US and Russia account for nearly 87 percent of the world’s total nuclear arsenal. The geopolitical rivals control about 83 percent of the nuclear warheads actually deployed or ready for operational use.</p><p>Despite significant post-Cold War reductions, global nuclear arsenals remain at a “very high level”, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists. As of January 2025, just nine countries are estimated to possess a total of approximately 12,241 nuclear warheads.</p><p>Today, according to the nonprofit Arms Control Association, the US deploys 1,419 and Russia deploys 1,549 strategic warheads on several hundred bombers and missiles.</p><p>The US conducted its first nuclear test explosion in July 1945; the following month, it dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of <a href=\"/news/2020/8/6/seared-to-death-the-atomic-bomb-attack-on-hiroshima\">Hiroshima</a> and Nagasaki. Four years later, the Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test explosion.</p><p>As of 2025, the US Navy operates 71 submarines, all nuclear‑powered, making it the largest undersea force. This fleet includes 14 Ohio‑class ballistic missile subs (SSBNs), four Ohio‑class converted guided‑missile submarines (SSGNs) loaded with Tomahawk missiles for strikes or special operations, and about 53 fast‑attack submarines designed for intelligence gathering, anti‑submarine warfare and cruise‑missile support.</p><p>By comparison, the Russian Navy fields fewer than 30 nuclear‑powered submarines, including approximately 10 strategic SSBNs, a mix of modern Borei and older Delta IV classes, that carry Bulava missiles.</p><p>It also operates several strategic‑missile cruise boats and about six Akula‑class attack submarines equipped for anti‑ship and multi‑role missions. Russia is investing in modern fleet expansion through the Yasen‑M class.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2774545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2774545\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2774545\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AFP__20240315__34LL93C__v3__HighRes__TopshotRussiaPoliticsVote-1710506193.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dmitry Medvedev,\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2774545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In this pool photograph distributed by Russia’s state news agency Sputnik, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president now serving as deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, casts his ballot in Russia’s presidential election in the Moscow region on March 15, 2024 [Yekaterina Shrukina/Poll/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"has-russia-responded-to-trump-s-submarine-manoeuvre\">Has Russia responded to Trump’s submarine manoeuvre?</h2><p>No. Neither the Kremlin nor Medvedev has publicly responded to Trump’s order to move two nuclear submarines following their war of words.</p><p>Viktor Vodolatsky, a senior Russian lawmaker and deputy chairman of the State Duma’s committee on Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) affairs, however, stated that Russia possesses “significantly more nuclear submarines in the world’s oceans” than the US, claiming US subs have “long been under their control” and, therefore, no specific response is required.</p><p>Last month, the US President said he was “disappointed” with Putin.</p><p>“We’ll have a great conversation. I’ll say: ‘That’s good, I’ll think we’re close to getting it done,’ and then he’ll knock down a building in Kyiv,” he told the BBC in an interview.</p><p>On Friday, in an apparent reference to Trump’s comment, Putin said: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.”</p><p>On a ceasefire with Kyiv, Putin said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine; however, he has not given any indication that Russia is willing to achieve it any quicker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2017, during his first term as US president, Trump announced that he had sent two nuclear submarines to the Korean peninsula. Soon afterwards, he held a meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.</p><p>Whether this latest move will lead to a new meeting with Putin is yet to be seen, however.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in Peru, that position is held by Inca Kola – an almost 100-year-old beverage deeply embedded in the national identity.</p><p>The yellow soda – meant to evoke the grandeur of the ancient Inca Empire and its reverence for gold – was the creation of Joseph Robinson Lindley. The British immigrant had set out from the coal mining town of Doncaster, England, for Peru in 1910 and soon after set up a drinks factory in a working-class district of the capital, Lima.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>He started producing small-batch carbonated fruit drinks and gradually expanded. When Inca Kola was created in 1935, with its secret recipe of 13 herbs and aromatics, it was just a year ahead of Coca-Cola’s arrival in the country. Recognising the threat posed by the soft drink giant, which had launched in the US in 1886 and made inroads across Latin America, Lindley invested in the budding television advertising industry to promote Inca Kola.</p><p>Advertisement campaigns featuring Inca Kola bottles with their vaguely Indigenous motifs and slogans like “the flavour that unites us” appealed to Peru’s multiethnic society – and to its Inca roots.</p><p>It fostered a sense of national pride, explains Andres Macara-Chvili, a marketing professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. “Inca Kola was one of the first brands in Peru that connected with a sense of Peruanidad, or what it means to be Peruvian. It spoke to Peruvians about what we are – diverse,” he says.</p><p>But it wasn’t only the drink’s appeal to Peruvian identity or its unique flavour (described by some as tasting like bubblegum, by others as being similar to chamomile tea) that enhanced brand awareness.

Most went to the country’s budding coastal sugar and cotton plantations. Upon arriving, they found themselves subjected to low wages, exploitative work schedules, and unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions, which led to deadly outbreaks of dysentery and typhus. Unable to afford passage back to Japan after they’d completed their four-year contracts, many of the Japanese labourers remained in Peru – moving to urban centres where they opened businesses, notably bodegas, or small grocery stores.</p><p>Denied access to loans from Peruvian banks, as their community grew in number and economic standing, they established their own savings and credit cooperatives.</p><p>“Among their community, money began to circulate, and with it they raised the capital to open small businesses,” explains Alejandro Valdez Tamashiro, a researcher of Japanese migration to Peru.</p><p>In the 1920s and 1930s, the Japanese community <a href=\"https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/lcs/kiyou/18-3/RitsIILCS_18.3pp.79-94shintani.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emerged as a formidable merchant class</a>. But with that came animosity.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>By the mid-1930s, anti-Japanese sentiment had begun to fester. Nationalist politicians and xenophobic media accused the community of running a monopoly on the Peruvian economy, and, in the build-up to World War II, of espionage.</p><p>By the start of that war in 1939, Peru was home to the second-largest Japanese community in Latin America. The following year, one incident of racially motivated attacks and lootings against the community resulted in at least 10 deaths, six million dollars in damage and loss of property for more than 600 Japanese families.</p><p>Since its release, Inca Kola had been widely sold in the mainly Japanese-owned bodegas.</p><p>With the outbreak of war, its competitor, Coca-Cola, received a huge boost internationally.

The Niger Delta, which produces the crude that earned Nigeria 80 percent of its foreign revenues, teemed with gun-carrying soldiers from the military dictatorship of the feared General Sani Abacha. They responded to the protests with force.</p><p>That day, the loudest Ogoni voice – renowned playwright and environmental activist <a href=\"/features/2015/11/10/we-all-stand-before-history\">Ken Saro-Wiwa</a> – faced his fate. A week earlier, a military tribunal had declared his sentence. And just the day before, five executioners tasked with carrying it out had flown in from the northern city of Sokoto.</p><p>At 5am that morning, Saro-Wiwa and the eight other Ogoni activists accused alongside him of murder were moved from the army camp where they had been held to the prison grounds in Port Harcourt, the regional hub a few hours drive from Ogoniland. There, they were herded into a room and shackled. Then, one after the other, they were led out to the gallows. Saro-Wiwa went first.</p><p>It took five attempts to kill him. After one failed tug, the activist cried out in frustration: “Why are you people treating me like this? What kind of country is this?”</p><p>On the final attempt, the gallows finally functioned as they were supposed to. By 3:15pm, all nine men had been executed. Their bodies were placed in coffins, loaded into vehicles and escorted by armed guards to the public cemetery. On the streets, thousands of horrified people watched the procession as soldiers fired tear gas into the air to quell any thoughts of rebellion. No relatives of the nine men were allowed into the cemetery. There were no dignified burials, no parting words from loved ones.</p><p>Thirty years later, on June 12 this year, Nigeria’s Democracy Day, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu pardoned Saro-Wiwa and the others – the Ogoni Nine as they had become known. He went on to call them heroes and awarded them prestigious national titles.</p><p>For Saro-Wiwa’s daughter Noo Saro-Wiwa, who is now aged 49, and other <a href=\"/news/2015/11/10/ken-saro-wiwas-widow-talks-about-execution-20-years-on\">relatives</a> of the executed men, the pardons were moving but insufficient.

More than two dozen books, poems and essays bore his name. His radio dramas and TV plays were wildly successful, particularly one that mocked the corrupt Nigerian elite, which took over after independence in 1960. In the short story Africa Kills Her Sun, Saro-Wiwa eerily warned of his killing: A man condemned to death pens a long letter to his lover, Zole, on the eve of his execution, telling her not to grieve.</p><p>Saro-Wiwa’s execution made him a martyr for the Ogoni people – the man whose death drew international attention to their plight.</p><p>In 1958, when Nigeria discovered oil in the southern Niger Delta, of which Ogoniland is a part, a 17-year-old Saro-Wiwa wrote letters to the government and oil companies questioning how delta communities would benefit from oil dollars. Later on, his essays highlighted how Ogoniland still lacked infrastructure – roads, electricity, water – despite the oil.</p><p>In October 1990, Saro-Wiwa led the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which he cofounded, to present the Ogoni Bill of Rights to the Nigerian government. In it, the Ogoni people denounced the dominance of the majority tribes (Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo) and the sidelining of minorities like the Ogoni. They called for political autonomy and direct control of oil profits, saying:</p><p>“Thirty years of Nigerian independence has done no more than outline the wretched quality of the leadership of the Nigerian majority ethnic groups and their cruelty as they have plunged the nation into ethnic strife, carnage, war, dictatorship, retrogression and the greatest waste of national resources ever witnessed in world history, turning generations of Nigerians, born and unborn into perpetual debtors.”</p><p>It marked Saro-Wiwa as a thorn in the side of the military dictators, and from 1992 to 1993, he was arrested without charge several times. Still, he continued to condemn the slow death he said Ogonis were sentenced to.</p><p>“I accuse the oil companies of practising genocide against the Ogoni,” he wrote in one article. The Nigerian government, he said, was complicit.</p><p>Saro-Wiwa’s fervour took hold in Ogoniland. About 300,000 Ogonis, out of a population of half a million, marched with him in January 1993 to peacefully protest against the Nigerian government and Shell, the oil company that they said bore particular responsibility for the oil spills in their part of the delta.</p><p>It was one of the largest mass demonstrations Nigeria had ever seen at the time. Protesters carried signs with messages like: “Assassins, go home.” The protests were so large that the world began to notice the Ogonis and the slight, articulate man speaking for them. Soon, he was speaking at the United Nations, presenting the Ogonis’ case there. Environmental rights groups like Greenpeace noted and supported his activism.</p><p>By the end of that year, riots were breaking out, and angry protesters had destroyed oil pipelines worth billions of dollars. Shell was forced to suspend operations. The government promptly deployed a special task force to suppress what is now known as the Ogoni Rebellion. Soldiers brutally put down protests, carried out extrajudicial killings, and raped and tortured scores of people, according to reports by Amnesty International.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1312756\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1312756\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1312756\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AP_110324160065.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria oil\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1312756\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oil is seen on the surface of a creek in March 2011 near an illegal oil refinery in Ogoniland outside Port Harcourt in Nigeria’s Delta region, which has suffered from widespread ecological damage [Sunday Alamba/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"in-fighting-and-mob-actions-in-ogoniland\">In-fighting and mob actions in Ogoniland</h2><p>By 1994 and with soldiers still in Ogoniland, tensions were running high. Splits within the MOSOP leadership were also emerging with one side, led by Saro-Wiwa, calling for a stronger stance against the government and another preaching pacifism.</p><p>Edward Kobani was a childhood friend of Saro-Wiwa’s. He was also a pacifist who opposed his friend’s mobilisation of young people in rallies that rang with angry rhetoric. His stance against violence upturned their relationship. More broadly, the mood in the region was turning against the pacifists, who were increasingly seen as sellouts colluding with the military regime and Shell although there is no evidence they were working with either.</p><p>On May 21, 1994, word spread that some MOSOP leaders had gathered for a meeting at the chief’s palace in Ogoniland’s Gokana district but soldiers had blocked Saro-Wiwa from entering the area. Incensed, rioters marched to the meeting point and attacked those they could lay their hands on. Four of them – Kobani, Alfred Badey, and the brothers Samuel and Theophilus Orage, who were Saro-Wiwa’s in-laws – were clubbed with everything from broken bottles to sharpened rakes. Then they were set on fire.</p><p>The Nigerian military immediately accused Saro-Wiwa of inciting the killings and arrested him the next day. At a news conference, the military administrator of Rivers State, which Ogoniland is part of, declared MOSOP a “terror group” and Saro Wiwa, a “dictator who has … no room for dissenting views”.

Born in Port Harcourt, she lived and studied in London. On the day of the execution, she had no inkling that her world had changed. It wasn’t until late that night that her mother, Maria, managed to reach her on her landline.</p><p>Her first reaction was shock. Noo, who is now a travel writer and author based in London, told Al Jazeera in a phone call that it was hard to imagine the man who would amble into her room while she idled on her bed and thrust a book in her face with a “Read this!” could be killed in such a way. After all, powerful international voices had spoken up to pressure the Nigerian government to release him: Nelson Mandela was among them.</p><p>Noo’s brother, Ken, was in New Zealand to attend the opening of the annual Commonwealth of Nations meeting and press for Nigeria’s suspension. The association of former British colonial states was an important aid avenue for Nigeria at the time.</p><p>The world, too, reacted with shock. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth, and the United States and several other countries severed diplomatic ties. Noo remembers wondering why United Kingdom news channels were repeatedly running the story. That’s when it dawned on Noo how great her father’s task had been.</p><p>Her family was determined to get justice, but it was a long road, Noo explained. In 1996, her brother and uncle sued Shell, which the Ogoni Nine families accused of complicity by aiding the military. Shell denied the allegations.</p><p>The case, filed in the US under a law that allows for jurisdiction in foreign matters, dragged on until 2009 when the company settled for $15.5m. Shell said it was “humanitarian and legal fees”.</p><p>It mostly went towards paying lawyers and establishing a trust fund that still provides scholarships to Ogoni students, Noo said. It’s annoying, though, she added, that critics claim her family and the others got rich on the settlement.</p><p>“It was a tiny amount,” she said. “And even if it weren’t, who wants their parent killed for a $15m settlement?”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3825094\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3825094\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3825094\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1996-02-27T120000Z_587668318_PBEAHUMTBBT_RTRMADP_3_ECUADOR-1751975328.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C551&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ogoni\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3825094\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two Nigerians from the Ogoni tribe and other environmental activists protest against Shell in front of a petrol station in Quito, Ecuador in February 1996 [File: Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>For many years, Noo said, she couldn’t bear to visit Nigeria or hear the name “Shell” without feeling overwhelmed. The company was also taken to The Hague in 2017 by a group of Ogoni Nine widows with the support of Amnesty International; however, a judge ruled there was no evidence that Shell was complicit in the government executions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amnesty said <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/11/investigate-shell-for-complicity-in-murder-rape-and-torture/\">in a 2017 report</a> that it had found evidence that Shell executives had met with military officials and “encouraged” them to suppress protests. The company, the report said, transported soldiers and in “at least one instance paid a military commander notorious for human rights violations”.</p><p>Shell denied the claims and said it pleaded with the government for clemency for the Ogoni Nine.</p><p>Noo has since found the strength to visit Ogoniland. She first went back in 2005, 10 years after her father’s execution. The region has become even more volatile as ethnic militias now patrol the creeks, attacking soldiers, controlling oil pipelines and kidnapping oil workers at sea.</p><p>Noo said her next book will focus on the devastation in her homeland. Her brother and mother died in the past decade, leaving her and Zina, her US-based twin sister. The losses set her back, she said, but she now frequently travels back home to document the oil spills, which are still going on, although Shell never resumed operations after the 1993 protests.</p><p>Life as a writer abroad contrasts jarringly with her life back home, Noo said. One week, she is walking down the streets of Paris, and the next, she is standing in oil-soaked farms in Ogoniland. But her work in Nigeria, she added, reminds her of her father’s struggle.</p><p>“My father was a real kind of David vs Goliath,” Noo said. “Most people back then had never even heard of Ogoni. As I get older, I’m just always more in awe of what he achieved. It was quite incredible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3825127\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3825127\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3825127\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2183312792-1751975993.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ogoni 9\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3825127\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Red Rebel Brigade, a performance activist arts group created as a response to the global environmental crisis, takes part in a protest outside the Shell Centre in London to remember the Ogoni Nine on the 29th anniversary of their executions [File: Mark Kerrison/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"too-little-too-late\">Too little, too late?</h2><p>Shell’s leaky pipes continue to pump oil into the earth all these years later, environmental groups say. The company, which plans to sell its onshore assets and exit the Niger Delta after so many years of controversy, has always claimed its pipes are being sabotaged.</p><p>Calculated or accidental, the oily devastation is visible in the eerie stillness of Ogoniland’s mangroves, which should be alive with the sounds of chirping insects and croaking frogs. In the murky rivers floating with oil, old, stooped fishermen cast nets that bring up air.</p><p>Nubari Saatah, an Ogoni, has long advocated for Ogonis to control their oil wealth, just as activists before him did. The president of the Niger Delta Congress political movement said Ogonis have remained resentful since the rebellion, primarily because Nigeria has not repaired the ruptured relationship or rectified injustices by giving Ogonis control over their land.</p><p>Saatah, author of the 2022 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-We-Must-Do-Revolution/dp/B0C2SM3P4M\">What We Must Do</a>: Towards a Niger Delta Revolution, regularly appears on radio and TV shows to comment on the Niger Delta crisis and often places the blame for the region’s instability at the government’s doorstep.</p><p>“The violent militancy that engulfed the Niger Delta was a direct reaction to the violence visited on the peaceful methods employed by Ogoni,” Saatah said.</p><p>“Unfortunately for the Ogoni, the executions brought about a leadership vacuum that has still not been filled till today,” he added.</p><p>A UN <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/22118/Ogoniland_factsheet_Science.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">Environmental Programme</a> report in 2011 found that more than 50 years of oil extraction in Ogoniland had caused the water in much of the region to be contaminated with extremely high levels of toxic hydrocarbons like benzene. In one village, benzene in the groundwater was up to 900 times the accepted World Health Organization standard.</p><p>Cleaning up the devastation and restoring the land would require the “world’s most wide-ranging and long-term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken”, the report said.</p><p>Although Nigeria and Shell committed in 2012 to a clean-up through the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), more than a decade later, progress has been slow and hard to measure, critics said.</p><p>Saatah blamed the government for the lack of results. Abuja, he said, has not funded the programme as promised. To Ogonis, that feels like a message that the government does not care, he added. Shell, meanwhile, has contributed $270m to the project. Al Jazeera reached out to HYPREP for comment but did not receive a response.</p><p>Still, there is some change, Saatah noted. When the clean-up started, government authorities installed a sign at the community well in Saatah’s village of Bomu that read: “Warning! Do not drink this water.”</p><p>People hardly glanced at the post as they fetched their drinking water, largely because there were no alternative water sources. In the past five or so years, however, HYPREP has installed potable water tanks in Bomu. Saatah worries, though, about whether the government will maintain the costs in the long run and whether the burden will be put on his community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3825100\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3825100\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3825100\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25164691954675-1751975354.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ogoni 9\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3825100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of Nigeria’s Ogoni community at a rally in New York in May 2009 [Bebeto Matthews/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Some in Ogoniland see Abuja’s renewed interest through the recent pardoning of the Ogoni Nine as suspicious, coming as it does at a time when Nigeria is in the throes of one of its worst financial declines and when the government is desperate to extract and sell more crude oil.</p><p>Resuming active exploration in Ogoniland, which stopped in 1993, could yield up to 500,000 barrels of crude per day, a MOSOP official, which is still operating, told reporters last year. That would be on top of the current 1.7 million barrels per day produced from other parts of the delta.</p><p>“The lines are there to be connected between oil resumption and the pardon of the Ogoni Nine,” Saatah said. The pardons, he said, were to sweeten the Ogoni people and avoid any opposition.</p><p>As things stand, though, Ogoni communities are unlikely to agree to renewed exploration, he added, first, because locals still cannot control oil profits and, second, because rather than make Ogonis happy, Tinubu’s pardoning of the Ogoni Nine has only worsened tensions internally, Saatah said.</p><p>Rifts that emerged during the 1994 crisis have not healed. The fact that the president’s speech did not acknowledge the four murdered MOSOP members in the mob action that led to Saro-Wiwa’s arrest has angered their families and supporters, some of whom fault the aggressive stance of Saro-Wiwa for what happened.</p><p>Noo and the Ogoni Nine families are not completely satisfied with the government’s move either.</p><p>The national honour was a welcome surprise, Noo said, but the pardons were not enough.</p><p>“A pardon suggests that something, that a crime had been committed in the first place,” she said. “But nothing’s been committed.”</p><p>What she wants, she added, is for the conviction of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni Nine to be thrown out of the country’s history books.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In front of her, Mali had arranged her small stock of fish in a circle, perhaps hoping to make the display look fuller for potential customers.</p><p>At another market, Sydonemy, just outside Houayxay town, the story was the same. The fish stalls were bare.</p><p>“Sometimes the fish come, sometimes they don’t. We just wait,” another vendor said.</p><p>“There used to be giant fish here,” recalled Vilasai, 53, who comes from a fishing family but now works as a taxi driver.</p><p>“Now the river gives us little.

There are now rapid water level fluctuations in the dry season, which used to be rare, and this has negative impacts on both the river and the people,” he said.</p><p>Another major effect is the reversal of the river’s natural cycle.</p><p>“Now there is more water in the dry season and less during the rainy season. That reduces flooding and the beneficial ecological effects of the annual flood pulse,” Baird explained.</p><p>“The dams hold water during the rainy season and release it in the dry season to maximise energy output and profits.

Then, a “small transition team” will remain through January 2026 to “ensure a responsible and orderly closeout”.</p><p>The death knell for the nonprofit came last month in the form of two legislative actions.</p><p>The first was the passage of the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/us-senate-approves-cutting-billions-in-foreign-aid-as-trump-demands\">Rescission Act of 2025</a>, which was designed to revoke funding that Congress approved in the past. The Rescission Act targeted federal programmes that Trump sought to put on the chopping block, including foreign aid and federal funding for public broadcasters.</p><p>The Senate voted to pass the act by a margin of 51 to 48, and the House then approved it by a vote of 216 to 213.</p><p>The second legislative wallop came on July 31, as the Senate Appropriations Committee unveiled its 2026 funding bill for labour, health and human services, education and related agencies.</p><p>That bill earmarked $197bn in discretionary funding, but none of it went to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Never in five decades had the corporation been excluded from the appropriations bill, according to the nonprofit.</p><p>Both houses of Congress are controlled by Republicans, and party members have largely fallen in line with Trump’s legislative priorities.</p><p>Defunding public media has long been a priority of Republicans, stretching back to President Richard Nixon’s feud in the 1970s with public broadcasting personalities like Sander Vanocur.</p><p>Nixon, like Trump, had an adversarial relationship with the media, and in 1972, he vetoed a public broadcasting funding bill, forcing Congress to return with a slimmed-down version of its funding. That move helped establish a trend of Republicans seeking to whittle down federal support for public, non-commercial TV and radio.</p><p>Trump, during his second term, has made it a priority to slash at what he considers government “bloat”, and that includes reducing federal spending.</p><p>He and his allies have accused news outlets like National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) of being left-wing soapboxes.</p><p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes its funds to NPR and PBS member stations. NPR boasts a weekly audience of 43 million. PBS, meanwhile, reaches 130 million people each year through its television offerings alone, not counting its online presence.</p><p>Still, in the lead-up to the passage of the Rescissions Act, Trump threatened to yank his support from any Republican who opposed his efforts to defund the corporation.</p><p>Trump also said public broadcasting was worse than its commercial counterparts, including MSNBC, which he frequently misspells as “MSDNC” to imply alleged bias towards the Democratic National Committee (DNC).</p><p>“It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN &amp; MSDNC put together,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114831435031070955\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote on social media</a> on July 10.</p><p>“Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.

The report suggested that the economy has sharply weakened during Trump’s tenure, a pattern consistent with a slowdown in economic growth during the first half of the year and an increase in inflation during June that appeared to reflect the price pressures created by the president’s tariffs.</p><p>“What does a bad leader do when they get bad news? Shoot the messenger,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a Friday speech.</p><h2 id=\"revisions-to-hiring-data\">Revisions to hiring data</h2><p>Trump has sought to attack institutions that rely on objective data for assessing the economy, including the Federal Reserve and, now, the BLS. The actions are part of a broader mission to bring the totality of the executive branch – including independent agencies designed to objectively measure the nation’s wellbeing – under the White House’s control.</p><p>McEntarfer was nominated by Biden in 2023 and became the commissioner of the BLS in January 2024. Commissioners typically serve four-year terms, but since they are political appointees, they can be fired. The commissioner is the only political appointee of the agency, which has hundreds of career civil servants.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The Senate confirmed McEntarfer to her post 86-8, with now Vice President JD Vance among the yea votes.</p><p>Trump focused much of his ire on the revisions the agency made to previous hiring data. Job gains in May were revised down to just 19,000 from 125,000, and for June they were cut to 14,000 from 147,000. In July, only 73,000 positions were added. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.2 percent from 4.1 percent.</p><p>“No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.”</p><p>The monthly employment report is one of the most closely-watched pieces of government economic data and can cause sharp swings in financial markets. The disappointing figure sent US market indexes about 1.5 percent lower on Friday.</p><p>While the jobs numbers are often the subject of political spin, economists and Wall Street investors – with millions of dollars at stake – have always accepted US government economic data as free from political manipulation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The only additions were in the healthcare sector, which added 55,000 jobs, and the social services sector added 18,000.</p><p>US employers also cut 62,075 jobs in July — up 29 percent from cuts in the month before, and 140 percent higher than this time last year, according to the firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which tracks monthly job cuts. Government, tech, and retail sectors are the industries that saw the biggest declines so far this year.</p><p>It comes as this month’s jobs and labour turnover report showed an economic slowdown. There were 7.4 million open jobs in the US, down from 7.7 million a month before.</p><p>The Department of Labour on Friday released downward revisions to both the May and June jobs reports, significantly changing the picture the White House had previously painted.</p><p>“For the FOURTH month in a row, jobs numbers have beat market expectations with nearly 150,000 good jobs created in June,” the White House said in a July 3 release following the initial June report.</p><p>The Labor Department had reported an addition of 147,000 jobs in June. On Friday, it sharply revised down that number to just 14,000. May’s report also saw a big downgrade from 144,000 to only 19,000 jobs gained. Trump has since <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-fires-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-dismal-employment-numbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fired</a> the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs data, alleging that the data had been manipulated to make him look bad.</p><p>Even before the revisions, June’s report was the first to reflect early signs of economic strain tied to the administration’s tariff threats, as it revealed that job growth was concentrated in areas such as state and local government and healthcare. Sectors more exposed to trade policy – including construction, wholesale trade, and manufacturing – were flat. Meanwhile, leisure and hospitality showed weak growth, even in peak summer, reflecting falling travel demand both at home and abroad.</p><p>The administration also claimed that native-born workers accounted for all job gains since January. That assertion is misleading as it implies that no naturalised citizens or legally present foreign workers gained employment.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>However, it is true that employment among foreign-born workers has declined – by over half a million jobs – claims that native-born workers are replacing foreign-born labour, are not supported by the jobs data.</p><p>Jobs lost in sectors with high foreign-born employment, including tech, have been abundant, driven by tariffs and automation, particularly AI. In fact, recent layoffs in tech have been explicitly attributed to AI advancements, not labour displacement by other groups.</p><p>Companies including Recruit Holdings — the parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor, Axel Springer, IBM, Duolingo and others have already made headcount reductions directly attributed to AI advancements.</p><h2 id=\"wage-growth\">Wage growth</h2><p>The pace of rise of wage growth, an indicator of economic success, has slowed in recent months. That is partly due to the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates steady in hopes of keeping inflation stable.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages have been outpacing inflation since 2023, after a period of declining real wages following the COVID pandemic.</p><p>Wage growth ticked up by 0.3 percent in July from a month prior. Compared with this time last year, wage growth is 3.9 percent, according to Friday’s Labor Department jobs report.</p><p>Earlier this year, the White House painted a picture that wage growth differed between the era of former President Joe Biden and now under Trump because of policy.</p><p>“Blue-collar workers have seen real wages grow almost two percent in the first five months of President Trump’s second term — a stark contrast from the negative wage growth seen during the first five months of the Biden Administration,” the White House said in a release.</p><p>However, Biden and Trump inherited two very different economies when they took office. Biden has to deal with a massive global economic downturn driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Trump, on the other hand, during his second term, inherited “unquestionably the strongest economy” in more than two decades, per the Economic Policy Institute, particularly because of the US economy’s rebound compared with peer nations.</p><h2 id=\"inflation\">Inflation</h2><p>Inflation peaked in mid-2022 during Biden’s term at 9 percent, before falling steadily because of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to manage a soft landing.</p><p>A July 21 White House statement claimed, “Since President Trump took office, core inflation has tracked at just 2.1 percent.” On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett said “<a href=\"https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1950575608494227932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation is cooling</a>” in a post on X.</p><p>However, the Consumer Price Index report, which tracks core inflation – a measure that excludes the price of volatile items such as food and energy – was 2.9 percent in the most recent report and overall inflation was at 2.7 percent in June.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"prices\">Prices</h2><p>The most recent Consumer Price Index report, published July 15, shows that on a monthly basis, prices on all goods went up in June by 0.3 ,percent which is 2.7 percent higher from this time last year.</p><p>Grocery prices in particular are up 2.4 percent from this time last year and 0.3 percent from the prior month. The cost of fruits and vegetables went up 0.9 percent, the price of coffee increased by 2.2 percent and the cost of beef went up 2 percent.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/7/11/trumps-new-brazil-tariffs-could-raise-us-beef-prices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New pending tariffs on Brazil</a>, as Al Jazeera previously reported, could further drive up the cost of beef in the months to come.</p><p>Trump has pointed to falling egg prices in particular as evidence of economic success, after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eggs-democrats-trump-biden-tariffs-ca0e8d9c557e849f4715628d5313b622\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democrats attacked</a> his administration over their price in March. He has even gone so far as to claim that prices are down by 400 percent. That figure is mathematically impossible – a 100 percent decrease would mean eggs are free.</p><p>During the first few months of Trump’s term <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/24/trump-says-petrol-and-grocery-prices-are-down-facts-say-otherwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">egg prices surged</a>, and then dropped due to an outbreak of, and then recovery from, a severe avian flue outbreak, which had been hindering supply – not because of any specific policy intervention.</p><p>In January, when Trump took office egg prices were $4.95 per dozen as supply was constrained by the virus. By March, the average egg price was $6.23.  But outbreak and high prices drove away consumers, allowing farmers with healthier flocks to catch up on the supply side. As a result, prices fell to an average of $3.38. That would be a 32 percent drop since the beginning of his term and a 46 percent drop from their peak price – far from the 400 percent Trump claimed.</p><p>Trump also recently said petrol prices are at $1.98 per gallon ($0.52 per litre) in some states. He doubled down on that again on Wednesday. That is untrue. There is not a single state that has those petrol prices.</p><p>According to Gasbuddy, a platform that helps consumers find the lowest prices on petrol, Mississippi at $2.70 a gallon ($0.71 per litre) has the cheapest gas, and the cheapest petrol station in that state is currently selling gas at $2.37 ($0.62 per litre).</p><p>AAA, which tracks the average petrol price, has it at $3.15 per gallon ($0.83 per litre) nationwide, this is up from the end of January when it was $3.11 ($0.82 per litre).</p><p>While petrol prices have gone down since Trump took office, they are nowhere close to the rate he has continually suggested. In July 2024, for instance, the average price for a gallon of petrol nationwide was $3.50 ($0.93 per litre).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"gdp\">GDP</h2><p>On Wednesday, the White House said that “President Trump has reduced America’s reliance on foreign products, boosted investment in the US”, citing the positive GDP data that had come out that morning.</p><p>That is misleading. While the US economy grew at a 3 percent annualised rate in the second quarter, surpassing expectations, that was a combination of a rebound after a weak first quarter, a drop in imports – which boosted GDP, and a modest rise in consumer spending.</p><p>The data beneath the headline showed that private sector investment fell sharply by 15.6 percent and inventories of <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/30/us-q2-gdp-growth-masks-broader-economic-downturn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goods and services declined by 3.2 percent</a>, indicating a slowdown.</p><h2 id=\"manufacturing\">Manufacturing</h2><p>The administration recently highlighted gains in industrial production, pointing to a boost in domestic manufacturing. Overall, there was a 0.3 percent increase in US industrial production in June. That was after stagnating for two months.</p><p>There have been isolated gains, such as increases in aerospace and petroleum-related sectors—1.6 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.</p><p>But production of durable goods — items that are not necessarily for immediate consumption— remained flat, and auto manufacturing fell by 2.6 percent last month as tariffs dampened demand. Mining output also decreased by 0.3 percent.</p><p>According to the Department of Commerce’s gross domestic product report, manufacturing growth among non-durable goods has slowed. While there was a 1.3 percent increase, that’s a decline from 2.3 percent in the previous quarter.</p><p>This could change in the future, as several companies across a range of sectors have pledged to increase US production, including carmaker Hyundai and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, which just pledged a $50bn investment over the next five years.</p><h2 id=\"trade-deals-and-tariffs\">Trade deals and tariffs</h2><p>In April, the White House replaced country-specific tariffs with a <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/2/us-labour-market-holds-steady-despite-tariffs-adding-177000-jobs-in-april\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10-percent blanket tariff</a> while maintaining additional levies on steel, cars, and some other items. It then promised to deliver “90 trade deals in 90 days.” That benchmark was not met. By the deadline, only one loosely fleshed out deal — with the United Kingdom — had been announced. As of 113 days later, the US has announced comparable deals with just a handful more countries and the European Union. The EU deal still needs parliamentary approval.</p><p>Contrary to the administration’s claims, tariffs do not pressure foreign exporters — they are paid by US importers and ultimately are likely to be passed on to US consumers. Companies, including big box retailer <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/15/largest-us-retailer-walmart-warns-of-price-hikes-because-of-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart</a> and toymaker Mattel, have announced price hikes as a direct result. <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/7/ford-to-raise-prices-on-three-cars-produced-in-mexico-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ford, for example, raised prices</a> on three Mexico-assembled models due to tariff pressures.</p><p>To protect their own economies, many countries have pivoted their trade policies away from the US. Brazil and Mexico recently announced a new trade pact.</p><p>The White House and its allies continue to defend tariffs by highlighting the increased revenue they bring to the federal government, which is true. Since Trump took office, the US has brought in more than $100bn in revenue, compared with $77bn in the entire fiscal year 2024. The price of imports for consumers <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/what-has-been-the-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-so-far\">has only risen</a> about 3 percent, but many expect that will change as the import taxes are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5477470/prices-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed on</a> to consumers.</p><p>The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"
