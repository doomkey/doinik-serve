We know that the US population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase — more births than deaths,” Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy, told The Associated Press news agency.</p>\n<p>The US fertility rate has gone up and down over the years, reaching 3.5 percent in the early 1960s before dropping to 1.7 percent by 1976 and then rebounding to 2.1 percent in 2007.</p>\n<p>Lower fertility rates are common in wealthier countries, and the new figures put the US roughly on par with its Western European counterparts.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The birth rate trends can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic stability and the affordability of necessities such as housing.

The midpoint of the forecast is 30 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 61 cents a share, according to LSEG data.</p>\n<p>American, which generates more than two-thirds of its passenger revenue from the US domestic market, said that if domestic travel demand continues to strengthen, it expects to hit the top end of its outlook. But if the economy weakens, it only expects to be at the bottom end of the forecast.</p>\n<p>“The domestic network has been under stress because of the uncertainty in the economy and the reluctance of domestic passengers to get in the game,” CEO Robert Isom told analysts on an earnings call.</p>\n<p>American said tepid domestic travel demand affected its bookings in July. Isom, however, said the performance is expected to improve sequentially in August and September.</p>\n<p>“We expect that July will be the low point,” he said.</p>\n<p>The company expects its domestic unit revenue, or revenue generated from each seat, to remain lower year-over-year in the third quarter. Its non-fuel operating costs are estimated to be up as much as 4.5 percent in the September quarter.</p>\n<p>American expects an adjusted loss per share in the range of 10 cents to 60 cents in the third quarter, compared with analysts’ estimates of a loss of 7 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.</p>\n<p>The company’s outlook contrasts with upbeat forecasts of rival Delta and United Airlines. Alaska Air Group has also reported improvements in passenger traffic and pricing power.</p>\n<p>Most US airlines withdrew their financial forecasts in April as President Donald Trump’s trade war created the biggest uncertainty for the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic. While some have reinstated their expectations, there is lingering uncertainty as to how the economy will fare in an ever-evolving tariff landscape.</p>\n<p>Demand in the domestic travel market has remained subdued, with budget travellers approaching their plans with caution, hurting carriers that primarily service the US domestic market and price-sensitive customers.</p>\n<p>Even summer, typically the peak money-making season for airlines, is falling short this year, with unsold standard economy seats forcing carriers to cut fares.</p>\n<p>It dented the second-quarter earnings of Southwest Airlines, the largest US domestic airline.</p>\n<p>At American, the domestic market was the weakest in the second quarter, with its unit revenue declining 6.4 percent from a year ago. The company’s unit revenue in international markets was up, led by a 5 percent annual jump in the transatlantic market.</p>\n<p>On Wall Street, the stock is taking a hit and was down 7.2 percent from the market open as of 11:30am in New York (15:30 GMT).</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Columbia will also regain access to billions of dollars’ worth of current and future grants under the deal.</p>\n<p>Columbia is required, within 30 days, to appoint an administrator who will report to the university president and will be responsible for overseeing the deal’s compliance. This includes verifying that the institution ends programmes that promote “unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas [and] diversity targets”.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Columbia must review its Middle East curriculum to make sure it is “comprehensive and balanced” and appoint new faculty staff to its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Columbia said the agreement establishes Bart Schwartz, of the compliance firm Guidepost Solutions, as an independent monitor who will report to the government on its progress every six months.</p>\n<p>The university will be expected to compile a report for the monitor to ensure its programmes “do not promote unlawful DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] goals”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-have-they-come-to-this-agreement\">Why have they come to this agreement?</h2>\n<p>Columbia said the agreement formalises <a href=\"/amp/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">already-announced reforms</a> to address harassment of Jewish students and staff, including the hiring of additional public safety personnel, changes to disciplinary processes, and efforts to foster “an inclusive and respectful learning environment”.</p>\n<p>The dispute between Columbia and the Trump administration began after Jewish students and faculty complained of harassment on campus by pro-Palestine demonstrators, while pro-Palestinian advocates accused critics of often wrongly conflating opposition to Israel with the hatred of Jews.</p>\n<p>Columbia’s acting president, Claire Shipman, said the agreement marked “an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty”.</p>\n<p>“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track. Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest,” she added.</p>\n<p>Trump hailed the settlement as “historic” in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming,” he wrote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-have-students-and-activists-reacted\">How have students and activists reacted?</h2>\n<p>Student activist group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) slammed the settlement as “a bribe”. “Imagine selling your students out just so you can pay Trump $221 million dollars and keep funding genocide,” the group wrote on X.</p>\n<p>It added that Columbia’s disciplinary action against students, including suspensions and expulsions, this week was a punishment that “hugely” exceeded the precedent for non-Palestine-related demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Non-governmental organisation Palestine Legal accused Columbia of “weaponising claims of antisemitism to punish those calling for freedom for Palestinians”.</p>\n<p>“It is clear that Columbia’s desire to create a community ‘where all feel welcome’ doesn’t extend to students who call for an end to Israel’s genocide,” the group posted on X.</p>\n<p>Hasan Piker, a left-wing activist, political commentator and a critic of Trump, said the US president was “underwater on everything and Columbia is still caving to Trump on everything”, adding “it seems like some of these institutions were looking for the pretext to go right”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-steps-has-columbia-already-taken-to-pacify-the-trump-administration\">What steps has Columbia already taken to pacify the Trump administration?</h2>\n<p>In March, Columbia <a href=\"/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">agreed to a list of demands</a> laid down by Trump in return for negotiations to reinstate its $400m federal funding, which he had revoked a month before, citing “a failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment”.</p>\n<p>Among other concessions, the university agreed to ban face mask coverings during protests, as well as to install 36 campus police officers with special powers to arrest students.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Columbia adopted a <a href=\"/news/2024/5/8/will-the-us-adopt-ihras-anti-semitism-definition-whats-the-controversy\">controversial definition of anti-Semitism</a> drafted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), which has been criticised for what some say is conflating criticism of the state of Israel and Zionism with anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>Critics have warned that the definition could be used to stifle dissent and curb academic freedom. In a <a href=\"/news/2023/4/4/rights-groups-urge-un-not-to-adopt-ihra-anti-semitism-definition#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20rights%20groups%20have,anti%2DSemitism%20and%20subsequent%20activities.\">letter</a> sent to the United Nations in 2023, 60 human and civil rights organisations said the definition should not be used.</p>\n<p>“The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe,” they wrote.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Columbia also announced it would suspend, expel or revoke degrees for nearly 80 students who participated in a Butler Library demonstration on its campus on May 7, 2025 and a “Revolt for Rafah” <a href=\"/news/2024/5/1/columbias-hamilton-hall-a-history-of-student-action-at-gaza-protest-hub\">encampment</a> on May 31, 2024 during the university’s annual alumni weekend.</p>\n<p><span>During protests, students demanded that the university’s $14.8bn endowment stop investing in weapons makers and other companies that support Israel.</span></p>\n<p>Protest organiser and former student <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/11/a-dangerous-moment-advocates-denounce-arrest-of-activist-mahmoud-khalil\">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, 29, was the first person to be detained during the Trump administration’s push to deport pro-Palestinian activists who are not US citizens.</p>\n<p>The school also said it would no longer engage with pro-Palestinian group CUAD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"which-other-universities-has-trump-set-his-sights-on-and-why\">Which other universities has Trump set his sights on, and why?</h2>\n<p>The Trump administration is focusing attention on 10 universities that it deems noteworthy in its campaign to root out anti-Semitism. These are Columbia; George Washington University; Harvard; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>Columbia University was the first college to see its funding slashed, but several Ivy League schools have been subjected to or threatened with funding cuts since Trump took office in January 2024.</p>\n<p>More than $2bn in total was frozen for Cornell, Northwestern, Brown and Princeton universities.</p>\n<p>In April, the administration also threatened to freeze $510m in grants to Brown University over alleged violations “relating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination”.</p>\n<p>Harvard University was the first – and has so far been the only – major higher education institution to defy Trump’s demands and fight back in federal court.</p>\n<p>This week, it argued in <a href=\"/news/2025/7/21/hearing-begins-in-harvards-case-against-the-trump-administration\">federal court</a> that the Trump administration had illegally cut $2.6bn in funding in what were politically motivated attempts to reshape the institution.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"are-deals-with-other-universities-expected-as-well\">Are deals with other universities expected as well?</h2>\n<p>Some universities are also believed to be in talks with the Trump administration, so more deals could be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>In particular, US news outlets have reported that officials from the Trump administration and Harvard are continuing negotiations, despite the court case brought by Harvard.</p>\n<p>In June, Trump posted on social media that “if a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be ‘mindbogglingly’ HISTORIC, and very good for our Country”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It’s become a sociocidal war,” he added, describing a conflict intended to destroy a society’s entire structures and sense of identity. “People have been left with nothing, and are feeling they can’t go on.”</p>\n<p>The constant spectre of death and the complete devastation of Gaza have driven many Palestinians there to desperation.

It’s not like dropping a bomb… Starvation can take 60 to 80 days. Semi-starvation, such as we’re seeing in Gaza, can take longer.</p>\n<p>“Israel has had ample and stark warnings that its actions are leading to mass starvation.

It’s about dismantling a society and reducing its people to desperate, starving victims,” de Waal added. “It also encourages the abuser to think of the sufferer as dehumanised, so it becomes self-justifying.”</p>\n<h3>A strategy of annihilation</h3>\n<p>Through its 21-month war, Israel’s leaders have repeatedly claimed their war on Gaza was to “defeat Hamas” and rescue the captives held in the territory.</p>\n<p>However, with every new offensive, its critics around the world have accused it of either turning a blind eye to the humanitarian consequences of its actions or actively seeking to punish Palestinians and force starvation upon them.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you can call this a strategy,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how much is planned, how much is tactical, cynical, opportunistic or just incompetence. It all depends where you look.”</p>\n<p>Mekelberg broke down the factions competing for final say in Israeli policy, from the messianic ambitions of ultranationalist government ministers, such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who would like to see the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank expelled, to a security establishment that Mekelberg described as divided over whether it should continue or end the war.</p>\n<p>“Lastly, you have the cynical and the opportunistic,” he continued, “which is essentially Benjamin Netanyahu and his adherents. To them, this is all about politics and surviving for another day,” Mekelberg said of the prime minister, who is on trial on multiple corruption charges.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3835332\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3835332\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3835332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-09T185432Z_1911545309_RC26JFARLUUE_RTRMADP_3_USA-ISRAEL-1752418834.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Netanyahu\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3835332\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been on trial on corruption charges throughout much of the war on Gaza [File: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>The legacy of destruction</h3>\n<p>The consequences of Israel’s actions in Gaza will last generations, analysts said.</p>\n<p>Those who survive Israel’s current war will carry its scars, as will their descendants, while those who leave are unlikely to be allowed to return.</p>\n<p>“Israel has adopted a formula in the last few weeks where it is making conditions in Gaza intolerable and unable to support human life,” said Mouin Rabbani, co-editor of Jadaliyya.</p>\n<p>“If it can reduce life to such a level and at the same time increase the level of chaos and anarchy [across Gaza], the thinking is that people will leave.”</p>\n<p>Once they have been forced from their homeland, either through the conditions that Israel has imposed, or via the one-way entrance into what Israeli government ministers call a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/lapid-olmert-slam-israels-plans-for-concentration-camps-in-gazas-rafah\">“humanitarian city”</a>, while many critics call it a concentration camp, it intends to construct along the border with Egypt, they won’t be allowed back, Rabbani said.</p>\n<p>Hardly a day has gone by since Israel’s assault upon Gaza began in October 2023 that its war has not dominated headlines.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, as starvation and the extent of the near-total destruction that Israel has visited upon the enclave have grown, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/is-the-international-community-finally-speaking-up-about-israel\">so too has the disquiet </a>among the international community.</p>\n<p>However, in the face of the protests, and with ceasefire negotiations supposedly ongoing, Israel’s war has shown few signs of slowing.</p>\n<p>That has left Gaza’s population, in the words of Summerfield, left to “wander Gaza; starving, alone and hunted”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

There have been skirmishes before, but this is the first time fighter jets have been involved, marking a significant escalation.</p>\n<p>The border areas are replete with centuries-old historical temples, some of which are claimed by both sides.</p>\n<p>Although the establishment of a demilitarised zone has been discussed in the past, there are no formal zones in place now.</p>\n<p>Troops from both sides clashed in 2011 near the Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, killing 15-20 people and causing the displacement of thousands.</p>\n<p>Cambodia first took the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1963. In 2011, Cambodia again went to the ICJ in relation to the Preah Vihear Temple. The ICJ ruled in Cambodia’s favour and handed it control of the immediate area around the temple in 2013.</p>\n<p>However, the court did not address any of the other disputed areas, especially those within the “Emerald Triangle”, a shared border region between Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, where troops also frequently clash.</p>\n<p>Thailand has refused to acknowledge the ICJ’s jurisdiction in this issue. Tensions have simmered until this year’s escalation.</p>\n<p>“The whole situation has been spiralling downwards for weeks, with Cambodia laying landmines that injured Thai soldiers, and Bangkok’s expulsion of the Cambodian ambassador was apparently the last straw,” Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates Consultancy, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“So now the question is really how long will both sides continue fighting, and how many civilians will get killed in the indiscriminate crossfire that is already apparent,” he added.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-have-tensions-escalated-between-thailand-and-cambodia-this-year\">How have tensions escalated between Thailand and Cambodia this year?</h2>\n<ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>On February 13, Cambodian soldiers escorted 25 civilians to the Prasat Ta Moan Thon Temple, where they reportedly sang the Cambodian national anthem. Thai military officials said they stopped the tourists from singing, on the basis that it violated mutual agreements about tourist protocols.</li>\n<li>On February 17, the Thai army sent a warning letter to the Cambodian military, accusing it of “inappropriate behaviour” and instructing it not to repeat the incident of February 13. In a statement, the Thai Ministry of National Defence said the temple was officially in Thai territory and that while Cambodian citizens could visit, singing the country’s national anthem “raises concerns”.</li>\n<li>On May 28, both sides clashed in the disputed border area of the Emerald Triangle, leaving one Cambodian soldier dead. The tri-border area connects Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. Again, each side blamed the other for starting the violence.</li>\n<li>On June 12, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announced that Cambodia would stop relying on Thai electricity and internet infrastructure due to “threats”. Cambodian TV stations stopped broadcasting Thai movies, and Cambodia also blocked imports of fuel and gas, as well as fruit and vegetables, from Thailand.</li>\n<li>On June 14, officials from both countries met in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for talks. However, no concrete agreement for peace was reached. Both countries instead boosted border security and tightened checks at crossings.</li>\n<li>On June 15, Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2024/8/16/who-is-paetongtarn-shinawatra-thailands-new-youngest-prime-minister\">Paetongtarn Shinawatra</a>, who is the country’s youngest premier at 38, held a call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen and discussed the tensions. Hun Sen is the father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet.</li>\n<li>On June 26, Thailand ordered operators to stop providing broadband and mobile internet connections to Cambodia.</li>\n<li>On July 1, Shinawatra was suspended after her phone call with Hun Sen was leaked to the public. In it, Shinawatra appeared to criticise the Thai military’s actions, signalling discord between the government and the army. Pro-military protesters have since called for her resignation.</li>\n<li>On July 16, a Thai soldier lost a leg in a landmine explosion while on patrol in First was in the Chong Bok area of Nam Zuen district, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, escalating tensions.</li>\n<li>On July 23, a second blast injured five Thai soldiers near Chong An Ma point, in Ubon Ratchathani province, causing a second soldier to lose a leg. Thailand immediately recalled its ambassador to Cambodia and shut border checkpoints at Chong An Ma, Chong Sa-ngam, Chong Chom and Chong Sai Takoo. Ta Moan Thom and Ta Kwai temples were also closed.</li>\n<li>On July 24, violence erupted between the two sides, involving heavy weapons and air attacks. Cambodia also recalled its diplomatic staff in Thailand.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3854833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854833\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-08T061146Z_947459385_RC24IFAMKY93_RTRMADP_3_THAILAND-ECONOMY-1753357315.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Thai PM\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3854833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thailand’s Minister of Culture, Paetongtarn Shinawatra reacts after a cabinet meeting, after Thailand’s Constitutional Court suspended her from duty as prime minister pending a case seeking her dismissal, at the Government House in Bangkok, Thailand, on July 8, 2025 [Chalinee Thirasupa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-the-military-forces-of-thailand-and-cambodia-compare\">How do the military forces of Thailand and Cambodia compare?</h2>\n<h3>Thailand</h3>\n<p>According to data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, cited by Reuters, Thailand has a large military with more than 360,000 active armed forces personnel.</p>\n<p>Its military is well-funded, with a defence budget of $5.7bn last year.</p>\n<p>It has about 400 battle tanks, more than 1,200 armoured personnel carriers and some 2,600 artillery weapons.</p>\n<p>It also has a fleet of aircraft, comprising passenger planes, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Cambodia</h3>\n<p>The International Institute for Strategic Studies data shows that last year, Cambodia had a defence budget of $1.3bn and has at least 124,300 active military personnel.</p>\n<p>Cambodia’s armed forces were established in 1993 following the merger of the country’s former communist military and two other resistance armies.

We may have to take actions we have tried to avoid in the past,” she said.</p>\n<p>For his part, Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Manet, has urged an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to stop “Thailand’s aggression”. Manet said Thai forces launched “unprovoked, premeditated and deliberate attacks” on the Cambodian border, violating international law.</p>\n<p>“Facing this flagrant aggression, Cambodian troops had no option but to respond in self-defence in order to safeguard Cambodia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Manet wrote in a letter to UNSC President Asin Iftikhar Ahmad.</p>\n<p>“It is profoundly reprehensible that this act of aggression occurs while Cambodia is actively pursuing peaceful and impartial legal avenues to resolve outstanding border issues with Thailand through both bilateral and international mechanisms,” he added.</p>\n<p>Both countries have closed borders and announced evacuations of their citizens from the border zones. The Thai embassy in Phnom Penh urged citizens to leave Cambodia.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-reactions-have-there-been-from-other-nations-and-international-bodies\">What reactions have there been from other nations and international bodies?</h2>\n<p>The United States and China issued warnings to their citizens to be vigilant in the border areas.</p>\n<p>The US embassy in Thailand urged Americans to heed advice from Thai authorities, who commenced evacuation from the worst-hit areas on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters at a news conference on Thursday that China is “deeply concerned” about escalating tensions between its neighbours, and stressed the importance of “maintaining friendly relations” with “long-term interests on both sides”.</p>\n<p>China will “continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace and dialogue to help ease tensions”, the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia and current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Thailand and Cambodia are members, said he would engage both sides in negotiations.</p>\n<p>“I have sent messages to both prime ministers and look forward to speaking with them later today or tonight,” he told reporters.</p>\n<p>“The least we can expect is for them to stand down and hopefully try to enter into negotiation,” Ibrahim said, calling the situation “worrying” and describing Thailand and Cambodia as key ASEAN members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-this-situation-escalate-further\">Will this situation escalate further?</h2>\n<p>Robertson of AHRLA said the situation would likely “get worse before it gets better”.</p>\n<p>Bad blood between Cambodian PM Hun Sen and former Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra, respectively the fathers of both countries’ current leaders, could add to the political will to continue fighting, Robertson said.</p>\n<p>Although Thaksin and Hun Sen were longtime allies, Robertson said Hun Sen’s leaking of the recording of  the damaging <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/court-suspends-thailands-pm-pending-case-over-leaked-phone-call\">phone call</a> between him and Thaksin’s daughter, suspended PM Shinawatra, means “the gloves are now off between the two sides.</p>\n<p>“Right now, neither side wants to be seen as conceding any ground to the other, so the fighting is likely to continue for some time, primarily in the form of firing across the border with artillery and firefights across the border in disputed areas,” he said.</p>\n<p>Robertson added: “We’re not going to see either side invade the other, but the damage will be lasting and it’s hard to see how this will be mediated towards peace, at least in the short-to-medium term.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The current tariffs are slated to increase on August 1, including levies ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent for 21 countries,  based on what the Trump administration has said.</p>\n<p>An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) – Congress’s nonpartisan number-crunching arm – also projects that 10 years of tariff revenue increases under Trump will not pay for the added deficits from his bill or the cumulative deficits over the next decade. The projected added deficit from the bill is $3.4 trillion, on top of the existing projected deficit over the next decade of $21.8 trillion.</p>\n<p>“I can’t envision a scenario where the tariff revenues eliminate the deficit,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks the federal budget.</p>\n<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-is-the-us-collecting-from-trump-tariffs\">How much is the US collecting from Trump tariffs?</h2>\n<p>The federal government has been taking in higher tariff revenues under Trump’s more aggressive tariff policies. Currently, the tariffs are a baseline 10 percent for all countries, plus additional tariffs on some products such as steel. Economists say consumers will ultimately swallow much of the tariff increases.</p>\n<p>Federal tariff revenue tracked by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model shows that, up to July 11, the federal government had collected about $100bn in tariffs so far this year. During the same period in 2024, before Trump took office, the federal government had collected less than $48bn in tariff revenue.</p>\n<p>In June 2025, the most recent monthly data available, the federal government took in $27bn in tariffs, according to the Treasury Department. A year earlier, that figure was $6bn. That’s an increase of $21bn a month because of Trump’s trade policies.</p>\n<p>If the government were to continue collecting tariff revenue at the June 2025 pace for a full decade – 120 months – that would produce $2.52 trillion in tariff revenue.</p>\n<p>That is in the ballpark of what the CBO published in June. Taking into account the potential economic shrinkage from higher tariffs, such as higher consumer prices, CBO projected that the boost in tariff revenue would reduce total federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-this-tariff-revenue-compare-with-the-federal-deficit\">How does this tariff revenue compare with the federal deficit?</h2>\n<p>Without adding in the deficits from the bill Trump just signed, CBO’s baseline projection for the cumulative deficits over the next 10 years is almost $21.8 trillion. That is about seven times the size of the CBO’s projected tariff revenues over the same period.</p>\n<p>And the projected tariff revenue under Trump would not fully cover the added deficits just from the “megabill” Trump signed. According to CBO estimates, the law Trump signed on July 4 will raise deficits by $3.4 trillion beyond their previous trajectory over the next 10 years, which exceeds CBO’s tariff revenue projection.</p>\n<p>There is uncertainty about how much tariff revenue Trump’s policies will generate, because he has frequently announced and then <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/10/how-trump-flip-flopped-on-pausing-tariffs\">paused</a> higher tariffs.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to know what the end game is,” Ellis said. “Is it high tariffs to generate revenue, which would reduce economic activity, or is it to rebalance the trade and eventually lower tariffs”, and thus their revenue?</p>\n<p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, has noted that Trump’s tariff policies have been challenged in court, and the <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/29/us-trade-court-rules-trumps-sweeping-global-tariffs-are-unlawful\">initial ruling</a> by the Court of International Trade went against the administration.</p>\n<p>If the initial ruling is upheld on <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/29/federal-appeals-court-temporarily-reinstates-trump-tariffs\">appeal</a>, then Trump would lose his power to unilaterally enact many of the tariffs he has been imposing, and the new tariff revenues now being generated would largely dry up.</p>\n<p>And even if Trump’s tariff powers are upheld on appeal, Trump’s successor could reverse them by executive order, meaning any tariff revenues would cover the next four years, not the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2>\n<p>Lutnick said tariffs are “going to pay off our deficit”.</p>\n<p>Trump’s on-again, off-again pattern for implementing tariffs makes estimates tricky. But two projections show that the Trump administration’s tariff revenues would not cover the next 10 years of projected deficits.</p>\n<p>The CBO said it expects tariff revenues to reach $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, while a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the tariffs collected in June 2025 would reach $2.52 trillion.</p>\n<p>Both sums are only a fraction of the nearly $22 trillion in cumulative deficits projected over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We rate the statement <strong>False</strong>.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
