Operation Midnight Hammer came towards the end of a 12-day war Israel initiated with Iran that month.</p><p>But eight months later, US and Iranian officials are once again <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/iran-says-ready-for-talks-but-will-defend-itself-against-us-aggression\">holding talks</a> to reach a nuclear deal and avert another war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Tuesday, Leavitt said the destruction of Iran’s nuclear programme had been “verified” by Trump and the United Nations’ watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p><p>“That does not mean that Iran may never try again to establish a nuclear programme that could directly threaten the United States and our allies abroad, and that’s what the president wants to ensure can never happen again,” she added.</p><p>Last year, after the US attack, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said Iran could resume <a href=\"/news/2025/6/29/iran-could-resume-uranium-enrichment-within-months-says-iaea-chief\">uranium enrichment</a> “in a matter of months”.</p><p>But the UN agency’s inspectors have not been able to assess Iran’s nuclear sites since the US strikes.</p><p>The Pentagon’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">public assessment</a> was that the Iranian nuclear programme was set back by one to two years.</p><p>There has been no official confirmation of the US claims that Iran has restarted nuclear enrichment after the attack.</p><p>After a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the US in December, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/trump-says-us-would-back-strikes-against-irans-missile-programme\">renewed his threats</a> to attack Iran if it tries to rebuild its nuclear or missile programme.</p><p>Tensions have spiralled since then, with the US <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">amassing military assets</a> near Iran.</p><p>Still, Tehran and Washington are set to hold the third round of negotiations this year to push for a nuclear deal.</p><p>Iran, which denies seeking a nuclear weapon, has said it would agree to minimal uranium enrichment under strict IAEA supervision in exchange for lifting sanctions against its economy.</p><p>But Trump has repeatedly stressed that it is seeking zero enrichment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Enrichment is the process of isolating and concentrating a rare variant, or isotope, of uranium that can produce nuclear fission.</p><p>At low levels, enriched uranium can power electric plants.

The estate spans 4.6 hectares (11.4 acres) and has 60 marble fountains that spill into mosaic-tiled courtyards. Gold-draped salons open onto gardens threaded with olive trees and more than 2,000 palms. A hammam steam spa sits beneath carved ceilings while an outdoor pool glints in the Moroccan sun.</p><p>It is the kind of property that keeps its owner beyond the view of the outside world.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In the summer of 2019, a wire transfer request bearing convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s signature and dated July 4 was submitted to buy the Moroccan palace – in a country that has no extradition treaty with the United States. Two days later, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on federal <a href=\"/news/2019/7/8/jeffrey-epstein-faces-sex-trafficking-and-conspiracy-charges\">sex trafficking</a> and conspiracy charges.</p><p>Newly released US Department of Justice documents reviewed by Al Jazeera show that in the months before that arrest, Epstein had been negotiating to acquire the Moroccan estate through a layered offshore structure spanning the British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein.</p><p>But as scrutiny intensified and details of Epstein’s life and crimes became public, the financial institutions that had long handled his money began to tighten their grip. The documents show banks rejecting wire transfers tied to his accounts and compliance teams escalating internal reviews. Tens of millions of dollars were sent abroad and then pulled back.</p><p>The records suggest that a man long adept at navigating complex financial systems was beginning to find those routes closing. A month after his arrest, he was discovered dead in US federal custody.</p><h2 id=\"epstein-and-morocco\">Epstein and Morocco</h2><p>Bin Ennakhil palace was not the first time Morocco had appeared in Epstein’s orbit.</p><p>Emails examined by French broadcaster <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/3jOxy/https:/www.franceinfo.fr/monde/usa/affaire-jeffrey-epstein/enquete-francetv-dans-les-dossiers-epstein-l-ombre-de-daniel-siad-chasseur-de-mannequins-soupconne-d-avoir-ete-un-recruteur-de-l-homme-d-affaires_7794857.html\">France Televisions</a> showed that as early as July 2002, a Swedish national of Algerian origin, Daniel Siad, described by witnesses as a recruiter working for Epstein, sent him a photograph of a young woman in Marrakesh. “Cute French girl in Marrakech,” one message read.</p><p>A woman later questioned by French police said Siad “wanted me to meet girls for Epstein, to give him massages, prostitution”. She told investigators Siad showed her photographs of Moroccan girls and asked whether they would appeal to Epstein. “I told him no, that he wouldn’t be interested,” she said, adding that she did not want “another girl to suffer”.</p><p>The exchange suggests Morocco was part of Epstein’s international network long before the palace negotiations of 2019.</p><p>In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months in jail under a much criticised plea agreement that shielded him from federal prosecution. For years afterwards, he resumed a life of wealth and influence, moving between homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, the US Virgin Islands and Paris and maintaining connections in finance, academia and politics.</p><p>He largely eluded scrutiny until late 2018 when the Miami Herald newspaper published a series of investigations revisiting the 2008 plea deal and giving voice to dozens of his accusers. The reporting triggered a renewed federal investigation. By early 2019, prosecutors in New York were quietly building a new case.</p><h2 id=\"a-palace-and-an-offshore-financial-structure\">A palace and an offshore financial structure</h2><p>Documents reviewed by Al Jazeera show that in February 2019, five months before his arrest, negotiations were under way for the purchase of Bin Ennakhil.</p><p>The transaction was not structured as a straightforward real estate purchase. Instead, emails show the deal involved acquiring shares in a Liechtenstein company connected to the property through a British Virgin Islands trust.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the correspondence, the broker noted the arrangement would “save 7% in government taxes”. The proposed buyer was identified as “The Haze Trust”, and the price under discussion was about 25 million euros ($29.5m).</p><p>The emails were handled by Karyna Shuliak, who was described in media reports at the time as Epstein’s girlfriend and who also worked for his companies. She advanced negotiations on his behalf.</p><h2 id=\"rejected-wires-and-new-accounts\">Rejected wires and new accounts</h2><p>However, internal banking records reviewed by Al Jazeera show that a month later on March 13, 2019, a wire transfer tied to “Epstein, Jeffrey E.” was marked “Rejected” by Deutsche Bank</p><p>The documents do not specify why the transaction failed. According to the Reuters news agency, Deutsche Bank was in the process of winding down accounts held by Epstein in 2019.</p><p>About this time, Epstein appeared to turn to a new financial institution: Charles Schwab. It opened three accounts for Epstein-linked companies in April 2019, including one for Southern Trust, an Epstein-owned entity trying to buy the Moroccan palace.</p><p>On June 26, 2019, Southern Trust instructed Schwab to wire roughly 11.15 million euros (then worth about $12.7m), to an account in Switzerland held by Marc Leon, the Marrakesh-based realtor handling the sale, according to a suspicious activity report described by Reuters.</p><p>The next day, Schwab received a call asking to reverse the transfer. The funds were due to be returned on July 10.</p><p>Two days before his arrest, on July 4, 2019, a second wire request was submitted by Southern Trust, this time for $14.95m. It was signed by Epstein.</p><p>According to the suspicious activity report cited by Reuters, the Southern Trust account did not contain sufficient funds at that moment because the earlier $12.7m had not yet been credited back to it.</p><p>The second transfer was cancelled on July 9, 2019.</p><h2 id=\"the-death-of-epstein\">The death of Epstein</h2><p>Additional documents reviewed by Al Jazeera show that by late July 2019, federal investigators were discussing a Charles Schwab account and Switzerland. One internal email noted that Epstein had “tried to send money … to Switzerland”.</p><p>Schwab told Reuters it had concerns about attempted wires “for the purpose of real estate, in light of negative media surrounding Jeffrey Epstein” and worries about him being a possible flight risk before a bail hearing.</p><p>By early July, the financial systems that had long sustained Epstein’s opulent life were beginning to close around him as transfers were flagged and the flow of funds reversed. Epstein’s financial manoeuvring had collided with a legal reckoning</p><p>On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey by a Crimes Against Children Task Force on charges of sex trafficking minors from 2002 to 2005.</p><p>Investigators seized electronic devices from his homes in New York, Florida and the US Virgin Islands. According to court filings, the search of his Manhattan townhouse yielded evidence of sex trafficking and hundreds, possibly thousands, of sexually suggestive photographs of girls.</p><p>Epstein sought release on a proposed $100m bond and offered to submit to house arrest at his Manhattan mansion. US District Judge Richard M Berman denied the request, ruling that he posed both a danger to the community and a serious flight risk.</p><p>The palace near Marrakesh with its fountains and marble courtyards was never owned by Epstein. Instead, he was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan, a federal jail where detainees are confined to small cells behind steel doors.</p><p>Weeks later, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell. The New York City medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some universities have already moved classes online for the remainder of the Iranian calendar year, which ends on March 20.</p><p>But videos released on Tuesday by students and local media from inside tense university campuses that are still open showed pro-state groups affiliated with the paramilitary Basij force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) violently clashing with anti-establishment students.</p><p>Major demonstrations also took place across multiple top universities in Tehran, as well as in Shiraz to the northeast and Isfahan in central Iran, all major hotspots during the nationwide protests last month.</p><p>Protesting students chanted “Death to the dictator”, “Freedom” and “With each killed, a thousand stand behind them”.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: Student clashes in gatherings at Tehran’s Khaje-Nassir-Toosi University of Technology.</em><br>\nPro-government students were seen holding public prayers and reciting the Shia Islamic chant of “Haydar Haydar” as they marched in universities with the backing of university officials and security forces.</p><p>State media said no students were arrested inside universities this week, but confirmed that a number of students have had internal disciplinary cases opened against them, and some have already been suspended. Many <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/iranian-families-mark-protest-killings-as-schools-observe-strikes\">students and schoolchidren remain imprisoned</a> after being arrested during and in the aftermath of the nationwide protests.</p><p>“Due to reports of violations of student disciplinary guidelines, you will not be allowed to enter the university grounds. Refer to the university’s security department to offer explanations as soon as possible,” read a text message sent to a number of protesting students shared online.</p><p>Masoud Tajrishi, director of the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, warned students on Monday that the prosecutor general’s office is now handling the issue of protesting students and that he would not help them if they are arrested.</p><p>“And if the number of those forbidden from entering the universities grows too much, we will hold all classes online,” he said, according to the university’s student publication.</p><p>The prestigious university’s website was hacked on Monday, with the hackers displaying its original name before the 1979 Islamic revolution – Aryamehr University. Officials had to take down the website for several hours to recover it.</p><p>Another cyberattack on the same day led to about 50,000 Iranians receiving a text message reading, “To the oppressed people of Iran: the US president is a man of action, you will soon see”.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the devastation wrought by the Kremlin’s drones, infantry, missiles and armour continues to be matched by economic destruction. This is a cost borne mostly by Ukraine: The World Bank now <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2026/02/23/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released\">estimates</a> the cost of reconstruction, were the war to end today, is now $588bn, nearly three times the country’s GDP.</p><p>Simultaneous to the fighting in Ukraine itself, the economic war between Russia and the West rages on. But that battlefield has shifted far more sharply than the one in southern and eastern Ukraine has over the past year. With a war of attrition being waged on the ground, how the geo-economic battleground plays out from here may well prove more important in determining how the conflict is ultimately settled.</p><p>The nature of the changes in both sides’ economic fighting conditions, however, is obscured by a dense fog of war. This is compounded by the fact that most participants in this economic conflict are increasingly happy to obscure the state of the geo-economics at play, and to let narratives play out that are more rooted in propaganda and politics than fact. To understand where the war is headed, it could help to bust three myths about Russia’s current state of economic affairs and Western capabilities.</p><p>The first is that the economic cost Russia has borne is manageable. The Kremlin may appear willing to wage the war no matter the cost to its coffers and people, but that does not mean that doing so is not devastating its economy.</p><p>As a result of the 2022 invasion, the Kremlin has lost what was its largest gas export market: Europe. Before the war, Russia sold roughly 150 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to the EU annually; that number is down to <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/where-does-the-eu-s-gas-come-from/#0\">38 bcm</a>. Based on the recent prices for European gas futures, every billion cubic metres is worth more than 300 million euros ($353m), meaning Russia is losing out on as much as 34 billion euros ($40bn) annually. That sum will increase next year when EU countries will phase out completely Russian gas imports.</p><p>Approximately $335bn in Russian sovereign assets remain frozen worldwide as well. Although the Kremlin has launched repeated legal challenges to the underpinning sanctions to scare off Ukraine’s backers from harnessing these in its defence, reading between the lines of recent Russian offers in negotiations indicates the Kremlin acknowledges a large portion thereof will never be recovered.</p><p>The Kremlin has also acknowledged that its remaining domestic piggy bank, the National Wealth Fund, is running dry, and with withdrawals at a record pace at the beginning of the year could even be spent by year’s end, barring a sustained uptick in oil prices.</p><p>The sole area of the economy that is performing well is that connected to the military and defence production, but sustained high borrowing costs and the decline in employable Russians due to war losses and recruitment mean that the Russian economy continues to bleed, too.</p><p>The second myth that must be dispelled is that the US has lost interest in fighting the economic war against Russia.</p><p>President Donald Trump may be making offers for Russian-American cooperation if a ceasefire and potential settlement to the conflict are reached, but it is still maintaining the sanctions.</p><p>In fact, his administration’s punitive economic measures are bringing real additional pain to the Kremlin in its sole remaining other major export market: oil.</p><p>Since Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in October, early signs suggest the measures are beginning to disrupt the Kremlin’s ability to place barrels on global markets.</p><p>The restrictions blacklisted firms responsible for a large share of Russian crude exports and deterred banks, traders and refiners from participating in deals, particularly in Asia. The Trump administration may lag well behind Europe in imposing sanctions on Russia’s shadow fleet, but it has outpaced Europe in targeting Iran’s, meaning there are more “black” barrels in the market than before.</p><p>The result has been a growing pool of oil in search of buyers. Cargoes have accumulated, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-05/russia-and-iran-oil-black-market-is-in-trouble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tens of millions of barrels</a> stranded in storage or on tankers without firm destinations as refiners hesitate to risk sanctions exposure. The emerging pattern suggests sanctions are not stopping exports outright, but forcing a slower and less certain trade in which Russian crude must hunt for buyers – and offer increasingly sharp discounts.</p><p>Therefore, even as the geopolitical risk premium driven by Trump’s threat to strike Iran has seen the benchmark Brent oil price reach more than $70 per barrel, Russia has had to offer discounts of as much as $30 per barrel to secure buyers.</p><p>This is not only a US story. Even in India, where Washington has openly negotiated on tariffs in exchange for decreasing Russian oil purchases, European sanctions have helped heap on the pressure. Brussels significantly sharpened its “anti-circumvention measures” over the past year, going as far as to target refineries in both China and India.</p><p>In the latter case, the country’s second-largest refinery, Vadinar, which is part-owned by Rosneft, has been blacklisted since the middle of last year.</p><p>Europe is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package and has proposed going further still, including with an outright ban on providing any support for the trading of Russian crude. That process, however, as well as the crucial 90-billion-euro ($106bn) loan that Brussels agreed to provide Kyiv in December, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/eu-sanctions-russian-officials-as-hungary-blocks-funds-to-ukraine\">has been delayed</a> by the latest round of intra-EU squabbling, after Hungary extended its veto on the eve of the invasion’s anniversary.</p><p>And therein lies the third myth due for dispelling in relation to the ongoing economic war: Europe must be prepared to pay for assistance to Kyiv from its own coffers. The EU does have a viable alternative: Russia’s frozen assets.</p><p>In fact, the 90-billion-euro loan plan was itself thrown together at the last minute in December, after the bloc failed to unite on a plan to harness these assets, the lion’s share of which is firmly under EU jurisdiction. Negotiations failed last year, but that does not mean they cannot be revisited.</p><p>With Russia-US-Ukraine diplomatic negotiations making no discernible progress, and both sides girding for fighting to continue unabated into a fifth year, the economic war is set to trundle on, as well.</p><p>To threaten a real collapse of the Russian economy and force Moscow to make concessions on ending the war, the West must take steps it has been unable to so far. The alternative is far worse: striking a deal on the Kremlin’s terms that may encourage future aggression.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last week, American diplomats and their Iranian counterparts sat down in Geneva for yet another round of talks mediated by Oman. The outcome seemed unclear. While the Iranians <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/irans-araghchi-hails-good-progress-in-nuclear-talks-with-us\">said</a> “good progress” had been made, the Americans claimed there was “a little progress”. Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump threatened once again to strike Iran.</p><p>In recent weeks, there has been a heavy US military build-up in the Middle East in preparation for what many observers see as an imminent attack. In this context, it may be apt to question whether the current negotiations are not simply a tactic to buy time to better prepare for the inevitable.</p><p>In the face of US military might, some have suggested that Iran’s only option is negotiating an agreement with the US, however unfair it may be. While Iranian military capabilities stand no chance against an army with the world’s biggest budget, accepting capitulation through a debilitating deal that may be broken again by Washington may not necessarily be Tehran’s only choice.</p><p>There is another way in which Iran can stand up to US bullying and win.</p><h2 id=\"the-fate-of-past-negotiations\">The fate of past negotiations</h2><p>The ongoing US-Iran talks cannot be viewed in isolation. For Iran, any diplomatic engagement with the US is overshadowed by the legacy of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).</p><p>Signed by the US, China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union and Iran in 2015, the agreement provided sanctions relief in exchange for full transparency of the Iranian nuclear programme. Tehran accepted the deal even though it had some unfair provisions, including some US sanctions remaining in place.</p><p>Nevertheless, it fulfilled its obligations – a fact that was repeatedly verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p>In return, however, the US as a signatory did not uphold its end of the deal. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed maximum pressure sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s economy.</p><p>It was a stark reminder that American promises are nonbinding. As a leader who has shown no regard for the interests of American allies in pursuit of an “America first” policy, Trump could hardly be expected to respect the interests of American adversaries.</p><p>However, even if a Democratic president had been in the White House, there would not have been any guarantee that the JCPOA would have remained in place. In the US’s polarised political climate, an American president’s signature is only valid until the next election.</p><p>For the US, negotiations can also be little more than a facade intended to lull adversaries into a false sense of security. Last year, just as US and Iranian representatives were scheduled to meet in Oman for another round of talks, Israel, a key American ally, launched a massive military campaign against Iran.</p><p>While the US denied direct involvement, it acknowledged having received prior notice. Given the close ties between the two countries, this prior knowledge strongly implied that the US had given Israel tacit approval for the air attacks.</p><p>Today, Iran is engaging in negotiations with the US again, and it is being pressured to accept an even more unfair deal. Should it back down and submit to US demands, then Trump – who preys on perceived weakness – would simply move the goalpost. Demands would shift from Iran’s nuclear programme today to its ballistic missiles tomorrow and regime change the day after.</p><p>The special US relationship with Israel means that Washington is fundamentally hostile to an Iranian government that sees the Israeli state as an enemy. Consequently, Trump’s goal is not to reach a durable agreement but to ensure that Iran can never fully comply with his demands, thereby justifying a permanent campaign of maximum pressure and hostility.</p><p>In this context and given its recent experience, it would be foolish for Iran to rely on US promises and negotiated agreements.</p><h2 id=\"leverage-through-strong-regional-ties\">Leverage through strong regional ties</h2><p>The current US-Iran standoff is a high-stakes game in which an all-out war is a likely outcome. While the US could achieve an initial victory through overwhelming military superiority, it could also get bogged down fighting a protracted counterinsurgency in Iran’s mountainous terrain.</p><p>Conversely, while Iran could eventually repel an American invasion – just as its Afghan neighbours did – the country would be reduced to rubble in the process.</p><p>That does not mean Iran should back down. The Greenland crisis and <a href=\"/news/2025/5/14/did-the-us-flinch-first-in-tariff-war-with-china\">the China-US trade war</a> have demonstrated that Trump’s propensity for sabre-rattling is tempered by his aversion to losses. Even though the EU and China are far more powerful than Iran, a clear show of resolve could compel Trump to retreat.</p><p>And Tehran does not have to be alone in its defiance. In its neighbourhood, there are other big players who recognise that another disastrous war led by the US is not in their interests. Iran can and should leverage the regional desire for stability.</p><p>For years, Iran pursued a policy of confrontation in the region until it realised that carving out a sphere of influence was actually exacerbating its security dilemma. This recognition ultimately led to the historic <a href=\"/news/2023/8/21/china-brokered-saudi-iran-deal-driving-wave-of-reconciliation-says-wang\">normalisation of relations</a> with Saudi Arabia in 2023 – a breakthrough facilitated by China, Oman and Iraq – which in turn set in motion a <a href=\"/news/2023/9/24/what-countries-have-normalised-relations-with-iran-after-saudi-detente\">broader detente</a> with other Arab countries.</p><p>Three years later, that decision is yielding dividends. Notably, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Turkiye and Qatar are <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">lobbying</a> Trump to exercise restraint. Building on this neighbourly diplomacy and investing in developing regional stability and a security architecture could help stave off another major US war in the region.</p><p>The most important path to peace – and the only means of countering American gunboat diplomacy – does not lie in matching American military might, a contest Iran is destined to lose, but in establishing good relations with its neighbours and accepting regional stability as part of its national security.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The slain aid workers were then buried along with their vehicles.</p><p>The Israeli military initially claimed the vehicles were “uncoordinated” and later admitted a “professional error”. But the forensic analysis paints a different picture: a coordinated ambush, an absence of return fire and a calculated move to eliminate survivors.</p><h2 id=\"the-science-of-the-massacre\">The science of the massacre</h2><p>The investigation relies heavily on a “situated testimony” technique and advanced audio ballistics to analyse the sound of gunfire to determine the shooter’s distance, weapon type and direction.</p><p>Investigators analysed footage recovered from the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan, a PRCS paramedic who began recording at 5:09am, when the ambush began. In a video lasting five and a half minutes, at least 844 gunshots were recorded. Combined with other recordings, the total documented count reached at least 910 gunshots.</p><p>In the video, filmed from inside one of the last two ambulances, Radwan can be heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the Islamic declaration of faith, the shahada, before he dies.</p><p>According to Earshot’s analysis, 93 percent of these shots featured a specific acoustic signature: a “supersonic shockwave”, followed by a muzzle blast. This combination confirms that the camera – and the aid workers huddled around it – were directly in the line of fire.</p><p>“The density of gunfire … frequently exceeds 900 rounds per minute,” the report states, noting that, at one point, five shots were fired in just 67 milliseconds. This rate of fire confirms that at least five shooters, likely many more, were firing simultaneously from an elevated sandbank approximately 40 metres away.</p><p>“Israeli soldiers ambushed and subjected Palestinian aid workers to continuous assault by gunfire for over two hours”, between 5:09am and 7:13am, the report says.</p><h2 id=\"from-ambush-to-execution\">From ambush to execution</h2><p>The report challenges the Israeli narrative of a chaotic “combat zone”. Instead, it describes a methodical massacre of Palestinian aid workers on their way to help people injured in Israeli strikes.</p><p>“There was no exchange of fire in the area, and no tangible threat to the safety of those soldiers. These attacks did not happen in ‘a hostile and dangerous combat zone’, as was claimed by Israeli spokespersons,” the report says.</p><p>By analysing the time delay between the sound of the gunshots and their echoes bouncing off a nearby concrete wall, investigators tracked the movement of the soldiers.</p><p>For the first four minutes, the soldiers held a fixed position on a sandbank. Then, the audio data shows the echo interval increasing, indicating the soldiers were moving down the hill, advancing roughly 50 metres towards the convoy while continuing to fire.</p><p>This corroborates the testimony of survivor Assaad al-Nassasra, a PRCS worker, who told investigators: “They were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.”</p><p>The most chilling findings concern the final moments of the attack. Analysis of a subsequent phone call made by paramedic Ashraf Abu Libda to dispatchers captures the soldiers arriving at the vehicles.</p><p>The audio analysis identifies specific gunshots where the distinct “supersonic crack” of the bullet disappears, leaving only the muzzle blast. Ballistically, this indicates the shooter was within 1 to 4 metres (3 feet to 13 feet) of the victim.</p><p>These shots coincide with the final sounds of movement from Abu Libda, suggesting he was shot while lying on the ground. A doctor who later examined the bodies confirmed the wounds were consistent with “<a href=\"/news/2025/4/4/palestinian-aid-workers-likely-shot-execution-style-forensic-expert-says\">execution-style</a>” killings.</p><p>Israeli forces have repeatedly been accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes during their genocidal war in Gaza that killed more than 72,000 Palestinians. A recent report by the medical journal The Lancet says the death toll in the first 16 months was much higher than the official figures. Despite a “ceasefire” in place since October, Israel has killed more than 600 Palestinians.</p><p>Rights groups and scholars have said the Israeli military offensive that turned Gaza into ruins is genocide. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hearing a case of genocide against Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for war crimes against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>The brutal killing of the 15 aid workers in March 2025 caused outrage, but Israel faced no legal or political consequences as it continued to receive backing from its Western allies, including the United States.</p><h2 id=\"hiding-the-evidence\">Hiding the evidence</h2><p>The report details a systematic attempt by Israeli forces to conceal the massacre in the hours that followed.</p><p>Satellite imagery from that morning revealed that bulldozers were deployed to the site. The emergency vehicles were crushed and buried, and earth berms were constructed over the scene to block visibility.</p><p>These forensic findings align with exclusive satellite imagery obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency last year. In a report published on March 30, 2025, Sanad revealed imagery taken on March 25 showing that at least five rescue vehicles had been “completely destroyed” and buried in sand by Israeli forces on al-Muharrarat Street – the site of the massacre.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4333861\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4333861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4333861\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1_25-03-2025-west-rafah-illustration-en-copy-1771927180.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C595&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Exclusive satellite imagery obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency reveals the destruction and burial of Palestinian Red Crescent and Civil Defence vehicles in Rafah.

Instead, it documents a deliberate attack on a humanitarian convoy that ended in the calculated execution of those who survived the initial barrage.</p></div></div></body></html>"

footballer Achraf Hakimi is to face a rape trial, ⁠a social media post from him has said.</p><p>In his post on X on Tuesday, however, the Morocco national team player denied the allegations.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">“Today, a rape accusation is enough to justify a ‌trial, even though I deny it and everything proves it’s false,” Hakimi said.</p><p class=\"p1\">“This is as unjust to the innocent as it is to the genuine victims. ⁠I calmly await this ⁠trial, which will allow the truth to come out publicly.”</p><p class=\"p1\">The Nanterre prosecutor’s office in the French capital of Paris had <a href=\"/news/2023/3/3/morocco-and-psg-defender-hakimi-charged-with-rape\">opened an investigation in ⁠2023</a> after a woman accused him of rape.</p><p class=\"p1\">The prosecutor confirmed on ⁠Tuesday that Hakimi’s case had been sent to trial.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hakimi’s lawyer, Fanny Colin, also confirmed the trial order in a statement to the AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"p1\">“A trial has been ordered on the basis of an accusation that rests solely on the word of a woman who obstructed all investigations, refused all medical examinations and DNA tests, refused to allow her mobile phone to be examined, and refused to give the name of a key witness,” Colin said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The plaintiff’s lawyer, Rachel-Flore Pardo, said her client was relieved to hear the case was going to court.</p><p class=\"p1\">She said the judiciary had been exemplary in handling the case.</p><p class=\"p1\">But its treatment in general showed “there are still areas where the #MeToo movement has not yet breached the sound barrier, chiefly in men’s football”, AFP quoted Pardo as saying.</p><p class=\"p1\">PSG will face Monaco in Wednesday’s return ‌leg of their Champions League knockout round playoff tie.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hakimi was in the initial ‌squad ‌list published last Tuesday.</p><p class=\"p1\">PSG coach Luis Enrique, when asked about Hakimi’s situation at Tuesday’s news conference, said: “This matter is in the hands of the authorities.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

She did not know whether he was alive.</p><p>When she reached Kosti, a city of about 460,000 people in the White Nile state with more than <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/only-sheets-to-cover-us-sudans-displaced-face-little-shelter-in-kosti\">42 shelters and nine displacement camps</a>, she expected to find a United Nations reception centre that would provide her with shelter, food and medicine.</p><p>Instead, a resident led her to a government school converted into a temporary shelter. The building, hosting dozens of other displaced families, was run by a neighbourhood committee and funded by Sudanese expatriates in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar who wire money monthly to cover rent, food and basic healthcare.</p><p>“We seek to ease the burden on displaced persons and vulnerable groups, while promoting a culture of volunteerism and cooperation among the residents of Kosti,” says Emad Asalaya, a 28-year-old coordinator of the neighbourhood committee known as For Cost.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332009\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332009\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332009\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-01-1771847474.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Kulna Qeem initiative distribute meals inside a temporary shelter in Rabak [Handout/Kulna Qeem]</figcaption></figure><p>Local volunteer groups, such as For Cost, have taken over support for Sudanese displaced by two years of civil war pitting government forces against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that, as of now, have killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.</p><p>Hundreds of such committees have sprung up around the country to provide shelter and food for hundreds of thousands of people since 2023.</p><h2 id=\"humanitarian-donations-dry-up\">Humanitarian donations dry up</h2><p>Kamal said that, before she was forced to leave Kadugli, she had heard that aid agencies were providing food and medicine to displaced people fleeing to safety in cities like Kosti.</p><p>“I felt lost because I had three children with me, and my diabetes medication had run out on the way,” she said. “I was afraid that I would get sick and not be able to take care of my children. At that moment, all I could think about was a safe place to sleep.”</p><p>“In the end, it was the city’s residents and neighbourhood committees who helped us. They shared what they had with us, even though their own circumstances were not easy. If they hadn’t done that, I don’t know how we would have survived.”</p><p>Kamal was one of hundreds of thousands of Sudanese displaced by fighting in South Kordofan and el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, who were able to reach cities already strained by two years of civil war, only to find that international humanitarian infrastructure had largely contracted.</p><p>Almost a year ago, in a March 2025 <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/urgent-appeal-major-donors-reduce-life-saving-funding-amid-sudan-crisis-statement-united-nations-resident-and-humanitarian-coordinator-sudan-clementine-nkweta-salami\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, described sudden cuts by leading Western government donors as “a catastrophic blow” to humanitarian assistance in a country she called “one of the deadliest humanitarian crises of our times”.</p><p>Things have not improved since then.</p><p>The UN said it was forced to cut its 2026 humanitarian appeal to $23bn after steep cuts by Western donors, including the United States. The UN had originally sought $47bn for 2025, but later <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/un-cuts-global-aid-plan-as-funding-plummets\">revised the figure</a> as aid cuts by the new administration in the US, followed by other top Western donors, including Germany, became clear.</p><h2 id=\"local-networks-absorb-what-institutions-cannot\">Local networks absorb what institutions cannot</h2><p>More than half of Sudan’s population is hungry and famine is spreading, according to the UN. The cuts come as displacement continues to push families into Khartoum, Kosti, White Nile capital Rabak, and other urban centres already over capacity.</p><p>Between 300 and 400 families benefit daily from the meals provided by For Cost, according to its estimates. In October 2025, its health awareness campaign reached more than 1,600 girls during a breast cancer awareness drive. Funding comes from private contributions and local partner organisations, a community-assembled line of defence against a gap that international donors have left widening.</p><p>In Rabak, Dwalbit Mohamed, an engineering graduate from the Sudan University of Science and Technology, has led the initiative known as We Are All Values since July 2023, operating charity kitchens at the Qoz al-Salam displacement camp and organising meals for patients at Rabak Teaching Hospital and al-Jasser camp.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332016\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332016\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332016\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-12-1-1771847485.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Min Ajl Kosti initiative assist in a temporary shelter [Handout/Min Ajl Kosti]</figcaption></figure><p>At Qoz al-Salam, Abdullah Muqaddam Toto, a 34-year-old father of five displaced from South Kordofan, lost his livelihood when fighting reached his area.

Initiative coordinators say dozens of families benefit weekly from this arrangement, a system that exists almost entirely outside formal humanitarian infrastructure, in a capital where that infrastructure is nearly absent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332014\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-11-1-1771847482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Min Ajl Kosti initiative assist in a temporary shelter [Handout/Min Ajl Kosti]</figcaption></figure><p>From Kosti to Rabak to Khartoum, the specific mechanisms change: a converted school, a camp kitchen, an empty apartment, but the dynamic is consistent: local communities absorbing a humanitarian burden that exceeds their resources, sustained by diaspora remittances, private donations, and volunteer labour, with no guarantee of continuity.</p><p>As war continues to reshape Sudan’s population geography, the question these networks face is not whether they can respond to emergencies — they already are — but whether improvised solidarity can hold under the weight of a crisis that international donors, by their own coordinator’s account, have left dangerously underfunded.</p><p>Asalaya warned that when humanitarian support declines, it directly impacts the number of families being served and the quality of the assistance provided.</p><p>“Despite this, we try not to let the displaced feel this shortage because they have come to us in very harsh circumstances, and it is our duty to support them as much as possible,” he said.</p><p> </p><p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.egab.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"
