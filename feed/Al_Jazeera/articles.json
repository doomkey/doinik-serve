As I stood by the side of the road, I felt a small hand tugging at my clothes.</p><p>I looked down and saw a little girl, no older than eight. She was barefoot, her shirt was torn, and her hair was messy and unwashed. Her eyes were beautiful, and her face showed innocence, yet exhaustion and despair clouded it.</p><p>She pleaded: “Please, please, give me just one shekel, God bless you.”</p><p>Before I gave her the money, I decided to speak with her. I knelt down and asked, “What is your name, my dear?”</p><p>She replied in a frightened voice, “My name is Nour, and I am from the north.” Her name, which means “light” in Arabic, stood in stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her.</p><p>I asked her, “Why are you asking for money, Nour?”</p><p>She looked at me hesitantly, then whispered, “I want to buy an apple… I crave one.”</p><p>In Gaza, a single apple now costs $7; before the war, a kilogramme of apples was less than a dollar.</p><p>I tried to ignore the pain rising in my chest. I thought about the circumstances we now face, where young children are forced to beg in the street just to buy an apple.</p><p>I gave Nour one shekel ($0.30), but as soon as I did, the situation worsened. A large group of children, all Nour’s age or younger, gathered around me, repeating the same request. I felt immense distress.</p><p>For more than two years, we have faced genocide. We have witnessed countless tragedies and horrors. But for me, the sight of children begging in the streets is particularly unbearable.</p><p>Before the war, Gaza was still a poor place. We used to see child beggars, but they were few, mostly roaming in a few areas. Now, they are everywhere, from the north to the south.</p><p>The genocidal war has destroyed families and livelihoods across Gaza. The carnage has orphaned more than 39,000 children, and the enormous destruction has deprived more than 80 percent of the workforce of their jobs, driving countless children into extreme poverty and forcing them to beg for survival.</p><p>But child begging is not just a result of poverty; it is a sign of a deep disintegration affecting the family, the education system, and the community. No parent sends their child to beg because they want to. The war has left many families in Gaza without options, and in many cases, there are no surviving parents to keep the children away from the streets.</p><p>Child beggars do not just lose their childhood; they also face exploitation, harsh labour, illiteracy and psychological trauma that leaves a lasting effect.</p><p>The more begging children increase in number, the more the hope for this generation diminishes. Houses can be rebuilt, infrastructure can be restored, but a young generation that is deprived of education and hope for the future cannot be rehabilitated.</p><p>The strength Gaza possessed before the war was not just about military power; it was about human power, the main pillar of which was education. We had one of the highest levels of literacy in the world. The enrolment rate for primary education stood at 95 percent; for higher education, it reached 44 percent.</p><p>Education stood as a counterforce to the debilitating siege that dispossessed the people of Gaza and crippled the economy. It nourished skills and ingenuity within the young generations to help them cope with an increasingly harsh economic reality. More importantly, education gave children a sense of direction, security and pride.</p><p>The systematic attack on Gaza’s education system – the destruction of schools, universities, libraries and the killing of teachers and professors – has pushed what used to be a remarkably resilient and effective educational system to the brink. The pillar that protected children and guaranteed them a clear future is now falling apart.</p><p>After I left the Nuseirat roundabout, Nour’s eyes stayed with me. It was not just because of the pain of seeing an innocent child being forced to beg. It was also because of the realisation that this encounter brought about: That the capacity of the next generation to rebuild Gaza one day is being taken away.</p><p>The world allowed Israel to carry out genocide in Gaza for two years. It knew what was going on, and yet it chose complicity and silence. Today, it cannot erase its guilt, but it can choose to redeem itself. It can take all necessary action to save the children of Gaza and to grant them the rights they are inherently given by the Convention on the Rights of Children: The right to food, water, healthcare, a safe environment, education, and protection from violence and abuse.</p><p>Anything short of that would mean continuing support for the slow genocide of Gaza.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Those who force authorities to arrest them “may never be allowed to return,” according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The decision comes <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ethiopia-travel-advisory.html\">despite</a> the State Department’s own travel advisory for Ethiopia, which urges Americans to “reconsider” travel to the country due to “sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping”.</p><p>The advisory, still in effect, warns that multiple regions remain off-limits and that the US embassy is “unlikely to be able to assist with departure from the country if the security situation deteriorates”.</p><p>Federal authorities justified the termination by citing peace agreements signed in recent years, including a 2022 ceasefire in Tigray and a December 2024 deal in Oromia. Analysts have also <a href=\"/news/2025/3/25/are-ethiopia-and-eritrea-on-the-brink-of-war\">warned</a> of the risk of renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p><p>The Federal Register notice acknowledged that “some sporadic and episodic violence occurs” but claimed improvements in healthcare, food security and internal displacement figures demonstrated the country’s recovery.</p><p>However, the notice also cited national interest concerns, including Ethiopian visa overstay rates that exceed the global average by more than 250 percent and unspecified national security investigations involving some TPS holders.</p><p>The Ethiopian termination is part of a broader pattern under President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved to end protections for nationals from Haiti, Venezuela, Somalia, South Sudan and other countries since returning to office.</p><p>His administration has dismissed many nations as “Third World” countries, a term largely no longer used given its pejorative impetus for developing nations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Over the past two weeks, Trump has escalated inflammatory racist attacks on Minnesota’s large Somali community in particular, including calling Somali immigrants “<a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/12/5/what-are-the-implications-of-trumps-somali-garbage-comments\">garbage</a>” and directing a surge of ICE agents into the state, alarming residents and drawing criticism.</p><p>As of March 2025, approximately 1.3 million people held TPS in the United States, according to the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based research and advocacy organisation.</p><p>Trump has identified immigration control as central to his national security strategy, with the document published this month describing migration policies in Europe and elsewhere as contributing to what they term “civilizational erasure,” a far-right theory which is has been comprehensively debunked.</p><p>The approach has drawn sharp criticism for its racial selectivity. While terminating protections for Ethiopians who fled documented armed conflict, the administration simultaneously opened a refugee resettlement programme for white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity, claiming “race-based discrimination”. That discrimination has been rejected by the South African government and by numbers of Afrikaners themselves.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera the contrast revealed a “perverse honesty” about the administration’s priorities.</p><p>“If you’re white and you’ve got connections you get in,” he said. “If you’re not white, forget about it.”</p><p>Legal challenges have mounted against several TPS terminations, with courts temporarily blocking some decisions.</p><p>Ethiopian TPS beneficiaries can continue working during the 60-day transition period, but after the deadline, anyone without an alternative legal status becomes subject to immediate arrest and removal.</p><p>The administration has offered what it calls a “complimentary plane ticket” and “$1,000 exit bonus” to those who depart voluntarily using a mobile app to report their departure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

detention for five months while prosecutors investigate <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/bolivia-arrests-ex-president-luis-arce-in-corruption-investigation\">allegations he embezzled millions of dollars</a> from a fund meant for Indigenous communities.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Arce, who left office just a month ago, appeared before Judge Elmer Laura in a virtual hearing on Friday, two days after his arrest on the streets of La Paz.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 2 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The judge rejected appeals from Arce’s legal team for his release and ruled he must await trial in one of the capital’s largest prisons, citing the seriousness of charges that “directly affect state assets and resources allocated to vulnerable sectors”.</p><p>No trial date has been set.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The accusations centre on Arce’s time as economy minister under former President Evo Morales between 2006 and 2017, when authorities say he oversaw the diversion of approximately $700m from a state fund created to channel natural gas revenues into development projects for Indigenous peoples and peasant farmers.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Interior minister of the new right-wing government, Marco Antonio Oviedo, has described the 62-year-old former president as “the principal person responsible” for approving transfers of large sums into personal accounts of government officials for projects that were never completed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Arce maintained his innocence during Friday’s hearing, saying he had no personal involvement in managing the fund and dismissing the case as politically motivated. “I’m a scapegoat,” he told the judge. “The accusations are politically motivated.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">His defence lawyers had requested his release on health grounds, noting his previous battle with kidney cancer.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">However, Judge Laura denied the appeal and exceeded the prosecution’s request of three months’ detention by ordering five months in a state prison rather than a juvenile facility.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The case first emerged almost a decade ago in 2015 when the Indigenous fund was shut down amid corruption allegations, but investigations stalled during the years of Movement Toward Socialism governance.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The probe was <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/bolivia-elects-centre-right-rodrigo-paz-as-president\">revived</a> after conservative President Rodrigo Paz took office last month, ending nearly two decades of left-wing rule in Bolivia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words

highest levels as Bolivia grapples with its worst economic crisis in 40 years. His vice president, Edmand Lara, celebrated Arce’s arrest on social media, declaring that “everyone who has stolen from this country will return every last cent”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Former ministers in Arce’s administration have condemned the arrest as an abuse of power and political persecution against the Movement Toward Socialism party.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">If convicted, Arce faces up to six years in prison.</p></div></div></body></html>"

China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history.</p><p>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has infuriated Beijing after her remarks last month in which she projected that a hypothetical Chinese attack on the self-governed island of Taiwan could trigger a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">military response</a> from Japan.</p><p>Doves flew over the national memorial centre in Nanjing after the ceremony, which was completed in less than half an hour, in front of an audience that included police officers and schoolchildren.</p><p>Shi Taifeng, head of the ruling Communist Party’s powerful organisation department, made far less combative remarks than recent rhetoric from Chinese government officials.</p><p>“History has proven and will continue to prove that any attempt to revive militarism, challenge the post-war international order, or undermine world peace and stability will never be tolerated by all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples around the world and is doomed to fail.”</p><p>He did not mention Takaichi but alluded to China’s previous assertions that the Japanese leader seeks to revive the country’s history of militarism.</p><p>On Saturday, the Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army put out a picture on its social media accounts of a large bloody sword, of the type used by many Chinese soldiers during the war, chopping off the head of a skeleton wearing a Japanese army cap.</p><p>“For nearly 1,000 years, the eastern dwarves have brought calamity; the sea of blood and deep hatred are still before our very eyes,” it said, using an old expression for Japan.</p><h2 id=\"dispute-over-taiwan\">Dispute over Taiwan</h2><p>Last month, Japan’s Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">announced</a> that Tokyo was moving forward with plans to deploy a missile system on Yonaguni, the country’s westernmost island located 110km (68 miles) off Taiwan’s east coast, which has hosted a Japanese military base since 2016.</p><p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs blasted the announcement, describing Japan’s plan as a “deliberate attempt to create regional tension and provoke military confrontation”. Koizumi pushed back, saying the Type 03 guided missile system was purely defensive and “intended to counter aircraft and missiles invading our nation”.</p><p>Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory and has promised to unite the island with the Chinese mainland, an aspiration that Taipei says infringes on its sovereignty and that only Taiwan’s citizens can decide their future.</p><p>Both countries have since traded quarrelsome accusations, with Japan summoning China’s ambassador earlier this month over an incident in which Chinese military aircraft <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/japan-accuses-chinese-jets-of-directing-fire-control-radar-at-its-aircraft\">allegedly twice locked fire-control radar</a> onto Japanese fighter jets.</p><p>Illuminating aircraft with radar signals a potential attack that could force targeted planes to take evasive measures, making it among the most threatening actions a military aircraft can take.</p><p>For its part, the Chinese embassy denied Tokyo’s claims, saying in a statement that “China solemnly demands that Japan stop smearing and slandering, strictly restrain its frontline actions, and prevent similar incidents from happening again”.</p><p>Beijing has summoned the Japanese ambassador, <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/22/china-spat-with-japan-on-taiwan-deepens-reaches-un-whats-it-all-about\">written to the United Nations</a>, urged citizens to avoid travelling to Japan and renewed a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/china-to-suspend-imports-of-japanese-seafood-amid-diplomatic-row-reports\">ban on Japanese seafood imports</a>, while cultural events involving Japanese performers and movies <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan\">have also been hit</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Despite unanimous support at the UN for <a href=\"/news/2024/5/23/ancient-humans-lived-in-east-timor-44000-years-ago-archaeologists-find\">Timorese self-determination</a>, Indonesian troops launched their invasion on December 7, 1975.</p><p>Ramos-Horta’s colleagues, including Prime Minister Nicolau Lobato and other Fretilin leaders, either went into hiding or were killed in the ensuing attack. Unable to return home, Ramos-Horta became East Timor’s voice in exile for the next 24 years.</p><p>During his exile, Ramos-Horta lobbied governments, human rights organisations, and the UN to condemn Indonesia’s occupation, which resulted in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 Timorese through conflict, famine, and repression.</p><p>Silenced by a military-imposed media blackout for much of the 1980s, it was only in the 1990s that reports of Indonesian atrocities – including the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre – began to filter out and East Timor’s struggle for independence gained international attention.</p><p>Ramos-Horta’s tireless advocacy earned him a Nobel Peace Prize, along with Bishop Carlos Belo, in 1996.</p><p>A UN-sponsored referendum delivered an overwhelming vote for independence in 1999, leading to a fully independent East Timor in 2002. However, the country continues to face economic challenges and remains one of Southeast Asia’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/east-timor-mps-bow-to-protesters-vote-to-scrap-lifetime-pensions\">poorest nations.</a></p><p>In the years overseeing his country’s transition from conflict to reconciliation, Ramos-Horta has held the roles of foreign minister, prime minister and now president.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ali MC sat down with Ramos-Horta on a recent trip to East Timor, where the president spoke about his country’s long road to peace and hopes for it to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/26/dream-realised-east-timor-becomes-aseans-11th-member\">prosper from membership</a> of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), increased trade with China, and development of the offshore Greater Sunrise gas field.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Reflecting on your role as an ambassador for East Timor after Indonesia’s 1975 invasion, what were some of the key challenges that you faced while advocating for your country on the international stage?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> First, we were in the midst of the Cold War with that catastrophic US engagement in the wars against North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.</p><p>Then, you can say – the US defeat, if not military defeat, it was a total political defeat at the hands of the Vietnamese. So, it was in the midst of all of this that Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste [the official Portuguese-language name for East Timor], on December 7, 1975. The day before, US President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger were in Jakarta, and they officially gave the green light to President Soeharto to invade – immorally – with the use of American weapons.</p><p>So, it was within this context that it was very challenging for us to mobilise sympathy, support and the media. The invasion merited only one small, short column in The New York Times.</p><p>In Australia, there was more coverage. But the coverage didn’t last long, because Indonesia did a very good job, with Australian complicity, in blocking any news out of East Timor. At that time, not a single journalist came – the first foreign journalist to come here was in 1987.</p><p>The absence of [proof of] death is the worst enemy of any struggle. There were terrible massacres on the day of the invasion, hundreds of people shot and dumped into the sea, including an Australian, Roger East [a journalist killed by Indonesian forces on the day of the invasion].</p><p>Many, many countless people shot on the spot. Many were alive and dragged to the port of Dili, shot and fell into the sea. Many more killed randomly around town. And zero media coverage, not a single camera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4137014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4137014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4137014\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2023-09-21T143545Z_352115851_RC22D3ARDTOX_RTRMADP_3_UN-ASSEMBLY-1764315235.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"East Timorese President Jose Ramos-Horta addresses the 78th Session of the U.N.

This must be backed up with visuals.</p><p>But people were sympathetic and listened to me. I was persuasive enough for them to believe what might be going on.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: Given your own personal experience in the struggle for independence in East Timor, does that influence the way that you advocate? Does that bring a more personal response to your diplomacy?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> My personal instinct as a person is not shaped by anyone, by any school, any religion. It is me, always, against injustice and abuse.</p><p>Then came our experience and the fight for independence. When we fought for independence and for freedom, I went around the world begging for support, begging for sympathy. Then, we became independent.</p><p>Well, how can I not show sympathy in a real way towards the Palestinians? Why would I not show sympathy in a real way towards the people of Myanmar? Just showing sympathy, because we cannot do much more.</p><p>What can we do? We are not even a mid-sized country. But speaking out – a voice – is very important.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: What are your reflections on what has occurred in Gaza?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> It is one of the most abominable humanitarian catastrophes in modern times, in the 21st century, next to the killing fields in Cambodia during Pol Pot’s regime.</p><p>The amount of bombs dropped on Gaza is more than the combined amount of the bombs dropped on London and Dresden during World War II, and more than the bombs dropped on Cambodia by the Americans during the Vietnam War.</p><p>The suffering inflicted on civilians, women and children is just unbelievable.</p><p>How we, human beings in this 21st century, can descend so low and how Israel, a country that I always admired, first out of sympathy for what Jewish people went through, through their lives, through their history – always persecuted, always having to flee, and then culminating in the horrendous Holocaust. When you survive a Holocaust experience, like the Jews, I would think that you are a person that is the most sympathetic to anyone yearning for freedom, for peace, for dignity. Because you understand.</p><p>They [Israelis] are doing the opposite.</p><p>And you have to understand, also, the people who are on the other side. You know the Palestinians, who had 70 years of occupation and brutality, they are not going to show any sympathy to the Jews or Israelis.

I know the whole world, literally, and I don’t know of anyone in the whole world that I know that considers Iran a threat to them.</p><p>I feel nauseated with such dishonesty, such inhumanity. So, I’m thoroughly disappointed. And I was always an admirer of the West.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: Reflecting on many decades in politics in East Timor, is there anything that stands out to you as a personal success or something that you feel most proud about?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> I feel proud that we have been able to keep the country at peace. We have zero political violence. We have zero ethnic-based or religious-based tensions or violence. We don’t have even organised crime. We have never had a bank robbery or armed robbery in someone’s home. We don’t have that. And we are ranked among having the freest media in the world and the freest democracy in the world. I’m proud of my contribution in that.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4168860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4168860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4168860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/East-Timor-Additional-2-2-1765528720.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"While East Timor has one of the highest Catholic populations worldwide, LGBT rights have become more accepted, with even President Ramos - Horta a supporter. 2.

What will be the benefits of being a part of that?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> We’ll be part of a community of 700 million people, a community whose combined GDP is at least $4 trillion.</p><p>And that means the possibility of Timor-Leste benefitting from our neighbours is greater. There will be more free movement of capital. There’ll be more people attracted to visit Timor-Leste and more embassies opening.</p><p>These are the benefits of being associated with <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/26/asias-youngest-nation-east-timor-declared-aseans-11th-member\">an organisation like ASEAN</a>.

Are there any tensions over East Timor’s relationship with China?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> We don’t view China as an enemy of anyone, unlike some in America.</p><p>The US is not able to digest the fact that China today is a global superpower, that China today is a major global financial and economic power. That it is no longer the US that rules this unipolar world, that it has a competitor.</p><p>But the Chinese are very modest, and they say they are not competing to be number one with the US.</p><p>Any rational, intelligent person who is informed about China – even if a leader emerged in China that would view Australia and the US with hostility – would, in his right mind, think that you can overpower the US economically and militarily.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: What is the projected benefit economically for East Timor from the Greater Sunrise Gas Field?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> The existing studies point to it taking seven years for the whole project to be completed and deliver gas and revenue to Timor-Leste.</p><p>But long before that, the day we sign the agreement, within the following few months, two years, a lot of investments already start to happen. Because we have to build all the infrastructure on the south coast that will run into the tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The pipeline will take its time to reach Timor, but the pipeline will be served by all the infrastructure built on the south coast, plus housing. Hundreds, maybe thousands of houses for workers, for people and so on. Then improvement in the agriculture sector. Farmers in the community benefitting because they will sell produce to the company, to the workers and so on.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4137038\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4137038\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4137038\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ramos-Horta-Article-6-1764315950.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Despite more than two decades of independence, Timor - Leste remains one of the poorest countries in the region (Ali MC/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4137038\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite more than two decades of independence, East Timor remains one of the poorest countries in the region [Ali MC/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
