But not the FBI and not our partners,” said Darren Cox, a deputy assistant director in the FBI.</p><p>He explained that the investigation involved sorting through “3 million lines of data”.</p><p><span>“We do not forget, we do not give up, and we do not relent. Though it had been nearly five years, our team continued to churn through massive amounts of data and tips that we used to identify this suspect,” he said.</span></p><p>Officials under Presidential Donald Trump also touted the arrest as a victory for the current Republican administration — and a sign of the incompetence under Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.</p><p>“We did not discover any new information,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on Thursday.</p><p>“An investigation spearheaded by the deputy director and the AIC [agent in charge] of our Washington field office brought in a new team of investigators and experts, reexamined every piece of evidence, sifted through all the data — something that the prior administration refused and failed to do.”</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was also at the news conference, explained that Cole would be charged with the illegal use of an explosive device.</p><p>She added that the investigation was ongoing and that further charges could be filed at a later date.</p><h2 id=\"a-long-running-investigation\">A long-running investigation</h2><p>The arrest potentially ends a nearly five-year-long mystery that underscored the rising threat of political violence in the US.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies have said that the bombs, which did not explode, were viable and “could have seriously injured or killed innocent bystanders”.</p><p>Officials offered $500,000 for information on the perpetrator, warning that the suspect “may still pose a danger to the public”.</p><p>Early on, authorities released grainy footage of the person who left the bombs. The suspect, long believed to be a man, was captured on surveillance cameras wearing a mask, gloves and a grey hoodie.</p><p>The perpetrator walked through the densely populated Capitol Hill neighbourhood to arrive near the offices of the Democratic and Republican Parties, where he placed the pipe bombs.</p><p>Last year, the FBI said its analysts, agents and law enforcement partners had “worked thousands of hours conducting interviews, reviewing physical and digital evidence, and assessing tips from the public about who may have placed pipe bombs on Capitol Hill”.</p><p>The day after the bombs were left, President Trump’s supporters <a href=\"/news/2022/12/23/5-key-takeaways-from-january-6-panels-report-on-us-capitol-riot\">stormed and ransacked</a> the US Capitol to prevent the certification of Biden’s victory in the 2020 elections.</p><p>Trump continues to falsely claim that his election loss that year was due to widespread voter fraud.</p><p>In one of his first decrees after returning to the White House early in 2025, Trump issued a presidential pardon for more than 1,500 people charged or convicted of criminal offences related to the riot.</p><p>The mystery surrounding the pipe bombs has fuelled right-wing conspiracy theories that the Capitol riot was an “inside job”. Some online personalities have maintained, without evidence, that the would-be bomber was a “deep state” government agent who sought to discredit Trump’s supporters.</p><p>But even some Trump officials who previously helped spread such theories, like Dan Bongino, have since come out strongly against them.</p><p>Last month, Bongino, now the second-in-command at the FBI, <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDDBongino/status/1988956947190616397\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denounced</a> rumours about the pipe bombing case, calling them “grossly inaccurate”. He added that the misinformation “serves only to mislead the public”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ilhan Omar is garbage. Her friends are garbage,” Trump said.</p><p>“ When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but b****, we don’t want them in our country.”</p><p>Minnesota state Senator Omar Fateh, who is of Somali descent, called Trump’s comments “hurtful” and “disgraceful”.</p><p>“Also, it was flat out wrong — calling not only our congresswoman ‘garbage’ but calling the entire community ‘garbage’, saying they’re good for nothing,” Fateh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It is a community that has been resilient, that has produced so much. We are teachers and doctors and lawyers and even politicians taking part in every part of Minnesota’s economy and the nation’s economy.”</p><p>The state legislator accused Trump of engaging in “political theatre” to rally his base ahead of next year’s mid-term elections.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Fateh warned that the president’s rhetoric could fuel further political violence in Minnesota.</p><p>Already, in June, a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/minnesota-lawmakers-targeted-in-deadly-politically-motivated-shootings\">gunman in Minnesota assassinated</a> a Democratic state legislator and her husband and injured another lawmaker.</p><p>“Right now our community is afraid,” said Fateh, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor Minneapolis last month.</p><p>“We’ve had our mosques be targeted. Myself, I had a campaign office vandalised earlier this year, and so we want to make sure that our neighbours understand that we’re standing up for one another, showing up in this time in which we have a hostile federal government.”</p><p>Khadijo Warsame, a cafe owner in Minneapolis, echoed the feeling that Trump’s remarks have created an atmosphere of fear in the local Somali community.</p><p>“It is deserted. Every business is closed, and it has been like this for the last three days,” she told Al Jaeera. “And we are really a small business. I’m scared that people [are] not showing up to buy from me, and I am like, I don’t want to close my business.”</p><p>Trump has escalated his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies after the deadly shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington, DC, last month.</p><p>An Afghan evacuee who worked with allied forces during the US war in Afghanistan has been charged with the shooting and has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/rahmanullah-lakanwal-pleads-not-guilty-in-us-national-guard-shooting\">pleaded not guilty</a>.</p><p>Trump has long attacked Congresswoman Omar and the Somali community, but his tirade against them during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting was especially striking.</p><p>“ They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump said.</p><p>“These aren’t people that work. These aren’t people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on. Let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing.”</p><p>Omar has told reporters this week that Trump’s xenophobic and Islamophobic comments are not new. “But what is weird to me is just how creepy he’s been obsessed with me and the Somali community,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump’s comments have also been rejected in Somalia, where many people are expressing anger and calling on their government to respond to the US president.</p><p>The US president had called the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/under-trump-us-strikes-on-somalia-have-doubled-since-last-year-why\">East African country</a> “hell”, saying that “it stinks”.</p><p>“This is intolerable,” said Mogadishu resident Abdisalan Ahmed.</p><p>“Trump insults Somalis several times every day, calling us garbage and other derogatory names we can no longer tolerate. Our leaders should address his remarks.”</p><p>On Thursday, several key Democratic congressmembers released a statement condemning Trump’s comments, calling them “xenophobic and unacceptable”.</p><p>“Instead of using the power of the presidency to bring our country together, President Trump chose to attack an American immigrant community, the overwhelming majority of whom are law-abiding and have made many positive contributions to the United States,” the legislators said in a joint statement.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One of the houses raided belongs to the family of Muhammad Barahmeh, who was shot and killed last year by Israeli forces.</p><p>The military also turned one house into a makeshift interrogation site, Wafa reported, holding several young men there for questioning. Palestinian reports said that at least two people were arrested in Qalqilya, in addition to 11 Palestinians held following similar raids on Thursday in Ramallah, Hebron, Jenin and Nablus.</p><p>Violence has surged across several towns in the northern West Bank over the past week, following the launch of a new Israeli military operation. The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/israels-siege-on-west-bank-city-raises-alarms-over-ethnic-cleansing\">offensive</a> began in Tubas and Tammun in late November and was later extended to Qabatiya and Masliya, bringing curfews, raids, widespread arrests and significant damage to local infrastructure.</p><p>The Israeli army has said the goal of its operations in the occupied West Bank is to arrest Palestinian fighters. Israel has conducted near-daily raids in the region since 2022 that have escalated since it began its genocidal war in Gaza in October 2023. The raids have made daily life for Palestinians in the West Bank increasingly difficult, and have forced tens of thousands from their homes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dreams-of-annexation\">Dreams of annexation</h2><p>Local Palestinian sources, including Tubas Governor Ahmed Asaad, also claim that the recent uptick in violence in the northern West Bank is aimed primarily at imposing “new realities” in the area around the Jordan Valley, which runs along the West Bank’s border with Jordan.</p><p>Senior politicians in Israel continue to push for an expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, and particularly in the Jordan Valley, tightening Israel’s grip on the territory, paving the way for annexation. The expansion of Israeli settlements also effectively makes a Palestinian state impossible under current circumstances.</p><p>Annexing the West Bank is a particular focus of the right-wing settler groups that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of both encouraging and relying upon to sustain his coalition and his political survival. In June 2024, Netanyahu quietly <a href=\"/news/2024/6/21/is-israels-smotrich-fulfilling-his-dream-of-annexing-the-west-bank\">increased</a> much of the control already granted over the territory to far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in an illegal settlement.</p><p>Reacting to a United Nations nonbinding resolution endorsing a two-state solution in September, Smotrich wrote on social media that, in response, “Israel must apply sovereignty [to the West Bank] as a preventive measure against the reckless attempt to establish a terror state in the heart of our land”.</p><p>Right groups and international monitors have noted an increase in attacks by the Israeli military and settler groups since the war on Gaza began. In <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/israels-push-to-displace-thousands-from-the-occupied-west-bank\">addition</a> to storming refugee camps in Jenin, Nur Shams, and Tulkarem in January, attacks by the Israeli military, settler groups, or combinations of the two have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians and injured nearly 10,000 across the occupied West Bank, UN figures show.</p><p>Israel has arrested more than 18,000 people over the same period, according to Palestinian rights groups.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty_69319a1317-1764858387.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"133\" data-end=\"539\">Israel hasn’t talked about the “war” in Gaza for many weeks. After all, there’s a ceasefire in place, is there not? The fact that more than 350 Palestinians, including more than 130 children, have been killed during this so-called “ceasefire” is neither here nor there, as is the fact that Israel killed them. Palestinians die because that is what Palestinians are there to do. There is nothing to discuss.</p><p data-start=\"541\" data-end=\"1158\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pardon request, however, is another ball of wax. It is all anyone in Israel seems to be talking about, on every side of the political divide. Nothing better reflects the Netanyahu age (my daughter is 22, and she has barely experienced an Israel not led by Netanyahu). Those enraged by Netanyahu point out that it isn’t even a pardon request. The president of Israel (currently Isaac Herzog, a former head of the opposition to Netanyahu) has the legal authority to pardon “felons”. But felons are people who have been convicted in court of breaking the law. Netanyahu is still on trial.</p><p data-start=\"1160\" data-end=\"1902\">There has only been one pardon given before conviction (before a trial, actually) in the history of Israel. It was granted to Shin Bet personnel who, in 1984, stormed a bus hijacked by Palestinians and beat two of the hijackers to death. The internal investigation into what came to be known as the Bus 300 affair was rigged by the leadership of Shin Bet. Two years later, an unprecedented deal was reached that not only pardoned the Shin Bet members accused — but never convicted — of the extrajudicial killings, but also allowed Shin Bet leaders who manipulated the investigation into the incident to resign without being indicted. Special security circumstances were cited. Netanyahu is basically asking to invoke those same circumstances.</p><p data-start=\"1904\" data-end=\"3347\">Then again, he is not merely asking for a pardon. He is asking the president (a largely ceremonial role) to stop the trial in the interest of “national unity” and the “stupendous developments” expected (by Netanyahu) in the Middle East. As far as his devoted supporters are concerned, the trial should never have begun. They have advocated for both immunity from prosecution and a mistrial due to the “weakness” of the indictments he faces. Now, in the middle of a never-ending war (at Netanyahu’s instigation and orchestration), his supporters claim that his presence is necessary full-time at the helm. They describe his trial as a personal vendetta by the Israeli legal system, a result of the “crucial” legal and judicial reform Netanyahu began to implement long before October 7, 2023. These supporters, in parliament and the media, consider the uproar in response to Netanyahu’s request a perfect representation of the hatred of the Israeli “deep state” towards Netanyahu and towards Israel in general. They have responded to Netanyahu’s request with gusto that ranges from Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman warning that if Herzog does not halt the trial, Donald Trump will be “forced to intervene” against Israel’s judicial establishment, to Netanyahu’s personal attorney, Amit Hadad, insisting that the trial must stop so Netanyahu can “get on with the business of healing the nation” and lead Israel through its current crisis.</p><p data-start=\"3349\" data-end=\"4224\">Between the two camps are the perennial “compromisers”, those who say at every juncture that truth can only be found in the middle. These people, the notorious Israeli centrists, are calling for a plea bargain or some other grand deal. Most want a political deal that would entail Netanyahu’s departure from politics in return for avoiding conviction. Others don’t care for a solution as much as for the general framing of the issue, calling for a “moderate” approach that would refrain from accusing Netanyahu of corruption but focus instead on his responsibility for the events of October 7, 2023, particularly the dysfunctional behaviour of the Israeli military and other governmental authorities. In all cases, the desirable narrative is one of unity, and unity can only be reached if both “sides” agree to end up with less than 100 percent of what they initially wanted.</p><p data-start=\"4226\" data-end=\"4925\">The common denominator between these seemingly contrasting approaches is that they are all focused completely on Netanyahu. Take the centrists, for example. Netanyahu issued an unprecedented letter, one essentially calling for a suspension of institutional norms and state law in his favour. The justification was abstract at best — an “interest”, “stupendous developments”, national unity — and a cynical manipulation at worst. One might suppose that Netanyahu’s request would be soundly rejected by sworn advocates of “moderation”. And yet, the minute Netanyahu made the letter public, these centrists immediately accepted it as legitimate and sought to situate their compromise in relation to it.</p><p data-start=\"4927\" data-end=\"6029\">The same goes for the liberals. The US’s Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner spoke at the biggest demonstration held before the ceasefire went into effect, addressing a crowd of 100,000 people. These protesters saw themselves as vehement opponents of Netanyahu and crystallised their differences with him into one issue — his failure (and lack of desire) to return the hostages. When Kushner mentioned Netanyahu, the crowd booed. For three days — much longer than the Israeli attention span for, say, a documented execution of Palestinians — Israeli media was consumed with the question of the boos. Were they proper? Were they improper because he was PM? Did they prove that the protests against him were based on hatred for him (and, by proxy, for his supporters) alone? Was Netanyahu the epitome of evil who must be booed, decorum be damned? Palestinians were dying by the dozens and hundreds over those days. Israeli infrastructure continued to come undone, as did the Israeli economy. Netanyahu, the response to Netanyahu, the positioning vis-a-vis Netanyahu — this was all liberal Israelis wanted to discuss.</p><p data-start=\"6031\" data-end=\"7622\">For Netanyahu’s supporters, there is no one but him. He is “their” man, the one who represents them against the elites who feel the country is theirs by right. He alone, through his audacity and cunning, took the fight to Israel’s enemies and brought them to their knees. He is the one who broke the paradigm that put Israel at the mercy of the world. Israel now does as it wishes, and those desires are for Israel alone to articulate. He is one of a kind, and no rule or law should apply to him as he upholds his historic mission and saves the Jewish people. Even if he doesn’t do all of that, say his overt supporters (thus echoing the thoughts of his covert ones), why vote for anyone else? In substance, however, they differ from him hardly at all. No Jewish “opposition” leader has ever articulated a vision that differs from what Netanyahu has already accomplished. They all support Israel’s right to “destroy” Hamas and to attack any other “enemy” at Israel’s complete discretion. They all bar Palestinian Israeli parliamentarians from their “coordination” meetings and talk about a “Zionist” government (read “fully Jewish”) that will replace Netanyahu. They may blame Netanyahu for Israel’s deteriorating international stature, but none of them accepts Israel’s responsibility for the destruction of Gaza, let alone the genocide. The two “opposition” leaders who served as PMs did so for less than 18 months combined. Netanyahu has been PM for nearly two decades. Granted, he’s a bit of a cad and perhaps slightly mad. He still knows his business better than any self-styled heirs.</p><p data-start=\"7624\" data-end=\"8011\">The conclusion is simple. Netanyahu isn’t just the most effective politician in Israel. He is the only politician in Israel. If an election is called in the coming months and he has not been indicted, expect him to emerge as the leader of the largest party and as PM. Originally, “there is none like Him” refers to God. For Israelis of all political persuasions, there is only Netanyahu.</p><p data-start=\"7624\" data-end=\"8011\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

However, this would require unanimous agreement from the bloc, giving Hungary <a href=\"/news/2023/12/15/hungary-blocks-54bn-eu-financial-aid-for-ukraine\">another opportunity to veto Ukraine aid</a>.</p><p>Hungary has repeatedly vetoed EU assistance to Ukraine because Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government argues that arming Kyiv will prolong the war and increase the EU’s collective debt. Orban has also maintained unusually warm ties with Vladimir Putin compared to other EU leaders.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-belgium-object-to-this-plan\">Why does Belgium object to this plan?</h2><p data-start=\"3308\" data-end=\"3884\">Belgium worries that Euroclear – the Brussels-based financial clearing house that holds the bulk of the frozen Russian assets – could end up entangled in damaging litigation if Russia challenges the EU decision, or if the action harms Euroclear’s reputation and business model.</p><p data-start=\"3308\" data-end=\"3884\">In theory, Russia could challenge the asset-freeze decision in a court in Belgium, where Euroclear is incorporated.</p><p>Addressing an audience at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said: “We are not seeking to antagonise our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return.”</p><p>Prevot said Belgium views “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky” and “has never been done before”. Instead, he wants the EU to pursue ordinary market borrowing to fund a loan to Ukraine. “It is a well-known, a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters,” he said.</p><p>He is strongly supported by Belgian officials who have doubled down on their opposition to the reparations loan in recent weeks, especially after a 28-point plan<a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\"> for a peace deal</a> by the administration of US President Donald Trump was made public, and included plans to use the frozen assets.</p><p>To address Belgium’s concerns, the European Commission’s blueprint does include measures to shield EU governments from “possible retaliation from Russia”, and to establish an EU-level borrowing mechanism to “underpin a loan to Ukraine”. However, Prevot emphasised that “the reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks”, and argued that the commission’s safeguards do not go far enough, leaving Belgium exposed.</p><p>“It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-is-at-stake\">How much money is at stake?</h2><p>Some 290 billion euros ($337bn) of Russia’s sovereign wealth – principally in the form of foreign-exchange reserves held as cash and bonds – was frozen by Western powers following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.</p><p>A large portion of those assets is held in Belgium, where roughly 194 billion euros ($225bn) was held as of June this year. Euroclear alone holds about 183 billion euros ($212bn) of these assets. Smaller amounts of assets are also held in the US, United Kingdom, and Japan.</p><p>Under a plan agreed by <a href=\"/news/2024/6/14/g7-to-use-russian-assets-for-50bn-ukraine-loan-how-will-it-work\">Group of Seven (G7)</a> countries in 2024, Ukraine would be provided with loans to be repaid using the interest earned on Russia’s foreign frozen assets, effectively leaving the assets untouched but allowing Kyiv to benefit from the income they generate.</p><p>Yesterday’s announcement goes one step further by collateralising the frozen funds.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-belgium-s-eu-partners-say\">What do Belgium’s EU partners say?</h2><p data-start=\"3963\" data-end=\"4212\">On Wednesday, von der Leyen said she was considering Belgium’s objections. “We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns, and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal. We will share the burden in a fair way, as it is the European way,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"4491\" data-end=\"5203\">Other European officials echoed this. Johann Wadephul, Germany’s minister of foreign affairs, said: “We take Belgium’s concerns seriously. They are justified, but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”</p><p>Elsewhere, David van Weel, the Netherlands’ minister of foreign affairs, highlighted the stakes of Belgium’s recalcitrance. “These funds are really, really important. We need to support the Ukrainian economy; otherwise, they will have a very tough time next year.”</p><p>Van Weel emphasised that EU member states have listened to Belgium. “We understand the Belgian concerns, and we are willing to at least make sure that they are not alone in this,” he said.</p><p>Other EU countries have already signalled readiness to backstop potential losses for Belgium.</p><p data-start=\"5205\" data-end=\"5393\">Belgium, meanwhile, has been collecting tax revenue from the immobilised Russian funds, and interest from the assets is already being directed into a G7-organised loan package for Ukraine.</p><p data-start=\"5395\" data-end=\"5513\">Looking ahead, European leaders are set to revisit the issue as well as Ukraine’s broader financing requirements at their Brussels summit on December 18.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Participants in the Signal chat group included Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p>Hegseth used Signal to share highly sensitive information with unauthorised persons, the report found, and failed to preserve those communications as required by US law.</p><p>It also found that he shared information about a Yemen operation in a separate Signal group chat which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer – all unauthorised people, CNN revealed.</p><p>However, the inspector general’s findings also stated that, as Hegseth has the authority to declassify sensitive information, the consequences of his actions are less clear.</p><p>Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host who had no prior government experience before his appointment, has <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/pete-hegseth-says-signal-chat-had-no-war-plans-hes-wrong-say-experts\">maintained</a> that he declassified the information before sharing it on the Signal chat and thus did nothing wrong, although he has not presented documentation to back that claim.</p><p>Stebbins began his investigation on April 3, following an outcry from both Democrat and Republican lawmakers who pointed out that the Signal chat could have put US personnel in danger if it had fallen into the wrong hands. The inspector general, who was appointed by Trump in January, revealed in a memo at the time that he had been prompted by the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee to begin a probe.</p><p>“The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD [Department of Defense] personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” Stebbins wrote in a short <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/03/2003681607/-1/-1/1/EVALUATION%20OF%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE'S%20REPORTED%20USE%20OF%20A%20COMMERCIALLY%20AVAILABLE%20MESSAGE%20APPLICATION%20FOR%20OFFICER%20BUSINESS%20(PROJECT%20NO.%20D2025-DEV0PC-0095.000).PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a> published on April 3, adding that compliance with classification and records retention would also be reviewed.</p><h2 id=\"did-hegseth-declassify-the-information-before-he-divulged-it-on-signal\">Did Hegseth declassify the information before he divulged it on Signal?</h2><p>Stebbins’s report detailed how Hegseth’s staff set up Signal so that the defence secretary could use it from his office at the Pentagon, where personal devices are not allowed and where he could not have physically accessed his phone.</p><p>While the inspector general’s report states that Hegseth has the authority to determine the classification level of military intelligence – and could have declassified the information if he wanted to – it does not conclusively determine whether the material he transmitted over Signal had been declassified.</p><p>According to a report by CNN, the information shared by Hegseth on the Signal chat was taken from a classified US Central Command document marked “Secret/NOFORN”, meaning no foreign nationals were permitted to view it.</p><p>Stebbins’s report referenced a broader review of how federal officials use Signal and recommended more training for Pentagon officials to ensure compliance.</p><p>Hegseth refused to be interviewed by the inspector general and instead submitted his arguments in writing, The Associated Press reported. Investigators relied on screenshots shared by the journalist who broke the story in March because Hegseth failed to provide all of his Signal messages.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-hegseth-responded-to-the-report\">How has Hegseth responded to the report?</h2><p>In a post on X on Tuesday, Hegseth claimed the inspector general report revealed “no classified information” was shared and that it represented “total exoneration” for him.</p><p></p><p>That post followed one by his office’s spokesperson Sean Parnell, who wrote: “This Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared.”</p><p>“This matter is resolved and the case is closed,” he continued.</p><p>Parnell also responded to A New York Times post which raised the potential dangers of Hegseth’s actions as highlighted in the report, saying: “There is zero evidence that supports this conclusion. None.”</p><p>He added that the “flawless execution &amp; success of Operation Rough Rider” – the name of the Yemen bombing campaign discussed on Signal – was evidence that no troops had been placed at risk.</p><p>Parnell and Hegseth’s stances align with those of the Trump administration since the scandal first broke in March. President Trump’s office did not publicly admonish Hegseth, and Trump himself called the scandal <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/trump-calls-signal-chat-fallout-a-witch-hunt-amid-calls-for-probe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a “witch-hunt”</a>. Trump also attempted to blame the messaging app by questioning whether Signal itself was “defective”.</p><p>Some Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees, however, said that Hegseth’s actions would be a fireable offence for any other official.</p><p>“This was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head,” Senator Mark Warner said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-said-in-the-signal-chat\">What was said in the Signal chat?</h2><p>The “<a href=\"/news/2025/3/25/yemen-war-plans-what-did-trump-aides-leak-to-the-atlantic-in-signal-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signalgate”</a> scandal, as it has been referred to in US media, dates back to March.</p><p>Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran journalist and editor-in-chief of the Washington, DC-based The Atlantic magazine, revealed in an article on March 24 that Trump administration officials accidentally added him to a Signal chat in which they disclosed specific details about a March 15 air strike on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, hours before the attack happened.</p><p>Goldberg said he had earlier received a connection request on March 11 from someone named Michael Waltz on the encrypted messaging service, likely to be then-US national security adviser Mike Waltz. Thinking it was probably a scam, Goldberg nevertheless accepted the invitation to join the group, which had been named “Houthi PC small group”, only to find that top officials were also on it, including Hegseth, Vance, Rubio, and Gabbard. There were 18 participants in the group.</p><p>The chat revealed precise timings of when US F-18 planes and drones would be launched. One update on the timing of the strikes read: “This is DEFINITELY when the first bombs will drop.”</p><p>The strikes killed at least 53 people, including children.</p><p>Goldberg said he left the group after discovering that the messages matched the timing of the air strikes.</p><p>His article about the affair soon after drew immediate uproar from both Democrats and Republicans, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer calling it one of the “most stunning breaches of military intelligence” in recent US history. Democrats and a small group of Republicans demanded an investigation, and the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee at the time, the late Gerald Connolly, asked Stebbins to launch a probe.</p><p>Critics pointed out that foreign intelligence operatives could have intercepted the Signal messages and that Signal’s auto-delete function violated government transparency requirements that require documentation to be kept, albeit securely.</p><p>In a follow-up article on March 26, The Atlantic revealed more screenshots of the chat.</p><p>But Hegseth denied that he had shared “war plans” on the messaging app and said he was permitted to declassify information and that he only communicated details he believed would not endanger the mission. He told Fox News in April that the messages were “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4073829\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4073829\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4073829\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251028__82AU2VE__v1__HighRes__UsMilitaryStrikesPacificDrugs-1761910899.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C435&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"boast strikes\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4073829\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This screen grab from a video posted by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on his X account on October 28, 2025, shows what he says is one of four alleged drug-smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean that was destroyed in strikes, bringing the death toll from Washington’s anti-narcotics campaign to at least 57 [Handout/US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s X Account/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-other-scandals-has-hegseth-been-involved-in\">What other scandals has Hegseth been involved in?</h2><p>Hegseth is <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/hegseth-or-admiral-bradley-who-approved-the-second-venezuela-boat-strike\">separately being investigated</a> over a verbal order he is alleged to have given regarding a September 2 strike on a boat presumed to be carrying drugs in Caribbean waters.</p><p>Sources involved said Hegseth gave the order to “kill everybody” in the mission, according to details first published on November 28 by The Washington Post, quoting two people who had direct knowledge of the operation.</p><p>A commander in charge of the operation then ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">second strike</a>, which killed two people struggling in the water who had survived a first attack on the 11 people in the boat.</p><p>The boat was the first to be hit in Trump’s deadly campaign against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which Democrat lawmakers have criticised for its human rights implications. The Trump administration has justified the strikes as a necessary step to curb drug inflows to the country, which it says threatens national security.</p><p>At least 80 people have been killed in the strikes on Venezuelan boats that the US says – without evidence – are trafficking drugs. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called the strikes “unacceptable” in October and said they represented “extrajudicial killing”,  which is in violation of international human rights law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The family of a Colombian man, Alejandro Carranza, killed in a strike on September 15, also filed a legal case on Tuesday, arguing that he was a fisherman and that the hit was an extrajudicial killing. That case has been filed at the regional Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is based in Washington, DC. However, the US does not recognise its jurisdiction.</p><p>In a post on his Truth Social media platform, Trump stated at the time that the September 2 strike had killed 11 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, designated by the US as a terrorist group, and claimed that the boat was headed to the US.</p><p>However, Rubio, on the same day, said in a<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-remarks-to-press\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> news briefing</a>, it was “probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean” before changing his stance the following day and saying it was “headed towards, eventually” the US.</p><p>US media reported that four missiles had been used and that Hegseth watched the strikes in real time. The Associated Press reported that the Pentagon knew there were survivors in the water, quoting people familiar with the operation who said the argument was that the boat needed to be sunk.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-republicans-responded-to-these-allegations\">How have Republicans responded to these allegations?</h2><p>Hegseth condemned The Washington Post’s reporting last week, saying it was “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”. At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the White House, he said the second strike happened in the “fog of war” and that he did not see any survivors. He added that he “didn’t stick around” for the rest of the mission.</p><p>Both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee have opened investigations into the legality of the attack. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” Democrat Senator Tim Kaine told reporters last week.</p><p>Responding to reporters’ questions on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump appeared to distance himself from the affair. “I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike,” he said, adding that his administration would look into the reports. He also stated that Hegseth had told him he “did not order the death of those two men”.</p><p>Questions regarding what role Hegseth in fact played in the attack will be asked during a classified congressional briefing on Thursday with the commander the Trump administration says headed the operation, Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley.</p><p>Before Hegseth’s appointment in January, the military veteran and former Fox News host faced allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use and financial mismanagement.</p><p>In 2017, he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who said he took her cellphone and blocked the door of a hotel room to prevent her from leaving, according to a police report. Hegseth denied the accusation, although his lawyer acknowledged that the woman was paid a settlement.</p><p>A December 2024 report by The New Yorker revealed claims that Hegseth, as leader of the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America between 2013 and 2016, frequently became so intoxicated at work events that he relied on colleagues to get home. He was also accused of using official funds for the nonprofit as a “personal expense account”. Hegseth has denied these claims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They believe Putin has no real interest in peace, given the continuous bombing of Ukrainian cities.</p><p>“These negotiations did not end in success, as was expected, because they’re based on fundamentally different ideas about what is happening between the Americans and the Kremlin,” Ilya Budraitskis, a Russian political scientist and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The offer of peace resting on the exchange of territories, which the Americans tried to sell as the key idea of this plan, does not really interest Putin. He is interested in changing the entire security structure in Eastern Europe.”</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-an-unreliable-counterpart-russian-analyst\">Ukraine an ‘unreliable counterpart’: Russian analyst</h2><p>But some in Russia back the Kremlin’s viewpoint, and use similar words while doing so.</p><p>“The Kyiv regime’s sabotage of progress toward a peaceful settlement, distortion of facts, and attempts to delay the inevitable have significantly complicated the negotiation process,” said Spartak Baranovsky, a political scientist and member of the Moscow-based Digoria Expert Club, a think tank whose views broadly align with those of the Russian government.</p><p>“The Ukrainian side refused to implement the Minsk agreements and then rejected the initial parameters of the peace agreement negotiated in Istanbul. It is truly difficult to establish a constructive dialogue with such an unreliable counterpart,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The Minsk agreements were a series of treaties signed in 2014 and 2015 to end the war in Donbas, where Russian-backed separatists were fighting the Kyiv government. After the full-scale invasion of 2022, several meetings between Russian and Ukrainian delegates have taken place in Belarus and Turkiye, all of which failed to secure peace.</p><p>While the full details of this week’s meeting have not been revealed, there is a little optimism in Russia that the end of the war is in sight.</p><p>Tatyana, a Saint Petersburg businesswoman in her 60s who declined to give her full name to avoid backlash, blames Russia for the war but believes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s European allies have pushed him into prolonging the fighting.</p><p>“My God, what has the world come to when the only person who seems to be acting rationally in this situation is Trump, who is absolutely insane by his very nature?” she asked.</p><p>“Now the situation is much worse for everyone. A decision still needs to be made, but on the battlefield, the advantage is clearly on Russia’s side, which the crude American generals understand as well as anyone else.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Russian troops had finally taken the strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, ending a two-year siege. While Ukraine denied the city had fallen, its forces have struggled in recent months to halt Russia’s advance in several regions.</p><p>Among the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">proposed terms</a> of an agreement being floated are that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the parts of the Donbas region as yet unoccupied by Russia, which will become a neutral demilitarised zone but internationally recognised as Russian territory. Meanwhile, the Crimean Peninsula as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, which have been under Russian or pro-Russian control since 2014, will be recognised as Russia as well. Ukraine’s armed forces are to be capped at 600,000 personnel, and Ukraine must abandon any aspirations of joining NATO, but its bid for EU membership will be considered.</p><p>In return, Russia must promise not to invade any more European countries, which must be enshrined in its law. There is also a proposed amnesty for war crimes.</p><p>Last week, Putin <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/putin-says-us-backed-peace-plan-as-framework-is-ok-in\">acknowledged</a> the plan “can be the basis for future agreements”, but added, “If Ukrainian troops leave the territories they occupy, then we will stop fighting. If they don’t, we will achieve our aims militarily.”</p><p>Over the weekend, Ukrainian negotiators reiterated to their US counterparts that giving up any territory was not on the table, sources told RBC-Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"can-russia-fight-on-for-years\">Can Russia fight on for years?</h2><p>“Putin perfectly understands that Ukraine is running out of time,” Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, based in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Therefore, Putin is very confident in everything. He has time. He can fight for a year or two. The problem is rather with the West [and its will to fight]. Therefore, yes, he is ready to delay, not until Ukraine is tired and gives up, [but] until his conditions are met.”</p><p>Before Tuesday’s meeting, Putin upped the ante with a threat to Europe.</p><p>He warned that while Russia is not planning a war with Europe, “if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now”.</p><p>Budraitskis at the University of California, Berkeley said, “[Putin] will be preparing for this, just like before 2022, when he said that Russia was not going to attack Ukraine, implying the opposite”.</p><p>Despite their different outlooks, Inozemtsev and Baranovsky agree that Russia is capable of sustaining its war effort indefinitely.</p><p>“To keep fighting for years, at such an intensity, is not a problem at all,” said Inozemtsev.</p><p>“There were more problems at the beginning of the war than now, because we saw at the beginning of the war they needed mobilisation; now they pay them a fairly high salary and [new volunteers] are constantly enlisting. Additionally, they had problems with weapons, and especially active commentators wrote they will run out of shells in three months. In fact, munitions are being produced now more actively than before the war.”</p><p>Inozemtsev believes that now, “the Americans are very determined to either end this war or completely withdraw from any support for Ukraine.”</p><p>“I think that this has now been clearly conveyed to Kyiv,” he said. “And therefore, the Ukrainians will be in some way persuaded … the Ukrainians understand that the Europeans will not save them. In the sense that if now the Americans completely get out of this process, then, of course, Europe will have neither money, nor the determination to constantly support this cause for years.”</p><p>A deal could still be in Ukraine’s interest, Inozemtsev noted.</p><p>“If they are able to guarantee themselves 600,000 for the army and a break for at least a few years, then, in fact, this is the solution to the problem,” he said.</p><p>“Putin will always be a threat [and so] the main task of the West is to outlive [73-year-old] Putin. If there’s a break in the fighting for three to five years, then this is already nearing the end of his life, which naturally makes him less decisive.”</p><p>Any potential peace deal and the lifting of sanctions will be beneficial to the Russian economy, but Inozemtsev and Budraitskis doubt that life will return to how it was before 2022. Society will remain heavily militarised and tightly-controlled, they predicted.</p><p>“There can be no peace, no return to a normal situation in which all these measures that correspond to a full-fledged repressive totalitarian dictatorship will be abolished, because we no longer have any direct external threat,” Budraitskis said.</p><p>“This is the design of Putin’s regime in Russia, how his power is arranged, that there is an endless war, where Russian elites are consolidated under the flag, there is repression against any dissenters inside the country… These are not some kind of extraordinary measures temporarily introduced only in wartime, but this is how he will continue to rule.”</p><p>He added that “war in any form” against Ukraine, Europe, the Baltic states or “anyone” is an integral motif of the “normality that Putin established” in Russia after 2022.</p><p>“Therefore, there will be a continuation of the war on different fronts in order for this regime to remain,” he predicted.</p><p>Some Russians have settled for the long haul already.</p><p>“Until America withdraws its occupation troops from the EU, the war will not end,” said Sergey Kalenik, a media consultant from Moscow.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that international leaders had called on him to intervene and leverage his influence to stop the violence.</p><p>The civil war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, as the government-controlled Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) clashed with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for control of areas including the capital Khartoum.</p><p>Peace negotiations have been complicated by recent RSF advances.</p><p>Earlier this week, the RSF claimed to have seized control of Babnusa, a key city in the vast central Sudanese region of West Kordofan. The SAF has disputed this claim.</p><p>Babnusa serves as a gateway to the western Darfur region, over which the RSF <a href=\"/video/project-force-2/2025/11/6/reports-of-atrocities-as-rsf-captures-darfur\">took full control</a> last month, and the whole of western Sudan.</p><p>The RSF’s assault on Babnusa builds on the paramilitary group’s momentum after it captured the city of el-Fasher, the army’s final holdout in Darfur, following an 18-month siege.

It also said that the UAE’s involvement in the Quad is biased and that the proposal aimed to eliminate the army.</p><p>The UAE has been widely accused of supporting the RSF with money and weapons, but it has staunchly rejected any involvement.</p><p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said on Thursday that he feared new atrocities amid the intense fighting between the SAF and RSF.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Council has already mandated one inquiry into alleged atrocities – including systematic mass murder, rape, torture, and forced displacement of non-Arab ethnic groups – after the RSF seized el-Fasher.</p><p>Sudan’s war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups said that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher.</p><p>The UN said the war has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis as millions of people have been forced to flee their homes and parts of the country have been pushed into famine.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"61\" data-end=\"319\">Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Asmaa Mohammed, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.net/video/2025/12/4/%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%86-4\">reporting</a> from the al-Afad refugee camp in Sudan’s Northern State, said families displaced from Darfur and Kordofan — the sites of intense fighting in recent weeks — were in a “dire humanitarian condition.”</p><p data-start=\"321\" data-end=\"455\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">She added that there were also shortages of emergency services, medicine, and specialised medical personnel, including paediatricians.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Soon, American traders had also turned to opium to boost their own exports to China.</p><p>In 1839, Chinese forces attempted to crack down on the inflow of opium, confiscating and destroying it and marking the beginning of the First Opium War. The British and Chinese engaged in naval conflict and the British emerged victorious in 1842. While the US did not militarily engage in the war, American traders were active in China and brought limited amounts of opium from Turkiye and India.</p><p>In 1844, the US and China signed the Treaty of Wanghia, their first treaty together. While this treaty ostensibly outlawed the opium trade, in practice, it opened up five ports for Western-Chinese trade in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai, enabling US traders to expand their sales of opium.</p><p>The Second Opium War took place 20 years later, from 1856 to 1860. French and British forces fought with diplomatic assistance from Russia and protection from American forces. Under pressure, China was forced to sign a treaty legalising opium, one of Britain’s main demands.</p><h3 id=\"1960s-1970s-in-laos-during-the-vietnam-war\">1960s-1970s: In Laos during the Vietnam War</h3><p>Between 1955 and 1975, the US was engaged in armed conflict in Vietnam and parts of neighbouring Laos and Cambodia in a war between the communist North Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South Vietnam, backed by the US.</p><p>During this time, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ran covert operations in Laos, which is northwest of Vietnam, to counter communist forces in Southeast Asia.</p><p>In Laos, CIA officers trained militias from Indigenous tribes such as the Hmong people in the mountainous north, according to a 2003 <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Recollections-Case-Officer-Laos.pdf\">document</a> published by the CIA, to fight against North Vietnamese forces in Laos, as well as against Laotian communists, the Pathet Lao.</p><p>At the time, the Hmong were heavily economically reliant on the cultivation of opium poppies as a cash crop.</p><p>According to historian Alfred W McCoy, who wrote the 1972 book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, the CIA covertly operated an airline called Air America to transport opium from remote mountain areas to be sold in Southeast Asia and international markets, including the US. The proceeds were used to support the militias.</p><p>McCoy presented the findings of his book during a 1972 congressional testimony before a Senate subcommittee. The CIA has never formally admitted direct involvement in the drug operation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149731\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149731\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1354471168-1764839397.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Laotian Civil War (1953Ð75) was fought between the Communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government in which both the political rightists and leftists received heavy external support for a proxy war from the global Cold War superpowers. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Hmong militia during the US’s ‘Secret War’ in Laos, in 1961 [File: History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1980s-during-the-soviet-afghan-war\">1980s: During the Soviet-Afghan War</h2><p>The Soviet army invaded <a href=\"/topics/country/afghanistan.html\">Afghanistan</a> in 1979 to support a communist government that was facing internal threats. Between 1979 and 1989, the Soviet Union fought Afghan rebel fighters, the mujahideen.</p><p>Poppy cultivation thrived in mujahideen‑held provinces such as Helmand in southern Afghanistan and Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan. Historians, including McCoy, allege that CIA-backed mujahideen fighters financed much of their war efforts through opium cultivation and trafficking. Trafficking routes went through Pakistan and Iran, feeding both European and Middle Eastern markets.</p><p>The Soviet-Afghan War resulted in one of the sharpest spikes in global heroin supply in the late 1980s. A UNODC report in 2001 found that in 1999, Afghanistan was producing 79 percent of global illegal opium.</p><p>A CIA report from 1986 also alleges that there was widespread use of drugs among Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and that those soldiers smuggled drugs back to the Soviet Union.</p><p>The CIA has never publicly admitted to backing opium cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149766\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149766\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149766\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-612550268-1764839982.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Afghan Mujahideen fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s.

In 1985, then-US President Ronald Reagan heaped praise on the Contras, calling them “the moral equivalent of our founding fathers”.</p><p>However, this all took place against the backdrop of another war overseas that the US took an interest in.</p><p>From 1980 to 1988, Iran and Iraq fought a war, which began with Iraq’s invasion of Iran. In 1985, Iran secretly requested to buy weapons from the US. At this time, an arms embargo prevented the US from openly selling weapons to Iran.</p><p>The Reagan administration nevertheless sold Iran the weapons so that the US could strengthen its position in the Middle East and secure the release of American hostages, mostly diplomats and missionaries, who were being held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>While Reagan had initially publicly denied selling weapons to Iran, he later admitted that the weapons had been sold to secure the hostages’ release.</p><p>Around the same time, the US Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted US involvement in foreign countries and banned US funding for the Contras. To get around this, members of the National Security Council diverted profits from the Iran arms sales to fund the Contras without congressional approval.</p><p>In his 1998 book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion, US investigative journalist Gary Webb traced links between Contra supporters and the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles.</p><p>Webb wrote that a group affiliated with the Contras smuggled cocaine into the US, which was then sold as crack cocaine in Los Angeles – ultimately triggering the epidemic. The funds generated were then used to support the Contras. Webb claimed that the CIA knew about these transactions and backed them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149777\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149777\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-882017752-1764840815.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of Boston Feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boston feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest against the war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986 [Tom Landers/The Boston Globe via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-1980s-during-the-manuel-noriega-era\">1970s-1980s: During the Manuel Noriega era</h2><p>Manuel Noriega was a military dictator who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989.</p><p>Noriega had been a CIA informant and asset since the 1960s.
