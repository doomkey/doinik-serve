Banks locked their doors and prevented depositors from accessing their money.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Some depositors were forced to hold up bank branches to get their own money.</p><p>By the time the currency had been regulated, the Lebanese Lira had lost 98 percent of its value.</p><p>To fix the situation, Lebanon’s cabinet is passing a so-called “gap law” that’s expected to be signed by the prime minister and president before heading to parliament for debate.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the so-called “gap law”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-good-about-the-law\">What’s good about the law?</h2><p>Depositors will be getting some of their money back.</p><p>Under the law, anyone who deposited up to $100,000 will be reimbursed within four years. This is an improvement on past proposals, where the same amount would be repaid over more than a decade.</p><p>However, observers noted that plans proposed in 2020, under the government of former Prime Minister Hassan Diab, had depositors receiving up to $500,000 back.</p><p>“This was probably the biggest lost opportunity, and it was done to protect the banks,” Fouad Debs, a lawyer and member of the Depositors Union, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is also supposed to be a full financial audit, according to Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.</p><p>“A forensic audit … means [the banks] will open all their operations – their dividends and the bonuses they paid executives – basically all the financial engineering they’ve done,” Debs said.</p><p>He added that an audit is important because “there are a lot of discrepancies between what they say and what the state is saying.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-bad-about-it\">What’s bad about it?</h2><p>Plenty.</p><p>First off, the $100,000 figure is per depositor and not per account. So if someone had two accounts with a figure more than $100,000, they would still only get $100,000 back.</p><p>For depositors who have more than $100,000 in their account or accounts, they will be given $100,000 in cash, and the rest will be paid in bonds backed by the Central Bank, according to PM Salam.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-the-draft-law-good-for-who-does-it-penalise\">Who is the draft law good for? Who does it penalise?</h2><p>The bankers, the banks, and politicians aligned with them get off fairly easily under the current draft law, while the state will bear most of the burden for the financial collapse.</p><p>Under the current version of the draft law, banks are responsible for paying only 40 percent of withdrawals, despite their major roles in engineering the financial crisis.</p><p>But banks, bankers, and affiliated politicians are still waging media campaigns and lobbying parliament to attack the law and make it even more favourable for them.</p><p>Under the new draft law, banks are being asked to pay much more than they are currently paying – but still significantly less than critics say they should be paying.</p><p>There is a lack of clarity over the claims.</p><p>During the crisis, banks were still able to pay out dividends to shareholders and pay executives bonuses, while regular depositors were blocked from accessing their money for daily expenses like buying food or paying bills.</p><p>“Depositors should be last on the list to have to pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-would-the-state-have-to-pay\">How much would the state have to pay?</h2><p>The state would have to make up the “gap” between what is owed by Lebanese banks to depositors and what the Lebanese financial system can pay out.</p><p>Estimates currently say there is a gap of $70bn.</p><h2 id=\"who-do-the-bankers-say-should-pay-all-this\">Who do the bankers say should pay all this?</h2><p>They say the state should pay. Many bankers and banks say that they entrusted their money to the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) and that BDL gave the money to the state, which lost it. Therefore, the state should pay.</p><p>But critics argue that many of the banks gave depositors’ money to BDL without asking the depositors.</p><p>“They put it there because banks made so much money and benefitted from it a lot,” Debs said. “They put all their eggs in the same basket … and the banks knew this very well.”</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-state-pay\">How would the state pay?</h2><p>With public funds, essentially. After the cash is given to depositors, everything else will be paid back in bonds backed by the state and its assets, including Lebanon’s gold reserves.</p><p>Critics say this is problematic because many of Lebanon’s current bonds were sold to vulture funds abroad. So state assets could essentially be used to pay back vulture funds or to pay back big depositors at the expense of the entire Lebanese population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-imf-saying\">What is the IMF saying?</h2><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is usually calling for austerity, but for once, civil society and the IMF are on the same page.</p><p>“The IMF is saying… ‘how can you make depositors pay before bankers?’” Debs said, adding that the IMF’s position shows “how greedy and vicious the ruling elites are here”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The intensity of the current backlash against Alaa Abdelfattah in Britain is striking – not because it reflects a renewed concern for justice, but because it exposes how selectively outrage is deployed.</p><p>Alaa, an Egyptian-British writer and activist, spent more than a decade in and out of Egyptian prisons following the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. His detention was marked by prolonged hunger strikes, denial of basic rights and treatment that human rights organisations described as cruel and degrading. He was <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/egyptian-british-activist-alaa-abd-el-fattah-freed-after-sisi-pardon\">released</a> on September 23 after a years-long campaign by his mother, sister and close friends. A travel ban on him was lifted only this month, and he was able to join his family in the UK on December 26.</p><p>Alaa left behind a decade of repression in Cairo only to be welcomed in London with public attacks and a call for the revocation of his British citizenship and his deportation. Public hostility was whipped up by the uncovering of a social media post from 2010 in which Alaa said he considered “killing any colonialists … heroic”, including Zionists.</p><p>The tweet has been widely condemned, referred to the counter-terrorism police for review, and seized upon by politicians calling for punitive measures.</p><p>The speed and intensity of this reaction stand in stark contrast to the silence surrounding far more consequential statements and actions that the UK not only tolerates but actively enables.</p><p>This is what selective outrage looks like.</p><p>While Alaa’s words are dissected and framed as a moral emergency, the UK continues to host and collaborate with senior Israeli officials who have been accused of participating in and inciting genocide.</p><p>In July, for example, Israel’s air force chief Tomer Bar – the man who has overseen the carpet bombing of Gaza, destruction of hospitals, schools and homes and the extermination of entire families – was granted special legal immunity to visit the UK. Reporting by Declassified UK <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/israeli-air-force-chief-given-special-immunity-to-visit-britain/\">showed</a> that this immunity shielded him from arrest for war crimes while on British soil.</p><p>There has been no comparable outcry over this.</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog was also able to pay a visit to the UK in September and hold high-level meetings. This is the same man who, at the start of the genocide, suggested that the “entire [Palestinian] nation” is responsible and that “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved – it’s not true.” This and other statements by Herzog <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/14/intent-in-the-genocide-case-against-israel-is-not-hard-to-prove\">have been collected</a> in a large database that currently supports the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p><p>Yet, despite being accused of incitement to genocide, the Israeli president entered the UK without a problem and was welcomed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Those quarters concerned about Alaa’s tweet displayed no outrage over the visit of a potential war criminal.</p><p>They have also been silent about British citizens who have travelled to serve in the Israeli military, including during Israel’s offensives in Gaza and the ongoing genocide. These operations, documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths, the destruction of hospitals and universities, and the devastation of entire neighbourhoods.</p><p>Despite extensive documentation of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the ICJ’s warning of a serious risk of genocide, there has been no systematic investigation into whether British nationals may have been involved in violations of international law.</p><p>Again, there is little sustained outrage.</p><p>At the same time, the UK continues to license arms exports to Israel and to engage in political, military and intelligence cooperation. These policies have persisted even as international bodies have warned of grave humanitarian consequences and potential violations of international law. All of this unfolds with relatively little political cost.</p><p>And yet it is a decade-old tweet – not mass killing, not siege, not the destruction of civilian life on a vast scale, not incitement to genocide – that triggers political panic in the UK.</p><p>This contrast is not incidental. It reveals a hierarchy of outrage in which dissenting voices are policed and punished, and state violence is not, and in which public hostility is directed downward at individuals rather than upward at power. Alaa’s case shows how moral language is deployed selectively – not to restrain impunity, but to manage discomfort.</p><p>This asymmetry corrodes the credibility of the principles the UK claims to uphold. When human rights are defended selectively, they become tools of convenience rather than universal norms. When outrage is loud but inconsistent, it becomes performative. And when accountability is withheld from powerful allies, impunity hardens into policy.</p><p>Those who defend this approach often invoke “quiet diplomacy”, arguing that restraint is more effective than confrontation. Yet there is little evidence that silence has delivered accountability – either for Alaa or for civilians subjected to mass violence in Gaza. In both cases, discretion has functioned less as a strategy than as permission.</p><p>The UK has the tools to act differently: Suspending arms exports, investigating potential crimes by its nationals, conditioning cooperation on respect for international law, restricting visits by officials implicated in serious abuses. That these tools remain largely unused is itself revealing.</p><p>Until that changes, outrage will remain selective, accountability conditional, and impunity intact – widening the gap between the values the UK professes and the violence it continues to enable.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It would also disrupt vital global shipping routes through the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Alexander Huang, director-general of Taiwan’s Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies, told Al Jazeera the drills were similar to those held after Pelosi’s visit in August 2022.</p><p>“For this drill, it actually interfered with international civil aviation routes and also maritime shipping routes. In previous drills, they tried to avoid that, but this time they actually disrupted the air and maritime traffic,” he said.</p><p>The drills also put pressure on Taiwan’s maritime and transport links to Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are closer to the Chinese mainland.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"why-did-china-stage-the-exercises-now\">Why did China stage the exercises now?</h2><p>China has a history of holding military exercises to express its anger with Taiwan and its allies, but large-scale exercises have become more frequent since Pelosi’s Taiwan visit.</p><p>Beijing claims Taiwan as a province and has accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs by continuing to sell weapons to Taipei and supporting its “separatist” government led by President William Lai Ching-te.</p><p>Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but it has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>The Justice Mission 2025 came just days after Washington approved a record-breaking $11.1bn arms sale to Taiwan.</p><p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that the drills were a “punitive and deterrent action against separatist forces who seek ‘Taiwan independence’ through military build-up, and a necessary move to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Beijing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/china-sanctions-30-us-firms-individuals-over-taiwan-weapons-sales\">sanctioned 30 US firms and individuals</a> over the arms sale.</p><p>Experts also say the exercises were linked to a separate but related diplomatic row between China and Japan.</p><p>Beijing was angered in November by remarks from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi that an attack on Taiwan would be a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan.

He wrote poetry when he was a teenager, studied literature at university in Kharkiv, and joined the local Zolochiv newspaper at age 20. At 31, he stepped away to work for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, where he investigated corruption in the district. Ten years later, he returned to the weekly.</p><p>“I can’t imagine doing anything other than journalism,” he says.</p><p>Vassyl is proud that his newspaper was among the first to be de-nationalised in 2017. He helped draft the legislation that allowed Ukrainian local newspapers to be privatised, a step he saw as essential to reducing state pressure and safeguarding editorial independence.</p><p>Throughout the war, he has continued to investigate local political corruption, though he acknowledges that much of his focus has shifted to the war.</p><p>“Russia feeds on our internal divisions. Even if holding our own authorities to account remains part of the job, currently, my priority is to counter the enemy’s lies,” he says.</p><p>The fight against Russian disinformation has put his life at risk more than once.</p><p>On April 5, 2022, at 9:30am, two Russian shells hit the weekly's newsroom, partially destroying the 140-year-old building that housed it. Vassyl would normally have been sitting at his desk at the time, but he was spared because he stayed in bed longer than usual that day.</p><p>“I was running late to work ... The night before, we partied with one of my friends and drank a lot of terrible vodka,” he says with a dark laugh. “It is a time of war. The quality of the alcohol is very bad, but this is all we had.</p><p>“That’s what saved me. I usually wake up early, but I was hungover.”</p><p>When he finally got moving and was walking with a friend, two shells passed overhead.</p><p>\"Half a second later, everything exploded.”</p><p>Luckily, nobody was in the newsroom at the time. Vassyl’s old desk is still covered in debris more than three years later, and he knows he had a lucky escape.</p><p>“Given the shrapnel marks in the room, I would have been dead,” he says.</p><p>His newsroom has been targeted 10 times — twice with artillery, eight times with guided aerial bombs — with the latest strike hitting in spring 2025.</p><p>At the beginning of the war, Kremlin news outlets claimed that Vassyl was responsible for spreading disinformation.</p><p>“Apparently, I run a propaganda outlet,” Vassyl says ironically. “In 2022, Russian state television aired a report accusing me of illegally entering one of their villages to spread false information.</p><p>“I have never been there. What I have done, since the start of the war, is document missile remnants embedded in the ground to show where they came from.”</p><p>Tracing the origins of missile remnants could expose Russian attacks as war crimes or violations of international law.</p><p>“This work is the reason why my newsroom has been targeted,” Vassyl says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154154\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154154\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6607-1765002367.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn Neoneta, the newspaper's accountant, delivers the weekly edition in Zolochiv, far from first-person view (FPV) drones near the Russian border [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Following the 2022 invasion and the bombing of its printing press in Kharkiv, the newspaper ceased publication for nearly half a year. Russian forces were closing in, prompting many from Zolochiv to flee to safer areas, at least temporarily. But Vassyl chose to remain.</p><p>“I had to stay and bear witness, but I couldn't do it if my loved ones were also in danger,” he says, explaining how he sent his family to western Ukraine and then began documenting the destruction engulfing his hometown.</p><p>At the time, enemy forces were less than 10km (6.2 miles) away. With his phone, he filmed bombings, civilian evacuations and shattered buildings.</p><p>“If I didn’t film what I was seeing with my own eyes, who would have done it? We live in very remote areas. I had to show the world what was happening to us.”</p><p>Vassyl taught himself how to edit videos, which he posted on YouTube and social media to reach more people.</p><p>“The Russians were claiming they were striking command posts or tank repair facilities,” he says, still outraged. “In reality, they were hitting residential buildings, the hospital and a kindergarten.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154149\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154149\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6557-1765002348.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn delivers the newspaper in Zolochiv [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>When the Ukrainian army began liberating the first villages near Zolochiv, Vassyl became determined to restore access to news in areas that had been deprived of it for six months. He found a new printing press and got to work.</p><p>“In these rural areas, there is often no alternative source for reliable information. People trust us, and we cannot walk away from that,” he says proudly.</p><p>Two members of the newsroom returned to work remotely, while Kostyantyn Neoneta, the newspaper’s accountant, remained in Zolochiv like Vassyl.</p><p>“I didn’t want to leave,” says Kostyantyn, who distributes the newspaper in the town every week by bicycle. “I knew I was far more useful here than in other cities.”</p><p>In those villages where Russian signals bleed into people’s homes, “people are left with propaganda,” Vassyl says, adding, “My mission is to make sure it does not happen.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Electricity networks, water systems, hospitals, roads and municipal services have been systematically destroyed or severely damaged, leaving daily life defined by survival.</p><p>It is not unusual for families to plan their days around the sound of generators, if fuel is available at all. Parents and children queue for hours for a few litres of unsafe water or a pack of bread.</p><p>Hospitals operate in near darkness, doctors performing life-saving procedures using mobile phones for light. Streets that once carried children to school are reduced to rubble.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"gaza-s-reality-is-always-harsh\">Gaza’s reality is always harsh</h2><p>Life in Gaza was never easy, even during the moments the outside world labelled as “normal”.</p><p>For most people, life was lived with constant uncertainty. You learned not to plan too far ahead, because calm was fragile, always temporary.</p><p>There were days with electricity, when the streets felt quieter, and families allowed themselves a small sense of relief, but everyone knew it could disappear at any time.</p><p>Gaza’s infrastructure mirrors that. It was fragile long before the latest devastation of Israel’s genocidal war.</p><p>Decades of illegal Israeli blockade, repeated military assaults and tight restrictions on construction materials meant systems were always patched up, always operating on borrowed time. Nothing truly recovered.</p><p>One of the most visible losses has been electricity. Across the Gaza Strip, darkness is not an exception. Our only power plant was severely damaged and shut down due to fuel shortages; close to 80 percent of power transmission has been destroyed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For families, this loss is felt in small, relentless ways. A mother charges her phone whenever a neighbour’s generator briefly hums to life, knowing it may be her only chance to contact family.</p><p>Children do their homework by candlelight, if they do it at all. Refrigerators sit useless, food spoiling.</p><p>Access to water has also deteriorated sharply. Israel’s bombardment damaged wells, desalination plants and pumping stations. Without electricity or fuel, clean water cannot be extracted or distributed.</p><p>Over the course of our reporting on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, we documented families lining up with plastic containers, waiting for water trucks that may or may not arrive.

Telecommunications infrastructure has been repeatedly knocked out, isolating families and cutting people off from emergency services and the outside world.</p><p>There’s a cumulative effect of Israel’s intense bombing campaign – which is being carried out deliberately to paralyse daily life – because infrastructure systems depend on one another.</p><p>Without electricity, water cannot be pumped. Without fuel, hospitals cannot function. Without roads, aid cannot reach those in need.</p><p>Each collapse accelerates the next while creating new layers of difficult living conditions.</p><p>As the year 2025 approaches its end, Gaza’s entire infrastructure no longer supports normal life; it barely sustains survival.</p><p>Talking about rebuilding does not simply mean reconstructing buildings, but also the restoration of systems that allow people to live with dignity: safe water, reliable electricity, functioning hospitals, and basic public services.</p><p>Until then, Gaza’s civilians continue to endure the consequences of another year that has shaken the foundations of daily life.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Every day without safe and unhindered access increases the risk of children growing weaker and more death and suffering from causes that are entirely preventable,” she said.</p><p>According to UNICEF, many people currently living in the Um Baru area recently arrived from el-Fasher following the escalation of fighting in the city in late October. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have fled the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/why-are-people-in-sudans-el-fasher-starving\">famine-stricken city</a> at the time.</p><p>Many of those who fled reported mass atrocities, including killings, sexual assault and detentions, by RSF troops.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"crime-scene\">‘Crime scene’</h2><p>On Friday, a UN humanitarian team was allowed access to the RSF-controlled city for the first time in two years.

There were very few people that [they] were able to see,” she said. Those who the UN staff did see were living in empty buildings or rudimentary camps using basic plastic sheets.</p><p>Brown said the UN remains “very concerned” about people who were injured and “those who may be detained”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the RSF.</p><p>The paramilitary force, which has consolidated its control of Darfur following el-Fasher’s fall, is now pushing east into the Kordofan region. Al Jazeera’s Hassan Razzaq, reporting from Sudan, said the RSF continues to maintain sieges on the cities of Kadugli and Dilling, in South Kordofan, further worsening the hunger crisis there.</p><p>Expanded military operations have also added to people fleeing parts of the country, particularly North Darfur and North Kordofan, leaving behind <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/starvation-ghost-towns-plague-sudan-as-al-burhan-demands-rsf-surrender\">“ghost towns”</a>, Razzaq added.</p><p>UN officials, too, say fighting has intensified amid the dry season.</p><p>“Each passing day brings staggering levels of violence and destruction,” UN Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari told the UN Security Council (UNSC) last week. “Civilians are enduring immense, unimaginable suffering, with no end in sight.”</p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/un-renews-sudan-ceasefire-appeal-over-unimaginable-suffering-of-civilians\">immediate ceasefire</a> in the brutal civil war, while Sudan’s Prime Minister Kamil Idris presented a peace plan to the UNSC that called for the RSF to disarm.</p><p>The plan was rejected by the RSF as “wishful thinking”.</p><p>General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese army, dismissed the possibility of a political solution that does not involve the disarmament of the RSF.</p><p>“We are not talking about a military solution … We said the military solution does not necessarily have to end with fighting; it can end with surrender,” al-Burhan told members of the Sudanese community in Turkiye. “The war will end after … arms are laid down,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

December 30:</p><h2 id=\"alleged-attack-on-putin-s-residence\">Alleged attack on Putin’s residence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said that an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/kyiv-rejects-russias-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putins-residence\">attack took place</a> on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence in northwestern Russia’s Novgorod on Sunday, “practically immediately after” talks in Florida between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</li>\n<li>The strike “will not go unanswered”, Ushakov said in remarks reported by Russian media, following a call between Trump and Putin.</li>\n<li>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russian air defence systems shot down 91 long-range strike drones used in the attack and that no one was injured.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/29/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putin-residence\">denied the claim</a>, accusing Russia of trying to derail peace talks.</li>\n<li>However, Trump expressed anger over the alleged attack, telling reporters: “I was very angry about it.” When asked if the United States had evidence of the attack, Trump said, “We’ll find out.”</li>\n<li>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that “the response to Kyiv’s attacks will not be diplomatic” and that Russia would be revising its negotiating position in the attack’s wake.</li>\n<li>The United Arab Emirates’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “strongly condemned” the “deplorable attack” and “the threat it poses to security and stability”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy\">Diplomacy</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that a phone call between Putin and Trump on the issue of Ukraine on Monday was “positive”, without elaborating.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he spoke by phone with the leaders of Germany, Latvia and Finland to update them on the outcomes of his meeting with Trump and where peace negotiations stood.</li>\n<li>Lavrov said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA Novosti that “Kyiv and its Western backers must recognise the new territorial realities that have emerged following the incorporation of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the  Luhansk People’s Republic, and the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions into the Russian Federation.” He was referring to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions that Moscow claims to have annexed, which include Donetsk and Luhansk, renamed by Russian-backed separatists as the DPR and LPR.</li>\n<li>A survey published by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation (DIF), a Ukrainian think tank, on Monday showed that recognising occupied Ukrainian territories “as part of the Russian Federation” remained deeply unpopular in Ukraine, with 76 percent of Ukrainians saying they considered it “unacceptable”.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"fighting\">Fighting</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces attacked the front-line town of Orikhiv in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, killing a 46-year-old man and wounding a 49-year-old woman, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces killed one person and injured five in attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region on Sunday, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, said on Telegram that Russian forces killed seven civilians who had been hiding in a basement in the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said it had launched an investigation into reports that Russian soldiers shot dead two captured Ukrainian soldiers in the village of Shakhove, Pokrovsky, on Saturday.</li>\n<li>“The deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and qualifies as a grave international crime,” the prosecutor general’s office said.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks injured five civilians in Russia’s Belgorod region, according to Russia’s TASS state news agency, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks also injured four civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia, and three civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Donetsk, TASS reported, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>In a televised address from the Kremlin, Putin made a wide range of claims about Moscow’s ongoing war on Ukraine, including that Russian troops were advancing towards the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia.</li>\n<li>General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s army chief, said during the same address that Russian forces had captured 6,460 square kilometres (2,494sq miles) of territory in Ukraine in 2025, including 334 villages.</li>\n<li>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quoted its director general, Rafael Grossi, as saying that power line repairs near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had been successfully completed.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"
