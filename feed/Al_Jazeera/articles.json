An estimated 125 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, including the two latest casualties.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>US Southern Command, the military unit that oversees operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean Sea, reported that one survivor had yet to be recovered. It added that the US Coast Guard had been notified to activate its search-and-rescue operations.</p><p>“On Jan. 23, at the direction of [Secretary of Defense] Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” the command wrote in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/Southcom/status/2014825085425877224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.”</p><p>The deadly strike is the first such attack to take place in 2026: The last one took place on <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369758/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-31-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 31</a>.</p><p>And it is also the first to unfold since the US launched a full-scale military operation on January 3 in Venezuela to remove the country’s then-president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife Cilia Flores. The couple is now being held in a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, on charges of narcotics trafficking.</p><p>Trump’s increasingly aggressive actions in the Latin American region have sparked alarm among world leaders and human rights advocates, who have compared the boat bombings to extrajudicial killings.</p><h2 id=\"unknown-fate-for-survivors\">Unknown fate for survivors</h2><p>The treatment of survivors during such strikes has also elicited alarm.</p><p>One survivor from an October 27 attack went missing in the waves and is presumed dead. And during a December 30 <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369710/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-30-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attack</a>, Southern Command reported that eight survivors “abandoned their vessels” and jumped overboard before their boats could be sunk in a second strike.</p><p>Despite efforts by the US Coast Guard, the men were never found.</p><p>One of the biggest controversies came in late November, when The Washington Post revealed that the very first strike in the series, on September 2, resulted in two previously unknown survivors.</p><p>Those survivors were then killed in a follow-up “double-tap” strike as they clung to the wreckage of their boat.</p><p>Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle denounced the “double tap” as a possible crime, and pressure has mounted for the Trump administration to release video to the public depicting the second strike.</p><p>Only on one rare occasion have survivors been recovered from the Trump administration’s lethal boat strikes.</p><p>On October 16, the US military targeted a submersible vessel for bombing. Two men survived, one from Ecuador and one from Colombia, and they were repatriated to their home countries. Both men were reportedly released from custody without charges, as officials cited a lack of evidence to detain them.</p><h2 id=\"questionable-legal-justification\">Questionable legal justification</h2><p>The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the people on board the boats of being drug traffickers, though it has never offered any evidence to justify that claim.</p><p>In October, media reports emerged that the White House had issued a notice to Congress saying that the president had determined that the US was locked in an “armed conflict” with drug traffickers, whom it described as “unlawful combatants”.</p><p>Drug trafficking is a crime under international law, but not an act of armed aggression.</p><p>Without a forum in which to weigh evidence and ascertain guilt, experts at the United Nations and elsewhere have warned the killings could amount to international crimes.</p><p>“These attacks appear to be unlawful killings carried out by order of a Government, without judicial or legal process allowing due process of law,” a group of UN experts said in a statement in November.</p><p>They added that the bombing campaign violates “fundamental international human rights law prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of life”, since the attacks were not carried out “within the context of national self-defence” nor against “individuals posing an imminent threat”.</p><p>US groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, have sued the Trump administration to release a secret opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel that it uses to justify the attacks. But that legal case remains ongoing.</p><p>The US also faces questions about the manner in which it conducts the strikes, after a report in The New York Times this month claimed it had disguised the aircraft in the September 2 attack as a civilian plane.</p><p>That could explain why survivors appeared to wave at it for help before being killed in the “double tap”, according to the report. Under international law, such deception can be considered “perfidy”, a serious war crime.</p><p>No victims have ever been publicly identified by the US, raising additional concerns.</p><p>Families from countries including Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have claimed that their loved ones were among those killed, and many insist the deceased were merely fishermen, not drug traffickers.</p><p>In December, the family of missing fisherman Alejandro Carranza <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/1/16/inevitably-difficult-inside-a-familys-fight-against-the-us-boat-strikes\">was the first to file</a> an international complaint against the US for its boat strikes.</p><p>It appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to stop the bombings, investigate the circumstances and seek compensation on the family’s behalf.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the vote had yet to be ​published in the country’s official gazette as of late Friday, a necessary step before ‌the decision becomes legally valid.</p><p>The TPC was established in 2024 as the country’s top executive body, a response to a political crisis stretching back to the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.

Despite a bruising week, the Brazilian knows that Real Madrid as an institution are firmly behind him,” wrote Spanish newspaper AS.</p><p>“Vinicius needed the backing of his own to rise from the ashes – and the embrace, first from his teammates and then from Alvaro Arbeloa, made that clear.”</p><p>Arbeloa has indicated from the beginning of his reign that a happy Vinicius will lead to a happy Madrid.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-villarreal-fared-in-la-liga-this-season\">How have Villarreal fared in La Liga this season?</h2><p>Marcelino Garcia Toral’s third-placed Villarreal are seven points behind Madrid and eight off champions Barca; a defeat would therefore virtually write off any chance of a first La Liga title.</p><p>Whatever the result on Saturday, though, it has been a remarkable run until now.</p><p>The east coast club lost only one of their first seven La Liga fixtures this season, winning five. A similar run would see them win six in a row from late October through early December – a ride that was ended by defeat at Barcelona.</p><p>Toral’s side bounced back to win their following two matches but they did suffer defeat in their last domestic outing, going down 2-0 at Real Betis last Saturday.</p><p>Estadio de la Ceramica has proven to be a fortress this season with eight wins, a draw and one defeat recorded at home, that in comparison with five wins, a draw and three defeats on the road.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-villarreal-fared-in-the-champions-league\">How have Villarreal fared in the Champions League?</h2><p>The exploits in Europe have not been as rewarding for Villarreal, with six defeats and a draw recorded in their seven games.</p><p>They finish the league phase of the Champions League at Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday, but any hopes of reaching the next round have long since faded.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-villarreal-played-real-madrid\">What happened the last time Villarreal played Real Madrid?</h2><p>Real won the first meeting in La Liga this season 3-1 at Bernabeu on October 4.</p><p>Vinicius Junior netted two minutes in the second half to open the scoring, then doubled Real’s tally from the penalty spot with 20 minutes remaining.</p><p>Georges Mikautadze pulled one back for the away team but after Santiago Mourino saw red in the 77th minute, Kylian Mbappe soon after netted Real’s third to ensure the win.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This will be the 55th meeting between the sides, with Real Madrid winning 31 of the encounters.

He argues it lacks clarity and does not explicitly establish that private companies can hold majority ownership.</p><p>“This law is a law of ambiguity, designed to avoid openly breaking with Chavez’s oil legacy,” Guerra said. “It is not emphatic about private participation.”</p><p>He noted that, in practice, the government has already ceded ground to private capital through production participation contracts (CPP), under which companies could effectively hold more than 50 percent.</p><p>The CPP framework emerged in 2024 when Rodríguez was serving as energy and oil minister. Its operation has been marked by opacity, as it is shielded by Article 37 of the Anti-Blockade Law, enacted to circumvent sanctions imposed on PDVSA in 2019.</p><p>That provision establishes a regime of confidentiality and document classification, allowing the government to bypass the existing Hydrocarbons Law, which limits private or foreign capital to joint ventures in which PDVSA must hold a majority stake.</p><p>On January 15, Rodríguez told the National Assembly that the introduction of CPPs in April of 2024 led to a rebound in oil production, from 900,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million bpd, and that investments under this model reached nearly $900m in 2025.</p><p>But the introduction of the proposed changes were marred by controversy as the draft was not made public until just a couple of hours before lawmakers convened for its first debate. The opposition declined to vote, arguing that in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves, energy legislation should be treated as a “social pact”, the result of a broad and thorough consultation among all stakeholders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"chevron-model\">‘Chevron model’</h2><p>Luis Oliveros, dean of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Metropolitan University at Caracas, described it as a positive sign that the law formalises what is known as the “Chevron model”.</p><p>“It opens room for foreign companies to assume technical, operational and financial management of the joint ventures they operate, with greater flexibility,” he said. However, he added that eliminating PDVSA’s mandatory majority stake would have been more attractive to foreign investors.</p><p>Oswaldo Felizzola, coordinator of Venezuela’s International Centre for Energy and Environment (CIEA), told Al Jazeera that the reform contains enough elements to invite new capital to invest in the industry, but ultimately falls short.</p><p>“What has been proposed is necessary, but not sufficient. The law needs to be updated for the 21st century,” Felizzola said. “That said, it is no longer as statist as to paralyse the industry.”</p><p>He noted that many existing companies could shift to a different operating model to improve profitability, but warned that the framework still has significant shortcomings. “It does not take into account current or future issues – climate change, for example – and therefore it is not a law that will drive the role of oil in the years ahead,” he said.</p><p>According to Felizzola, the conditions outlined in the reform are closer to the model that prevailed in Venezuela during the last quarter of the 20th century. “Are further reforms needed? Yes. But there is at least enough in place to work with – and for the Venezuelan government to allow you to do so.”</p><p>The reform bill must now move to a consultation phase and a second, article-by-article debate in the National Assembly before it can be enacted. It is not clear when that will happen.</p><p>Meanwhile, energy cooperation with the Trump administration is already having an impact on Venezuela’s economy. This week, the country received its first $300m from US crude sales, earmarked for stabilising the foreign exchange market.</p><p>“We are witnessing a shift,” Guerra said. “The Rodriguez–Trump pact is clearly being implemented, and oil revenues are already flowing in. The lifting of sanctions allows Venezuela to sell at market prices rather than at a discount, as it has been doing. At a minimum, oil revenues this year are expected to rise by 30 percent compared with last year.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
