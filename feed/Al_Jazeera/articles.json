Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-has-the-upper-hand\">Israel has ‘the upper hand’</h2><p>Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.</p><p>“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.</p><p>Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.</p><p>Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/23/israeli-jets-bomb-villages-across-lebanon-despite-ceasefire\">intensified attacks</a> in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">killed</a> by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including <a href=\"/features/2025/11/12/israel-intensifying-attacks-on-lebanon-is-it-planning-another-war\">around 127 civilians</a>, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.</p><p>“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”</p><h2 id=\"israel-should-demonstrate-good-faith\">Israel ‘should demonstrate good faith’</h2><p>Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/lebanese-cabinet-holds-more-talks-on-disarming-hezbollah-under-us-pressure\">approved</a> a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/hezbollah-rejects-calls-to-disarm-says-demands-serve-israel\">refused</a> to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.</p><p>Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.</p><p>The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.</p><p>“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"choices-before-hezbollah\">Choices before Hezbollah</h2><p>Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks <a href=\"/news/2024/12/2/israeli-attacks-kill-two-people-in-lebanon-hezbollah-responds\">once</a>. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.</p><p>Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.</p><p>“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”</p><p>Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.</p><p>Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s <a href=\"/news/2022/10/14/what-to-know-about-the-israel-lebanon-maritime-border-deal\">maritime agreement</a> between Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.</p><p>But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">violated</a>.</p><p>“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Saturday, the Reuters news agency published an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-launch-new-phase-venezuela-operations-sources-say-2025-11-22/\">report</a> claiming that the United States is “poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days”. The report cited four US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the officials said covert operations would likely be the first step in this “new action” against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>This was less than shocking news given that more than a month ago, US President Donald Trump himself announced that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela – a rather unique approach since one does not normally broadcast actions that are supposed to be, um, secret.</p><p>Anyway, it’s no secret that the US has been overseeing a massive military build-up in the region with about 15,000 US troops currently stationed there under the guise of fighting “narcoterrorism”. Since early September, Trump has also presided over wanton extrajudicial executions in the Caribbean Sea, repeatedly ordering the bombing of what he claims are drug-trafficking boats.</p><p>In addition to violating both international and US law, the strikes have produced little to show for themselves beyond terrorising local fishermen.</p><p>To be sure, the US has never met a <a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">“war on drugs” it didn’t love</a>, given the convenient opportunities the whole drug-war narrative offers for wreaking havoc worldwide, militarising the Western Hemisphere, <a href=\"/opinions/2023/5/21/fentanyl-the-new-face-of-the-us-war-on-the-poor\">criminalising poor Americans</a> and all sorts of other good stuff.</p><p>Never mind that US financial institutions have for decades reaped profits from the international drug trade – or that “The CIA Drug Connection Is as Old as the Agency,” as an article on The New York Times website <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/03/opinion/IHT-the-cia-drug-connectionis-as-old-as-the-agency.html\">puts it</a>.</p><p>It should come as no surprise by now that the president who campaigned on keeping the US out of wars and then promptly <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/2/did-god-want-trump-to-bomb-iran\">bombed Iran</a> has now found another conflict in which to embroil the country. And as is par for the course in US imperial belligerence, the rationale for aggression against Venezuela doesn’t hold water.</p><p>For example, the Trump administration has strived to pin the blame for the fentanyl crisis in the US on Maduro. But there’s a slight problem – which is that Venezuela doesn’t even produce the synthetic opioid in question.</p><p>As NBC News and other hardly radical outlets have pointed out, Venezuelan drug cartels are focused on exporting cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the US.</p><p>Nevertheless, on November 13, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth – pardon, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, as per <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/us-department-of-defense-to-be-renamed-department-of-war-report\">administrative rebranding</a> – took to X to <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430\">assure</a> his audience that the massive US military build-up off the Venezuelan coast is a mission that “defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people”.</p><p>This is the same administration, of course, that was just <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/10/the-government-shutdown-has-escalated-the-us-war-on-the-poor\">threatening to starve</a> impoverished Americans by withholding essential food assistance, which suggests that the wellbeing of “our people” isn’t really of utmost concern.</p><p>Consider also the fact that Trump slashed federal funding for gun violence prevention programmes in a country where <a href=\"/opinions/2022/7/31/us-gun-violence-capitalism-is-the-culprit\">mass shootings</a> have become a way of life. Obviously, <a href=\"/opinions/2022/5/26/the-american-nightmare\">massacres in elementary schools</a> are “killing our people” in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with Venezuela.</p><p>But it’s so much more fun to blame Maduro for everything, right?</p><p>Poverty itself is a major killer in America – as is the domestic pharmaceutical industry (speaking of opioids). However, none of these full-blown crises has merited a remotely gung-ho response from the valiant defenders of the Homeland.</p><p>Like his predecessor <a href=\"/opinions/2014/3/4/remembering-hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chavez</a>, Maduro has long been a thorn in the side of US empire – hence the current campaign to discredit him as a “narcoterrorist” and thereby set the stage for regime change. He also happens to be a pet target of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the main architect of Washington’s war plans in Venezuela. Potentially eyeing a presidential bid in three years, Rubio is seeking to curry favour with his Florida constituency, which includes fanatically right-wing members of the Venezuelan and Cuban diasporas.</p><p>According to the Reuters report on impending “Venezuela-related operations”, two of the US officials consulted told the news agency that “the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro”. If the plans succeeds, Rubio would join the lengthy roster of US politicians who have propagated deadly havoc abroad in the interest of political gains at home.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the White House had “proposed an idea for US military planes to drop leaflets over Caracas in a psychological operation” to pressure Maduro.</p><p>Sounds like a page – or a leaflet – out of the old <a href=\"/news/2005/11/23/israel-drops-leaflets-on-lebanon-town\">Israeli military playbook</a>.</p><p>And as the Trump administration barrels on with its not-so-covert plans for Venezuela, such hemispheric recklessness will secure neither the US homeland nor anyone else’s.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.</p><p>She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.</p><p>“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.</p><p>“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p><p><span>According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while </span><span>Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</span></p><p>The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.</p><p>“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”</p><p>Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.</p><p>Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.</p><p>In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.</p><p>Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.</p><p>EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.</p><p>“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land.

Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.</p><p>“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.</p><p>In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.</p><p>Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”</p><p>On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.</p><p>“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p><h2 id=\"does-trump-s-peace-plan-favour-moscow\">Does Trump’s peace plan favour Moscow?</h2><p>European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.</p><p>A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.</p><p>“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.</p><p>However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation.

He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.</p><p>But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.</p><p>In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war. He even announced sanctions on Moscow to force it to end the war. He also slapped hefty tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, which he said was financing Moscow’s war efforts.</p><p>As the talks were under way in Geneva on Sunday, Trump again took aim at Ukraine, saying Kyiv has not been grateful for American efforts related to the war with Russia.</p><p>“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on X, echoing remarks he made during a heated exchange in the White House in February in which Trump and US Vice President JD Vance <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/world-reacts-after-donald-trump-jd-vance-berate-ukaines-zelenskyy\">berated</a> Zelenskyy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Slovenia has an electorate of 1.69 million people.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said it will alleviate unnecessary pain. Those against said society should care for the sick, not help them die.</p><p>Several European countries – including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland – already allow terminally ill people to receive medical help to end their lives.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-slovenes-proposing\"></h2><h2 id=\"what-are-the-slovenes-proposing\">What are the Slovenes proposing?</h2><p>Under the disputed law, which was set to take effect this year, lucid but terminally ill patients would have had the right to die if their suffering had become unbearable and all other treatment options had been exhausted.</p><p>The legislation is similar to the assisted dying bill passed by the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/british-parliament-votes-in-favour-of-assisted-dying-law\">United Kingdom Parliament</a> in June. Britain’s bill allows assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, the approvals of two doctors, judicial oversight and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>Slovenia’s law would require the approval of two doctors but also cooling-off periods and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>About 54 percent of citizens back the legalisation of assisted dying, almost 31 percent oppose it and 15 percent are undecided, according to a poll published this week by the Dnevnik daily based on 700 responses. In June 2024, 55 percent backed the law.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-supporters-saying\">What are supporters saying?</h2><p>Prime Minister Robert Golob urged citizens to back the law “so that each of us can decide for ourselves how and with what dignity we will end our lives”.</p><p>Marijan Janzekovic, an 86-year-old who lives in the town of Sveti Tomaz near the capital, Ljubljana, also supports the bill.</p><p>His wife, Alenka Curin-Janzekovic, was in pain from diabetes-related illnesses before she ended her life at a suicide clinic in Switzerland in 2023.</p><p>“She was in a wheelchair … and in pain so bad my heart hurt just by watching her,” he told the Reuters news agency.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-opponents-think\">What do opponents think?</h2><p>The main political group opposing the law, called Voice for the Children and the Family, has accused the government of using the law to “poison” ill and elderly people.</p><p>Opponents said the law is inhumane and violates Slovenia’s Constitution, which declares human life inviolable.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slovenian Catholic Archbishop Stanislav Zore said the state should focus on palliative care instead.</p><p>“Let’s care for the sick and dying but not offer them suicide,” he said. The Catholic Church is opposed to euthanasia.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-countries-practice-assisted-dying\">What other countries practise assisted dying?</h2><p>Assisted dying is already permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, several states in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.</p><p>In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several US states, assisted dying laws are generally framed around medical aid. These jurisdictions typically require that patients be terminally ill, mentally competent and assessed by two independent doctors.</p><p>In many of these countries, the patient must self-administer lethal medication rather than have a doctor provide it directly. These regimes prioritise patient autonomy and strict procedural safeguards, such as waiting periods.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal, the approach to assisted dying is permissive. Active euthanasia or doctor-administered treatment is legal under defined conditions of unbearable suffering, even if the patient is not terminally ill.</p><p>In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only assisted suicide is legally tolerated as opposed to active euthanasia. Switzerland is an outlier insofar as there is no dedicated regulatory regime for euthanasia, meaning nonresidents may access the service via organisations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4125340\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4125340\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4125340\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-assisted-dying-legal-world-NOV23-2025-1763907325.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is assisted dying legal - world-NOV23, 2025-1763907325\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4125340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-currently-debating-assisted-dying-laws\">Which other countries are currently debating assisted dying laws?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/french-lawmakers-approve-assisted-dying-bill\">May</a>, France’s National Assembly approved a “right-to-die” bill. The legislation would allow adults over 18 who are citizens or residents and suffer from incurable illnesses and “intolerable” physical or psychological suffering to request lethal medication.</p><p>Under the bill, a medical team must assess the patient’s condition before a mandatory reflection period before the prescription of a lethal substance. If the patient is physically unable to self-administer, a doctor or nurse may assist.</p><p>The proposal excludes people with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative disorders like advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The bill now has to go to the Senate and must return to the National Assembly for a second reading before it could become law.</p><p>Elsewhere, Britain’s lower house voted to legalise assisted dying in June. The House of Commons narrowly voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, marking a major step towards legalising assisted dying in England and Wales.</p><p>The bill would allow mentally competent adults with a prognosis of less than six months to live to request medical help to end their lives, subject to assessments by two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a social worker.</p><p>The legislation is not yet law. It must still get through the House of Lords, where it will be further scrutinised and may be amended. If it does become law, the timeline for implementation may not be until 2029.</p></div></div></body></html>"
