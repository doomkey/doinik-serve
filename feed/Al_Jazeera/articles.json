But even where there was no change in policy stance, labour migration fell in most European Union countries, dropping to below 2019 levels.</p><p>According to Jean-Christophe Dumont, who leads the OECD’s international migration division, the downturn can be chalked up to a “less favourable” global economic situation.</p><p>In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecast by 0.5 percentage points to 2.8 percent for 2025, citing President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/opinions/2025/4/3/american-consumers-set-to-be-the-biggest-losers-in-trumps-trade-wars\">trade war</a> as a limiting factor.</p><p>Meanwhile, other countries that had traditionally been among the largest recipients of migrants have toughened entry rules. Over the past two years, Canada, Australia and the UK have all brought in measures to limit work-related migration.</p><p>Elsewhere, Dumont noted that a large number of Ukrainians granted temporary protection in Europe had eased labour shortages in several sectors, reducing the demand for foreign workers.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/international-migration-outlook-2025_ae26c893-en/full-report/recent-developments-in-international-migration-movements-and-labour-market-inclusion-of-immigrants_203de29e.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">most recent</a> data from the OECD, an estimated 5.1 million Ukrainians who fled their country following Russia’s <a href=\"/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets\">full-scale invasion in 2022</a> are now living in OECD member states, as of June 2025.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-other-types-of-migration\">What about other types of migration?</h2><p>The OECD recorded a 13 percent fall in the number of new international students arriving in OECD nations between 2023 and 2024. Tighter visa policies in the UK, US, Canada and Australia played a key role, driven by concerns about migration fraud as well as pressure on local housing markets.</p><p data-start=\"1746\" data-end=\"2267\">By contrast, migration for humanitarian reasons has continued to climb. Asylum applications surged in the US in the final months of the Biden administration last year, and the UK has experienced a sharp increase in illegal <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/refugee-and-migrant-crossings-to-uk-hit-record-high-by-end-of-july\">small-boat arrivals</a> from EU countries in recent months.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>These increases mean that, despite the fall in labour and student migration, total permanent migration to advanced economies in 2024 dipped only slightly, by 4 percent, from a peak in the previous year.</p><p>Still, the 6.2 million newcomers to the OECD recorded in 2024 exceeded pre-pandemic levels by about 15 percent. Temporary labour mobility, involving visas which do not lead to permanent settlement, held steady at approximately 2.3 million. This remains above 2019 levels.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-migration-numbers-changed\">How have migration numbers changed?</h2><p>A record 6.5 million people settled in OECD countries in 2023. That was an increase of almost 10 percent on the previous record of six million who moved in 2022 – the greatest rise was in the UK.</p><p>Roughly one-third of OECD countries experienced record levels of immigration in 2023, including Canada, France and Japan. The US received 1.2 million permanent legal immigrants and Donald Trump based his 2024 election campaign on <a href=\"/economy/2024/10/3/how-will-trumps-plans-to-deport-undocumented-migrants-impact-us-economy\">curbing migration</a>.</p><p>Despite the political debate, research by investment bank Goldman Sachs found that immigration drove most of the employment gains in Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Germany and the UK in 2023, and added more than four million jobs in the US.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-future-hold\">What does the future hold?</h2><p>Dumont suggested that overall immigration to OECD countries may ease slightly in 2025, but it will remain historically high despite stricter US immigration policies. He also highlighted that the employment rate among migrants remains solid in labour markets.</p><p>In the UK, for instance, the employment rate among foreign-born workers stood at about 76 percent – a figure that slightly surpassed the rate recorded for people who were born in the country.</p><p>He attributed this partly to visa schemes geared towards higher-skilled roles and partly to the fact that lower-skilled migrants were willingly “filling gaps” in jobs UK nationals do not want.</p><p>Fabiola Mieres, a senior specialist in migration at the International Labour Organization, told Al Jazeera: “We need to rethink some of the issues around native labour shortages in areas like agriculture, construction and health [where migrant workers tend to be concentrated].</p><p>“Clearly, minimum wages and working conditions are part of the story.”</p><p>She added that “immigration will likely continue to form an important part of electoral politics around the world, especially in Europe and the US. It creates a lot of heated emotions.”</p><p><strong>What is the OECD?</strong></p><p>The OECD was founded in 1948 to coordinate the US Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe following World War II. At the time, it provided a forum for economic planning and the removal of trade barriers between its European members.</p><p>By the late 1950s, as European reconstruction neared completion, member states sought a more global framework for economic cooperation. In 1961, the OECD expanded its membership to include the US and Canada.</p><p>Over subsequent decades, the OECD widened its membership to include countries from the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting its evolution from a transatlantic group to a broader community of advanced and emerging countries.</p><p>By the late 20th century, the OECD had grown into a central hub for economic research, policy analysis and the development of governance standards. It became widely recognised for its work and research on education, labour markets and environmental policy.</p><p>In 2019, the OECD <a href=\"/economy/2019/10/9/oecd-takes-aim-at-tech-giants-with-global-tax-plan\">spearheaded a proposal</a> to tax big multinational companies at least 15 percent to put an end to decades of tax competition between governments trying to attract foreign investment.</p><p>The rules, which were <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\">adopted by the G20</a> in October 2021, have made it harder for large international companies, including giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, to avoid taxation by establishing offices in low-tax jurisdictions.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.</p><p>Netanyahu denies the charges, and his lawyers said in a 111-page letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal.</p><p>In a brief video statement, Netanyahu said he wanted to see the process through, “but the security and political reality – the national interest – dictate otherwise”.</p><p>“The continuation of the trial is tearing us apart from within, arousing fierce divisions, intensifying rifts,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Herzog’s office confirmed it had received Netanyahu’s request.</p><p>“This is an extraordinary request, which carries with it significant implications. After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the president will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,” it said.</p><p>Beyond the domestic charges, Netanyahu is also wanted by The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC). In November 2024, the ICC issued <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/icc-prosecutor-warned-to-drop-netanyahu-case-or-be-destroyed-report\">arrest warrants</a> for Netanyahu and former Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Israel’s war on the Palestinian territory has killed more than 70,000 people, mostly women and children, and wounded nearly 171,000 others.</p><p>Netanyahu’s pardon request comes weeks after United States President Donald Trump publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament last month.</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump also sent a letter to Herzog, calling the corruption case a “political, unjustified prosecution”.</p><p>Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s request triggered an immediate backlash.</p><p>Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life.</p><p>Opposition politician Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon.</p><p>“Only the guilty seek pardon,” Golan said.</p><p>The Movement for Quality Government in Israel said that granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offences of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"liability\">‘Liability’</h2><p>Outside Herzog’s home, protester Ami Dror, 52, said the president’s job was to “protect Israeli democracy… and if you demolish law and order, this might be the end of Israeli democracy”.</p><p>Coalition allies, meanwhile, issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.</p><p>Smotrich said Netanyahu had “been persecuted for years by a corrupt judicial system that fabricated political cases against him”, while Defence Minister Israel Katz said a pardon would end the “deep rift that has accompanied Israeli society for nearly a decade”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara, reporting from Doha, called Netanyahu a “liability for Israel”.</p><p>“Israel has been boasting for decades to be the one and only democracy in the Middle East. Yes, it is a procedural democracy for Jews in Israel, and even that has been diminishing slowly but surely under Netanyahu,” he said.</p><p>Bishara pointed to Netanyahu’s “crusade” against Israel’s judiciary, including the Supreme Court, before the war on Gaza, noting the moves had triggered widespread antigovernment protests in Israel.</p><p>“So, he has an issue with legality and institutions and liberal democracy. And internationally, he’s now been indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, and he led Israel into a genocidal war, which is the subject of proceedings at the International Court of Justice,” Bishara said.</p><p>“The man is an outlaw. He is an international fugitive… Israel’s economy is not going to pick up as long as he’s prime minister. Israel’s society is not going to heal, and the war is not going to end as long as he’s prime minister,” the analyst added.</p><p>“All in all, he does not bode well for Israel because he’s hostage to his criminal past.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Witkoff leaves on Monday for Moscow, where he is expected to meet Russian counterparts for talks this week.</p><p>“We continue to be realistic about how difficult this is, but optimistic, particularly given the fact that as we’ve made progress, I think there is a shared vision here that this is not just about ending the war,” Rubio told reporters after the talks concluded.</p><p>“It is about securing Ukraine’s future, a future that we hope will be more prosperous than it’s ever been.”</p><p>He added that there were “a lot of moving parts” in the discussions, and “obviously, there’s another party involved [Russia] here that will have to be a part of the equation”.</p><p>Rubio said the US has been in touch “in varying degrees” with the Russians and has “a pretty good understanding of their views as well”.</p><p>The talks came a week after Rubio and Ukrainian negotiators met in Geneva, Switzerland, to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/russia-ukraine-peace-plan-whats-the-latest-version-after-us-kyiv-talks\">revise Trump’s peace plan</a>, which was initially criticised as a Russian wish list.</p><p>Umerov, writing on  X ahead of the meeting, said Ukraine had clear directives and priorities for the talks – “safeguarding Ukrainian interests, ensuring substantive dialogue, and advancing on the basis of the progress achieved in Geneva”. He added that negotiators want to “secure real peace for Ukraine and reliable, long-term security guarantees”.</p><p>After the meeting, he declared it productive.</p><p>“We discussed all the important matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people, and [the] US was super supportive,” Umerov said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The sit-down set the stage for Witkoff’s planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Trump earlier signalled would take place this week.</p><p>Putin said the US draft, which has not yet been published, could serve as a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/putin-says-us-backed-peace-plan-as-framework-is-ok-in\">“basis for future agreements”</a>, adding that his talks with Witkoff should focus on the Russian-occupied Donbas and Crimea regions.</p><h2 id=\"important-days\">‘Important days’</h2><p>The negotiations come at a sensitive moment for Ukraine as it continues to push back against Russian forces, which invaded in 2022, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reeling from a corruption scandal that led to the resignation of his chief of staff, <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/11/29/what-next-for-ukraine-after-president-zelenskyys-top-aide-quits\">Andriy Yermak</a>, this week.</p><p>It was Yermak who sat down with Rubio in Geneva last week to make <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">amendments to Trump’s original 28-point plan</a>, which initially envisioned Ukraine ceding its entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia, limiting the size of its military, and giving up on joining NATO.</p><p>The US pared back the original draft to 19 points following criticism from Kyiv and Europe, but the current contents remain unclear.</p><p>“Ukraine’s got some difficult little problems,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One, referring to the corruption probe that forced Yermak out.</p><p>“But I think that there’s a good chance we can make a deal,” he said.</p><p>Zelenskyy wrote on X that the US is “demonstrating a constructive approach”.</p><p>“In the coming days, it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,” he said.</p><p>On Sunday, the Ukrainian president said he spoke with NATO chief Mark Rutte, and noted, “These are important days and much can change.”</p><p></p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, will host Zelenskyy for talks in Paris on Monday, the French presidency announced.</p><h2 id=\"fatigue-with-the-war\">‘Fatigue with the war’</h2><p>Theresa Fallon, the director of the Brussels-based Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine needs strong European and US support to secure a favourable deal.</p><p>“There is a real attitude of fatigue with the war. It’s winter. Its cold. The Russians have been pounding various cities in Ukraine. So, they are suffering, and they would like to see a peaceful, but one with dignity, end to this conflict,” Fallon said from the Italian city of Milan.</p><p>The talks needed hard-headed negotiators, she said, stressing that it was Putin who started the conflict and “should not be rewarded for beginning a war and all of the atrocities that were committed by Russian soldiers there”.</p><p>Ukraine, however, faces difficult days, Fallon said.</p><p>“We don’t have much support from the Europeans. The Trump administration has made it kind of clear that they don’t want to help Ukraine so much. They are willing to sell weapons to the Europeans who will pass it on to Ukraine. There’s really not a whole lot of support,” she said.</p><p>“So, I think that it’s a really hard haul for the Ukrainians, and they will have to hopefully come up with more support from the Trump administration for peace.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On the battlefield, meanwhile, Russian forces claimed more advances, while also launching attacks on Ukraine’s capital and the region for two nights in a row.</p><p>A drone attack on the outskirts of Kyiv on Sunday killed one person and wounded 11, the regional governor said. Russian attacks overnight on Saturday, meanwhile, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/russian-strikes-on-kyiv-kill-three-as-ukraine-envoys-travel-to-us-for-talks\">killed six people</a> and wounded dozens of others across Ukraine, and cut power to 400,000 households in Kyiv.</p><p>A Ukrainian security source said on Sunday that Kyiv was responsible for attacks on <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/30/ukraine-hits-two-oil-tankers-in-black-sea-targeting-russian-shadow-fleet\">two oil tankers</a> in the Black Sea that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil.</p><p>One of Russia’s largest oil terminals also halted operations on Saturday following a drone attack.</p><p>The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), a group that includes US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil, and which owns the terminal, called the strike a “terrorist attack”.</p><p>Ukraine, which did not comment on the incident, regularly attacks Russian energy facilities in a bid to sap the country’s war chest.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The creation of a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the decades-long conflict.</p><p>“We know that in this moment, Israel doesn’t accept this solution, but we see it as the only one that can offer a solution to the conflict that they are living in,” said Leo. “We are also friends with Israel, and we try with both sides to be a mediating voice that can help bring them closer to a solution with justice for all.”</p><p>The pope has avoided any direct mention of Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2024/12/6/who-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">genocidal war on Gaza</a> while in Turkiye.</p><p>There was no immediate response from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In a mix of Spanish and English, Maduro declared, “No war … Yes peace, forever.”</p><p>On November 15, Maduro invoked singer John Lennon’s peace anthem “Imagine” during a rally of supporters. “Do everything for peace, as John Lennon used to say. Imagine all the people,” he said.</p><p>Two days later, condemning the use of force or military threats, Maduro said, “Dialogue, call, yes. Peace, yes. War, no. Never, never war.”</p><p>But as tensions continue to escalate, Maduro last week pledged to defend the country against any “imperialist threat”.

But when the founder of the governing United Socialist Party and former president, Hugo Chavez, was elected in 1998, relations with Washington began to sour.</p><p>After a failed coup attempt in 2002, Chavez ended cooperation with the US drug enforcement agencies and expelled US military advisers. He also pushed out US oil majors ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after nationalising the oil sector, further straining the ties. Chevron, another US oil giant, still operates in Venezuela.</p><p>Chavez was critical of the US involvement in Latin America and cultivated ties with regional left-leaning countries such as Cuba and Bolivia under former socialist President Evo Morales. He also forged closer economic ties with Russia and China.</p><p>After Maduro took over from Chavez in 2013, relations worsened. During his first term, Trump backed Maduro’s political rivals, recognising opposition figure Juan Guaido as interim president in 2019.</p><p>The US’s so-called “war on drugs” here functions as a political technology that strips alleged traffickers and small-boat crews of their humanity, argued Regilme, “so that lethal force and regime change look like law enforcement rather than war”.</p><p>Trump’s administration also frames Maduro’s state as a criminal syndicate “to delegitimise not just the regime but the entire political-economic model that resists this kind of restructuring”, said Regilme.</p><p>Adolfo Franco, a lawyer and Republican strategist, told Al Jazeera that while Trump has not explicitly laid out the next steps, he clearly wants regime change in Venezuela.</p><p>“For President Trump, everything is on the table. The desire here, from my experience in government, is forcing Maduro to exit, either peacefully, which I think might be a tall order,” Franco said.</p><p>“The negotiation part is difficult because of the massive amount of forces and signals we have sent in the region that we’re serious about some affirmative change in Venezuela,” he added. “I can’t imagine it being business as usual with Maduro running the Venezuelan government. That is not on the table.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_2013827\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2013827\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2013827\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AP22330774337393.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"two homeless people sharing a piece of fentanyl\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2013827\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two homeless people share a dose of fentanyl in an alley in Los Angeles, August 18, 2022.

But the fentanyl crisis that claims the most American lives has hardly any connection to Caracas.</p><p>US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of State data consistently identify Mexico, specifically the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, as the manufacturing hub for synthetic opioids, utilising precursors imported from China.</p><p>Venezuela does not even serve as a significant transit corridor for the drug that overwhelmingly enters the US through legal ports of entry, along the southwest land border rather than via the Caribbean maritime routes currently being targeted by the US Navy.</p><p>For cocaine, while Venezuela appears to be a transit hub, it is neither the primary producer nor the dominant trafficking actor.</p><p>Colombia remains the world’s leading cultivator of the drug. Most of the cocaine that passes through Venezuela goes to Europe.</p><p>In March 2020, the US estimated between 200 and 250 tonnes of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela each year, representing 13 percent of the estimated global production.</p><p>The US allies in Europe have also pushed back against the Trump administration’s strikes in the Caribbean.</p><p>At a Group of Seven foreign ministers’ meeting in Canada’s Niagara region, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the strikes “violate international law” and were concerning France’s territories in the wider region.</p><p>US State Secretary Marco Rubio was present at the meeting. Before departing, he told reporters that drugs are also shipped via Venezuela to Europe, so the US should be thanked for killing the alleged smugglers.</p><p>“I don’t think that the European Union gets to determine what international law is,” Rubio said. “They certainly don’t get to determine how the United States defends its national security.”</p><p>Colombia has been vocal against the US actions as a conflict would impact the country, which shares a 2,219km-long (1,378-mile) border with Venezuela. Bogota already hosts millions of Venezuelan refugees who have fled the country due to a debilitating economic and political crisis.</p><p>Left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who refused to recognise Maduro’s re-election in January, has effectively severed security cooperation with the US over the strikes on boats.</p><p>Petro has described Trump as a “barbarian” who “wants to frighten us” in interviews in the US media. He has called the US military build-up in the Caribbean “undoubtedly an aggression against Latin America”.</p><p>Brazil’s President Lula da Silva has taken a more diplomatic but equally firm stance, telling reporters in Johannesburg, South Africa, “no president of another country should make assumptions about what Venezuela … will be like”.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov condemned the US strikes as “unacceptable” in televised remarks, adding, “This is how, in general, lawless countries act, as well as those who consider themselves above the law.”</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a late November letter to Maduro, reaffirmed the two nations as “intimate friends, dear brothers, and good partners”, saying “China resolutely opposes the meddling of external forces in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4141022\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4141022\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4141022\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-28T101210Z_200909721_RC2BDCAX2Y5E_RTRMADP_3_YEAR-END-2025-PHOTOS-BEST-1764502755.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4141022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump dances onstage as the Village People perform during a rally the day before he is scheduled to be inaugurated for a second term, in Washington, DC, January 19, 2025 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-venezuela-s-actions-dividing-trump-s-maga-base\">Are Venezuela’s actions dividing Trump’s MAGA base?</h2><p>Trump returned to power this year, rising on a pledge to avoid “forever wars”, a message that appeared to resonate deeply with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign.</p><p>Many in his camp are sceptical of extended military engagements abroad, viewing them as costly distractions from domestic priorities and a drain on US resources. That fear was central to the debate when the US bombed Iran earlier this year amid tensions between Tehran and Israel.</p><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most vocal faces of MAGA, had a public falling-out with Trump over his administration’s focus on foreign conflicts at the expense of the pressing economic issues, including the cost-of-living crisis, facing Americans. She has since decided to step down from Congress.</p><p>However, some MAGA-aligned voices have backed pressuring Venezuela’s government by sanctions or low-scale operations amid public opinion against any military intervention in the country.</p><p>Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, has pushed for a tough policy against Venezuela – an agenda that serves his support base in Florida, home to a significant population of Cuban and Venezuelan immigrants.</p><p>Confronting an “authoritarian socialist narco-regime” plays well domestically for Trump as well, said Regilme, the foreign policy expert, adding that it ties “together anticommunism, border security, and the promise to be tough on crime”.</p><p>For Trump, Regilme argued, a kinetic strike on Venezuela is both a bargaining tool and a real option.</p><p>“That’s precisely what makes it so dangerous,” he said. “Trump has little appetite for large-scale occupations, but he has repeatedly embraced highly visible uses of force that send a clear message to domestic audiences and foreign elites while limiting US casualties.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Sudan was teetering on the edge of crisis long before open war erupted in April 2023. Decades of authoritarian rule under Omar al-Bashir resulted in a fragile economy, fragmented security forces, and entrenched paramilitary structures.</p><p>Following the coup that overthrew al-Bashir in 2019, a fragile civilian-military transitional arrangement failed to unite competing factions. Political instability, localised rebellions, and a simmering rivalry between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – the successor to the Popular Defence Forces, government-backed militia known as the Janjaweed who committed war crimes in Darfur in the early 2000s – escalated into full-blown conflict.</p><p>By mid-2023, Sudan was effectively split into contested zones, with major urban centres, such as Khartoum and Omdurman, transformed into battlefields, and millions of civilians displaced internally or forced across borders as refugees.</p><p>Although geographically removed, the European Union played a consequential role in these developments. For nearly a decade, it pursued a strategy of “externalising” migration control, directing aid, training, and equipment to African states ostensibly to reduce irregular migration towards Europe.</p><p>In Sudan, this approach produced unintended and devastating consequences that the EU is yet to be held accountable for. Funding initially justified under “migration management” and “capacity building” intersected with opaque arms flows, Gulf intermediaries, and weak oversight. European money and materiel, intended to stabilise populations and impose border forces to buffer the migratory ambitions of Africans, may have indirectly reinforced the very actors now perpetrating war crimes in Sudan.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2018, the EU channelled more than 200 million euros ($232m at the current exchange rate) into Sudan via the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) and the Better Migration Management (BMM) initiative.</p><p>These programmes formally aimed to strengthen migration control, border security and anti-trafficking enforcement. In reality, they entrenched cooperation between the EU and Sudan’s security structures, including units that effectively merged into the RSF.</p><p>As early as 2017, the Enough Project, an advocacy group focused on conflict, corruption and human rights, published a report titled Border Control from Hell, warning that “the gravest concern about the EU’s new partnership with Sudan is that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), one of the most abusive paramilitary groups in the country, stands to benefit from EU funding” and that “the equipment that enables identification and registration of migrants will also reinforce the surveillance capabilities of a Sudanese government that has violently suppressed Sudanese citizens for the past 28 years”.</p><p>Two years later, the EU had to suspend several migration-control activities in Sudan because there was a risk that resources could be “diverted for repressive aims”, according to an EU official document cited by German news outlet Deutsche Welle.</p><p>And yet, a factsheet titled What the EU really does in Sudan, published on the bloc’s website in 2018, claimed: “The EU does not provide any financial support to the Government of Sudan … The Rapid Support Forces of the Sudanese military do not benefit directly or indirectly from EU funding.”</p><p>All this raises an important question: If the EU knew of the risk of diversion, why did it still invest hundreds of millions into a context where control over the end use of training, equipment and funds was manifestly weak?</p><p>What is worse is that the EU’s role was not limited to supplying funds that could be misappropriated. It also provided weapons, albeit indirectly.</p><p>As the conflict deepened, investigators started uncovering foreign-manufactured weapons and ammunition circulating widely among the RSF and the SAF. Verified imagery, open-source analysis and serial number tracing have revealed European-manufactured systems on Sudan’s battlefields. In November 2024, Amnesty International released an investigation disclosing that Nimr Ajban armoured personnel carriers (APCs) were equipped with French-made Galix defensive systems. Amnesty’s analysts verified images and videos from multiple Sudanese locations and concluded that, if deployed in Darfur, their use would breach the longstanding United Nations arms embargo on the region.</p><p>In April, investigations by France24 and the Reuters news agency traced 81mm mortar shells found in an RSF convoy in North Darfur back to Bulgaria. The markings on this ammunition matched mortar bombs manufactured by a Bulgarian firm and exported legally to the United Arab Emirates in 2019. The Bulgarian government had not authorised the re-export of the shells from the UAE to Sudan.</p><p>In October, The Guardian reported that British military equipment, including small-arms target systems and engines for APCs, had been used by the RSF in Sudan, and they may have been supplied by the UAE.</p><p>Taken together, these findings illustrate a pattern: European-made arms and weapons systems, legally exported to third countries, have subsequently been diverted into Sudan’s conflict, despite embargoes and supposed safeguards.</p><p>Although the UAE denies it plays any role in the conflict, its position as an intermediary hub for re-exported weaponry has been repeatedly documented. Still, European suppliers, bound by end-user agreements and export-control frameworks, share responsibility for ensuring compliance.</p><p>Under the United Kingdom and EU regulations, governments must deny or revoke licences when there is a clear risk of diversion to conflict zones or human rights abusers. The use of European-made arms and weapons systems in Sudan, therefore, demands a rigorous reassessment of post-shipment monitoring and enforcement.</p><p>Despite this, European and British governments have continued to issue new export licences to potential violators, including the UAE. Recent reporting by Middle East Eye shows that the UK approved roughly $227m in military exports to the UAE between April and June this year, even after being informed that Emirati-supplied equipment had reached the RSF.</p><p>European countries are by far not an exception in failing to ensure that their weapons are not diverted to war zones under embargo.</p><p>My own country, South Africa, has also faced criticism over the lack of control over its arms shipments. In the mid-2010s, the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) faced international and domestic scrutiny after South African-manufactured weapons and ammunition were reportedly used by Saudi and Emirati forces in Yemen.</p><p>As a result, in 2019, the NCACC delayed or withheld export approvals, especially for “the most lethal” items, amid disputes over updated inspection clauses and human rights concerns. The South African authorities demanded that they be granted access to facilities in importer countries to ensure compliance with the end-user agreement – something the UAE and Saudi Arabia, along with several other countries, refused to provide. By 2022, previously withheld consignments were eventually cleared under renegotiated terms.</p><p>Today, evidence suggests that South African weapons may have been diverted to Sudan as well. Investigators and open-source analysts claim to have identified munitions consistent with South African manufacture in Sudan.</p><p>The South African case illustrates that even when there is political will to ensure compliance with the end-user agreements for arms sales, enforcement can be challenging. And yet, it is a necessary and crucial part of peacebuilding efforts.</p><p>If democratic governments wish to reclaim credibility, end-use monitoring must be enforceable, not a bureaucratic concession. The NCACC in Pretoria and export control authorities in Brussels, Sofia, Paris and London must publish transparent audits of past licences, investigate credible diversion cases, and suspend new approvals where risk remains unmitigated.</p><p>In parallel, the EU must ensure migration management funding cannot be coopted by armed actors.</p><p>Without such measures, Europe’s migration policy and South Africa’s defence trade risk complicity in a grim paradox: initiatives justified in the name of security that foster insecurity.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
