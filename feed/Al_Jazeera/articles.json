Africa’s forests and woodlands have historically served as a carbon sink. Now, they are contributing to widening the global greenhouse gas emissions gap that needs to be filled to stay within the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report stated.</p><p>The 2015 Paris Agreement is a treaty between 196 countries acting to mitigate <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/un-climate-talks-go-into-overtime-as-divisions-over-fossil-fuels-persist\">climate change</a> and to keep the world’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-study-found\">What has the study found?</h2><p>In short, Africa’s forests are facing “increasing pressures” which have led to a decline in their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Currently, Africa’s forests are responsible for about one-fifth of global carbon removal. The largest of the continent’s forests is the Congo rainforest – the second largest in the world after the Amazon, and often dubbed the “lungs of Africa”.</p><p>The report found that between 2011 and 2017, Africa’s forests lost 106 million tonnes in biomass – living organisms such as plants – each year. This means their ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere has been severely reduced.</p><p>The worst-affected areas were reportedly the tropical broadleaf forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and other parts of West Africa.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-caused-this\">What has caused this?</h2><p>Carbon output has risen exponentially in the industrial age and is largely caused by burning <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/cop30-draft-text-urges-more-funds-for-poorer-countries-omits-fossil-fuels\">fossil fuels</a> such as coal, oil and gas.</p><p>While forests were adept at absorbing this excess carbon for some time, their ability to do so has been impacted by increased logging to make way for agricultural land and to provide materials for infrastructure projects.</p><p>“The observed trends may be further exacerbated in the future by population growth in Africa, the increasing export demand, particularly from Asia, and the resulting pressure on natural resources (agricultural expansion for commodity crop, timber and fuelwood),” the report found.</p><p>“The long-term persistence of these trends will depend on local governance and whether resources are used sustainably,” it added.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-carbon-sink-and-how-does-it-work\">What is a carbon sink, and how does it work?</h2><p>A “sink” is any area of land or sea that absorbs more carbon dioxide than it produces.</p><p>On land, these areas tend to be abundant in bio material such as plants and trees, which absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store it in their biomass and in the soil. Farming, however, can disrupt this process in the soil.</p><p>The largest carbon sink in the world is the ocean, which absorbs about one-quarter of the Earth’s carbon output, according to ClientEarth, an environmental organisation. Carbon dioxide dissolves on the surface of the water and marine organisms absorb it via photosynthesis.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-areas-of-the-world-are-at-risk\">Which other areas of the world are at risk?</h2><p>The Amazon rainforest is another area of concern.</p><p>Last year, the United States-based nonprofit Amazon Conservation found that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was also eliminating trees that could absorb carbon.</p><p>Cleared land is often used for farming and livestock. These also tend to produce more emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat and produce carbon dioxide.</p><p>But due to the Brazilian government’s crackdown on deforestation, fears that the Amazon could also stop being a carbon sink have so far been averted.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental non-governmental organisation, the loss of the world’s forest carbon sinks will have “catastrophic consequences for people and the planet”.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-solution\">What’s the solution?</h2><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The authors of the report noted that a Brazilian initiative, known as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), is trying to raise $100bn, which will be used to compensate countries that leave their forests untouched. So far, however, only $6.5bn has been raised by a small number of donor countries.</p><p>The report, therefore, called for more efforts to be focused on protecting Africa’s carbon sink and countering climate change.</p><p>“The world otherwise risks losing an important carbon sink needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report found.</p><p>“Reversing biomass losses in Africa requires actions in the political, economic and societal spheres, to promote capacity building [and] improve forest governance,” it added.</p><p>Ultimately, however, more must be done to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, experts say.</p><p>Heiko Balzter, professor of physical geography at the University of Leicester and one of the authors of the report, told New Scientist magazine: “If we are losing the tropical forests as one of the means of mitigating climate change, then we basically have to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning even faster to get to near-zero emissions.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hani wonders painfully what else he can do to protect his children from the rain and strong winds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167385\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167385\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture4-1765452701.jpg?w=430&amp;resize=430%2C330&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Palestinian father taking shelter in a tent in Gaza City.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hani Zaira, a Palestinian father taking shelter in a destroyed building in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In many camps, the ground was already soft from previous rainfall. Wet sand and mud stick to shoes, blankets and cooking pots as people shuffle through. Trenches dug by volunteers to divert water often collapse within hours. With nowhere else to go, families who live in low-lying areas are preparing for the worst: that floodwaters will be pushed directly into their tents.</p><p>Stocking up on food, storing clean water and securing shelter are the most basic steps when people prepare for a storm, but that is considered a luxury for the displaced of Gaza.</p><p>Most families receive scant water deliveries, going sometimes days without enough to cook or wash. Food supplies are equally strained, and while irregular aid distributions provide basics like rice or canned beans, the quantities seldom last more than a few days. Preparing for a storm by cooking ahead, gathering dry goods or storing fuel is simply not possible.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167412\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167412\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture5-1765453479.jpg?w=438&amp;resize=438%2C275&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mervit, a Palestinian mother of 5 children displaced near the Gaza Sea Port.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“We could not sleep last night. Our tent was flooded with rainwater. Everything we had was flushed out by water. We want to prepare, but how?” asked Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port. She added, “We barely have enough food for tonight. We can’t save what we don’t have.”</p><p>Despite poverty, solidarity has become Gaza’s strongest survival strategy. Neighbours, with whatever they have, help secure the tents. Young men go through the rubble and scavenge for metal and wood remains to serve as temporary posts. The women organise collective cooking so that hot meals can be distributed to families in need, particularly those with young children or elderly family members, whenever possible.</p><p>These unofficial networks become more active the closer a storm gets. Volunteers trudge from tent to tent, helping families raise sleeping areas off the ground, patch holes in canopies with plastic sheets, and dig drainage channels. Crowds try to move those who are in precarious, extremely exposed areas to other locations, sharing information about safer places.</p><h2 id=\"we-are-exhausted\">‘We are exhausted’</h2><p>Beyond physical danger, the psychological impact is deep. After months of displacement, loss and deprivation, another crisis – this time, not war, but forces of nature – feels overwhelming.</p><p>“Our tents were destroyed. We are exhausted,” said Wissam Naser. “We have no strength left. Every day there is a new fear: hunger, cold, disease, now the storm.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture1-1765454064.jpg?w=480&amp;resize=480%2C311&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Many residents describe the feeling of being sandwiched between the sky and the ground, exposed on both ends and unable to protect their families from either.</p><p>As clouds mass along Gaza’s shore, families prepare to take a hit. Some weigh down tent walls against the wind with rocks and sandbags. Others push children’s blankets to the driest corner, hoping a roof will last. Most don’t have a plan. They just wait.</p><p>The storm will not be another single-night affair for the displaced in Gaza. It would be a further reminder of how fragile life has become, how survival depends not on preparedness but rather on endurance.</p><p>They wait because they have no alternative. They prepare with what little they have. They pray that this time, the winds will be merciful.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s the only state,” the president said, before referencing his three presidential bids. “It’s funny because I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn’t working on it very hard.”</p><p>Trump then proceeded to denounce the Indiana Senate president, Rodric Bray, and threatened to support a primary challenge against the Indiana leader.</p><p>“He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does,” Trump said.</p><p>“It’s, I think, in two years, but I’m sure he’ll go down. He’ll go down. I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against it.”</p><h2 id=\"fractures-in-the-caucus\">Fractures in the caucus</h2><p>Currently, Indiana sends nine Congress members to the US House of Representatives, one for each of its nine districts. Two of those seats are currently occupied by Democrats.</p><p>Republican leaders in the state, however, had proposed a new map of congressional districts that sought to disempower Democratic voters in the state, clearing the way for conservative candidates to claim all nine seats in next year’s midterm races.</p><p>The proposed map was part of a nationwide effort by the Trump administration to defend Republican control in the US Congress.</p><p>Already, the partisan map had passed the lower chamber of Indiana’s legislature. On December 5, Indiana’s House of Representatives voted 57 to 41 to send House Bill 1032 to the state Senate.</p><p>The bill had the backing of Indiana’s Republican Governor Mike Braun, who encouraged the state senators to emulate their colleagues in the lower chamber.</p><p>But even before the bill arrived in the state Senate, there were cracks in the Republican caucus. Twelve Republicans in the state House broke ranks to vote against the map.</p><p>And certain Republican state Senators likewise expressed reticence.</p><p>Some Republicans, like Indiana state Senator Greg Walker, had a history of opposing redistricting efforts. He was quoted in the Indiana Capital Chronicle as saying, “I cannot, myself, support the bill for which there must be a legal injunction in order for it to be found constitutional.”</p><p>Partisan redistricting has long been a controversial practice in US politics, with opponents calling the practice undemocratic and discriminatory.</p><p>Critics also pointed out that the Indiana proposal would force some voters in urban centres like Indianapolis to commute more than 200 kilometres (124 miles) for in-person voting.</p><p>Walker joined a total of 21 Republican state Senators, including Bray, in voting against the redistricting bill on Thursday.</p><h2 id=\"a-nationwide-campaign\">A nationwide campaign</h2><p>But the Trump administration had invested significant time and effort into swaying the vote.</p><p>In October, Vice President JD Vance travelled to the Hoosier State to try to convince wary Republicans. US House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly made personal phone calls to state leaders. And a day before the critical state Senate vote, Trump took to social media with a mixture of cajoling and pressure.</p><p>“I love the State of Indiana, and have won it, including Primaries, six times, all by MASSIVE Majorities,” Trump began in a winding, 414-word <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115698333420423237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“Importantly, it now has a chance to make a difference in Washington, D.C., in regard to the number of House seats we have that are necessary to hold the Majority against the Radical Left Democrats. Every other State has done Redistricting, willingly, openly, and easily.”</p><p>Currently, the US House of Representatives holds a narrow 220-member Republican majority, out of a total of 435 seats.</p><p>All of those seats, however, will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections, and Democrats are hoping to flip the chamber to their control.</p><p>Starting in June, reports began to emerge that Trump was petitioning the state legislature in the right-wing stronghold of Texas to redistrict, in an effort to help conservative candidates sweep up five extra congressional seats.</p><p>Texas Republicans complied, and in August, the state legislature <a href=\"/news/2025/8/29/texas-governor-greg-abbott-signs-trump-backed-redistricting-bill\">embraced a new redistricted map</a>, overcoming a walkout from state Democrats.</p><p>Republicans in other states, including Missouri and North Carolina, have followed suit, passing new maps that seek to increase right-wing gains in the midterm races.</p><p>But Democrats have fired back. In November, California voters passed a referendum to suspend their independent districting commission and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/california-proposition-50-on-redistricting-set-to-pass-in-blow-to-trump\">adopt a Democrat-leaning map</a> created by state lawmakers.</p><p>Indiana, however, appeared poised to buck <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps\">the redistricting trend</a>. In Wednesday’s lengthy post, Trump warned that the state could put Republican power “at risk” if it failed to pass a new map.</p><p>He also called Bray and other Republican splinter votes “SUCKERS” for the Democrats.</p><p>“Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“One of my favorite States, Indiana, will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!”</p><p>In the wake of Thursday’s defeat, Trump and his allies doubled down on their threats to remove the 21 Republican state senators who voted against the bill from office.</p><p>“I am very disappointed that a small group of misguided State Senators have partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity,” Governor Braun <a href=\"https://x.com/GovBraun/status/1999234066680512867\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media, calling it a decision to “reject the leadership of President Trump”.</p><p>“Ultimately, decisions like this carry political consequences. I will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Eight have died before charges could be brought, and 32 people have evaded the court’s arrest.</p><p>The court claims 13 convictions so far, and four acquittals.</p><p>Thursday’s vote came, in part, as a reaction to a recent decision by the court to close an office in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas.</p><p>The office was established in 2024 to help with the probe into crimes against humanity.</p><p>But the ICC announced it would close the bureau on December 1, with prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang telling an assembly of state parties that achieving “real progress” in the investigation had been a “challenge”.</p><p>“Being aware of the need to manage our limited resources effectively, we have decided to close our office in Caracas,” he said.</p><p>Venezuela’s Ministry of Foreign Relations quickly responded in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/embaveneztunez/photos/d41d8cd9/885078500510700/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, denouncing the office’s closure.</p><p>“Regrettably, the ICC Prosecutor’s Office showed not the slightest commitment or spirit of cooperation,” its statement said.</p><p>“Its agenda in the country was very clear: to disengage and do nothing in order to later instrumentalise justice for political ends.”</p><p>The 2023 investigation remains ongoing, with renewed attention on Maduro after a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/26/venezuela-election-results-who-lost-won-and-what-next\">contested 2024 presidential election</a> prompted a <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/much-more-persecution-venezuela-braces-for-nicolas-maduros-inauguration\">violent government response</a> against protesters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Zelenskyy said the main issues of contention were control of the Donetsk region in the Donbas, and future governance of the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-situation-critical-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant\">Zaporizhzhia</a> nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control.</p><p>Zelenskyy pushed back against the idea of a unilateral withdrawal of troops from the Donetsk, where Ukraine controls one-fifth of the territory. “Why doesn’t the other side of the war pull back the same distance in the other direction?” he said, adding there were “a great many questions” still unresolved.</p><p>After talks on Thursday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Ukrainian president said that security guarantees were “among the most critical elements for all subsequent steps.</p><p>The document on security guarantees would, he said, have to provide “concrete answers” on actions that would be taken if “Russia decides to launch its aggression again”.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"conflict-is-at-our-door\">‘Conflict is at our door’</h2><p>On Thursday, NATO chief Mark Rutte warned that Russia could be ready to use military force against the alliance within five years, urging members to “rapidly increase defence spending and production”.</p><p>“Conflict is at our door,” he said in a speech in Berlin. “We are Russia’s next target. I fear that too many are quietly complacent. Too many don’t feel the urgency. And too many believe that time is on our side. It is not. The time for action is now.”</p><p>In other developments, Ukraine’s allies in the so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/zelenskyy-rallies-key-allies-as-ukraine-faces-russian-and-us-pressure\">Coalition of the Willing</a> discussed progress on mobilising <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine\">frozen Russian sovereign assets</a> during a virtual meeting on Thursday, according to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office.</p><p>The European Commission is pushing to tap some 200 billion euros ($232bn) of Russian central bank assets immobilised in the bloc after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to provide Kyiv with much-needed funding.</p><p>The sanctions freezing the Russian funds currently require unanimous renewal twice a year, leaving them vulnerable to a veto from Hungary, the EU country closest to Russia.</p><p>But a majority of ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 nations agreed on Thursday on a way of keeping Russian funds frozen as long as required without the need for renewal every six months.</p><p>The idea, which still needs formal approval by the finance ministers meeting on Friday, is not a done deal. Belgium, which, as the home of Euroclear – the organisation holding most of the funds, fears legal or financial retribution from Moscow.</p><p>Trump has largely sought to sideline <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/ukraines-allies-say-efforts-to-end-russias-war-at-critical-moment\">European nations</a> from the peace process, preferring to deal directly with Moscow and Kyiv in shuttle diplomacy led by special envoy Witkoff and, lately, his son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>On Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met Rutte in Berlin, said further talks with the Americans were planned this weekend, and an international meeting on Ukraine could happen at the start of next week.</p><p class=\"p2\">Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine said Merz and Rutte “agreed that Ukraine was closer to a ceasefire than has ever been”.</p><p class=\"p2\">“They also agreed that any territorial concessions to be made by Ukraine must be approved by Kyiv, and that in any peace negotiations moving forward, that European leaders must be involved,” she said.</p><p>The White House said Trump would send a representative to talks in Europe this weekend if there was a real chance of signing a peace agreement.</p><p>Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US president was “extremely frustrated with both sides” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"russia-claims-to-hold-strategic-initiative\">Russia claims to hold ‘strategic initiative’</h2><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to portray himself as negotiating from a position of strength, claimed on Thursday in a call with military leaders that Russian armed forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” on the battlefield.</p><p>In 2022, Russia claimed to formally annex the Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, despite not having full control over them. Putin has said that Moscow is ready to fight on to seize the land it claims if Kyiv does not give it up.</p><p>Lieutenant General Sergei Medvedev told Putin on Thursday that troops had taken the city of Siversk in the Donetsk region, where fighting has been fierce in recent months.</p><p>The claim was denied by the Ukrainian military’s Operation Task Force East unit, which said Russia was “trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavourable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches”.</p><p>The task force also said Ukrainian forces were holding the northern districts of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/ukraine-reports-large-russian-mechanised-assault-in-battle-for-pokrovsk\">Pokrovsk</a>, a key former logistics hub in Donetsk that Russian commanders said came under Moscow’s control last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian long-range drones hit a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea belonging to Russian oil company Lukoil, according to a report by The Associated Press, citing an anonymous official in the Security Service of Ukraine.</p><p>The rig reportedly took four hits, halting the extraction of oil and gas from more than 20 wells, according to the official. Russian officials and Lukoil made no immediate comment.</p><p>Ukraine also launched one of its biggest drone attacks of the war overnight, halting flights in and out of all four Moscow airports for seven hours.</p><p>Zelenskyy told the Coalition of the Willing meeting that a ceasefire was needed for elections to be held in Ukraine. The leader, whose term expired last year, is facing renewed pressure from Trump to hold a vote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Netflix’s move came with widespread antitrust concern, with progressives like Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren saying it would limit access for consumers and filmmakers in Hollywood. The White House also said it would watch the deal with heavy scrutiny.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery, however, was undercut by a slew of conflicts of interest and connections to the administration of United States President Donald Trump, and accompanying concerns about freedom of expression.</p><p>Those come in addition to recent changes at CBS News, where a conservative opinion writer has been brought in as the top boss, and there is pressure on coverage critical of Trump, including by late-night show hosts.</p><h2 id=\"kushner-conflict\">Kushner conflict</h2><p>One of the sources of funds for Paramount’s bid is Jared Kushner’s investment firm Affinity Partners, alongside financing from both Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds. Kushner is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and served in an advisory role during the first Trump administration.</p><p>“If you were teaching a class at business school on conflicts of interest, this would be Exhibit A,” Nell Minow, chair of Portland, Maine-based ValueEdge Advisors, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Trump on Monday told reporters that neither Paramount nor Netflix “are friends of mine” and that he had not spoken to Kushner about the deal.</p><p>However, just last week, Trump told reporters that he would be involved in the decision about whether the Warner Bros-Netflix merger was to go through.</p><p>“I’ll be involved in that decision,” Trump told reporters as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for its annual awards show.</p><p>The Kushner connection is far from the only conflict looming over the hostile takeover. Paramount is now owned and led by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder and a close ally of the president.</p><h2 id=\"pressing-the-press\">Pressing the press</h2><p>In the weeks before Paramount’s merger with Skydance, its CBS News network settled a lawsuit brought by Trump over an interview with then Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been doctored.</p><p>The network described the allegations as baseless, but settled anyway for $16m. On the heels of that decision, Bill Owens, the executive producer of the show 60 Minutes that had been at the heart of Trump’s attacks, resigned. National Public Radio, citing two CBS staffers, said that Owens had “lost independence from corporate”.</p><p>Days later, late-night host Stephen Colbert, also on CBS, called the settlement a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bribe</a>”, and soon after the company announced that The Late Show, which he has hosted since 2015, would be cancelled in 2026.</p><p>Although the show was losing money, the timing of the decision to cut it was widely viewed as political.</p><p>Paramount’s merger with Skydance was approved a few weeks later. Since then, CBS News – which the president has long accused of being unfair to him – has made decisions that, critics say, are increasingly aligned with Trump’s preferences.</p><p>Among them was the appointment of ombudsman Ken Weinstein, tasked with overseeing fairness and adjudicating bias allegations. His appointment itself has been viewed as partisan. Weinstein was once a nominee to be the ambassador to Japan during Trump’s first term and has no media background.</p><p>In October, Paramount purchased The Free Press, a right-leaning publication, for $150m and installed its founder, Bari Weiss, as CBS’s editor-in-chief even though she had no prior TV experience.</p><p>“They hired an opinion columnist, Bari Weiss, to run a news network, paying enough for her services, [money they could have used] to retain plenty of the journalists they laid off. Not because running a successful Substack somehow qualifies her to manage a broadcast news giant, but because her politics are aligned with their own and, to a large degree, Trump’s,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Since her appointment, prominent anchors and producers have resigned. Claudia Milne, who oversaw standards and practices, and John Dickerson, co-anchor of the CBS Evening News, who has been with the network since 2009, both said they were leaving, as did the show’s other anchor, Maurice DuBois.</p><p>On Wednesday, CBS News announced that Tony Dokoupil would anchor the flagship evening news programme. Dokoupil has been serving as a co-anchor for CBS Mornings and joined the network in 2016.</p><p>In August, Margaret Brennan, moderator for another prominent CBS show, Face the Nation, a Sunday public affairs programme, interviewed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The interview was edited, a standard practice given time constraints. The administration complained, and the network changed its policy.</p><p>But that directive wasn’t the case for 60 Minutes. In October, longtime CBS News talent Norah O’Donnell asked the president about his pardoning of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. In 2023, Zhao had pleaded guilty to money laundering but now had business dealings connected with the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.</p><p>The network opted not to run that part of the segment, which Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1985230247093047608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a> was comparable to the very same allegation Trump made against the Harris interview of being “doctored”.</p><p>The network also cut the president’s remarks about the settlement.</p><p>“Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen in a transcript</a> of the full 73-minute interview that was published online.</p><p>The network complied with the president’s request. It did not air that part of the interview.</p><p>The president continues pressuring the network, while simultaneously praising the new management’s apparent friendliness.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After 60 Minutes aired an interview with outgoing Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – who has recently become more critical of the president – Trump erupted on social media.</p><p>“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor; it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!” he wrote on Truth Social.</p><h2 id=\"political-manoeuvring\">‘Political manoeuvring’</h2><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery includes CNN, another major news network.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that David Ellison, on a trip to the White House, told the president that Paramount would make “sweeping changes” to CNN, a frequent focus of Trump’s anger, if the merger were to go through.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump weighed in on the possible sale, saying, “I think CNN should be sold.”</p><p>On CNBC, David Ellison floated the idea of merging the networks and their respective newsgathering operations.</p><p>“We want to build a scaled news service that is basically, fundamentally, in the trust business, that is in the truth business, and that speaks to the 70 percent of Americans that are in the middle,” Ellison told the network’s David Faber.</p><p>But media experts are wary of such a move.</p><p>“It’s fair to say that a Netflix purchase of Warner Brothers would raise legitimate antitrust questions. However, the alleged political manoeuvring by Paramount to bring CNN and CBS under the same corporate roof – with implicit pledges to make both outlets’ news coverage more friendly to this administration – is even more concerning,” Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This would constitute a dramatic increase in the concentration of news media under the control of a single owner with close ties to the party in power. It’s a choice between two bad options, but as currently structured, a Paramount purchase would be objectively worse for American democracy and freedom of the press.”</p><p>The Guardian also reported that Larry Ellison even floated cutting anchors critical of the president, including Erin Burnett, who hosts a primetime show on the cable network. The elder Ellison is not directly involved with Paramount-Skydance.</p><p>“Throwing out the credibility of CNN and other WBD [Warner Bros Discovery] holdings might benefit the Ellisons in their efforts to curry favour with Trump, but it’s not going to benefit anyone else, including shareholders, in the long run,” Stern added.</p><p>Neither Paramount-Skydance nor Warner Bros responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>If Netflix ends up as the buyer instead, CNN would not face similar concerns. The focus would shift to the merger’s potential impact on the film and TV production industry, particularly fears that it could limit competition.</p><p>Netflix has shown no interest in acquiring CNN or other legacy cable properties such as TNT and TBS. Those would instead be spun off into a standalone company called Discovery Global.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the legislation failed to attract enough Republicans and fell short of the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance.</p><p>All Democrats voted for the bill alongside four Republicans: Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, as well as Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>Without the subsidies, premiums could more than double in cost on average, according to KFF, a health policy organisation.</p><p>For some, like Nicole Sheaff, a mother of four in New Hampshire, her prices would quintuple.</p><p>“I’m terrified we won’t be able to keep up with our mortgage. At the same time, going without health insurance is not an option. My husband has a chronic condition that he needs medication to manage, and he wouldn’t be able to afford it without health coverage. He’s lost family members to the same condition, and we simply can’t take that risk,” Sheaff said in testimony in front of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee earlier this month.</p><h2 id=\"republican-bill-fails-as-well\">Republican bill fails as well</h2><p>A Republican-led proposal earlier in the day also failed to pass. The measure would have sent up to $1,500 to those making less than 700 percent of the federal poverty line, which would be $110,000 for a single person and $225,000 for a family of four.</p><p>The payments are intended to help cover out-of-pocket costs for “Bronze” or “Catastrophic” plans on the healthcare marketplace to help meet the threshold they need to pay before their insurance kicks in.</p><p>The funds come with limitations that Democrats have long objected to, including verification of citizenship status and that the funds could not be used for abortion or gender transition treatment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>All Democrats voted against the measure and were joined by Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p><p>The proposed funds are far below the plans’ deductibles, meaning that even after that payment, a patient would be on the hook for up to $7,500 in out-of-pocket medical expenses before their insurance would start to pay for part of their care.</p><p>Those costs can rack up quickly for people with lower-cost plans, with a visit to a US emergency room costing between $1,000 and $3,000, while an ambulance ride can cost anywhere from $500 to more than $3,500.</p><p>Underscored by higher costs in food and housing, Felicia Burnett, national director for health care for MomsRising, a family advocacy organisation, said the families around the country are running out of ways to cut costs and higher healthcare bills only further the strain.</p><p>“The thing that I’m hearing, honestly, is fear. Families have reached the end of what they’re able to cut, and they’re fearful about their future. They don’t know what to expect when they’re not able to afford to go to the doctor or get the care that they need,” Burnett told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Families are going to be having to make really difficult choices between receiving treatment for their ongoing health issues or buying prescriptions and affording their other basic needs like food and housing.”</p><h2 id=\"americans-back-subsidy-continuation\">Americans back subsidy continuation</h2><p>Approximately 2.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance premium subsidies if they are not extended, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving low- and middle-income families struggling to maintain coverage.</p><p>A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans back a healthcare subsidy continuation. Some 51 percent of respondents — including three-quarters of Democrats and a third of Republicans — said they support extending the subsidies. Only 21 percent said they were opposed.</p><p>Insurance companies have warned customers of the rising premiums in the new year, and Democrats argue there is not enough time to do anything but a clean extension of the tax credits. Congress is set to leave Washington at the end of this week and will not return until January 5.</p><p>With more people forgoing insurance altogether because of the cost, experts like Dr Bruce Y Lee, professor of public health at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health, says there will be additional strains on emergency rooms, which have an obligation to treat people with or without a way to pay for care.</p><p>“Flooding the emergency room with patients at different stages of conditions delays care for those who truly need it. Emergency rooms already have long waits, and this only clogs them further, affecting everyone, even those with insurance, because instead of seeing 10 people, the staff might be handling 50.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
