This was the third attempt on his life, according to Israeli media, which reported that the two prior attempts occurred during last year’s war with Israel, which <a href=\"/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know\">culminated in a United States-brokered ceasefire</a> in November 2024.</p><p>Israel has since been accused of violating that ceasefire on a near-daily basis by United Nations experts. Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s continued attacks <a href=\"/news/2024/12/2/israeli-attacks-kill-two-people-in-lebanon-hezbollah-responds\">once</a>, in December.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai\">Who was Haytham Ali Tabatabai?</h2><p>Before the attack, Tabatabai’s name was not widely known in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s military operatives tend to work in the shadows to avoid Israeli assassinations.</p><p>But since his death on Sunday, it has been revealed that Tabatabai held many senior positions within the armed political group during his tenure.</p><p>He was born in 1968 in Bashoura, a neighbourhood in Beirut, to Lebanese parents although his father reportedly had Iranian roots. He grew up in southern Lebanon and reportedly joined Hezbollah in the 1980s.</p><p>In its official announcement, Hezbollah said Tabatabai had been part of the group since <a href=\"/news/2023/10/10/what-is-hezbollah-a-look-at-the-lebanese-armed-group-backing-hamas\">its founding in 1982</a> as a resistance movement against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In the post-war period, Hezbollah grew to become Lebanon’s strongest political party and military force, serving in Lebanon’s parliament and having ministers in several governments.</p><p>Tabatabai was a senior military official in Hezbollah with extensive military experience. He reportedly took part in a number of field operations in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon and led Hezbollah’s Nabatieh axis, or command area, from 1996 until Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.</p><p>According to Hezbollah, Tabatabai then led the Khiam axis from 2000 until 2008 and was in command during the July 2006 war, which saw Israel and Hezbollah fight to a draw after 34 days. The group also said Tabatabai participated in establishing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Later, he was responsible for Hezbollah’s operations along the border with Syria and took over responsibilities for the operations branch during <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">last year’s war with Israel</a>.</p><p>According to Israeli media reports, Tabatabai led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in Syria and Yemen before replacing Ali Karaki, who was assassinated during last year’s war, as commander of Hezbollah’s southern front.</p><p>He was appointed as Hezbollah’s chief of staff after the war, in which most of Hezbollah’s senior military leaders were killed by Israel.</p><p>“Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks,” Sohaib Jawhar, a nonresident fellow at the Beirut-based Badil, the Alternative Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-hezbollah-said-about-his-death\">What has Hezbollah said about his death?</h2><p>In its statement, Hezbollah confirmed the loss of “the great martyr jihadist commander” known as Sayyid Abu Ali and described Israel’s assassination as a “treacherous attack on the Haret Hreik area in the suburbs of Beirut”.</p><p>Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of the group’s Political Council, lamented “yet another ceasefire violation” and accused Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.</p><p>Hezbollah released a compilation video showing footage of Tabatabai operating in the field.</p><p>It also confirmed the deaths of four other Hezbollah members: Qassem Hussein Berjawi, Rifaat Ahmad Hussein, Mostafa Asaad Berro and Ibrahim Ali Hussein.</p><p>Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar accused Israel of again violating the ceasefire.</p><p>“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty and the security of its citizens,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-lebanese-state-said\">What has the Lebanese state said?</h2><p>Just two days before the attack, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun announced the government’s intention to enter peace <a href=\"/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks\">negotiations with Israel</a> with support from the international community.</p><p>After the attack on Sunday, however, Aoun called on the international community to intervene to stop Israeli attacks on his country.</p><p>Frustration has been building in parts of Lebanon as some locals feel the government is not properly equipped or willing to respond to Israel’s repeated aggressions. Many residents in southern Lebanon have expressed feelings of abandonment by the Lebanese government because it has been unable to prevent repeated Israeli attacks or rebuild destroyed homes.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-israel-said\">What has Israel said?</h2><p>After Sunday’s strike, Israel said it “remains committed to the understandings agreed upon between the State of Israel and Lebanon”, likely referring to the existing ceasefire.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had been ordered after recommendations from the defence minister and the Israeli army’s chief of staff, and he justified it by accusing Tabatabai of posing a threat to Israeli security.</p><p>The Israeli army released a statement, saying: “Tabatabai commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked extensively to restore their readiness for war with Israel. The [Israeli military] will act against attempts to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah and will operate forcefully to remove any threat against Israel.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"was-the-us-aware-of-the-attack-beforehand\">Was the US aware of the attack beforehand?</h2><p>According to the US news website Axios, US officials were aware that an “escalation” was expected but were not informed of the details of this particular strike. An official told Axios the US had been informed by Israel’s government directly after the strike.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-now\">What happens now?</h2><p>Qmati said Israel’s strike had crossed a “red line” and the group’s leadership would now consider whether a response was warranted.</p><p>“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Google and LinkedIn offer users ways to opt out of the AI features, while Meta’s AI tool provides no means for its users to say “no, thanks.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Gmail just flipped a dangerous switch on October 10, 2025 and 99% of Gmail users have no idea,” a November 8 Instagram post said.</p><p>Posts warned that the platforms’ AI tool rollouts make most private information available for tech company <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/30/how-generative-ai-is-affecting-peoples-minds\">harvesting</a>. “Every conversation, every photo, every voice message, fed into AI and used for profit,” a November 9 X video about Meta said.</p><p></p><p>Technology companies are rarely fully transparent when it comes to the user data they collect and what they use it for, Krystyna Sikora, a research analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, told PolitiFact.</p><p>“Unsurprisingly, this lack of transparency can create significant confusion that in turn can lead to fear mongering and the spread of false information about what is and is not permissible,” Sikora said.</p><p>The best – if tedious – way for people to know and protect their privacy rights is to read the terms and conditions, since it often explicitly outlines how the data will be used and whether it will be shared with <a href=\"/news/2025/1/7/social-media-giant-meta-scraps-fact-checking-for-community-notes\">third parties</a>, Sikora said. The US doesn’t have any comprehensive federal laws on data <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/eu-moves-to-ease-ai-privacy-rules-amid-pressure-from-big-tech-trump\">privacy</a> for technology companies.</p><p>Here’s what we learned about how each platform’s AI is handling your data:</p><p><strong>Social media claim: </strong>“Starting December 16th Meta will start reading your DMs, every conversation, every photo, every voice message fed into AI and used for profit.” – November 9 X post with 1.6 million views as of November 19.</p><p><strong>The facts:</strong> Meta announced a new policy to take effect December 16, but that policy alone does not result in your direct messages, photos and voice messages being fed into its AI tool. The policy involves how Meta will customise users’ content and advertisements based on how they interact with Meta AI.</p><p>For example, if a user interacts with Meta’s AI chatbot about hiking, Meta might start showing that person recommendations for hiking groups or hiking boots.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean your data isn’t being used for AI purposes. Although Meta doesn’t use people’s private messages in Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger to train its AI, it does collect user content that is set to “public” mode. This can include photos, posts, comments and reels. If the user’s Meta AI conversations involve religious views, sexual orientation and racial or ethnic origin, Meta says the system is designed to avoid parlaying these interactions into ads. If users ask questions of Meta AI using its voice feature, Meta says the AI tool will use the microphone only when users give <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/us-judge-allows-company-to-train-ai-using-copyrighted-literary-materials\">permission</a>.</p><p>There is a caveat: The tech company says its AI might use information about people who don’t have Meta product accounts if their information appears in other users’ public posts. For example, if a Meta user mentions a non-user in a public image caption, that photo and caption could be used to train Meta AI.</p><p><strong>Can you opt out?</strong> No. If you are using Meta platforms in these ways – making some of your posts public and using the chatbot – your data could be used by Meta AI. There is no way to deactivate Meta AI in Instagram, Facebook or Threads. WhatsApp users can deactivate the option to talk with Meta AI in their chats, but this option is available only per chat, meaning that you must deactivate the option in each chat’s advanced privacy settings.</p><p>The X post inaccurately advised people to submit this form to opt out. But the form is simply a way for users to report when Meta’s AI supplies an answer that contains someone’s personal information.</p><p>David Evan Harris, who teaches AI ethics at the University of California, Berkeley, told PolitiFact that because the US has no federal regulations about privacy and AI training, people have no standardised legal right to opt out of AI training in the way that people in countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and South Korea do.</p><p>Even when social media platforms provide opt-out options for US customers, it’s often difficult to find the settings to do so, Harris said.</p><p>Deleting your Meta accounts does not eliminate the possibility of Meta AI using your past public data, Meta’s spokesperson said.</p><h2 id=\"google\">Google</h2><p><strong>Social media claim:</strong> “Did you know Google just gave its AI access to read every email in your Gmail – even your attachments?”  – November 8 Instagram post with more than 146,000 likes as of November 19.</p><p><strong>The facts:</strong> Google has a host of products that interact with private data in different ways. Google announced on November 5 that its AI product, Gemini Deep Research, can connect to users’ other Google products, including Gmail, Drive and Chat. But, as Forbes reported, users must first give permission to employ the tool.</p><p>Users who want to allow Gemini Deep Research to have access to private information across products can choose what data sources to employ, including Google search, Gmail, Drive and Google Chat.</p><p>There are other ways <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/22/conservative-activist-sues-google-over-ai-generated-statements\">Google</a> collects people’s data:</p><ul>\n<li>Through searches and prompts in Gemini apps, including its mobile app, Gemini in Chrome or Gemini in another web browser</li>\n<li>Any video or photo uploads that the user entered into Gemini</li>\n<li>Through interactions with apps such as YouTube and Spotify, if users give permission</li>\n<li>Through message and phone calls apps, including call logs and message logs, if users give permission.</li>\n</ul><p>A Google spokesperson told PolitiFact the company doesn’t use this information to train AI when registered users are under age 13.</p><p>Google can also access people’s data when they have smart features activated in their Gmail and Google Workplace settings (that are automatically on in the US), which gives Google consent to draw on email content and user activity data to help users compose emails or suggest Google Calendar events. With optional paid subscriptions, users can access additional AI features, including in-app Gemini summaries.</p><p>Turning off Gmail’s smart features can stop Google’s AI from accessing Gmail, but it doesn’t stop Google’s access to the Gemini app, which users can either download or access in a browser.</p><p>A California lawsuit accuses Gemini of spying on users’ private communications. The lawsuit says an October policy change gives Gemini default access to private content such as emails and attachments in people’s Gmail, Chat and Meet. Before October, users had to manually allow Gemini to access the private content; now, users must go into their privacy settings to disable it. The lawsuit claims the Google policy update violates California’s 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, a law that prohibits unauthorised wiretapping and recording confidential communications without <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/us-judge-allows-company-to-train-ai-using-copyrighted-literary-materials\">consent</a>.</p><p><strong>Can you opt out? </strong>If people don’t want their conversations used to train <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/5/chk_google-drops-pledge-not-to-use-ai-for-weapons-surveillance\">Google AI</a>, they can use “temporary” chats or chat without signing into their Gemini accounts. Doing that means Gemini can’t save a person’s chat history, a Google spokesperson said. Otherwise, opting out of having Google’s AI in Gmail, Drive and Meet requires turning off smart features in settings.</p><h2 id=\"linkedin\">LinkedIn</h2><p><strong>Social media claim:</strong> Starting November 3, “LinkedIn will begin using your data to train AI.” – November 2 Instagram post with more than 18,000 likes as of November 19.</p><p><strong>The facts:</strong> LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft, announced on its website that starting November 3, it will use some US members’ data to train content-generating AI models.</p><p>The data the AI collects includes details from people’s profiles and public content that users post.</p><p>The training does not draw on information from people’s private messages, LinkedIn said.</p><p>LinkedIn also said, aside from the AI data access, that Microsoft started receiving information about LinkedIn members – such as profile information, feed activity and ad engagement – as of November 3 in order to target users with personalised ads.</p><p><strong>Can you opt out? </strong>Yes. Autumn Cobb, a LinkedIn spokesperson, confirmed to PolitiFact that members can opt out if they don’t want their content used for AI training purposes. They can also opt out of receiving targeted, <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/25/meta-to-suspend-political-advertising-in-the-eu-as-transparency-law-looms\">personalised ads</a>.</p><p>To remove your data from being used for training purposes, go to data privacy, click on the option that says “Data for Generative AI Improvement” and then turn off the feature that says “use my data for training content creation AI models.”</p><p>And to opt out of personalised ads, go to advertising data in settings, and turn off ads on LinkedIn and the option that says “data sharing with our affiliates and select partners”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>When on October 10, a “ceasefire” was declared in Gaza, many Palestinians breathed a sigh of relief. They had just endured two years of constant bombardment estimated to equal roughly six times the explosive force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, concentrated on an area less than half the size of the Japanese city..</p><p>The devastation was all encompassing. All hospitals and universities had been bombed, most homes and schools destroyed and vital infrastructure, such as the sewage system and electricity lines, had been damaged beyond repair. An estimated <a href=\"/gallery/2025/2/5/gaza-transformed-into-rubble-strewn-wasteland-after-israeli-bombardment\">50 million tonnes of rubble</a> was strewn across the strip and under it lay at least 10,000 bodies of Palestinians killed in bombardments who were yet to be recovered.</p><p>And yet, the respite the people of Gaza expected to finally come never materialised. Almost immediately after the “ceasefire” announcement, the Israeli regime started bombing the strip again. It hasn’t stopped since then.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, Israel has violated the “ceasefire” nearly <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">500 times</a> in 44 days, killing 342 civilians. The deadliest day was on October 29 when the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/live-israel-kills-63-in-gaza-trump-insists-nothing-will-jeopardise-truce\">killed</a> 109 Palestinians, including 52 children. More recently, on Thursday, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/at-least-67-palestinian-children-killed-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-began-un\">32 Palestinians</a> were killed, including an entire family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when a bomb was dropped on a building they were sheltering in.</p><p>But it is not just the bombardment that hasn’t stopped. The starvation hasn’t either.</p><p>As per the “ceasefire” agreement, 600 trucks of aid were supposed to be allowed in every day, which Israel has not fulfilled. As Al Jazeera’s correspondent Hind al-Khoudary has reported from Gaza, the IOF is permitting only <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/unrwa-slams-israel-for-crippling-gaza-efforts-aid-woefully-short-of-needs\">150 trucks a day</a> to cross into the strip. They are also preventing the entry of nutritious foods, including meat, dairy and vegetables, as well as much-needed medicine, tents and other materials for shelter.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">A coalition of Palestinian relief agencies</a> estimated that the aid that enters now doesn’t even cover a quarter of the basic needs of the population.</p><p>The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which says it has enough <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/on-world-food-day-israel-continues-to-restrict-aid-into-gaza\">food</a> in its warehouses to feed everyone in Gaza for months, is still not allowed to bring in any of it. This is in direct contravention of an October advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the Israeli regime has a duty to not impede the supply of aid by UN agencies, including UNRWA.</p><p>The court also rejected Israeli accusations that the agency lacks neutrality and asserted that it is an indispensable actor in the humanitarian landscape. Nonetheless, the Israeli regime has rejected the advisory opinion and continues to limit UNRWA activities by preventing aid distribution and denying visas to its international staff.</p><p>The Israeli regime is also not abiding by the provisional measures that were laid out in an ICJ ruling in January 2024 that found that plausible acts of genocide were being committed in Gaza. These measures included preventing acts of genocide, preventing and punishing incitement to genocide and allowing humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Since then, the court has reaffirmed its provisional measures several times. The Israeli regime continues to ignore them.</p><p>And that is because on the international level, it continues to enjoy unprecedented diplomatic, financial and military cover. The latest iteration of that came on November 17 when the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2803, endorsing United States President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">20-point plan</a> for Gaza.</p><p>Among its provisions is the creation of two bodies that would take control of Gaza: the board of peace, chaired by Trump himself, and the international stabilisation force, tasked with maintaining security and enforcing the disarmament of Palestinian groups. The governing structure of both bodies remains unclear, but they would operate in coordination with the Israeli regime, effectively installing another layer of foreign control over the Palestinian people.</p><p>The resolution also allows for the bypassing of existing local and international structures in the distribution of aid. It <a href=\"https://al-shabaka.org/policy-memos/trumps-unsc-resolution-2803-repackaged-colonial-rule/\">makes no mention of the genocide</a> and does not propose any mechanism for accountability for war crimes. Essentially, the resolution contravenes international law and gives the US – a co-perpetrator of genocide – control over Gaza.</p><p>All of this makes clear the fact that the “ceasefire” is not a ceasefire at all. The Israeli regime continues to attack Gaza, to starve the Palestinian population and to deny it access to proper shelter and healthcare.</p><p>Calling this arrangement a ceasefire allows third states to claim progress on conflict resolution and even peace when the core genocidal reality of the Palestinians on the ground remains largely unchanged. The “ceasefire” is a diplomatic sham – a cover for the continuing extermination, displacement and erasure of the Palestinian people in Gaza and a distraction for the international public and the media.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
