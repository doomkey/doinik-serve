He then headed in an Arda Guler cross two minutes later, and before the Greeks had time to recover from the double strike, the France forward completed his hat-trick with another fine finish.</p><p>The Spaniards hit the woodwork through Aurelien Tchouameni in a strong first half, but the hosts cut the deficit seven minutes after the restart through Mehdi Taremi’s close-range header before Mbappe’s tap-in from yet another Vinicius Jr assist briefly restored order.</p><p>Olympiacos scored again with Ayoub El Kaabi’s 81st-minute header, but despite intense late pressure, they could not find another goal as Real snapped their three-game winless run in all competitions.</p><p>Real climbed to fifth place on 12 points from five games in the league phase table, with the top eight earning automatic qualification for the knockout stage and with three matchdays remaining. Olympiakos are 33rd with two points.</p><h2 id=\"ucl-holders-psg-made-to-work-by-tottenham\">UCL holders PSG made to work by Tottenham</h2><p>Holders Paris St Germain showed a never-say-die attitude as they twice came from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 5-3 in the Champions League, with two moments of brilliance from Vitinha steering Luis Enrique’s side to victory.</p><p>PSG looked fragile at the back, conceding twice from defensive lapses and showing some of the same issues that contributed to their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the previous round, but they responded with greater control and efficiency to turn the match around at the Parc des Princes.</p><p>Vitinha bagged a hat-trick with two fine strikes and a penalty, while Pacho and Fabian Ruiz also scored for PSG, who were made to work after Tottenham twice led through Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani, the France forward finishing with a double.</p><p>After four victories in five games, PSG, who finished with 10 men after Lucas Hernandez was sent off in stoppage time, are second in the league phase standings, on course for direct qualification to the last 16, while Tottenham are 16th on eight points.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has also blamed the media for failing to carry his message.</p><p>“The South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right [sic] Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers,” Trump wrote on Wednesday.</p><p>“To put it more bluntly, they are killing white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.

Not only did Trump refuse to attend, but he also declined to send any top officials from Washington, DC, to the event.</p><p>“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115510666739916664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on November 7.</p><p>“No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”</p><p>The G20 has traditionally been a meeting ground for leaders from the European Union, the African Union and other major world economies to discuss technology, environmental initiatives and shared financial growth.</p><p>Next year, the summit is scheduled to take place in Miami. Traditionally, the host of the G20 summit closes the meeting by banging a gavel and then passing the little wooden hammer to officials from the next country to hold the meeting.</p><p>But on Sunday, Ramaphosa did not pass the gavel to anyone.</p><p>Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he had offered to send a member of the US Embassy to accept the gavel, but that the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/s-africa-says-g20-shared-goals-outweigh-differences-as-it-concludes-summit\">offer had been rejected</a> by Ramaphosa’s administration as a slight.</p><p>“At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-tensions\">Heightened tensions</h2><p>Ramaphosa largely avoided addressing the US absence during the G20 conference, instead underscoring his push for global unity and efforts to combat inequality.</p><p>“Our G20 Presidency has been rooted in the conviction that the world needs more solidarity, equality and sustainability,” Ramaphosa <a href=\"https://x.com/CyrilRamaphosa/status/1993281148852560015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“While some have sought to create division and polarisation between nations, we have reinforced our shared humanity. We have fostered collaboration and goodwill. Above all, we have affirmed that our shared goals outweigh our differences.”</p><p>The increasingly hostile relations between South Africa and the US began early in Trump’s second term as president.</p><p>On February 7, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/addressing-egregious-actions-of-the-republic-of-south-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> an executive action denouncing South Africa for alleged human rights abuses against white Afrikaners and saying that all aid and assistance to the country would stop.</p><p>As of fiscal year 2023, US assistance to South Africa totalled approximately $441.3m, according to government statistics. In fiscal year 2024, which is only partially reported at present, the total rose to approximately $581m.</p><p>In February’s order, Trump also directed US government agencies to assist in the resettlement of Afrikaners as “refugees” in the US.</p><p>He doubled down on that call in late October, when he set the lowest cap on refugee admissions in US history.</p><p>Of the 7,500 available refugee slots, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">called for the majority to be</a> “allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and other “victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.</p><p>In May, Trump also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">hosted Ramaphosa at the White House</a>, where he attempted to confront the South African leader with accusations of genocide in his country. Some critics have compared the meeting to an “ambush”.</p><p>Ramaphosa, for his part, has repeatedly denied the accusations. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trumps-us-boycott-of-g20-summit-is-their-loss-south-africa-says\">When asked by reporters</a> about the US boycotting the G20 this year, he said bluntly, “Their absence is their loss.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he later retracted that statement, saying that he had received “conflicting reports” about the situation.</p><p>In an earlier post, he pledged to pursue accountability against the attacker. “These brave West Virginians lost their lives in the service of their country,” he wrote. “West Virginia will never forget their service or their sacrifice, and we will demand full accountability for this horrific act.”</p><p>US President <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/georgia-judge-drops-election-interference-case-against-trump\">Donald Trump</a> quickly responded, pledging on his online platform Truth Social that the perpetrator would pay a “very steep price”.</p><p>Trump later shared a video address from his Mar-a-Lago residence, in Florida, where he said that his administration would begin measures to remove foreigners who do “not belong here”, after saying the Department of Homeland Security was “confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”.</p><p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) said it is ending the “processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals” pending review of “security and vetting protocols”.</p><p>US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth also quickly responded to the attack, saying that Trump had requested the deployment of 500 more National Guards to the US capital.</p><p>“This happened just steps from the White House and it will not stand and that’s why President Trump has asked me, and I will ask the secretary of the Army to the National Guard, to add 500 additional troops, National Guardsmen, to Washington, DC,” Hegseth said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"atter-of-national-security\">‘Matter of national security’</h2><p>Trump was not at the White House at the time of the shooting.

The residency requirement will rise from three to five years, and long-term recipients of certain social welfare benefits will be ineligible.</p><p>The government will also have the power to revoke a person’s asylum status if they are found to be a “danger to the security of the state” or convicted of a serious crime, said O’Callaghan.</p><p>“While these situations are rare, it is important that these powers are provided for in law,” he said.</p><p>He added that the government was also considering restrictions on student visas, amid concerns that some education routes are being misused for long-term residency.</p><p>The new rules echo sweeping <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/uks-sweeping-asylum-law-changes-how-will-they-impact-refugees\">recent asylum law changes</a> in the United Kingdom, where rising concern about immigration levels has fuelled support for the far-right Reform party.</p><p>Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said his government needed to consider the impact on migration flows into Ireland of the reforms in the UK.</p><p>“There are knock-on effects for us from what others do, that’s the reality we have to be ready for,” he said.</p><p>According to O’Callaghan, nearly 90 percent of those who applied for asylum in Ireland arrived across the border from Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK.</p></div></div></body></html>"
