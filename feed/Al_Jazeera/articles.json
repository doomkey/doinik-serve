But all of Ukraine is tired of war. We want our children to have quiet nights – no drones, no explosions.”</p><p>Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this winter, causing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/psychological-war-on-society-russia-plunges-ukraine-into-darkness\">mass power cuts</a> in the Ukrainian capital, during a <a href=\"/gallery/2026/1/16/photos-residents-of-kyiv-endure-freezing-conditions-due-to-power-outages\">bitter cold snap</a> that has left many residents without electricity and running water.</p><p>But war fatigue had long set in.

Either “Russia, as the aggressor, decides it wants the war to end, or enough pressure is placed on Moscow to force that decision”.</p><p>Neither of those options, he said, is likely to materialise until spring when Russia will have completed this phase of targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during the winter months.</p><p>He said Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to wear people down and sow “domestic chaos” but added that although people are exhausted, Ukraine has repeatedly shown an ability to adapt.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264180\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264180\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264180\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSCF4043-1769327903.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Igor Novikov, former advisor to Volodymyr Zelenskyy sits in his Kyiv office [Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Igor Novikov, former adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, believes Russia is not interested in a peaceful end to the war [Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>The US-brokered meeting in the Gulf state ended without a breakthrough.</p><p>“A lot was discussed, and it is important that the conversations were constructive,” said Zelenskyy, who sent Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov and other officials to the meeting.</p><p>“The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war. I highly value the understanding of the need for American monitoring and oversight of the process of ending the war and ensuring genuine security.”</p><p>He said further meetings could take place in the coming days, “provided there is readiness to move forward”.</p><p>Before the second day of talks, Russia sent more than 100 drones towards Kyiv along with missiles in an attack that lasted throughout the night, forcing people to venture out in pitch darkness to seek shelter in the metro system.</p><h2 id=\"i-have-decided-to-go-to-the-front-line\">‘I have decided to go to the front line’</h2><p>Maksym Fomin, a 20-year-old barman who is preparing to fight for Ukraine, said that when the war began, everything felt frightening.

I want my child to be safe. I want to be able to take the lift to our 23rd-floor apartment, to swim in the Black Sea again,” she said. “But I also cannot accept giving up land that so many people died defending.

Pretti moves between the agent and the women, then raises his left arm to shield himself as the agent pepper-sprays him.</p><p>Several agents then take ‍hold of Pretti – who struggles with them – and force him onto his hands and knees. As the agents pin down Pretti, someone shouts what sounds like a warning about the presence of a gun. Video footage then appears to show one of the agents removing a gun from Pretti and stepping away from the group with it.</p><p>Moments later, an officer points his handgun at Pretti’s back and fires four shots at him in quick succession. Several more shots ‍are then heard as another agent also appears to fire at Pretti.</p><p>The agents initially all back away from Pretti’s body on the road. Some agents then seem to offer medical assistance to Pretti as he lies on the ground, as other agents keep bystanders back.</p><p>Meanwhile, two witnesses who immediately filed sworn statements before the US District Court of Minnesota said Pretti did not brandish a gun during the incident. According to the court documents, one of the witnesses, a doctor, said Pretti sustained at least three gunshot wounds in his back.</p><p>Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara later said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.</p><h2 id=\"who-was-alex-pretti\">Who was Alex Pretti?</h2><p>Family members described Pretti as a compassionate and dedicated healthcare worker who had been angered by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>Pretti was working as an intensive care nurse at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis at the time of his death.</p><p>“We are heartbroken, but also very angry. Alex was a kind soul who cared deeply for his family and friends, and also the American veterans who he cared for as an ICU nurse,” his parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, said in a statement released to the media.</p><p>Michael Pretti told The Associated Press news agency that his son “was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States” with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and had taken part in the protests against the immigration raids.</p><p>“He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>By any measure, Gaza’s devastation demands urgent and serious reconstruction. Homes, hospitals, schools, farms, cultural heritage, and basic infrastructure lie in ruins. Entire neighbourhoods have been erased. The humanitarian need is undeniable. But urgency should never become an excuse for illusion, spectacle, or political shortcuts.</p><p>The contrast between rhetoric and reality could not be sharper. While United States President Donald Trump and a group of world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, to sign the charter of the so-called Board of Peace and unveil glossy reconstruction plans, the killing in Gaza continued.</p><p>Since the ceasefire came into effect on October 10, no fewer than 480 Palestinians have been killed. Four of them <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/22/live-trump-to-lead-signing-of-charter-for-gaza-board-of-peace-in-davos\">were killed</a> on the very day the charter was signed by 19 ministers and state representatives, many of whom were less interested in the issue of Gaza and much more in being seen alongside Trump.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the board’s carefully staged optimism feels like performance rather than transformation. It resembles a sandpit where those signing up get to build sandcastles with Trump that will wash away with the first real wave.</p><p>The proposals may look impressive and sound hopeful, but structurally, they are hollow. They sidestep the real drivers of the conflict, marginalise Palestinian agency, privilege Israeli military priorities over civilian recovery, and align uncomfortably with longstanding efforts to maintain the occupation, displace Palestinians, and deny the right of return for the population uprooted in 1948 and 1967.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-is-not-a-real-estate-prospectus\">Gaza is not a real estate prospectus</h2><p>The glossy vision of presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner treats Gaza not as a traumatised society emerging from catastrophic violence, but as a blank investment canvas for luxury housing, commercial zones, data hubs, beachfront promenades, and aspirational gross domestic product (GDP) targets.</p><p>It reads less like a recovery plan and more like a real-estate prospectus. Development language replaces political reality. Sleek presentations replace rights. Markets replace justice.</p><p>But Gaza is not a failed start-up looking for venture capital. It is home to more than two million Palestinians who have endured siege, displacement, repeated wars, and chronic insecurity for decades. Reconstruction cannot succeed if it is detached from their lived experiences or if it treats Gaza primarily as an economic asset open to speculative investment, including by extreme Zionists, rather than as a human community struggling to preserve its identity and social fabric.</p><p>For many families, even modest homes in Gaza’s formal refugee camps represented a fragile bridge worth holding on to as a step towards an eventual return to places from which they were forced to flee, in what is today known as Israel.</p><p>These homes were valued not for their comfort or market worth, but for the social networks they sustained and their symbolic links to continuity, memory, and political claims. Palestinians are therefore unlikely to be swayed by offers of glitzy towers, luxurious villas, or promises of a “market economy” under siege. Their experience over the past decades has taught them that no level of material improvement can substitute for deeper aspirations tied to dignity, rootedness, and the right of return.</p><h2 id=\"a-future-designed-without-palestinians\">A future designed without Palestinians</h2><p>A glaring flaw of Trump’s plan is the systematic exclusion of Palestinians themselves from shaping the vision of their future. These plans are unveiled in elite conference halls, not debated with the people whose neighbourhoods have been flattened.</p><p>Without Palestinian ownership, legitimacy collapses. Experience from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere has shown repeatedly that reconstruction imposed from the outside — however well branded — reproduces the very power imbalances that fuel instability in the first place.</p><p>Equally troubling is the plan’s deliberate avoidance of addressing the root causes of Gaza’s suffering: occupation, blockade, and military control. You cannot rebuild sustainably while continuing to preserve and fund the machinery that repeatedly destroys what is built.</p><p>No amount of concrete, branding, or foreign investment can substitute for political resolution. A territory that remains militarily besieged, economically sealed, and politically subjugated will never achieve durable recovery.</p><p>Prosperity cannot flourish inside a cage. The European Union learned this lesson the hard way through multiple reconstruction cycles it funded in Gaza, which may help explain why none of its members rushed to join the board, despite being able to afford the permanent membership fee and despite the political incentives of cultivating a more cordial relationship with Trump in light of the war in Ukraine and his threats on Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"aiding-israel-s-military-control-through-spatial-redesign\">Aiding Israel’s military control through spatial redesign</h2><p>There is also a serious risk that the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/23/analyst-breaks-down-map-of-trumps-gaza-plan#flips-6388132353112:0\">proposed physical design of Gaza</a> would entrench Israeli military strategy rather than restore Palestinian life. The plans envision buffer zones, segmented districts, and so-called “green spaces and corridors” that would break up the territory internally.</p><p>This kind of spatial engineering would facilitate surveillance, control, and rapid military access. Urban planning would become security architecture. Civilian geography would turn into militarised space. What is sold as modernisation would constitute a sophisticated system of containment, just like the illegal settlement networks and road systems in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The emphasis on reclaiming land from the sea using rubble may repeat the problems of Beirut’s reconstruction after the civil war, where newly reclaimed areas attracted disproportionate investment because they were free of unresolved ownership claims, ultimately allowing elites to appropriate the city’s waterfront and pull it away from public use.</p><p>The demographic implications of the plan are equally profound. Shifting Gaza’s population centre southward — closer to Egypt and further from Israel’s settlements — would quietly alter the political and social centre of gravity of Palestinian life.</p><p>It may ease Israeli security anxieties, but it would do so at the expense of Palestinian continuity, identity, and territorial coherence. Population engineering under the banner of reconstruction raises serious ethical concerns and risks externalising Gaza’s long-term humanitarian burden onto neighbouring states. This may also help explain Egypt’s absence from the signing ceremony and its decision to limit participation to its intelligence leadership.</p><h2 id=\"no-amount-of-political-theatre-can-replace-freedom\">No amount of political theatre can replace freedom</h2><p>The Board of Peace itself also deserves careful scrutiny. Its branding suggests neutrality and collective stewardship, yet its political framing remains highly personalised around Trump, with little clarity about how it is meant to operate in practice.</p><p>This is not the kind of multilateral peacebuilding mechanism envisaged by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803 of November 2025; it is political theatre. Peace mechanisms anchored in personalities rather than institutions and international law rarely survive political change.</p><p>At the heart of all this lies a familiar but dangerous assumption: that economic growth can substitute for political rights. History teaches the opposite. People do not resist simply because they are poor; they resist because they lack dignity, security, freedom of expression, and self-determination. No master plan can bypass these realities. No skyline can compensate for political exclusion.</p><p>This does not mean Gaza must wait for the perfect peace before rebuilding. Recovery must proceed urgently. But rebuilding must empower Palestinians rather than redesign their constraints. It must dismantle systems of control, not embed them into concrete and zoning maps. It must confront the political roots of destruction rather than cosmetically repackage its aftermath.</p><p>Until those foundations exist, the Board of Peace and Kushner’s vision risk becoming exactly what they resemble — a form of sandcastle diplomacy: impressive to the global public, comforting to elites, and destined to wash away when the first serious wave of political reality arrives.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”</p><h2 id=\"pakistan-slams-injustice\">Pakistan slams ‘injustice’</h2><p>While Pakistan are set to play all their T20 World Cup fixtures in Sri Lanka, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi said their participation was still not confirmed.</p><p>“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, said when asked to comment on the ICC’s decision.</p><p>“Our stance [on World Cup participation] will be what the government of Pakistan instructs me,” he said. “It’s the [Pakistan] government’s decision. We obey them, not the ICC.”</p><p>Naqvi said the ICC did an injustice to Bangladesh.</p><p>“You can’t have double standards. You can’t say for one country [India] they can do whatever they want and for the others to have to do the complete opposite,” he said. “That’s why we’ve taken this stand and made clear Bangladesh have had an injustice done to them. They should play in the World Cup; they are a major stakeholder in cricket.”</p><p>Naqvi said if the government blocked Pakistan from playing in the World Cup, “then maybe the ICC will bring in a 22nd team [after Scotland]. It’s up to the government”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She has ignored old boundaries and perceptions of what a man’s work is and started working as a woodcutter to feed her children.</p><p>“Carpentry is hard, … but the axe has become an extension of my hand,” Rasha told Al Jazeera Arabic. “There are no choices left.”</p><p>Her story is not unique. Thousands of Sudanese women have become their families’ sole breadwinners and work under harsh conditions. Rasha’s earnings after a day of back-breaking labour under the sun are often enough to buy only a packet of biscuits.</p><p>She spends the money on food and soap. “You want soap. You want to wash,” she said. “As for clothes, we have given up hope on that.”</p><p>The nearly three-year war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group has had a catastrophic impact on the country and its people.</p><p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than 30 million people from a population of 46.8 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>The population is facing acute food shortages and a nutrition crisis, especially in the Darfur and Kordofan regions in western and central Sudan. At the same time, disease outbreaks are worsening the situation.</p><p>Moreover, Sudan is dealing with the world’s largest displacement crisis with an estimated 13.6 million people forced from their homes by the fighting.</p><h2><strong>Worse than the pandemic</strong></h2><p>The war has also destroyed many aspects of life in Sudan, and it is now threatening the future of generations to come.</p><p>Save the Children <a href=\"https://www.savethechildren.net/news/sudan-children-have-lost-about-500-days-learning-due-war-one-worlds-longest-school-closures\">released</a> a damning report on Thursday confirming that Sudan is enduring one of the longest school closures in the world, surpassing even the worst shutdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>According to the new analysis released before the International Day of Education on Saturday:</p><ul>\n<li>More than eight million, or nearly half of Sudan’s school-age children, have missed about 484 days of learning since the war began in April 2023.</li>\n<li>This duration is 10 percent longer than the school closures during the pandemic in the Philippines, which was the last country to resume face-to-face learning.</li>\n<li>Unlike during the pandemic, remote learning is impossible for most Sudanese children, leaving them vulnerable to recruitment into armed groups and sexual exploitation.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>‘Total breakdown’ in conflict zones</strong></h2><p>The data reveal a system on the brink of collapse, particularly in conflict hotspots.</p><p>In North Darfur State, only 3 percent of its more than 1,100 schools remain open. The situation is similarly dire in the states of South Darfur (13 percent operational) and West Kordofan (15 percent).</p><p>“Education is not a luxury. … It is a lifeline,” Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children, said after a visit to Sudan. “If we fail to invest in education today, we risk condemning an entire generation to a future defined by conflict rather than by opportunity.”</p><p>Adding to the crisis, many teachers have gone unpaid for months, forcing them to abandon their posts, while countless schools have been bombed or turned into shelters.</p><h2><strong>Siege and famine conditions</strong></h2><p>The collapse of education is mirrored by the collapse of food supplies. As aid funding dries up – a reality confirmed by Blue Nile Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Qisma Abdel Karim – famine is setting in.</p><p>OCHA reported this week that:</p><ul>\n<li>At least 2,000 families are cut off from aid in North Darfur due to intense fighting.</li>\n<li>“Famine conditions” have been confirmed in the besieged city of Kadugli in South Kordofan.</li>\n<li>Significant gaps remain in the provision of aid as the UN has appealed for $2.9bn to fund its humanitarian response in Sudan this year.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>‘Equal in misery’</strong></h2><p>Those statistics translate into hard reality on the ground.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The war does not distinguish between a child, a woman or an elderly man,” Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Taher Almardi said, reporting from Ad-Damazin. “Everyone is equal in misery.”</p><p>For Rasha and mothers like her, the choice is stark: break traditional norms and toil for a pittance or succumb to hunger.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/features/2026/1/11/a-ghost-town-votes-in-myanmar-elections-second-phase\">controversial general election</a>, with a military-backed party on course for a landslide win amid a raging civil war.</p><p>Voting began in 60 townships, including in the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, at 6am local time on Sunday (23:30 GMT, Saturday).</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Critics say the polls are neither free nor fair, and are designed to legitimise military rule in Myanmar, nearly five years after the country’s generals ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, leading to a civil war that has killed thousands and displaced more than 3.5 million people.</p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi remains in detention and, like several other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy (NLD) has been dissolved, tilting the political playing field in favour of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which is <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/myanmar-military-backed-party-leads-after-second-round-of-election-voting\">leading in the polls</a>.</p><p>So far, the USDP has secured 193 out of 209 seats in the lower house, and 52 out of 78 seats in the upper house, according to the election commission.</p><p>That means that along with the military, which is allocated 166 seats, the two already hold just under 400 seats, comfortably surpassing the 294 needed to come to power.</p><p>Seventeen other parties have won a small number of seats in the legislature, ranging from one to 10, according to the election commission.</p><p>Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who heads the current military government, is widely expected by both supporters and opponents to assume the presidency when the new parliament meets.</p><p>On Sunday, images published by Myanmar media showed him meeting voters at a polling station in Mandalay in a seemingly relaxed atmosphere.</p><p>The 69-year-old general and acting president has indicated he is considering appointing someone to succeed him as armed forces chief and will likely move into a fully political role, Reuters news agency reported citing a source.</p><p>Asked on Sunday about his possible role in the future government, Min Aung Hlaing said it was too early to say.</p><p>“Once the Parliament is convened, they have their own procedures and methods for selection,” he said.</p><p>The military has announced that the parliament will be convened in March, and the new government will take up its duties in April.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the military has pledged that the election will return power to the people, rights monitors said the run-up was beset with coercion and the crushing of dissent, warning that the vote will only tighten the military’s grip on power.</p><p>A new Election Protection Law imposed harsh penalties for most public criticism of the polls, with the authorities charging more than 400 people recently for activities such as leafleting or online activity.</p><p>Ahead of the third round of voting, Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, also called for the rejection of its outcome, calling it “fraudulent”.</p><p>“Only an illegitimate government can emerge from an illegitimate election,” he wrote on X on Saturday.</p><p>“As Myanmar’s election ends, the world must reject it as fraudulent while rejecting what follows as simply military rule in civilian clothing.”</p><p>Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamad Hasan told Parliament on Tuesday that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, did not send observers and would not certify the election, citing concerns over the lack of inclusive and free participation.</p><p>His comments were the first clear statement that the 11-member regional bloc will not recognise the election results.</p><p>In Myanmar’s second city of Mandalay, Zaw Ko Ko Myint, a 53-year-old teacher, cast his vote at a high school around dawn.</p><p>“Although I do not expect much, we want to see a better country,” he told the AFP news agency. “I feel relieved after voting, as if I fulfilled my duty.”</p><p>The previous two phases of the election have been marked by low voter turnout of about 55 percent, well ⁠below the turnout of about 70 percent recorded in Myanmar’s 2020 and 2015 general elections.</p><p>Official results are expected late this week, but the USDP could claim victory as soon as Monday.</p><p>Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD thrashed the USDP in the last elections in 2020, before the military seized power on February 1, 2021.</p><p>According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors human rights abuses in the country, at least 7,705 people have been killed since the outbreak of the civil war, while 22,745 remain detained.</p><p>But the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, a monitoring group that tallies media reports of violence, estimates more than 90,000 have been killed on all sides of the conflict.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia targeted the capital and four regions in the country’s north and east.</li>\n<li>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the worst-affected in the capital was the northeastern suburb of Troyeshchyna, where 600 buildings were without power, water and heat.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s Air Force said Russia unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles.</li>\n<li>At least 30 people, including a child, were also wounded during the same attack in the country’s second-largest city of Kharkiv.

Arteta, though, acknowledged that his team will now be heavily tested.</p><p>“Yes, with Michael coming in, it’s going to bring new ideas; the intensity rises up – you could see [it] in the Manchester derby with their behaviour and the game that they ‍played,” Arteta said.</p><p>“We expect a tough match, but we will adapt to that for sure. We are at home, and we know how important that is going to be for us.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-arsenal-shape-up-for-manchester-united-s-visit\">How do Arsenal shape up for Manchester United’s visit?</h2><p>Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres are competing for a place in the starting lineup after both forwards impressed in Tuesday’s 3-1 Champions League <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/20/jesus-brace-helps-arsenal-down-inter-to-seal-champions-league-qualification\">win against Inter Milan</a>. Jesus scored twice, while substitute Gyokeres also found the net.</p><p>“We were waiting for that with ​the amount of games that are coming up, and they are all ‌going to have opportunities and minutes, so great to have them back and, especially, to have them in good form,” he said.</p><p>Arteta ‌also addressed Arsenal’s decision to send teenage midfielder Ethan Nwaneri on loan to Olympique de Marseille.</p><p>“At the end, you have to be thrown to the sharks ‌in an incredible atmosphere and club. It’s going to make so ⁠much good,” Arteta said of the move.</p><h2 id=\"arsenal-far-from-perfect-despite-topping-premier-and-champions-leagues\">Arsenal ‘far from perfect’ despite topping Premier and Champions leagues</h2><p>Arteta said his side had room for improvement, despite being unbeaten in their last 12 matches and winning all seven of their Champions League games this season, while Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola called Arsenal the ‌best team in the world.</p><p>“I think we’re the team that wants to be constantly better. We are doing a lot of things right, but we are far from perfect, and our only aim is to sustain ‍the level we are doing and try to improve again,” Arteta said.</p><p>“You need to dominate all the phases in the game if we want to have the chance to win major trophies.”</p><h2 id=\"manchester-united-must-not-get-carried-away-at-arsenal\">Manchester United must not get carried away at Arsenal</h2><p>United may ‌have lifted the mood around Old Trafford with their derby win over City, ‍but ‍Carrick on Friday urged his squad to balance renewed confidence with caution ahead of their trip to north London.</p><p>Carrick’s attack-minded side swept away the gloom hanging over the club with second-half goals from Bryan ​Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu last weekend, underlining their dominance against a disappointing City whose title ‍hopes suffered a significant setback.</p><p>“It has been a good week: a big result, a big performance and a big uplift with the feeling inside the stadium,” Carrick said ahead of Sunday’s clash.</p><p>“It is finding a balance ‍between getting the ⁠encouragement and confidence from the game and performance, and keeping level-headed and keeping our feet on the ground.</p><p>“We have got another big game coming up. One game does not make you a great team, but it gives us a great foundation to build on.</p><p>“[I’m] looking forward to the game; it’s a big challenge. They’re a very ​good team. They have so many strong points to their game. They ‌are where they are for a reason, we’re fully aware of that,” the 44-year-old Englishman added.</p><h2 id=\"casemiro-still-integral-to-united-despite-imminent-departure\">Casemiro still integral to United, despite imminent departure</h2><p>Carrick also addressed the future of Brazilian midfielder Casemiro, who announced on Thursday that he will leave the club at the end of the season, ‌when his contract expires.</p><p>Although the 33-year-old has a one-year extension option, a team source said the club has chosen not to ‌activate it.</p><p>Casemiro arrived at Old Trafford from Real Madrid in ⁠2022 for about 60 million pounds ($81.11m) and played a key role in United’s 2023 League Cup triumph, scoring in the final, as well as being part of their 2024 FA Cup win.</p><p>“The Casemiro announcement was for clarity as much ‌as anything,” Carrick said. “It was decided before I arrived; it wasn’t a knee-jerk decision.</p><p>“But the type of personality and character he is, it shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally, ‍and what it means to be here and finish the season strong.</p><p>“I’ve had the conversation with him. He’s desperate to do well and finish well.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"mainoo-can-be-united-s-main-man-for-years-to-come\">Mainoo can be United’s main man for years to come</h2><p>With Casemiro on the way out, Carrick was eager to turn his attention to Kobbie Mainoo, who he said has the quality and character to become a key player for the club after a frustrating spell during Ruben Amorim’s reign.</p><p>Mainoo started for the first time in the Premier League this season in the win against City.</p><p>The 20-year-old had, however, shot to prominence in the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, scoring as United beat City in the FA Cup final and playing a starring role in England’s run to the Euro 2024 final.</p><p>However, he struggled for game time during Amorim’s ill-fated 14-month spell as the Portuguese coach defied calls to play Mainoo alongside club captain Bruno Fernandes.</p><p>“This club needs young players coming through and being the foundation for what it means, not just for the players or the squad, but for the club and for the supporters,” said Carrick at his pre-match news conference ahead of Sunday’s trip to Premier League leaders Arsenal.</p><p>“I think that is something that we need to grasp, and we need to keep building on.</p><p>“Kobbie is a prime example. To come through so quickly and have the rapid rise, to play in some unbelievably big games and impact those big games at such a young age, shows an awful lot of quality, and in the terms of the character, and to be able to handle it.</p><p>“Part of a career is a few ups and downs, and sometimes, it goes in different trajectories. But I think we’ve seen last week what Kobbie can bring.”</p><h2 id=\"what-effect-did-united-s-win-against-city-have-on-carrick-s-team\">What effect did United’s win against City have on Carrick’s team?</h2><p>Victory over City lifted fifth-placed United to within one point of the Premier League’s top four. With fourth-placed Liverpool’s defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday, the Red Devils can move two points clear in fourth with victory against the Gunners.</p><p>The mood around Old Trafford was also transformed by the positive performance. Carrick is hoping it can be the foundation towards a positive end to the season as United aim to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in three years.</p><p>“It was a big result, big performance and a big uplift with the feeling inside the stadium,” added Carrick.</p><p>“It’s getting that balance between taking the encouragement and the confidence from the game, and keeping level-headed and our feet on the ground.</p><p>“One game doesn’t make you a great team, but it gives us a great foundation to build, so there’s a lot of confidence.”</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-last-time-arsenal-played-united\">What happened last time Arsenal played United?</h2><p>Manchester United provided a stern test for Arsenal in the first Premier League meeting of the season, with Amorim’s side the better of the teams but the Gunners <a href=\"/sports/2025/8/17/arsenal-capitalise-on-bayindir-error-to-win-1-0-at-manchester-united\">seeing off the challenge</a> with a 1-0 win.</p><p>Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game at Old Trafford in the 14th minute.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This will be the 255th meeting between two of English football’s great rivals, with United winning 99 of the matches.

Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has been extended by 15 more days, officials said, hours after the four-day truce expired.</p><p>Syria’s Defence Ministry said late on Saturday that the extension, which began at 11pm local time (20:00 GMT), aims to support <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">a United States operation</a> to transfer ISIL (ISIS) prisoners from detention facilities previously controlled by the SDF.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The SDF confirmed the extension, stressing in a statement that the deal “contributes to de-escalation, the protection of civilians, and the creation of the necessary conditions for stability”.</p><p>The announcement spurred relief in Syria, which has been on edge since fighting broke out between the Syrian military and the SDF earlier this month amid a dispute over its integration into the national army.</p><p>The Syrian military has pushed the SDF out of the city of Aleppo and seized swaths of northern and eastern territory from the force in the past two weeks.</p><p>The advances brought key oilfields, hydroelectric dams and some facilities holding ISIL fighters and affiliated civilians, including <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/syrian-govt-says-it-controls-prison-in-raqqa-with-isil-linked-detainees\">al-Aqtan prison</a> in Raqqa province, under government control.</p><p>The military was closing in ​on the last SDF strongholds when President Ahmed al-Sharaa abruptly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF until Saturday night ‍to lay down arms and come up with a plan to integrate with Syria’s army or to resume fighting.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The extension gives the SDF more time for such a plan.</p><p>It said in a statement that the latest agreement was reached through international mediation and that dialogue with Damascus was continuing.</p><p>The US has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy to establish a lasting ceasefire and facilitate the integration of the SDF, which for years was Washington’s main partner in Syria, into the state led by its new ​favoured ally, al-Sharaa.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said the issue of ISIL prisoners has been a “huge concern” for Washington.</p><p>“They are worried that the fighting between the two sides in the northeast could allow ISIL prisoners to escape and for ISIL to take the opportunity to regroup,” he said.</p><p>Oghanna noted that more than 100 ISIL prisoners escaped a prison in the province of Hasakah earlier this week in a move that has stoked fears of a wider jailbreak.</p><p>The US has since announced the launch of an operation to transfer ISIL prisoners to Iraq and said it expects to complete the transfer of up to 7,000 detainees in the coming days.</p><p>Oghanna said while there is relief in Syria and the US about the ceasefire, “the question is, what happens after these 15 days”.</p><p>“There’s still a lot of concern because the central issue that has caused the fighting between the SDF and the government hasn’t been resolved,” he said. “And that issue is integration: integrating SDF fighters and civil institutions into government institutions.”</p><p>Al-Sharaa signed the integration deal with the SDF in March last year following the fall of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, but the plan faltered amid disagreements between the two sides over how best to implement the agreement.</p></div></div></body></html>"
