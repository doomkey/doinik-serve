suggested that Donald Trump should apologise for his claims that European troops were not on the front lines in the war in Afghanistan.</p><p>In a rare direct rebuke of the United States president, Starmer said on Friday that Trump’s earlier <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/trump-claim-on-nato-role-in-afghanistan-draws-condemnation\">comments</a> to US broadcaster Fox News that NATO allies stayed “a little off the front lines” in Afghanistan were “insulting and frankly appalling”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Asked whether he would demand an apology from Trump, Starmer said, “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise.”</p><p>Trump’s comments came after he withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on several European countries that opposed his demands that the US take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.</p><p>Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said on Thursday that he was not sure NATO would be there to support the US if and when requested, saying, “We’ve never needed them, we have never really asked anything of them.”</p><p>In response, Starmer also paid tribute to the 457 British personnel who died after joining the US-led invasion of <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/12/17/who-will-save-afghans-from-hunger\">Afghanistan</a> in 2001 that followed the September 11 attacks on the United States.</p><p>More than 150,000 UK armed forces personnel served in Afghanistan, making the country the second-largest contributor to the US-led coalition that sought to destroy al-Qaeda and the armed group’s Taliban hosts.</p><p>Alongside the US and UK forces were troops from dozens of countries, including from NATO, whose <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/greenland-claims-how-close-have-nato-members-come-to-fighting-each-other\">collective security clause</a>, Article 5, had been triggered for the first time after the attacks on New York and Washington.</p><p>More than 150 Canadians were killed in Afghanistan, along with 90 French service personnel and scores from Germany, Italy and other countries.</p><p>Denmark, which remains under pressure from Trump over Greenland, lost 44 troops.</p><p>The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"thousands-of-lives-changed\">‘Thousands of lives changed’</h2><p>Trump’s comments provoked collective outrage across Europe, where patience with the US president appeared to be wearing thin at the end of a week when his threats to annex <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/did-the-us-give-greenland-back-to-denmark-trump-omits-history-at-davos\">Greenland</a> reached a crescendo.</p><p>Transatlantic relations took a hit as the US president threatened to <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/trumps-greenland-tariffs-whats-europes-bazooka-option-to-hit-back\">slap tariffs</a> on European nations opposed to his ambitions to annex the territory, which raised questions over the future of NATO.</p><p>And though Trump appeared to back down after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, in which they formed the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trumps-greenland-framework-deal-what-we-know-about-it-what-we-dont\">framework</a>” for a deal over Arctic security, his comments about NATO troops in Afghanistan drew widespread criticism.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Friday, Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel condemned Trump’s remarks, calling them untrue and disrespectful.</p><p>And Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said his country was “a reliable and proven ally, and nothing will change that”.</p><p>Later on Friday, the United Kingdom’s Prince Harry weighed in, saying the “sacrifices” of British soldiers during the war “deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect”.</p><p>“Thousands of lives were changed forever,” said Harry, who undertook two tours of duty in Afghanistan in the British Army.</p><p>“Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters,” he said. “Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But now it seems like he’s free from those shackles a little bit, and hopefully he can continue.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-is-vinicius-s-take-on-his-form\">What is Vinicius’s take on his form?</h2><p>Vinicius himself admitted he needed the Bernabeu faithful by his side rather than on his back.</p><p>“We have to keep going and have the support of our fans so that everything returns to normal,” said the winger.</p><p>“We want to win, the fans want it, too, and if we stick together, we’re going to achieve great things this season.”</p><p>The winger ran over to hug his coach, Arbeloa, after scoring, after the Spaniard had defended him publicly over the last week.</p><p>“I saw the fans completely devoted to Vinicius, chanting his name … I said it the other day, he needs to feel loved by his people, he’s very emotional and he needs that affection,” said the coach.</p><h2 id=\"will-vinicius-renew-his-real-madrid-contract\">Will Vinicius renew his Real Madrid contract?</h2><p>Vinicius, who finished as runner-up in the Ballon d’Or rankings in 2024, has struggled for consistency ever since.</p><p>The 25-year-old’s contract at Madrid runs out in the summer of 2027, and for months, he has been in an apparent standoff with the club over renewing it.</p><p>In the days after his sizzling performance against Monaco, that situation seems to be slowly easing, too.</p><p>“Renewal talks are gathering pace. Despite a bruising week, the Brazilian knows that Real Madrid as an institution are firmly behind him,” wrote Spanish newspaper AS.</p><p>“Vinicius needed the backing of his own to rise from the ashes – and the embrace, first from his teammates and then from Alvaro Arbeloa, made that clear.”</p><p>Arbeloa has indicated from the beginning of his reign that a happy Vinicius will lead to a happy Madrid.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-villarreal-fared-in-la-liga-this-season\">How have Villarreal fared in La Liga this season?</h2><p>Marcelino Garcia Toral’s third-placed Villarreal are seven points behind Madrid and eight off champions Barca; a defeat would therefore virtually write off any chance of a first La Liga title.</p><p>Whatever the result on Saturday, though, it has been a remarkable run until now.</p><p>The east coast club lost only one of their first seven La Liga fixtures this season, winning five. A similar run would see them win six in a row from late October through early December – a ride that was ended by defeat at Barcelona.</p><p>Toral’s side bounced back to win their following two matches but they did suffer defeat in their last domestic outing, going down 2-0 at Real Betis last Saturday.</p><p>Estadio de la Ceramica has proven to be a fortress this season with eight wins, a draw and one defeat recorded at home, that in comparison with five wins, a draw and three defeats on the road.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-villarreal-fared-in-the-champions-league\">How have Villarreal fared in the Champions League?</h2><p>The exploits in Europe have not been as rewarding for Villarreal, with six defeats and a draw recorded in their seven games.</p><p>They finish the league phase of the Champions League at Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday, but any hopes of reaching the next round have long since faded.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-villarreal-played-real-madrid\">What happened the last time Villarreal played Real Madrid?</h2><p>Real won the first meeting in La Liga this season 3-1 at Bernabeu on October 4.</p><p>Vinicius Junior netted two minutes in the second half to open the scoring, then doubled Real’s tally from the penalty spot with 20 minutes remaining.</p><p>Georges Mikautadze pulled one back for the away team but after Santiago Mourino saw red in the 77th minute, Kylian Mbappe soon after netted Real’s third to ensure the win.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This will be the 55th meeting between the sides, with Real Madrid winning 31 of the encounters.

He argues it lacks clarity and does not explicitly establish that private companies can hold majority ownership.</p><p>“This law is a law of ambiguity, designed to avoid openly breaking with Chavez’s oil legacy,” Guerra said. “It is not emphatic about private participation.”</p><p>He noted that, in practice, the government has already ceded ground to private capital through production participation contracts (CPP), under which companies could effectively hold more than 50 percent.</p><p>The CPP framework emerged in 2024 when Rodríguez was serving as energy and oil minister. Its operation has been marked by opacity, as it is shielded by Article 37 of the Anti-Blockade Law, enacted to circumvent sanctions imposed on PDVSA in 2019.</p><p>That provision establishes a regime of confidentiality and document classification, allowing the government to bypass the existing Hydrocarbons Law, which limits private or foreign capital to joint ventures in which PDVSA must hold a majority stake.</p><p>On January 15, Rodríguez told the National Assembly that the introduction of CPPs in April of 2024 led to a rebound in oil production, from 900,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million bpd, and that investments under this model reached nearly $900m in 2025.</p><p>But the introduction of the proposed changes were marred by controversy as the draft was not made public until just a couple of hours before lawmakers convened for its first debate. The opposition declined to vote, arguing that in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves, energy legislation should be treated as a “social pact”, the result of a broad and thorough consultation among all stakeholders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"chevron-model\">‘Chevron model’</h2><p>Luis Oliveros, dean of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Metropolitan University at Caracas, described it as a positive sign that the law formalises what is known as the “Chevron model”.</p><p>“It opens room for foreign companies to assume technical, operational and financial management of the joint ventures they operate, with greater flexibility,” he said. However, he added that eliminating PDVSA’s mandatory majority stake would have been more attractive to foreign investors.</p><p>Oswaldo Felizzola, coordinator of Venezuela’s International Centre for Energy and Environment (CIEA), told Al Jazeera that the reform contains enough elements to invite new capital to invest in the industry, but ultimately falls short.</p><p>“What has been proposed is necessary, but not sufficient. The law needs to be updated for the 21st century,” Felizzola said. “That said, it is no longer as statist as to paralyse the industry.”</p><p>He noted that many existing companies could shift to a different operating model to improve profitability, but warned that the framework still has significant shortcomings. “It does not take into account current or future issues – climate change, for example – and therefore it is not a law that will drive the role of oil in the years ahead,” he said.</p><p>According to Felizzola, the conditions outlined in the reform are closer to the model that prevailed in Venezuela during the last quarter of the 20th century. “Are further reforms needed? Yes. But there is at least enough in place to work with – and for the Venezuelan government to allow you to do so.”</p><p>The reform bill must now move to a consultation phase and a second, article-by-article debate in the National Assembly before it can be enacted. It is not clear when that will happen.</p><p>Meanwhile, energy cooperation with the Trump administration is already having an impact on Venezuela’s economy. This week, the country received its first $300m from US crude sales, earmarked for stabilising the foreign exchange market.</p><p>“We are witnessing a shift,” Guerra said. “The Rodriguez–Trump pact is clearly being implemented, and oil revenues are already flowing in. The lifting of sanctions allows Venezuela to sell at market prices rather than at a discount, as it has been doing. At a minimum, oil revenues this year are expected to rise by 30 percent compared with last year.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

From attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities to Tehran’s calibrated retaliation across the region, the risk of escalation has become tangible rather than theoretical. For Gulf states, whose security and economic stability are directly exposed to any US–Iran conflict, the implications are immediate. It is within this environment that Qatar’s diplomacy between Washington and Tehran should be understood: not as neutrality for its own sake, but as a calculated effort to contain risks that escalation would only magnify.</p><p data-start=\"1242\" data-end=\"2114\">Periods of heightened tension between the United States and Iran have long carried consequences well beyond Washington and Tehran. Following a wave of protests inside Iran that, according to varying estimates, resulted in the deaths of several thousand people, rhetoric between Tehran and Washington has hardened markedly. This included President Trump’s threat to intervene on behalf of the protesters, a development that further heightened the urgency of diplomacy in the Gulf. The Gulf’s geography, concentrated energy infrastructure and interlinked security environment mean that even limited confrontation risks rapid regional spillover. Against this backdrop, Qatar’s approach toward Washington and Tehran has consistently prioritised de-escalation, mediation and the maintenance of political channels at moments when such channels appeared increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2116\" data-end=\"2772\">Qatar has emerged as an effective and credible mediator at moments of acute tension between the United States and Iran, offering practical avenues that have helped prevent crises from escalating further. Drawing on its sustained relations with Tehran and its strategic partnership with Washington, Doha has maintained discreet and trusted channels that allow both sides to communicate when direct engagement becomes politically constrained. This positioning has enabled Qatar to facilitate de-escalatory outcomes that have saved face for both parties, reinforcing its role as a mediator that creates political space for restraint rather than confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"2774\" data-end=\"3291\">This role was most visibly demonstrated in September 2023, when Qatar helped facilitate a prisoner exchange between Iran and the United States, alongside the release of frozen Iranian funds for humanitarian purposes. The process required months of indirect negotiations, careful sequencing and political reassurance on both sides. While the agreement did not signal a broader rapprochement, it underscored an important point: even amid deep hostility, diplomacy remains possible when credible mediators are available.</p><p data-start=\"3293\" data-end=\"4444\">For Doha, such mediation is not an end in itself. It reflects a broader conviction that the Iranian nuclear issue, and US–Iran tensions more generally, cannot be sustainably managed through coercion alone. Qatar has consistently aligned itself with the view that dialogue rather than military action offers the only viable path toward containing risks and preventing escalation. This position does not imply indifference to Iranian regional behaviour or to proliferation concerns; rather, it reflects an assessment of costs, uncertainty and unintended consequences for regional security. As such, even in the aftermath of Iran’s calibrated missile strike on the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar — a Qatari military facility hosting US forces — launched in June 2025 in response to US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Doha moved swiftly to engage both sides and contain the crisis. Through urgent outreach and established communication channels, Qatar contributed to broader efforts that helped support a fragile ceasefire that has broadly held since, underscoring both its capacity to be effective in mediation and the trust placed in Qatari diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"4446\" data-end=\"5117\">A military confrontation aimed at overthrowing the Iranian regime would almost certainly generate effects that extend far beyond Iran’s borders. Internally, such a scenario risks producing state collapse, fragmentation of authority and the re-politicisation of ethnic and sectarian identities within a large and highly complex society. Externally, the spillover effects could include large-scale refugee movements toward neighbouring states, including across the Gulf, as well as severe disruptions to maritime security and energy markets. Taken together, these outcomes would pose immediate challenges to Gulf states whose own stability is closely tied to regional calm.</p><p data-start=\"5119\" data-end=\"5706\">Recent developments in the region have already altered the strategic balance. Since the October 7 attacks and the subsequent regional confrontations, Iran’s network of allied non-state actors has come under sustained pressure. Several elements of the “axis of resistance” have been weakened militarily and politically, reducing Tehran’s ability to project influence in certain theatres. At the same time, the US attacks on Iran in June 2025 have dispelled any remaining misconception about Washington’s willingness to strike Iran directly and degrade its nuclear enrichment capacity.</p><p data-start=\"5708\" data-end=\"6675\">From a Gulf perspective, however, further escalation offers diminishing returns. Weakening Iranian regional influence does not automatically translate into regional stability, particularly if pursued through strategies that risk state collapse. For Gulf states, the priority is not the dramatic remaking of Iran’s political system, but the avoidance of chaos that would be costly, unpredictable and difficult to contain. This assessment is not limited to Doha. In recent years, Qatar’s position has increasingly converged with those of Saudi Arabia and Oman, both of which have invested in reducing tensions with Tehran through dialogue and confidence-building measures. Their efforts to communicate the risks of military escalation to the Trump administration reflected a broader regional mood, one that favours containment and engagement over confrontation. This convergence is notable given the political differences that have historically separated Gulf capitals.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">Qatar’s mediation efforts offer a pathway that helps prevent regional chaos at a moment when escalation increasingly offers diminishing returns. By keeping channels open, facilitating limited agreements and discouraging maximalist strategies, Doha seeks to reduce the likelihood of miscalculation. Such efforts rarely produce dramatic breakthroughs, and they are often invisible by design. Yet their absence would likely make escalation more probable, not less.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">In an increasingly polarised regional environment, the value of de-escalation is easily overlooked. It lacks the clarity of deterrence and the euphoria of military action. Still, as Qatar’s engagement between Washington and Tehran illustrates, diplomacy, however incremental and imperfect, remains one of the few tools capable of preventing crises from spiralling into wider conflict. In a region where the costs of war are shared far beyond the battlefield, that contribution should not be dismissed lightly.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This system will be transformed,” he said in an evening video address.</p><p>Russia has also attacked Kyiv with Shahed drones fitted with jet engines, giving them greater speed and making them difficult to intercept, the Ukrainian Air Force has said.</p><p>Ukraine has been adapting. Its air force posted a video on January 15 showing a Sting drone successfully intercepting a jet-powered Shahed. The Sting was developed by Wild Hornets, a Ukrainian charitable fundraising money for air defences, and was designed to kill Shaheds.</p><p>Zelenskyy wants to speed up innovation to counter Russian adaptations to its defences, as well. As part of this effort, he appointed Mykhailo Fedorov as defence minister on January 2 to oversee faster drone production, and on Tuesday announced Colonel Pavlo Yelizarov as deputy head of the air force.</p><p>“With the participation of Pavlo Yelizarov, taking into account his experience and innovative approaches, the “small air defense” system will be improved,” wrote Oleksandr Syrskii, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><p>Zelenskyy has long warned Ukrainians to expect worse. On Sunday, he said it again. “Russia has prepared for a strike – a massive strike – and is waiting for the moment to carry it out,” he said.</p><p>Syrskii told Ukrainian news outlet Ib.ua that Russia planned to increase daily Shahed production from 404 to 1,000.</p><p>By the time Zelenskyy went to Switzerland to meet Trump this week, the situation in Ukraine was dire.</p><p>“Today in Ukraine was the most difficult day for the power system since the blackout of November 2022,” wrote energy minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday. “The situation is extremely difficult.

His failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize last year also seemed to be on his mind.</p><p>“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Sunday, adding he sought “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”.</p><p>That prompted eight Baltic and North Sea states to send military reinforcements to the island, which is self-governing but part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump performed an about-turn, saying he wouldn’t fight NATO allies for Greenland in a rambling 71-minute speech in Davos, but the diplomatic damage had been done. “Nobody is in any mood to stage a grand spectacle around an agreement with Trump right now,” one official told The Financial Times.</p><p>At Davos, European officials remained largely deferential to the US, but there were statements which demonstrated a different mood under the surface.</p><p>European diplomats said Brussels was floating the idea of giving Ukraine preliminary EU membership in 2027 as part of its security guarantees. Full membership would follow later.</p><p>This idea goes against the EU’s usual merit-based accession process, but diplomats said Ukraine’s security should be prioritised over that process. “We have to recognise that we are in a very different reality than when the (accession) rules were first drawn up,” one EU official was quoted as saying.</p><p>Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe could “unequivocally” defend itself without the United States, in a discussion about security. He also said Russia was not winning its war, saying it had taken “at most” 1 percent of Ukraine’s territory in the past 1,000 days, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p>On January 15, Macron reminded the French military that a coalition of 35 countries, not including the US, is now providing all of Ukraine’s military and financial support, after Washington adopted neutrality in the war under Trump.</p><p>“Where Ukraine was extremely dependent on American intelligence capacity, huge majority [of it] a year ago, in [the space of] a year, two-thirds is today provided by France,” Macron said.</p><p>In Brussels, European Commission President <a href=\"https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/2013888436625617323\">Ursula von der Leyen</a> was even clearer about the need for Europe to decouple from US foreign and defence policy.</p><p>“The shift in the international order is not only seismic, but it is permanent,” she told the European Parliament on Wednesday, adding that it is “imperative for Europe … to speed up our push for independence … Europe needs its own levers of power … above all with a real capacity to defend ourselves.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 470 Palestinians <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">have been killed</a> since a ceasefire was announced by Trump on October 10 last year.</p><p>Presented as a plan to rebuild the Palestinian territory, the Trump administration’s proposal this week, however, offers no insight into core issues such as property and land rights — let alone justice for war crimes — amid plans to construct shimmering buildings atop an estimated 68 million tonnes of rubble and war debris, where thousands of bodies remain buried.</p><p>Praising the redevelopment plan, Trump, who also spoke at length at the forum in Davos, argued that the war in Gaza “was really coming to an end”, even as Israeli forces killed at least 11 Palestinians, including two children and three journalists, in separate strikes on the Gaza Strip on Thursday.</p><p>“I’m a real estate person at heart, and it’s all about location,” Trump said about the development plan. “And I said, look at this location on the sea, look at this beautiful piece of property, what it could be for so many people.”</p><p>Experts have strongly criticised the “imperialist” vision of Trump’s so-called master plan, which they say does not include any consultation with Palestinians and reduces the ongoing catastrophic genocide to an “investment opportunity”.</p><p>Trump’s proposal reeks of “imperial plans for Gaza,” Palestinian-American writer Susan Abulhawa wrote in a post on X. “This is a plan to erase Gaza’s indigenous character, turn what remains of her people into a cheap labor force to manage their ‘industrial zones’ and create an exclusive coastline for ‘tourism’.”</p><p>During more than two years of bombardment on Gaza from October 2023, Israel, which is diplomatically supported and armed by the US, destroyed or damaged more than 80 percent of the Strip’s buildings, with residential blocks completely flattened.</p><p>All major hospitals and universities, and most of the Strip’s electricity and water systems, roads and municipal services have been destroyed.</p><p>Nearly all the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced, many of them multiple times. People face hours-long queues for basic food and water, and aid into the territory has been restricted by Israel, which controls everything that goes in and out.</p><p>So, what’s in the Gaza reconstruction plan, part of Trump’s launch of a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">Board of Peace</a>”; could it be realised — and at what cost, especially for the people of Gaza?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261411\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261411\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261411\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260122__93M84X6__v1__MidRes__SwitzerlandUsPoliticsEconomyDiplomacy-1769164474.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kushner\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261411\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US businessman Jared Kushner speaks at the ‘Board of Peace’ meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 22, 2026 [Fabrice Coffrini/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-board-of-peace\">What’s the Board of Peace?</h2><p>In Davos on Thursday, Trump formally announced the charter for his “Board of Peace”, which he has pitched as the next phase of his administration’s 20-point peace plan and a mechanism to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. Membership on the board has a three-year cycle. Those seeking a permanent seat must pay $1bn.</p><p>But the 11-page charter for the Board of Peace does not mention Gaza and appears to have morphed into something far more ambitious – an international disputes forum and a potential rival to the United Nations.</p><p>The executive board so far includes former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Kushner, with Trump as the chairman himself with veto power. It also includes Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even though he faces an arrest warrant from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>At least 50 countries’ leaders have confirmed that they have received invitations, including US adversaries China and Russia — and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">several have agreed to join</a>. However, Trump withdrew Canada’s invitation ‍on Thursday, in what appeared to be a retaliatory move following Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which he denounced Trump’s aggressive stance over Greenland.</p><p>Speaking at the forum, Trump said the board was going to be “very successful in Gaza” and “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”.</p><p>Kushner then outlined details about the board’s development plans for Gaza without mentioning plans for a path to Palestinian statehood.</p><p>Hamas, which currently governs Gaza, condemned the proposal, saying: “Our people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261413\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261413\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261413\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260122__93M687E__v1__MidRes__SwitzerlandUsPoliticsEconomyDiplomacy-1769164477.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kushner\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jared Kushner speaks as a ‘Gaza Timeline’ is displayed on a giant screen at the ‘Board of Peace’ meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 22, 2026 [Mandel Ngan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-in-the-gaza-plan\">What’s in the Gaza plan?</h2><p>Trump’s development plan includes projections to raise Gaza’s gross domestic product (GDP) to $10bn by 2035, after the size of the territory’s economy crashed to just $362m by 2024 amid the war; 500,000 new jobs; and at least $25bn in investment for modern utilities and public services.</p><p>Kushner did not specify who would fund the redevelopment. “As you guys know, peace is a different deal than a business deal, because you’re changing a mindset,” he said, calling the Gaza peace efforts “very entrepreneurial”.</p><p>However, he also focused on security. “[The] number one thing is going to be security,” Kushner said. “Without security, nobody’s going to make investments, nobody’s gonna come build there. We need investments in order to start giving jobs,” Kusher said.</p><p>He added that the US is working “very closely with the Israelis to figure out a way to de-escalation, and the next phase is working with Hamas on demilitarisation”.</p><p>There is no evidence that Palestinians or their leadership have been consulted over any of these plans. Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza, said Palestinian civil society and official bodies were not included in discussions with the Board of Peace.</p><p>“We were surprised, as Palestinian actors on the ground, after 10 years of work, and especially the last two years of work in Gaza, that no one consulted us about the plans for Gaza and its future,” he said.</p><p>“At the time these leaders are holding ceremonies, Israel is using this period to continue its actions in Gaza.”</p><p>Here are some of the highlights of Trump’s redevelopment plan:</p><h3 id=\"four-phases-of-development\">Four phases of development</h3><p>Presenting a four-phase development timeline beginning in Rafah, southern Gaza, and then moving its way north, Kushner displayed colour-coded maps showing coastal tourism zones, mixed-use towers, and residential and industrial areas, as he unveiled the plan in Davos.</p><p>Phase one of Trump’s plan for rebuilding is set to start in Rafah, Gaza’s southern-most city, and some parts of Khan Younis. Phase two will include other parts of Khan Younis, while phase three aims to develop refugee camps in central Gaza. Phase four will cover Gaza City, which is in the north of the territory.</p><p>Kushner told attendees at Davos that construction of new developments in all these areas will take two to three years.
