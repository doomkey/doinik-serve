That’s the grim choice facing many in Gaza today. Since late May, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led aid distribution, operating just four centres, compared with the UN’s former network of more than 400. At least 900 Palestinians have been killed in attacks at these GHF sites. Critics say GHF is nothing but a front for genocide, offering a deadly illusion of help. As Gaza’s people scrape for food, they face an impossible question: Risk the “death trap” for a few sacks of flour, or watch loved ones starve?</p>\n<p>Presenter: Stefanie Dekker</p>\n<p>Guests:<br>\nTamara Al Rifai – UNRWA director of external relations and communications<br>\nEman Hillis – Fact-checker and writer<br>\nAfeef Nessouli – Journalist</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Who are these countries? And how have Israel and its closest ally, the United States, reacted?</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-the-statement-say\">What did the statement say?</h2>\n<p>The joint statement said the countries are coming together “with a simple, urgent message: The war in Gaza must end now.”</p>\n<p>The statement underlined that the suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached “new depths” and that the Israeli government’s aid delivery model is “dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity”.</p>\n<p>They called on the Israeli government to “comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law” and immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid.</p>\n<p>The group of countries also noted that the captives “cruelly held” by Hamas continue to “suffer terribly” and called for their immediate and unconditional release.</p>\n<p>They said in the statement that a negotiated ceasefire offers “the best hope of bringing [the captives] home and ending the agony of their families”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"demographic-change-settler-violence-what-else-did-the-countries-say\">Demographic change, settler violence: What else did the countries say?</h2>\n<p>The countries criticised Israel’s plan to establish a concentration zone – Israel’s vision of relocating the entire Palestinian population into a fenced, heavily controlled zone built on the ruins of Rafah – as “completely unacceptable”.</p>\n<p>“Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law,” the joint statement said.</p>\n<p>The group of countries also marked its opposition to “any steps towards territorial or demographic change in the Occupied Palestinian Territories” and noted that the E1 settlement plan announced would divide a Palestinian state in two, “marking a flagrant breach of international law and critically [undermining] the two-state solution”.</p>\n<p>They also called out that the “settlement building across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has accelerated while settler violence against Palestinians has soared.

However, no official statistics on such crimes have been released.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">That has not stopped some Iranians, along with a large number of anonymous accounts online, from cheering on the mass returns, with popular hashtags in Farsi on X and other social media portraying the returns as a “national demand”.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">Again, there are no reliable statistics or surveys that show what portion of the Iranian population backs the move, or under what conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">Some tearful migrants told Afghan media after <a href=\"/gallery/2025/7/8/nearly-half-a-million-afghans-return-from-iran-amid-crackdown\">being returned from Iran</a> that security forces beat or humiliated them while putting them on buses to the border.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">Others said they were abruptly deported with only the clothes on their back, and were unable to get their last paycheques, savings, or downpayments made for their rented homes.</p>\n<p>Some of those with legal documentation have not been spared, as reports emerged in recent weeks of Afghan refugees and migrants being deported after having their documents shredded by police.</p>\n<p>Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani and Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni have separately said the government is only seeking undocumented migrants.</p>\n<p>“In cases where legal residents have been deported, those instances have been investigated,” Momeni said last week, adding that over 70 percent of those returned came forward voluntarily after the government set a deadline to leave for early July.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847935\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847935\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847935\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25173642101153-1753031682.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Afghanistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847935\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghan returnees who fled Iran to escape deportation and conflict gather at a UNHCR facility near the Islam Qala crossing in western Herat province, Afghanistan, on June 20, 2025 [Omid Haqjoo/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"i-sense-a-lot-of-anger-among-the-people\" class=\"s11\">‘I sense a lot of anger among the people’</h2>\n<p class=\"s9\">For those Afghans who remain in Iran, a host of other restrictions make life difficult.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">They are barred from entering dozens of Iranian cities.

Afghan-origin people can apply if their mother is Iranian or if they are a woman married to an Iranian man.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">Aazim said Iran’s rules have only gotten stricter over the years. But things took a sharp turn after the war, and she has received hundreds of threatening or insulting messages online since.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">“I’ve been hearing from other Afghan-origin friends in Iran … that this is no longer a place where we can live,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">“A friend called me with the same message after the war. I thought she meant she’s thinking about moving to another country or going back to Afghanistan. I never thought her last resort would be [taking her own life].”</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">Aazim also said her 23-year-old brother was taken by police from a Tehran cafe – and later released – on suspicion of espionage.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">The incident, along with videos of <a href=\"/features/2025/6/28/nowhere-to-run-the-afghan-refugees-caught-in-israels-war-on-iran\">violence against Afghans</a> that are circulating on social media, has made her feel unsafe.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">“I sense a lot of anger among the Iranian people, even in some of my Iranian friends. When you can’t lash out against those in power above, you start to look for people at lower levels to blame,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">“I’m not saying don’t take any action if you have security concerns about Afghan migrants … I just wish they would treat us respectfully.</p>\n<p class=\"s9\">“Respect has nothing to do with nationality, ethnicity or geography.”</p>\n<p class=\"s7\"><strong><em>*Name has been changed for the individual’s protection.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It is a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning temperatures rise.</p>\n<p>Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 15 degrees Celsius (27 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey, and reproduce.</p>\n<p>They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees, like people, may cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.</p>\n<p>“Just like we go into the shade, sweat, or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,” said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study’s authors.</p>\n<p>Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become more difficult. Habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases, and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3849716\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3849716\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3849716\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25199684785545-1753164523.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Climate Heat Bees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3849716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isaac Barnes places a full honeycomb onto the back of his truck. [Joshua A Bickel/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual US Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56 percent of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the United States are used to pollinate crops such as almonds, apples, cherries, and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.</p>\n<p>Back at Isaac Barnes’s hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by maize and soya bean fields.</p>\n<p>For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he cannot apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it is applied when it is too hot, the bees could die.</p>\n<p>Last year, they lost nearly a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health before pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.</p>\n<p>It is only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress are contributing to pollinator decline.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3849713\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3849713\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3849713\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25199684781943-1753164501.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Climate Heat Bees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3849713\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bees are not able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University. [Joshua A Bickel/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Trump administration’s proposed budget would eliminate the research programme that funds the US Geological Survey Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation’s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.</p>\n<p>US Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said his country’s pollinators are in “grave danger”, and he will fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.</p>\n<p>“Rather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press news agency.</p>\n<p>Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would generally be more difficult for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to rise or become scarce.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully, even if such research is defunded in the US, such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,” said Harrison.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

His wooden canoe, painted in white and faded blue, cuts through the darkening waters. Fruit bats screech overhead.</p>\n<p>Pratt, 35, is a seasoned sea cucumber diver from the Banana Islands - an archipelago home to about 500 people in Sierra Leone. For 15 years, he has made a living scouring the ocean floor for these creatures that resemble warty, oversized sea slugs. They hide in the silt by day and emerge at night to inch across the ocean floor, gobbling up decomposing matter.</p>\n<p>Also on the canoe, 25-year-old Omolade Jones - sweating in a half-zipped-up wetsuit - perches on the edge of the boat and gazes out at the dark water.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes, the younger diver gestures at Pratt to cut the engine and readies himself to dive. Jones blows on his mask, grabs an underwater torch and wraps a breathing hose around his waist.</p>\n<p>The seabed surrounding the small, jungle-coated archipelago used to teem with sea cucumbers. Nowadays, they are scarce and scattered.  Freediving is no longer an option. Pratt and Jones have to dive deeper, for longer, to find their catch.</p>\n<p>They have turned to “hookah diving” - a makeshift system where air is pumped from a diesel-powered generator on the boat down through a plastic hose. It is a risky and fragile lifeline. The engines are often old and the air is easily contaminated by diesel fumes. And experts say it is much more dangerous than scuba or free diving.</p>\n<p>As the diesel engine that powers his air supply rattles in the boat, Jones quietly slips over the edge into the black water. The yellow hose trails behind him as he swims away from the canoe. Minutes later, his torch lights up a column of water above the seabed.</p>\n<p>Pratt sits in the canoe, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his eyes fixed on the spot where Jones’s light is. “The cucumbers are running out,” he says glumly.</p>\n<p>While they used to haul in dozens of buckets of sea cucumbers a night, now they struggle to find a handful. Pratt says the divers rarely make more than $40 on a dive - barely enough to cover the costs of fuel or to hire some of the diving equipment.</p>\n<p>Not long after Jones exits the boat, he flashes his torch to signal that he is ready to swim back in. When he reaches the canoe, he hoists himself up on the side with his forearms. In one hand, he holds the torch, in the other, a small, brown sea cucumber.</p>\n<p>Pratt takes his turn and disappears into the dark water. He surfaces a while later with a sea cucumber. But the divers are unimpressed. After a couple of hours at sea, they head back to the mooring with a meagre catch of just three specimens.</p>\n<p>Overhead, the almost-full moon casts a white sheen over the water and dimly illuminates the way home.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

two places since 2023.</p>\n<p>The chance sightings have excited environmentalists and wildlife conservationists while raising hopes of a better future for the Himalayan region’s fragile freshwater ecosystems, which have been battered by climate change in recent years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habitat-has-improved\">‘Habitat has improved’</h2>\n<p>Indian wildlife biologist Nisarg Prakash believes the sighting of otters in Kashmir was an indicator of high-quality aquatic habitats.</p>\n<p>“The reappearance of otters might mean that poaching has come down or the habitat has improved, and maybe both in some cases,” Prakash, whose work focuses on otters in southern parts of India, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>Protected under India’s Wildlife Protection Act, otters were once widely distributed across north India, including the Himalayan foothills, the Gangetic plains and parts of the northeast.</p>\n<p>A peer-reviewed study by IUCN in November last year noted that the Eurasian otter, known among Kashmiri locals as “voddur”, was found in water bodies of Lidder and Jehlum valleys, including Wular Lake, one of Asia’s largest freshwater lakes.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3842753\"

and fragmented due to habitat loss, pollution and human disturbances”, says Khursheed Ahmad, a senior wildlife scientist at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST-K).</p>\n<p>Ahmad said that, due to habitat alterations from human activities and the encroachment of their ideal habitats along riverbanks and other water bodies, Eurasian otters retreated and became confined to areas that were least accessible to humans.</p>\n<p>“Although they were not extinct, sightings and occurrences had become extremely rare and they were never documented,” said Ahmad, who heads the Division of Wildlife Sciences at SKUAST-K.</p>\n<p>Less than two years ago, a research team led by Ahmad accidentally stumbled on otters during a study on musk deer in Gurez, a valley of lush meadows and towering peaks split into two by the Kishanganga River along the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the Himalayas.</p>\n<p>Past midnight on August 6, 2023, two individual otters were captured in a riverine habitat at an altitude of 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) in the valley near the 330MW Kishanganga Hydro Electric Project built by India following a prolonged legal battle with Pakistan at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.</p>\n<p>After that sighting, the research team focused on documenting the presence of otters on the Indian side of Kashmir.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, due to heavy disturbance from fishing and other local and paramilitary activities, no further presence was documented,” the IUCN study notes.</p>\n<p>Ahmed said Bhat’s video is only the second photographic evidence of otters in Kashmir.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"too-terrified-to-go-there\">‘Too terrified to go there’</h2>\n<p>But in the large farming village of Hugam, comprising some 300 families, residents are both excited and worried.</p>\n<p>At the crack of dawn, Muneera Bano, a homemaker, wakes to the flutter of crows cawing furiously on the willow trees lining the tributary’s banks outside her home in Hugam, located some 58km (36 miles) south of the main city of Srinagar.</p>\n<p>Bano has stopped washing clothes and utensils on the riverbank after the otter was discovered, something she had done for years.</p>\n<p>“There are underwater caves [in the tributary], and it is hiding in one of them. When it comes out in the morning, crows see it and they start screaming. I am too terrified to go there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Bhat, the teenager who filmed the video, said he often used to bathe in the tributary’s glacial waters and sometimes also caught fish. “Now I can’t even think about going there,” he said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3842762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3842762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3842762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1c6720d2-6e00-454c-a3e3-4c4047776c6b-1752742910.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"otter in Kashmir\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3842762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nasir Amin Bhat captured the Eurasian otter on his mobile phone on May 28, 2025, when he was about to take a bath in the Lidder [Jehangir Ali/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The grainy video led to rumours about the presence of crocodiles in the tributary, prompting Indian wildlife officials to set up a camera trap, which confirmed that it was a Eurasian otter – also seen in Bhat’s video – and not a crocodile.</p>\n<p>Some wildlife officials even bathed in the river in the presence of village elders to demonstrate that the water was completely safe.</p>\n<p>Although otters do not pose any threat to humans, they can turn unpredictable, especially when close to humans. But scientists say these animals can grow accustomed to the presence of humans.</p>\n<p>Wildlife biologist Prakash said rather than being scared or fearful, curiosity about otters can make them a sight to be enjoyed while watching them fish or swim.</p>\n<p>“Otters are largely active around dawn, dusk and after dark, though they can sometimes be seen during daytime as well. Eurasian otters largely prey on fish, eels, and sometimes, waterfowl,” he said.</p>\n<p>Kashmiri farmer Wasim Ahmad remembers a summer day in the early 1990s when he was on the way back from school situated along the banks of Doodhganga, a major tributary of the Jhelum River.</p>\n<p>As Ahmad, now in his 40s, turned the corner, he saw a large procession of people walking jubilantly. One man was holding a dead otter while another was walking a dog on a leash.</p>\n<p>Bagh-e-Mehtab in Srinagar is home to a community of poachers who, in the past, made a living by selling skins of animals such as cats, otters, and other animals. With stricter animal welfare laws in force in India now, the community has given up the old profession.</p>\n<p>“Our elders warned us that otters skinned the children and ate them raw,” said Ahmad, who was in ninth grade then. “But as I grew up, I didn’t come across even one person who was harmed by otters. It was basically a tactic to keep the children away from the river.”</p>\n<p>Ahmad, the wildlife scientist, said the reappearance of otters in Kashmir was a positive sign.</p>\n<p>“Now we should see to it that the new habitat is protected from uncontrolled pollution, garbage accumulation, increased carbon emissions and habitat degradation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for their conservation and wellbeing,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

She said that no prison time “is not appropriate” for Hankison and that she was “startled” that more people had not been injured in the raid.</p>\n<p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was killed in her apartment in the early hours of March 13, 2020, after police executed a so-called no-knock warrant, attempting to storm Taylor’s apartment unannounced, based on faulty evidence that her apartment was involved in a drug operation.</p>\n<p>Thinking they were experiencing a home invasion, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot at the suspected intruders. Police responded with approximately 22 shots, some of which went into a neighbour’s apartment, endangering a pregnant woman, her partner and five-year-old son.</p>\n<p>A federal jury in November 2024 found Hankison responsible for using excessive force in violation of Taylor’s civil rights.</p>\n<p>But last week, Department of Justice lawyers asked that Hankison be given a one-day sentence, plus three years of supervised release, arguing that a lengthy sentence would be “unjust”. Hankison shot 10 bullets into the apartment, though the shots he fired did not hit her.</p>\n<h2 id=\"death-was-a-catalyst-for-calls-for-racial-justice\">Death was a catalyst for calls for racial justice</h2>\n<p class=\"p2\">Taylor’s death, along with the murder of <a href=\"/news/2020/6/9/who-was-george-floyd-the-man-who-sparked-a-movement\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis at the hands of a white police officer, led to racial justice protests across the United States over the treatment of people of colour by police departments.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">During former President Joe Biden’s administration, the Justice Department brought criminal civil rights charges against the officers involved in both Taylor and Floyd’s deaths.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Hankison was convicted by a federal jury in November 2024 of one count of violating Taylor’s civil rights, after the first attempt to prosecute him ended with a mistrial.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He was separately acquitted on state charges in 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Justice Department’s sentencing memo for Hankison downplayed his role in the raid at Taylor’s home, saying he “did not shoot Ms. Taylor and is not otherwise responsible for her death”. The memo was notable because it was not signed by any of the career prosecutors – those who were not political appointees – who had tried the case. It was submitted on July 16 by Harmeet Dhillon, a political appointee by Trump to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and her counsel, Robert Keenan.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Keenan previously worked as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where he argued that a local deputy sheriff convicted of civil rights violations, Trevor Kirk, should have his conviction on the felony counts struck and should not serve prison time.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The efforts to strike the felony conviction led several prosecutors on the case to resign in protest, according to media reports and a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The department’s sentencing recommendation in the Hankison case marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to put the brakes on the department’s police accountability work. Earlier this year, Dhillon nixed plans to enter into a court-approved settlement with the Louisville Police Department, and rescinded the Civil Rights Division’s prior findings of widespread civil rights abuses against people of colour.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Lawyers for Taylor’s family called the department’s sentencing recommendation for Hankison an insult, and urged the judge to “deliver true justice” for her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On Monday, the Louisville Metro Police Department arrested four people in front of the court, who it said were “creating confrontation, kicking vehicles, or otherwise creating an unsafe environment”. Authorities did not list the charges those arrested would face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We understand this case caused pain and damaged trust between our department and the community,” a police statement said. “We particularly respect and value the 1st Amendment. However, what we saw today in front of the courthouse in the street was not safe, acceptable or legal.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A pre-sentencing report by the US Probation Office said that Hankison should face 135 to 168 months imprisonment on the excessive force conviction, according to the sentencing memo. But federal prosecutors said multiple factors, including that Hankison’s two other trials ended with no convictions, should greatly reduce the potential punishment.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

organisations it deems “terrorist organisations”.</p>\n<p>In a statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not reveal how many people were being targeted or any names, saying only that “certain individuals with US lawful permanent resident status have supported and collaborated with Haitian gang leaders connected to Viv Ansanm”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Following the determination, the Department of Homeland Security can pursue the deportation of the lawful permanent residents, also known as green-card holders, Rubio added.</p>\n<p>As the Trump administration has sought to ramp up deportations, the State Department has been invoking broad powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act to attempt to deport people living in the US on various visas, including as permanent legal residents or students.</p>\n<p>Under the law, the state secretary can expel anyone whose presence in the US is deemed to have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.</p>\n<p>The administration has sought to deport four people under the law for their pro-Palestine advocacy, which the State Department repeatedly equated, without evidence, to anti-Semitism and support for the “terrorist”-designated group Hamas.</p>\n<p>All four people are <a href=\"/news/2025/6/11/judge-rules-trump-cannot-use-foreign-policy-claim-to-deport-mahmoud-khalil\">challenging</a> their deportations and arrests in immigration and federal courts.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>In the statement regarding Haitians on Monday, Rubio said the US “will not allow individuals to enjoy the benefits of legal status in our country while they are facilitating the actions of violent organisations or supporting criminal terrorist organisations”.</p>\n<p>In May, the State Department <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/trump-administration-designates-two-haitian-gangs-as-terrorist-groups\">labelled</a> the Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif gangs “foreign terrorist organisations”, calling them a “direct threat to US national security interests in our region”.</p>\n<p>That followed the February designation of eight Latin American criminal groups as “terrorist organisations”, including the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua.</p>\n<p>The administration has used <a href=\"/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">alleged affiliation</a> with the gang to justify swiftly deporting Venezuelans living in the US without documentation under an 18th-century wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act.</p>\n<p>Critics have said the removal flouted due process, with court documents indicating that some of the affected men were targeted for nothing more than tattoos or clothing said to be associated with the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"haitians-singled-out\">Haitians singled out</h2>\n<p>The Haitian community living in the US has been prominently targeted by Trump, first during his campaign, when he <a href=\"/news/2024/9/14/going-backward-how-demonising-migrants-remains-fertile-ground-in-us\">falsely accused</a> Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, of “eating” pets.</p>\n<p>Since taking office, the administration has sought to end several legal statuses for Haitians, including a special humanitarian parole programme under former President Joe Biden, under which more than 200,000 Haitians legally entered the US.</p>\n<p>In May, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the special status.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has also sought to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians, a legal status granted to those already living in the US whose home countries are deemed unsafe to return to.</p>\n<p>In late June, despite the violent crime crisis gripping Haiti, US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem declared that the Caribbean nation no longer met the conditions for TPS.</p>\n<p>However, earlier this month, a federal judge blocked the administration from prematurely halting the programme before its currently scheduled end in February 2026.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
