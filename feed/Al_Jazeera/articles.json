Nearly 41.7 million people relied on the programme as of fiscal year 2024, a number that represents nearly 12 percent of US residents.</p><p>The USDA’s order would require states to pass along information like Social Security numbers, birth dates and home addresses to federal authorities. Critics fear that such a data transfer could constitute an invasion of privacy.</p><p>Rollins, however, told the cabinet meeting that the information was needed to address alleged fraud and “protect the American taxpayer”.</p><p>“ We asked for all the states, for the first time, to turn over their data to the federal government to let the USDA partner with them to root out this fraud, to make sure that those who really need food stamps are getting them,” she said.</p><p>She indicated that resistance to her demand was a question of partisan politics.</p><p>“ Twenty-nine states said yes. Not surprisingly, the red states. And that’s where all of that data [about] fraud comes from,” Rollins continued. “But 21 states including California, New York and Minnesota — the blue states — continue to say no.”</p><p>As a result, those Democratic-leaning states would no longer be receiving federal support for their SNAP recipients, according to Rollins.</p><p>“So as of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"an-ongoing-legal-question\">An ongoing legal question</h2><p>It is unclear whether Rollins will be able to carry out her threat.</p><p>In September, a US district court in northern California <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/california-et-al-v-united-states-department-of-agriculture-temporary-restraining-order-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> a temporary restraining order preventing the federal government from enforcing its data request. In October, another hearing was held on the issue, and a temporary injunction was again granted.</p><p>“Let’s be crystal clear: The President is trying to hijack a nutrition program to fuel his mass surveillance agenda,” California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/court-blocks-data-grab-attorney-general-bonta-secures-order-halting-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> after the October ruling.</p><p>“We won’t let that happen — not on our watch, and not in our communities.”</p><p>Tuesday’s announcement that the states involved in the lawsuit would see a suspension of federal SNAP funds was met with outrage by some top Democratic leaders.</p><p>“Genuine question: Why is the Trump Administration so hellbent on people going hungry?” New York Governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1995951130027983210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media, with a link to Rollins’s remarks.</p><p>The Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee also released a statement, denouncing the Trump administration’s plan.</p><p>“Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars. SNAP has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger,” the <a href=\"https://x.com/HouseAgDems/status/1995920067159040018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> said.</p><p>But Rollins struck back on social media, accusing the states of seeking to protect “their bribery schemes”, an allegation made without proof.</p><p>“NO DATA, NO MONEY — it’s that simple,” she wrote. “If a state won’t share data on criminal use of SNAP benefits, it won’t get a dollar of federal SNAP administrative funding.”</p><h2>Leveraging SNAP?</h2><p>Last year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report stating that 11.7 percent of SNAP benefits dispersed in fiscal year 2023 were “improper”. This amounted to about $10.5bn in incorrect payments.</p><p>But some of those “improper” disbursements were overpayments and underpayments to legitimate recipients, the report explained.</p><p>Tuesday’s threat was also not the first time the Trump administration has sought to suspend SNAP funds.</p><p>During this year’s government shutdown, which lasted a record 43 days, the USDA announced it would not pay SNAP benefits for the month of November.</p><p>Critics accused the Trump administration of leveraging food assistance to pressure Democratic lawmakers to pass a Republican-approved budget, and dozens of states sued.</p><p>Two federal courts sided with the states, ordering the federal government <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/us-courts-rule-trump-cannot-suspend-food-aid-during-government-shutdown\">to resume its funding</a>. The Trump administration <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/8/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-block-4bn-in-food-aid-to-families-in-need\">then appealed</a> to the Supreme Court, which <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/us-supreme-court-extends-order-allowing-trump-to-withhold-food-aid\">placed a hold</a> on the lower courts’ rulings.</p><p>The impasse ultimately ended when the government shutdown came to a close on November 12.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Both men agreed they would speak again soon.</p><p>“I stressed the urgency of strengthening cooperation with the US to combat international organised crime,” Lula said in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/LulaOficial/status/1995908479958270345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> following the call.</p><p>“President Trump stressed his full willingness to work with Brazil and that he will give full support to joint initiatives between the two countries to confront these criminal organisations.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, signalled that their conversation built upon a dialogue they had started in September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City.</p><p>“President Lula and I established a relationship at a meeting which took place at the United Nations, and I believe it set the stage for very good dialogue and agreement long into the future,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115652356733049190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>“I look forward to seeing and speaking with him soon. Much good will come out of this newly formed partnership!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tensions-over-bolsonaro\">Tensions over Bolsonaro</h2><p>Brazil and the US have generally had strong ties, but that bond hit turmoil earlier this year after Trump returned to the White House for a second term as president.</p><p>Trump, a Republican, had fostered close relations with Brazil’s former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who left office in 2023.</p><p>In February, however, Brazil’s attorney general filed charges against Bolsonaro for seeking to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Lula.</p><p>His case was heard by a five-member panel on Brazil’s Supreme Court.</p><p>Trump protested the trial, and in July, he threatened to hike tariffs on certain Brazilian exports to 50 percent if the case was not dropped. Those tariffs went into effect in August.</p><p>The US also imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on one of the members of Brazil’s Supreme Court, Alexandre de Moraes, who played a prominent role in the Bolsonaro investigation.</p><p>In response, Lula blasted Trump for interfering in Brazil’s court system and compared the tariffs to “blackmail”.</p><p>Bolsonaro has since been <a href=\"/news/2025/9/15/lula-defends-bolsonaro-verdict-tells-trump-brazils-democracy-not-on-table\">sentenced to 27 years in prison</a> and was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/brazils-supreme-court-panel-votes-to-keep-bolsonaro-in-police-custody\">taken into custody</a> last month.</p><h2 id=\"a-detente-in-relations\">A detente in relations?</h2><p>A turning point seemed to come in September, when Lula and Trump shared a brief encounter at the UNGA.</p><p>They exchanged a hug, and both men expressed surprise at the warmth of their meeting.</p><p>“I was walking in, and the leader of Brazil was walking out,” Trump said at the UN conference. “I saw him. He saw me. And we embraced.”</p><p>Trump added that they had “excellent chemistry” and promised to meet Lula again. “He seemed like a very nice man, actually,” Trump said. “He liked me. I liked him. And I only do business with people I like.”</p><p>Afterwards, the two leaders <a href=\"/news/2025/10/26/trump-meets-brazils-lula-at-asean-summit-touts-pretty-good-deals\">met again in Malaysia</a> for a conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p><p>And on November 20, Trump announced he would peel back the tariff hike on certain Brazilian agricultural products, including coffee, cocoa and beef.</p><p>On Tuesday, Lula praised the tariff rollback as “very positive” but <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/6/lula-asks-trump-to-lift-40-percent-tariff-from-brazilian-goods\">emphasised that there was more</a> to be done.</p><p>“I highlighted that there are still other tariffed products that need to be discussed between the two countries,” Lula said. “Brazil wants to move quickly in these negotiations.”</p><p>For his part, Trump signalled that he had discussed the “sanctions imposed on various Brazilian dignitaries” in his conversation with Lula.</p><p>The US is Brazil’s second largest trading partner, behind China, and in 2024, the two countries exchanged approximately $127.6bn in goods and services.</p><p>While Trump has criticised Brazil’s economic policies as disadvantaging the US, the South American country has a steep trade deficit with the US.</p><p>The US exports nearly $91.5bn to Brazil, compared with only $36.1bn in Brazilian exports to the US.</p><h2 id=\"collaboration-on-organised-crime\">Collaboration on organised crime</h2><p>Another pillar of Tuesday’s high-level discussion was the prospect of greater collaboration on organised crime.</p><p>Trump has made combating criminal networks in Latin America a major item on his foreign policy agenda. Since returning to office, he has moved to designate numerous Latin American cartels and gangs as “foreign terrorist organisations”.</p><p>He has also launched a series of air strikes against boats and other nautical vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, along the South American shoreline.</p><p>While Trump has framed the bombing campaign as a necessary bulwark against drug trafficking, human rights experts have called the attacks extrajudicial killings, in violation of international law. At least 83 people have been killed in the strikes.</p><p>Lula himself has faced pressure to address crime in Brazil, ahead of his <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/brazils-president-lula-announces-he-will-seek-a-fourth-term-in-2026\">re-election bid in 2026</a>.</p><p>In November, for instance, he called on lawmakers in Brazil’s Congress to pursue stronger legislation to combat criminal networks. His proposals included more support for the federal police and Brazil’s intelligence community.</p><p>“We need firm and secure laws to fight organised crime,” Lula <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Lula/posts/precisamos-de-leis-firmes-e-seguras-para-combater-o-crime-organizado-o-projeto-a/1504719464348398/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a November 19 post on social media.</p><p>Still, the Brazilian government has faced scrutiny for a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/police-operation-in-rio-de-janeiro-favelas-leaves-dozens-dead\">bloody October 28 police raid</a> in Rio de Janeiro that left 122 people dead.</p><p>Lula called for an investigation into the incident, which was meant to combat a criminal organisation known as the Red Command.</p><p>After Tuesday’s conversation, however, Lula reiterated that he was committed to “suffocating” the criminal networks in his country, with help from the US.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has used the shooting as the basis for tightening immigration from what he described as “third-world countries”, including Somalia.</p><p>“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” the US president said.</p><p>“These aren’t people that work. These aren’t people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on. Let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing.”</p><p>Trump said he does not know Omar “at all” but has watched her complain about the US for years. “I think she’s an incompetent person. She’s a real terrible person,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A former child refugee who fled Somalia’s long-running civil war, Omar is considered the first Somali American to serve in the US Congress. She represents a congressional district in Minnesota that contains one of the largest Somali diaspora communities in the country.</p><p>While Somalis in the US suffer from higher unemployment and poverty rates, akin to other refugee groups, a 2021 Minnesota Chamber of Commerce Report highlighted the community’s contributions and a trend towards upward mobility.</p><p>“While many Somali refugees arrived with limited education, low workforce participation rates and high poverty levels, their situation two decades later has shifted significantly,” it said.</p><p>“Poverty levels have dropped, workforce participation has increased, median household income has ticked up and educational attainment has made marginal gains.”</p><p>Trump has nevertheless taken a series of hardline steps in response to the National Guard shooting, including <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">suspending all migration</a> from the “third world” and ordering a review of the status of permanent residents from 19 countries.</p><p>The US president — whose first and current wives are immigrants from Eastern Europe — has also been decrying immigration in general as a drain on US resources.</p><p>Minnesota’s sizeable Somali community has long been in Trump’s crosshairs.</p><p>During his first term in office, for instance, Trump implemented sweeping migration restrictions against five predominantly Muslim countries, plus North Korea and Venezuela. One of the countries swept up in the so-called “Muslim ban” was Somalia.</p><p>Recently, Trump has also criticised the Somali community for a COVID-era welfare embezzlement scandal in which dozens of people, including some Somali immigrants, have been charged.</p><p>Omar herself has been a years-long target of Trump’s criticisms. He repeatedly berated her and other immigrant politicians for “telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run”.</p><p>“Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381395078000643\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media in 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration recently launched an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota that appears to be targeting <a href=\"/features/2025/3/12/somalia-is-dangerous-former-us-deportees-struggle-with-fear-uncertainty\">the Somali community</a>.</p><p>During the Thanksgiving holiday last week, Trump sparked outcry when he called Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously retarded” and accused him of doing nothing to confront Somali gangs allegedly “roving the streets”.</p><p>The US president also taunted Omar by appearing to mock her Islamic headscarf, saying that she is “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.</p><p>On Tuesday, the progressive group <a href=\"/news/2024/3/11/reject-aipac-us-progressives-join-forces-against-pro-israel-lobby-group\">Justice Democrats</a> decried Trump’s attacks on Omar and the Somali community as “disgustingly racist”.</p><p>“This is all Trump knows how to do when he has to distract from his own administration’s failures,” Justice Democrats said in a social media post.</p><p>“Stoke hate, divide our communities, &amp; send ICE in to terrorize our neighbors. Pathetic.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to the CNE, approximately 20 percent of the votes have yet to be tallied.</p><h2 id=\"infighting-on-the-council\">Infighting on the council</h2><p>But even before the first ballots were cast in Sunday’s election, controversies had gripped the council, resulting in accusations of malpractice from all three leading parties.</p><p>The CNE is led by a three-person panel. Each CNE councillor is selected by Honduras’s legislature to represent the three main political parties: the Liberal Party, the National Party and LIBRE, the party of outgoing President Xiomara Castro.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio represents the National Party. She has had a tumultuous relationship with her LIBRE counterpart, Ochoa.</p><p>In October, Ochoa filed a complaint with federal prosecutors, alleging that Lopez-Osorio had been caught in audio recordings conspiring with the Honduran military to influence the results.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio has denied the allegations. “These are fabricated recordings,” she told the Honduran newspaper La Prensa, calling Ochoa’s complaint “outrageous”.</p><p>Attorney General Johel Zelaya nevertheless opened an investigation into the audio recordings on October 29.</p><p>Ochoa, meanwhile, continued to raise doubts about the election proceedings as the November 30 vote drew near.</p><p>On November 9, for instance, he <a href=\"https://x.com/MarlonOchoaHN/status/1987670757795885119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media that a test of the voting system had “failed”, citing connectivity issues.</p><p>That result, he said, “constitutes further proof that the leaked audios are true and that there is a conspiracy against the electoral process, orchestrated from within the electoral body itself”.</p><p>The CNE has faced other high-profile conflicts as well. Also in October, the head of Honduras’s joint chiefs of staff, Roosevelt Hernandez, said the armed forces would seek to hold its own vote count.</p><p>But the president of the CNE, Liberal Party member Ana Paola Hall, rejected his demand, and legal experts have said there is no constitutional basis for the Honduran military to review the results.</p><h2 id=\"trouble-at-the-ballot-box\">Trouble at the ballot box</h2><p>Fears of irregularities and electoral interference have long loomed over Honduras’s presidential race.</p><p>In March, for example, advocates argued that long lines and delays in the distribution of election material impeded voters from participating in the election. Some polling stations stayed open late into the night as a result of the delays.</p><p>This week’s vote count also stuttered amid government website crashes. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Lopez-Osorio addressed some of the “technical failures” and “transmission issues” that have marred the proceedings.</p><p>She denied that the hiccups were part of any kind of conspiracy. “It is literally a technical failure in the disclosure platform,” she told CNN host Fernando del Rincon.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio explained that the CNE was “searching for explanations” and had been in contact with the company in charge of the technology, ASD SAS. The vote count, she added, would continue.</p><p>“We have very narrow margins, and we also have a large proportion of ballots to process in these remaining days,” she said.</p><p>A statement published on the CNE website echoed her comments. “The CNE has demanded that ASD SAS provide the fastest possible technical solution, so that all citizens have full and permanent access to the statistical data,” it read in part.</p><p>Still, those comments are unlikely to dampen efforts to contest the election results in the coming days.</p><p>Already, United States President Donald Trump — supporter of the right-wing Asfura — has amplified election fraud claims with posts on his online platform Truth Social.</p><p>“Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election. If they do, there will be hell to pay!” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115647697688351327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on Monday.</p><p>Moncada, the left-wing candidate, also appears poised to challenge the results. In a statement this week, she denounced Trump for his “imperial foreign interference” in the election process. She also called the initial election results proof that October’s audio leak was authentic.</p><p>“The elections are not lost,” she wrote. “The two-party system imposed its electoral plot on us, following the trap revealed by the 26 audio recordings.”</p><p>She added, “I declare that I will maintain my positions and that I will not surrender.”</p><p>For her part, Lopez-Osorio also called on the electorate to be vigilant, ending her post about her colleague Ochoa with the message: Stay “alert, Honduran people”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Elevated trade policy uncertainty limits prospects for a recovery.</p><p>Inflation is projected to gradually return to central bank targets by mid-2027 in most major economies. In the US, inflation is expected to peak in mid-2026 due to tariff pass-through before easing. In China and some emerging markets, inflation is projected to rise modestly as excess production capacity declines.</p><p>Most major central banks are expected to maintain or lower borrowing costs over the coming year as inflation pressures ease.

Currently, Republicans have a narrow majority in that chamber, as well as in the US Senate.</p><p>Given how small the margins are, both Democrats and Republicans have been angling to win every seat they can.</p><p>The right-wing stronghold of Texas, for instance, passed a bill in August that would redraw the state’s congressional districts with the aim of giving Republican politicians five extra seats in the midterms.</p><p>That Trump-backed redistricting push has inspired other states to take similar efforts. In Democrat-leaning California, for instance, voters approved a ballot initiative in November to redraw the state’s congressional map to help Democrats gain five more seats, effectively negating the Texas effort.</p><p>Tennessee’s 7th congressional district was not part of this year’s partisan redistricting push. But in 2022, the Republican-held state legislature did rework its congressional maps to give Republicans a greater edge.</p><p>The 2022 map split Nashville — a Democratic-leaning city — into three separate congressional districts, thereby diluting the power of its Democratic voters. The 7th congressional district is one of the districts that now represents a part of Nashville.</p><p>Previously, it was considered a safely Republican district. But Behn trails Van Epps closely in most polls.</p><p>A survey by Emerson College put her at 46 percent support, compared to 48 percent for Van Epps. An additional 5 percent of those surveyed remained undecided.</p><p>A victory for Behn would further narrow the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>Money from national groups has flowed into the race, given how close the two candidates are in the polls.</p><p>MAGA Inc — a super PAC named for Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement — has poured $1m into the race, in its first donation since the 2024 presidential election season. The left-leaning House Majority PAC has also spent $1m to back Behn.</p><p>Republicans are hoping to recover from a series of stinging election losses to Democrats in November’s off-year elections.</p><p>In New Jersey, for instance, Democrat Mikie Sherrill trounced a Trump-backed candidate to win the governor’s seat, and another Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, likewise emerged victorious in Virginia’s gubernatorial race.</p><p>Political analysts believe that Tennessee’s tight race could point towards an increasingly hostile political landscape for Republicans before the 2026 midterms.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trumps-approval-rating-in-us-drops-to-lowest-level-of-his-second-term\">Trump</a> won Tennessee’s 7th congressional district by 22 points in 2024.</p><p>But a recent Gallup poll found that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/donald-trumps-disapproval-rating-jumps-to-58-percent-poll\">Trump’s popularity</a> has dropped to the lowest levels of his second term, with just 36 percent of voters saying they approve of his work. Disapproval also reached a new high, with 60 percent saying they disapprove.</p><p>In the lead-up to Tuesday’s vote, Republican leaders urged supporters to make their voices heard at the ballot box.</p><p>“Special elections are strange animals, and anything can happen. And when you’re in a deep-red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative, will win,” Republican House Speaker <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/us-house-speaker-mike-johnson-visits-israeli-west-bank-settlement\">Mike Johnson</a> told reporters.</p><p>“You cannot assume that, because anything can happen.

Costco is represented by the law firm Crowell &amp; Moring. The firm declined Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>“They are filing within the statutory deadline in order to receive the [refunds] for the tariffs that were [allegedly] collected illegally,” Gregory Shaffer, professor of international law at Georgetown University School of Law, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Companies have 180 days to protest the liquidation, or the amounts owed, according to Shaffer.</p><p>“The liquidation of tariffs is the final, official calculation and assessment of the duties, taxes, and fees owed on imported goods.”</p><p>The White House has pushed back on the lawsuit.</p><p>“The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact.

As of the latest count in the November 30 election, right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura was said to be holding a narrow lead, though the race remains effectively a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trump-cries-foul-over-technical-tie-in-honduras-presidential-race\">“technical tie”</a> and no official winner has yet been declared.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump has publicly endorsed Asfura and threatened to cut off United States aid to Honduras if his preferred candidate does not win. He has also accused CNE of “trying to change” the outcome by calling a “technical tie” at this stage, and doubled down on vague threats of retaliation in posts published on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>Observers claim this is the latest example of Trump’s attempts to meddle with the internal affairs of other countries – several of which are in South America.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-main-candidates-and-what-do-they-stand-for\">Who are the main candidates, and what do they stand for?</h2><p>Asfura, 67, from the right-wing National Party of Honduras, has campaigned on a promise of economic stability, foreign investment and a tougher security stance.</p><p>Trump has thrown his support behind Asfura, calling him the “only real friend of Freedom in Honduras” in a Truth Social post and urging people to vote for him.</p><p>Asfura’s main rival, 72-year-old Salvador Nasralla, is running under the Liberal Party banner and positions himself as a centrist reformer focused on restoring the rule of law and on battling corruption.</p><p>The candidate for the left-wing ruling party, Liberty and Refoundation, Rixi Moncada, presents herself as the defender of President Xiomara Castro’s left-leaning legacy.</p><p>Moncada, 60, has proposed “democratising the economy” by expanding credit, strengthening national production, and building an economic model that generates “real opportunities for everyone”. She has also proposed changes to the Constitution to underpin a judicial overhaul in an effort to battle corruption.</p><p>“Our fight against corruption is head-on and without fear. To reform the justice system, there is only one way: to have a majority in Congress,” Moncada said during the campaign.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, polling has suggested a fragmented electorate with no clear favourite, setting the stage for the tight count now unfolding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-involved-himself-in-this-election\">How has Trump involved himself in this election?</h2><p>Trump pledged that there would be “hell to pay” in Honduras if election officials tampered with the results of the vote. He has threatened to cut off US aid to the country if his favoured, right-wing candidate does not win.</p><p>Trump has not specified the precise aid he would suspend, but the US provides Honduras, which has a population of around 11 million, with a substantial package of economic, development and security assistance each year.</p><p>The US president has also shown favour to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras and member of the country’s right-wing National Party, by pardoning his US drug conviction and releasing him from a 45-year jail sentence. On Monday, Hernandez was released from the high-security facility of USP Hazelton in West Virginia in the US.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He was extradited to the US in 2022 and was found guilty of conspiring to import cocaine to the US, and of possessing machine guns, in 2024. Justifying his decision to pardon him, Trump said Hernandez had been “treated very harshly and unfairly” in a social media post on Friday.</p><h2 id=\"what-aid-does-the-us-provide-to-honduras\">What aid does the US provide to Honduras?</h2><p>In 2024, the US provided just under $193.5m in aid to Honduras, according to <a href=\"https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/honduras/\">government data</a>.</p><p>Much of that flowed via the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and through programmes aimed at supporting small businesses, strengthening local governance, improving the agricultural sector and expanding education and health services, according to the US State Department’s website. About $10m was paid directly to the Honduran government.</p><p>USAID was closed down by the Trump administration earlier this year. It is unclear how that portion of aid would be distributed in the future.</p><p>Another major pillar is security cooperation through the US State Department and the Central America Regional Security Initiative, which trains police, supports anti-drug operations, and funds youth and community-violence-prevention initiatives.</p><p>These programmes are deeply embedded in Honduras’s security and social infrastructure. A sudden cutoff could disrupt everything from the police’s ability to operate to the basic work NGOs are able to carry out, according to experts.</p><h2 id=\"just-how-would-honduras-be-affected-if-trump-cuts-off-aid\">Just how would Honduras be affected if Trump cuts off aid?</h2><p>For one of the poorest countries in the region – and a major source of migration to the US – aid is far from just symbolic. It supports critical state functions in areas where violence, poverty and climate disasters drive migration.</p><p>Experts and rights groups <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/honduras/cut-too-deep-us-foreign-aid-withdrawals-and-collapse-protection-women-and-girls-honduras\">warned</a> earlier this year that abrupt cuts to funding to Honduras would likely worsen insecurity, weaken already strained public services and accelerate migration.</p><p>Nearly 30,000 Honduran people have been deported from the US since Trump returned to office in January, according to Honduran government data. The clampdown has dealt a severe blow to the country, where remittances from workers overseas represented about 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-another-instance-of-trump-meddling-in-the-affairs-of-countries-in-south-america\">Is this another instance of Trump meddling in the affairs of countries in South America?</h2><p>Trump’s comments about the election in Honduras fit a broader pattern observers say they have seen this year. He has publicly pressured governments or sided with specific opposition parties in several countries, most obviously in Venezuela.</p><p>In Venezuela, Trump has been accused of angling for <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/is-trump-pushing-for-regime-change-in-venezuela-where-else-is-he-meddling\">a “regime change”</a> against President Nicolas Maduro’s government, via a military campaign of strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific that the Trump administration claims are trafficking drugs.</p><p>Since September 2, US forces have carried out <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">at least 21 strikes</a> on boats, killing more than 80 people. Trump says he has not ruled out military action by land as well. The US has not shown evidence of drug trafficking, however.</p><p>The US has also built up a huge <a href=\"/amp/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast\">military presence</a> in the Caribbean, claiming this is necessary for national security and to push back an “invasion” by Venezuelan drug gangs.</p><p>Maduro has accused the US government of “fabricating a new eternal war” against him.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Brazil, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/terrible-thing-trump-defends-brazils-jair-bolsonaro-against-coup-trial\">publicly questioned</a> the legitimacy of criminal coup charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro earlier this year, bolstering Bolsonaro’s claims of political persecution and suggesting the country’s courts were being used to sideline a right-wing ally of the US. Bolsonaro was ultimately sentenced to 27 years in prison.</p><p>The US president’s comments were heavily criticised by Brazilian lawmakers, who claim he is attempting to delegitimise their institutions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This year, Trump has also said Mexico is being “run by the cartels” and has blamed the Mexican government for fentanyl trafficking. He has threatened to increase trade tariffs if the government does not extradite anyone involved, and has also hinted at US military action.</p><p>In Argentina, Trump has lavished praise on right-wing, populist President Javier Milei and said the US would not “waste our time” with helping Argentina if Milei’s party does not win future elections. A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027, but Trump said if “a socialist wins” then the US would feel “a lot differently” about supporting the country.</p><p>Following Trump’s threat over aid, Milei’s party went on to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">win</a> legislative elections in October with more than 40 percent ​​of the vote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
