Videos circulating online showed students shouting “dishonourables” at a group of paramilitary Basij students affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who chanted back in favour of the establishment.</p><p>The clashes come amid a heightened security atmosphere in Iranian schools and university dormitories. Teachers and schools in a number of cities near the capital went on strike last week to protest the killing of at least 230 children and teenagers, as well as increased presence of security forces in classrooms.</p><h2 id=\"families-dance-in-defiant-grief\" class=\"s3\">Families dance in defiant grief</h2><p class=\"s3\">The Iranian government held mourning events on Tuesday and Wednesday in Tehran, with some officials in attendance.</p><p class=\"s5\">Culture Minister Reza Salehi-Amiri announced on Saturday that the government has decided to call the upcoming <a href=\"/news/2025/3/20/nowruz-2025-traditions-haft-sin-and-celebrations-of-the-persian-new-year\">ceremonies around Newroz</a>, the new Iranian year starting in late March, an exercise in “unity and empathy” with the aim of “getting past the grief” of thousands killed.</p><p class=\"s5\">But numerous families have been holding defiant commemoration events of their own over the past week to mark 40 days since the killing of their loved ones during the anti-establishment protests.</p><p class=\"s5\">Footage from many ceremonies across the country this week showed family members, and large crowds gathered to support them, proudly holding up images of those killed and celebrating their shortened lives.</p><p class=\"s5\">Many chose to clap, play traditional drums and cymbals, and even dance in symbolic shows of resistance and defiance that heavily clash with religious rituals favoured by the theocratic state.</p><p class=\"s5\">“May your pen break, O fate, if you do not write about that which befell us,” the father of Abolfazl MirAeez, a 33-year-old killed in the city of Gorgan in the northern province of Golestan, told crowds gathered at a ceremony on Thursday.</p><p class=\"s5\">“My son was neither a rioter, nor an embezzler nor an aghazadeh [child of an elite].

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The Israeli Knesset is pushing through a bill that, if passed, would allow the occupation authorities to legally execute Palestinians. This development has attracted hardly any international attention, but for Palestinians, it is yet another looming horror.</p><p>The bill is part of the deal that allowed the formation of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government in late 2022. It was demanded by Itamar Ben-Gvir, now national security minister, who has led a reign of terror across the West Bank for the past three years.</p><p>In November, the bill passed its first reading, and in January, its provisions were revealed: execution carried out within 90 days of sentencing, no appeals, and death by hanging. Palestinians charged with planning attacks or killing Israelis would face the death penalty. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for the execution of Palestinians, most recently during his visit to Ofer Prison, where he filmed himself overseeing the abuse of detainees.</p><p>That we got to this point is hardly surprising. For decades, the international community has neglected the fate of Palestinian prisoners. In the past two and a half years, there has been almost no global reaction to the mass brutalisation of Palestinians held in Israeli jails with or without charges. Israeli efforts to legalise executions of Palestinian is the logical next step in eliminating the Palestinian question.</p><h2 id=\"prisoners-or-captives\">‘Prisoners’ or captives?</h2><p>The use of the term “prisoners” to refer to Palestinians held by Israel is deceptive. It strips this cruelty of its context – the military occupation and colonisation Palestinians live under. Prisoners of war or captives are much more accurate terms. That is because Palestinians are taken away either for resisting the occupation or for no reason at all – for the sake of terrorising their families and communities.</p><p>Currently, more than a third of the Palestinians Israel is holding are under “administrative detention” – ie, they are being held without charge – and some are women and children. Palestinians are also “tried” in military courts, which are blatantly biased against the occupied population.</p><p>I, myself, was a victim of this system of oppression through unjust detention.</p><p>In November 2015, Israeli soldiers burst into my home in Ramallah and <a href=\"/news/2016/2/27/profile-palestinian-journalist-mohammed-al-qeeq\">took me away</a>.  They tortured and isolated me for weeks without even telling me what I was accused of.</p><p>Eventually, they came up with an accusation of “incitement”, for which they did not produce any evidence. They kept me under their “administrative detention”, or what is really an arbitrary arrest. The abuse continued, and during one interrogation session, an Israeli officer threatened me with rape.</p><p>They treated me like an animal without rights or legal protection. Representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross were prevented from visiting me. I was released only after I went on a hunger strike for three months and my condition deteriorated to a dangerous level.</p><p>This happened to me 10 years ago, long before October 7, 2023. Back then, the international community was turning a blind eye to Israel’s violations of international law through administrative detention and abuse.</p><p>After October 7, the conditions in Israeli military prisons worsened, with rampant torture, starvation and medical neglect. <a href=\"https://english.palinfo.com/news/2026/02/16/357968/\">At least 88</a> Palestinians have been killed in Israeli detention since then. The international community has remained silent, issuing an occasional weak condemnation.</p><h2 id=\"legalising-the-illegal\">Legalising the illegal</h2><p>Israel’s brutal mistreatment of detained Palestinians is in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions, which it is a party to. By virtue of being under occupation, Palestinians are considered a protected population and have rights which the Israeli authorities have systematically denied.</p><p>Nevertheless, the international community has accepted these flagrant violations. Under the guise of anti-terrorism, the international discourse has transformed Palestinians from an occupied people to threats to Israeli and international security.</p><p>Not even the shocking images and testimonies of mass rape at Israeli detention centres managed to overturn this flawed framing.</p><p>In this context, the death penalty bill is not an extremist proposal; it fits right into the pattern of the brutalisation of Palestinian detainees.</p><p>From the perspective of the Palestinians, this bill is yet another tool of Israeli revenge. If passed, it would spread more fear and further diminish any peaceful resistance against the Israeli settlers’ violent assaults on the Palestinian people and their property.</p><p>The bill is also a nightmare for every family that has a member in an Israeli prison. They have already been pushed to the edge by the lack of information about their loved ones since a ban on visiting amid the spike in deaths in detention.</p><p>Even more horrific is the prospect that the bill may be applied retroactively. This means anyone with the charges of planning or causing the death of an Israeli could be executed.</p><p>There are currently reports in Israeli media that supposedly, the Israeli government is under pressure not to push forward with this law. There have been some suggestions to amend the text to make it more palatable. But we know that Israel will eventually get to executing Palestinians. Just as it has done with other laws, it will deceptively manoeuvre to minimise reactions but still proceed with what it wants to do.</p><p>As Israel is well on its way to bulldozing through yet another international legal norm, the most it will likely get is “calls for restraint” or “statements of condemnation”. Such weak rhetoric has enabled its onslaught against international law for the past few decades, and especially during the past two and a half years.</p><p>If the international community wants to salvage what is left of the international legal regime and save face, it is time to radically change its approach.</p><p>Instead of making weak statements about respect for international law, they must impose sanctions on Israel. Israeli officials who have been accused of committing crimes against Palestinians should not be hosted but held to account.</p><p>Only then can there be hope for the safe and peaceful return of all Palestinian prisoners – something that was already agreed upon during the Oslo Accords. And only then can there be hope that Israeli efforts to dismantle international law so it can do as it pleases in Palestine will be stopped.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Exports account for 85 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product, with the US as the second-largest market.</p><p data-start=\"1125\" data-end=\"1603\">“Officials have indicated that rapid changes could jeopardise major agreements, including a recent multibillion-dollar shipbuilding deal with the US and other investments,” said Barton.</p><p data-start=\"1125\" data-end=\"1603\">“While no definitive policy statement has been made yet, the Blue House has said that the trade deal will be under careful review and changes are likely.”</p><h2 id=\"india\" data-start=\"423\" data-end=\"918\">India</h2><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"902\">India has faced some of the highest US tariffs under Trump’s previous use of emergency trade powers. The president first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent on the country’s purchases of Russian oil, bringing the total to 50 percent.</p><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"902\">Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework trade deal. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. Meanwhile, India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.</p><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"902\">According to political economist MK Venu, founding editor of Indian publication, The Wire, “Critics have argued New Delhi should have waited for the US Supreme Court decision before finalising the interim trade deal and even trade analysts previously connected with the government have maintained it would have been wiser to wait for the court verdict.”</p><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"902\">Venu added that Trump was eager to finalise the trade deal, which includes a commitment to buy $500bn worth of new imports in defence, energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) from the US over the next five years.</p><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"902\">While India, he said, welcomed the reduction of tariffs to 18 percent and the removal of penal duties on Russian imports, uncertainty remains over negotiations, as the Supreme Court ruling affects the legal basis of past tariffs.</p><p data-start=\"904\" data-end=\"1705\">“The Indian trade delegation is likely to wait for the final outcome of the Supreme Court verdict before proceeding with further negotiations, and countries around the world are expected to follow the court’s ruling rather than rush into trade agreements under legislation deemed unconstitutional,” he said.</p><h2 data-start=\"904\" data-end=\"1705\"><strong>China</strong></h2><p data-start=\"175\" data-end=\"600\">China has reacted in a muted way to the Supreme Court ruling, with much of the country still on the Lunar New Year break.</p><p data-start=\"175\" data-end=\"600\">Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Beijing, said, “The Chinese embassy in Washington has issued a blanket statement, noting that trade wars benefit nobody, and that the decision is likely to be broadly welcomed in China, which has long been a primary target of Trump’s tariff policies.”</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"1101\">Since last April, he said, China has faced multiple layers of tariffs, including 10 percent on chemicals used in fentanyl production exported to the US and 100 percent on electric vehicles.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"1101\">Analysts have estimated that the overall tariff level, about 36 percent, could now fall to about 21 percent, providing some relief to an economy already under strain from the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged property market crisis, and declining exports.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"1101\">Shipments from China to the US have reportedly fallen by roughly a fifth over the past year.</p><p data-start=\"1103\" data-end=\"1574\">“Beijing has sought to offset losses in the US market by strengthening trade ties with Southeast Asian nations and pursuing agreements with the European Union,” McBride said.</p><p data-start=\"1103\" data-end=\"1574\">“The Supreme Court ruling may also create a more favourable atmosphere ahead of a planned state visit by Trump in early April, when he is expected to meet President Xi Jinping, potentially opening space for a reset in relations between the world’s two largest economies.”</p><h2 id=\"canada\" data-start=\"4407\" data-end=\"4428\">Canada</h2><p data-start=\"157\" data-end=\"975\">Canada has welcomed the US Supreme Court’s decision but has pointed out that there are still some challenges ahead.</p><p data-start=\"157\" data-end=\"975\">Regional leaders across the country, including those of British Columbia and Ontario, have signalled that the ruling is a positive step, according to Al Jazeera’s Ian Wood, reporting from Toronto.</p><p data-start=\"157\" data-end=\"975\">However, Minister for Canada-US trade Dominic LeBlanc has said that significant work remains, as Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber, and automobiles have remained in place.</p><p data-start=\"157\" data-end=\"975\">Meanwhile, Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford has added that while optimism has grown, tension has persisted over what Donald Trump will do next, Wood said.</p><h2 id=\"mexico\" data-start=\"977\" data-end=\"989\">Mexico</h2><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"415\">Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said her government would be carefully reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision to assess its scope and the extent to which Mexico might be affected.</p><p data-start=\"417\" data-end=\"889\">“The reality is that despite all we’ve heard over the last year about tariffs or the threat of tariffs, Mexico has actually ended up in quite a privileged, even competitive position, especially when compared to other countries,” said Al Jazeera’s Julia Gliano, reporting from Mexico City.</p><p data-start=\"417\" data-end=\"889\">“We have to remember Mexico is the US’s largest trading partner, and the two countries, along with Canada, share a vast trading agreement that shields most products from the so-called reciprocal tariffs that President Trump announced.</p><p data-start=\"417\" data-end=\"889\">“There were also punitive tariffs related to fentanyl and illegal immigration along the US border, which

The first, more broadly, is that this is the first time in the last year that the Supreme Court has stepped in and attempted to do something about Donald Trump’s generalised attack on the rule of law in the United States.</p><p data-start=\"271\" data-end=\"1115\">“And make no mistake, although tariffs certainly are about economics, what Trump has done over the last year is essentially to defy the law. And the Supreme Court happily decided that they had had enough and that they would say no. So, they’re not ruling on economic policy. They made a decision that the president simply exceeded his constitutional authority.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

As Mohammed explains, every time he goes to tend to his field, he is risking his life. A few hundred metres away sit Israeli tanks, and the sound of bullets flying by is common.</p><p>Before the war, Mohammed’s farm produced large quantities of vegetables.</p><p>“I learned farming from my father and grandfather,” he told Al Jazeera. “Our farm used to produce abundant, high-quality crops for the local market and for export to the [occupied] West Bank and abroad. Now, everything we had has been destroyed in the war.”</p><h2 id=\"levelled-to-the-ground\">Levelled to the ground</h2><p>More than three hectares (7.5 acres) of Mohammed’s greenhouses were levelled to the ground. The destruction also included his entire irrigation network, all nine of his wells, two solar power systems, and two desalination plants.</p><p>Mohammed’s losses reflect the wider extent of the damage to the agricultural sector in Gaza. According to a July 2025 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 80 percent of cropland was damaged, and less than 5 percent remained available for cultivation.</p><p>And even with the “ceasefire”, the losses have not stopped for Gaza’s farmers, as Israel expands a so-called buffer zone, within which its forces are based.</p><p>In fact, many Palestinians fear that Gaza’s agricultural lands will be forcibly taken by Israel if the buffer zone becomes a permanent fixture. Blueprints released as part of United States President Donald Trump’s “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/trump-announces-billions-of-dollars-in-gaza-aid-at-board-of-peace-meeting\">Board of Peace</a>” plan for Gaza show many agricultural areas erased.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325354\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325354\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325354\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Eid-AlTaaban-in-his-tomato-greenhouse-1771523963.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Eid al-Taaban stands in his greenhouse\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eid al-Taaban, a 75-year-old farmer in Deir el-Balah [Abdallah al-Naami/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"expanding-buffer-zones\">Expanding buffer zones</h2><p>Israel still controls about 58 percent of the Gaza Strip, calling it a security buffer zone in the east, north, and south of the Gaza Strip. The majority of that buffer zone is Palestinian agricultural land.</p><p>Mohammed has only been able to return to one hectare (2.5 acres) of the more than 22 hectares (54 acres) of farmland his family had cultivated in Gaza City before the war. The other 21 hectares lie within the Israeli buffer zone, and he cannot access them.</p><p>The solitary hectare is only about 200 metres (650 feet) from the “yellow line”, which marks the border between the buffer zone and the rest of Gaza. Mohammed says that Israeli tanks frequently approach and fire randomly.</p><p>One such incident occurred on February 12, when Israeli tanks advanced into Salah al-Din Street and opened fire. Two Palestinians were killed, and at least four others were reported wounded. Mohammed was in his farmland, close to the Israeli tanks.</p><p>“We were working in the field when suddenly a tank approached and opened fire towards us. I had to take cover behind a destroyed building and waited there for more than an hour and a half before I could escape west,” Mohammed said.</p><p>The dangers to Mohammed’s farm are mirrored in central Gaza, where 75-year-old Eid al-Taaban is increasingly worried.</p><p>His land in Deir el-Balah lies only about 300 metres (980 feet) from the yellow line and the Israeli areas of control.</p><p>“We planted eggplants in an open field after the ceasefire. Now, we can’t reach it and harvest the crop because of the expansion of the buffer zone,” Eid told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The sounds of Israeli heavy machineguns are heard every day in our area. Every time my sons go to irrigate the crops in the greenhouses, I just pray that they come back alive,” he added.</p><p>On February 6, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the Israeli army killed Palestinian farmer Khaled Baraka while he was working on his land in eastern Deir el-Balah. Khaled was Eid’s neighbour and friend.</p><p>“Khaled Baraka was a great farmer,” Eid said. “He dedicated his life to cultivating his land and teaching his sons and daughters about farming.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-blockade\">Israeli blockade</h2><p>According to Palestinian farmers, the Israeli blockade of Gaza is one of the biggest challenges they face in their efforts to reclaim agricultural land.</p><p>Since October 7, 2023, Israel has largely prevented the entry of any agricultural equipment or supplies, such as seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, irrigation networks, or tractors.</p><p>That has led to a huge shortage, with what is available still liable to being damaged in bombing, or in the case of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers, reaching expiry. The prices of what little is available have also skyrocketed due to the Israeli restrictions.</p><p>And even when the materials can be obtained, they do not guarantee a return.</p><p>Eid said that he had planted tomatoes in his greenhouses to harvest in the spring, paying an exorbitant amount to acquire the seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides.</p><p>After 90 days of costly care for the plants, and when it was time to start harvesting, the entire crop was ruined because the pesticides and fertilisers he had bought turned out to be ineffective. He was forced to replant the crop.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325535\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325535\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325535\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Israeli-crops-in-Gaza-1771529676.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Boxes of onions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325535\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli produce has flooded Gaza, often at lower prices than locally sourced produce [Abdallah al-Naami/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"market-difficulties\">Market difficulties</h2><p>Eid noted that the current economic conditions in Gaza mean that it is hard to find customers for the produce.</p><p>“Even when we manage to keep the plants alive and harvest the crop, we don’t know if we’ll be able to sell it,” Eid said.</p><p>The instability of the market in Gaza is causing heavy losses for local farmers.</p><p>Waleed Miqdad, an agricultural produce wholesaler, explained that Israeli authorities sometimes close the crossings and at other times flood the market with various goods, causing significant losses for Palestinian farmers.</p><p>He added that Israeli goods are usually of a lower quality and are priced more cheaply.</p><p>“Our local produce, although much fewer in quantity than before the war, still has a distinctive quality and taste. Many of our customers prefer local produce,” Waleed told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But many residents of Gaza, whose economy has been devastated as a result of the war, do not have the money to be able to choose the higher-priced items.</p><p>The competition from Israeli produce is therefore making it difficult for Palestinian farmers to market their produce and make a profit.</p><p>“I was recently forced to sell large quantities of my produce for less than the cost of production because of the competition from imported goods that are widely available in the market,” said Mohammed, the farmer from northern Gaza. “I had to sell and lose or watch my produce rot. And of course, we haven’t received any compensation or support.”</p><p>Despite the challenges facing the farmers in Gaza, they remain determined to reclaim agricultural fields across the Gaza Strip. These areas have always been adored by Palestinians in Gaza, where most had lived in the built-up cities. The farms provided a respite from Israel’s control over the territory and its constant wars.</p><p>“Agriculture is our life and our livelihood,” said Mohammed. “It is an important part of our Palestinian identity. Despite the destruction and danger, we will remain steadfast on our land and will replant all the land we can reach. Our children will continue after us.”</p><p>For Eid, farming is a continuation of the work of his ancestors – in towns that are now in Israel, and where he can never set foot.</p><p>“I’m 75 years old, and I still work in the fields every day,” Eid said. “My grandfather was a farmer in our hometown of Beersheba before the [1948] Nakba.”</p><p>“He taught my father, my father taught me, and today I’m passing on my agricultural expertise to my grandchildren,” Eid added. “The love of the land and agriculture is passed down from generation to generation in our family, and it can never be taken away from us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to UNESCO, it can’t be linked with certainty to any family of languages.

love of our country, which is, right now, very proud of those justices,” Trump said.</p><p>“When you read the dissenting opinions, there’s no way that anyone can argue against them,” he said.</p><p>Vice President Vance also sharply criticised the justices for their ruling, accusing them of “lawlessness” in a post on X.</p><p>“Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to ‘regulate imports’, didn’t actually mean it,” Vance wrote in a post on X.</p><p>“This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple,” said Vance, whose political

They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US envoy, an avowed Christian Zionist and <a href=\"/news/2024/11/13/who-is-mike-huckabee-the-evangelical-pro-settlement-envoy-to-israel\">staunch defender</a> of Israel, later appeared to walk back his assertion, saying that it “was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”.</p><p>Still, he left the door open for Israeli expansionism based on his religious interpretation.</p><p>“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said.</p><p>The Department of State did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio shares Huckabee’s views on Israel’s right to expand.</p><p>The principle of territorial integrity and the prohibition against the acquisition of land by force have been a bedrock of international law since World War II.</p><p>In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.</p><p>But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.</p><p>The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory.</p><p>After the 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.</p><p>Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.</p><p>Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stirred <a href=\"/news/2023/3/21/arab-states-condemn-israeli-ministers-no-palestinians-remark\">international outrage</a> in 2023 when he spoke at an event featuring a map that included the Palestinian territories and portions of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as part of Israel, set against the colours of the Israeli flag.</p><p>In his interview with Carlson, Huckabee tried to argue that Israel’s right to exist is rooted in international law, but he also attacked the legal institutions that oversee international law for their opposition to Israeli abuses.</p><p>“One of the reasons I’m so grateful President Trump and Secretary Rubio are pushing hard, trying to get rid of the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the ICJ is because they have become rogue organisations that are no longer really about an equal application of law,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Beyond his professed religious devotion to Israel, Huckabee has faced criticism for failing to speak up for the rights of US citizens who <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/young-palestinian-shot-killed-by-israeli-settlers-northeast-of-jerusalem\">have been killed</a> and imprisoned by Israeli forces during his ambassadorship.</p><p>Last year, Huckabee even sparked anger from some conservatives in the US when he met with convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, who sold US intelligence secrets to the Israeli government, details of which later made it to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.</p><p>Pollard, a former civilian analyst in the US Navy, served 30 years in jail and <a href=\"/news/2020/12/30/convicted-us-spy-pollard-arrives-in-israel\">moved to Israel</a> in 2020 after his release. He never expressed regret for his crimes, and in 2021, he called on Jewish employees in US security agencies to spy for Israel.</p><p>Huckabee said he does not agree with Pollard’s views, but he denied hosting him, arguing that he simply held a meeting with him at the US embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>Asked if anyone can walk into the embassy to meet the envoy, Huckabee acknowledged that such a meeting requires a pre-approved appointment.</p><p>“He was able to come to the US embassy to have a meeting at his request. I did, and frankly, I don’t regret it,” Huckabee said.</p><p>“I met with a lot of people over the course of the time I’ve been here and will meet with a lot more.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of criminal damage.</p><p>On Wednesday, the same court dropped aggravated burglary charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, against the remaining 18 Filton 24 members, granting <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/pro-palestine-activists-acquitted-of-burglary-at-israeli-arms-site-in-uk\">five</a> more defendants bail.</p><p>Only Samuel Corner, who faced an additional <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">charge</a> of allegedly hitting a female police sergeant with a sledgehammer, remains on remand. He did not apply for bail on Friday.</p><p>The Filton 24 Defence Committee called for Corner’s release. “This isn’t right, or just, given he has already spent over 18 months in prison with no convictions. He should also be granted immediate bail,” said the spokesperson.</p><p>The release of the activists comes after the British High Court ruled that the government’s ban on Palestine Action as a “terror group” was unlawful and disproportionate.</p><p>⁠Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood ⁠said in a statement that she was “disappointed” and that she intended to appeal the judgement in the Court of Appeal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
