I got a good exit out of Turn One; lifted as little as I dared out of Eau Rouge,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The rest of the race we managed really well. I struggled at the end. Maybe the mediums were not the best for the last five or six laps. We had it mostly under control.”</p>\n<p>The win was his sixth of 2025, making the 24-year-old the first Australian – on a list that includes past world champions Jack Brabham and Alan Jones – to win that many races in a single F1 season.</p>\n<p>Norris had a slight battery issue, with the Briton asking over the radio why he had “no pack”, before his race engineer assured him it was coming back, but he was not looking for any excuses afterwards.</p>\n<p>“Oscar just did a good job. Nothing more to say. Committed a bit more through Eau Rouge, and had the slipstream and got the run,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So, nothing to complain of. He did a better job in the beginning, and that was it. Nothing more I could do after that point.

I think it’s going to be great for both parties,” Trump told reporters. He added that it was “a good deal for everybody… a giant deal with lots of countries”.</p>\n<p data-start=\"977\" data-end=\"1145\">Von der Leyen welcomed the deal, saying it would “bring stability; it will bring predictability that’s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic”.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1147\" data-end=\"1444\">Trump claimed the EU committed to buying about $750bn worth of US energy, increasing investment in the United States by another $600bn and placing a large order for military equipment. Both leaders confirmed that the agreed tariff rate of 15 percent would apply broadly to automobiles and other goods.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1446\" data-end=\"1656\">“We have the opening up of all of the European countries,” Trump said. Von der Leyen echoed that, noting that the 15 percent rate was “across the board, all inclusive” and that the European market was effectively now open.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p data-start=\"1658\" data-end=\"1901\">The talks followed months of tense back-and-forth with Trump, who has long accused the EU of unfair trade practices. Just before negotiations began, he called the existing arrangements “a very one-sided transaction; very unfair to the United States”.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2195\">Von der Leyen pointed to the combined economic might of the two powers, describing their trade volume as the world’s largest, encompassing “hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars”.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2195\">She acknowledged Trump’s “tough” reputation as a negotiator, to which he replied: “But fair.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"trade-conflict-averted\" data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2195\">Trade conflict averted</h2>\n<p data-start=\"2197\" data-end=\"2446\">Earlier this month, negotiations appeared close to collapse when Trump threatened to proceed with the 30 percent tariff unless the EU matched the 15 percent terms he recently struck with Japan. Asked if he would accept anything lower, Trump flatly said, “No”.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3460\" data-end=\"3622\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Had no agreement been reached, Brussels had prepared a long list of retaliatory tariffs targeting everything from beef and beer to Boeing aircraft and car parts.</p>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the US-EU deal was a positive move that helped avoid a trade war and a serious blow to the auto sector.</p>\n<p>“This agreement has succeeded in averting a trade conflict that would have hit the export-orientated German economy hard,” he said in a statement. “This applies in particular to the automotive industry, where the current tariffs of 27.5 percent will be almost halved to 15 percent.”</p>\n<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said it was “positive” that a trade deal had been reached; however, she needed to see the details, Italian news agency ANSA reported.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2818\" data-end=\"3078\">Trump and United Kingdom Prime Minister Kier Starmer are expected to meet on Monday, with trade also on the agenda. While a separate US–UK trade framework was unveiled in May, Trump insists the broader agreement is already concluded, though the White House admits some elements remain unfinished.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3080\" data-end=\"3235\">Trump will travel to Aberdeen on Tuesday to help open a third golf course under the family name. He and his sons are expected to cut the ribbon themselves.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

There, it is said, we see the first glimpses of what warfare of the future will look like, not just in terms of weaponry, but also in terms of new technologies and tactics.</p>\n<p>Most recently, the United States-Israeli attacks on Iran demonstrated not just new strategies of drone deployment and infiltration but also new vulnerabilities. During the 12-day conflict, Iran and vessels in the waters of the Gulf experienced repeated disruptions of GPS signal.</p>\n<p>This clearly worried the Iranian authorities who, after the end of the war, began to look for alternatives.</p>\n<p>“At times, disruptions are created on this [GPS] system by internal systems, and this very issue has pushed us toward alternative options like BeiDou,” <a href=\"https://hammihanonline.ir/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-23/42985-%DA%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AB%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%A8-%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF\">Ehsan Chitsaz</a>, deputy communications minister, told Iranian media in mid-July. He added that the government was developing a plan to switch transportation, agriculture and the internet from GPS to BeiDou.</p>\n<p>Iran’s decision to explore adopting China’s navigation satellite system may appear at first glance to be merely a tactical manoeuvre. Yet, its implications are far more profound. This move is yet another indication of a major global realignment.</p>\n<p>For decades, the West, and the US in particular, have dominated the world’s technological infrastructure from computer operating systems and the internet to telecommunications and satellite networks.</p>\n<p>This has left much of the world dependent on an infrastructure it cannot match or challenge. This dependency can easily become vulnerability. Since 2013, whistleblowers and media investigations have revealed how various Western technologies and schemes have enabled illicit surveillance and data gathering on a global scale – something that has worried governments around the world.</p>\n<p>Iran’s possible shift to BeiDou sends a clear message to other nations grappling with the delicate balance between technological convenience and strategic self-defence: The era of blind, naive dependence on US-controlled infrastructure is rapidly coming to an end. Nations can no longer afford to have their military capabilities and vital digital sovereignty tied to the satellite grid of a superpower they cannot trust.</p>\n<p>This sentiment is one of the driving forces behind the creation of national or regional satellite navigation systems, from Europe’s Galileo to Russia’s GLONASS, each vying for a share of the global positioning market and offering a perceived guarantee of sovereign control.</p>\n<p>GPS was not the only vulnerability Iran encountered during the US-Israeli attacks. The Israeli army was able to assassinate a number of nuclear scientists and senior commanders in the Iranian security and military forces. The fact that Israel was able to obtain their exact locations raised fears that it was able to infiltrate telecommunications and trace people via their phones.</p>\n<p>On June 17 as the conflict was still raging, the Iranian authorities urged the Iranian people to stop using the messaging app WhatsApp and delete it from their phones, saying it was gathering user information to send to Israel. Whether this appeal was linked to the assassinations of the senior officials is unclear, but Iranian mistrust of the app run by US-based corporation Meta is not without merit.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity experts have long been sceptical about the security of the app. Recently, media reports have revealed that the artificial intelligence software Israel uses to target Palestinians in Gaza is reportedly fed data from social media. Furthermore, shortly after the end of the attacks on Iran, the US House of Representatives moved to ban WhatsApp from official devices.</p>\n<p>For Iran and other countries around the world, the implications are clear: Western platforms can no longer be trusted as mere conduits for communication; they are now seen as tools in a broader digital intelligence war.</p>\n<p>Tehran has already been developing its own intranet system, the National Information Network, which gives more control over internet use to state authorities. Moving forward, Iran will likely expand this process and possibly try to emulate China’s Great Firewall.</p>\n<p>By seeking to break with Western-dominated infrastructure, Tehran is definitively aligning itself with a growing sphere of influence that fundamentally challenges Western dominance. This partnership transcends simple transactional exchanges as China offers Iran tools essential for genuine digital and strategic independence.</p>\n<p>The broader context for this is China’s colossal Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While often framed as an infrastructure and trade project, BRI has always been about much more than roads and ports. It is an ambitious blueprint for building an alternative global order. Iran – strategically positioned and a key energy supplier – is becoming an increasingly important partner in this expansive vision.</p>\n<p>What we are witnessing is the emergence of a new powerful tech bloc – one that inextricably unites digital infrastructure with a shared sense of political defiance. Countries weary of the West’s double standards, unilateral sanctions and overwhelming digital hegemony will increasingly find both comfort and significant leverage in Beijing’s expanding clout.</p>\n<p>This accelerating shift heralds the dawn of a new “tech cold war”, a low-temperature confrontation in which nations will increasingly choose their critical infrastructure, from navigation and communications to data flows and financial payment systems, not primarily based on technological superiority or comprehensive global coverage but increasingly on political allegiance and perceived security.</p>\n<p>As more and more countries follow suit, the Western technological advantage will begin to shrink in real time, resulting in redesigned international power dynamics.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Trump has argued that these controls act as nontariff trade barriers.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Sefcovic recently told the Financial Times that he wants to reduce the US-EU trade deficit by buying more US gas, weapons and farm products.</p>\n<p>And while European leaders want the lowest tariffs possible, they “also want to be respected as the partners that we are”, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>On July 14, meanwhile, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told reporters in Brussels that “we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools”.</p>\n<p>He added: “If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.” Negotiators in Scotland are hoping it doesn’t come to that.</p>\n<p>This month, Oxford Economics, an economic forecasting consultancy, estimated that a 30 percent tariff could push the EU “to the edge of recession”.</p>\n<p>Countermeasures from the EU would also hit certain US industries hard.

At one point, to scare him, they fired at the ground near him, sending shrapnel flying into his abdomen and causing heavy bleeding.</p>\n<p>After three days, the men were lined up by their captors.</p>\n<p>“They tried to negotiate with us, demanding 3 million Sudanese pounds [about $1,000] per person,” al-Sadiq recalled.</p>\n<p>Three men were released after handing over everything they had, including a rickshaw and all their cash. Al-Sadiq and the other remaining prisoners were moved to a smaller cell – an even more cramped toilet tucked beneath a staircase.</p>\n<p>“There was no ventilation. There were insects everywhere,” he said. They had to alternate sleeping – two could just about lie down while two stood.</p>\n<p>A few kilometres away, al-Sadiq’s friend, the musician, who asked to remain anonymous, had also been arrested and held at the Paratrooper Military Camp in Khartoum North, which the RSF captured in the first months of the war with Sudan’s military.</p>\n<p>That would not be the only time the musician was taken because the RSF had been told that his family were distantly related to former President Omar al-Bashir.</p>\n<p>“They said I’m a ‘remnant of the regime’ because of that relation to him even though I was never part of the regime.
