The plan <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">met with strong pushback</a> in Ukraine and the European Union, as critics said the deal would reward Moscow for invading its smaller neighbour.</p><p>Meanwhile, a leaked recording, which shows Witkoff advising a Russian diplomat on how to sell a Ukraine deal, has prompted criticism in Europe.</p><p>Details of a thoroughly revamped 19-point peace plan are still emerging.

The US media reported that it was developed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, and Witkoff. Both had earlier met with top Russian diplomat Kirill Dmitriev and Ukraine’s chief national security adviser Rustem Umerov, before developing and presenting the plan to Trump for a green light.</p><p>Among other things, the plan proposed de-escalation and buffer zones, that Ukraine would receive security guarantees from the US that it would have to pay for, and that Russia would take no further aggression against Ukraine or its neighbours.</p><p>It also proposed that Moscow would enshrine in its law a non-aggression policy towards Europe, that civilians and prisoners of war from both sides be exchanged, that amnesty would be granted to the warring parties, and that Moscow would cease efforts to stop Ukraine from using the Dnipro River to transport grain across the Black Sea.</p><p>Contentiously, however, point 21, which discussed territorial concessions, proposed that parts of eastern Ukraine, including Russia-annexed Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which make up the fertile Donbas, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhia, be ceded to Russia. The proposal further restricted Ukraine to no more than 600,000 military personnel and required Kyiv to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-reaction\">What was the reaction?</h2><p>In Ukraine, angry citizens criticised the plan, which they said favoured Russia, while officials swiftly reached out to American negotiators for redress.</p><p>Ukraine’s European allies, too, who have been largely sidelined in the negotiation attempt, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">spoke out against the deal</a>. Britain, France and Germany, collectively known as Europe’s E3 powers, released an alternative peace deal over the weekend, which proposed freedom for Ukraine to join NATO based on agreements within the alliance. The European partners also said Ukraine’s military should be capped at 800,000 members.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in a Sunday statement on the sidelines of the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/22/g20-leaders-adopt-new-declaration-even-as-us-boycotts-summit\">G20 Summit in South Africa,</a> warned that the US-led plan would leave Ukraine more vulnerable to Russian aggression. The European Union, she said, would not support forceful territorial concessions nor would it accept a deal that did not reflect “the centrality of the European Union” in securing peace for Kyiv – although the peace plan itself only stops Ukraine from joining NATO, not the EU.</p><p>“Any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict,” the Commission president said.</p><p>Addressing the European parliament on Wednesday, von der Leyen reiterated: Any peace agreement must ensure European security without leaving open the possibility of “carving up” European countries or changing borders “by force”.</p><p>Ukraine has long pushed back against Russia’s insistent demands on its territory, saying that such concessions are not allowed by law and would require a referendum. As the battered country continues to suffer heavy losses under Russian bombardment, many Ukrainians reject the idea of what seems like a surrender after nearly four years of devastating war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4131640\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131640\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4131640\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_69269382a5824-1764135810.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A residential building burns after a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025.

The talks were led on Ukraine’s side by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak and diplomat Umerov, while US officials present included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Driscoll, Kushner and Witkoff.</p><p>In a statement, Ukraine’s presidency office did not disclose details but said the talks were “constructive” and that final decisions on the refined deal would be made by the presidents of Ukraine and the US.</p><p>Ukraine’s First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, who was at the Geneva talks, told The Financial Times the meeting was “intense” and nearly collapsed before it started. However, the resulting draft had left both sides feeling “positive,” he said, adding that the most sensitive topics – territorial issues and the question of Ukraine’s future in NATO – were left for Trump and Zelenskyy to decide on.</p><p>“We developed a solid body of convergence and a few things we can compromise on,” Kyslytsya told The FT. He said that “very few things are left from the original version”.</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The US appeared willing to remove the 600,000-member cap on Ukraine’s army, the official said. “They agreed the Ukrainian army number in the leaked version – whoever authored it – was no longer on the table,” Kyslytsya told The FT.</li>\n<li>He added that proposals for blanket amnesty for potential war crimes were rewritten to address “the grievances of those who suffered in the war”.</li>\n<li>Separately, an unnamed White House official said changes were also made to the earlier peace deal’s restrictions on NATO troops positioned in Ukraine, according to The New York Times. Russia has previously claimed without evidence that NATO troops are fighting in Ukraine.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-might-russia-want\">What might Russia want?</h2><p>Kyslytsya stressed to The FT how willing the US delegation was to listen to the Ukrainian side and to review all the issues raised point by point. However, with Russia not at the table, there are no guarantees that President Vladimir Putin will accept the deal.</p><p>“Obviously, the Russians get a vote here too,” Rubio said at the Geneva talks on Sunday, acknowledging the challenge of getting a yes from Moscow.</p><p>Potential contentious points remain the issue of ceding territory. Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine, unilaterally declared its annexation of the fertile, mineral-rich Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhia provinces, and has kept control of significant chunks of territory there since. Previously, in 2014, Russia forcefully annexed Crimea.</p><p>Putin has pushed for maximalist goals through the war and has stuck to his demands since 2022, including to fully claim all five territories. The Kremlin’s stance has largely remained unchanged despite negotiation efforts by Trump, who feted Putin at a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/no-deal-at-trump-putin-meeting-key-takeaways-from-alaska-summit\">summit in Alaska that resulted in no agreements</a> earlier in August.</p><p>There’s also the matter of NATO membership for Ukraine, which Moscow has vehemently objected to.</p><p>Regarding the uncapping of Ukraine’s military membership, it’s not clear yet if Russia will agree to a higher number. In initial peace talks in 2022, Russia proposed that Ukraine have no more than 100,000 troops, far fewer than the 600,000 troops mentioned in the first US peace plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy will now have to meet to decide the final aspects of the new deal. Trump initially gave a deadline of Thursday for Ukraine to formally agree to the pact, but said later on Tuesday that there were no more firm deadlines.</p><p>It is unclear yet when a meeting will be held as the US winds down for the Thanksgiving holidays on Thursday. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that “there are no plans at this moment” for a meeting.</p><p>Speaking at a video conference of the so-called coalition of the willing – a group of 30 countries supporting Ukraine – on Tuesday, President Zelenskyy said Kyiv was ready to “move forward” with the new “framework”, though he still needed to address “sensitive points”.</p><p>Importantly, Washington will now also have to get Moscow on board with the revised draft.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, commenting on the plan on Tuesday, said Moscow had not seen it, but warned that it should reflect “the spirit and letter” of the talks between Trump and Putin in Alaska, adding that if key terms are erased, “it will be a fundamentally different situation (for Russia). Putin, at those talks, reiterated Russia’s stated goals.</p><p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social media network, said he was looking forward to peace being accomplished.</p><p>“In the hopes of finalizing this Peace Plan, I have directed my Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with President Putin in Moscow and, at the same time, Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will be meeting with the Ukrainians,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages. Thank you for your attention to this very important matter, and let’s all hope that PEACE can be accomplished AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!”</p><p>US Army Secretary Driscoll, meanwhile, met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday in what appeared like an attempt to convey the new agreement to Moscow ahead of Witkoff’s visit next week. It’s unclear what was discussed, but a spokesperson for Driscoll told reporters the “talks are going well, and we remain optimistic”.</p><p>Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, however said that the peace plan was not discussed in meetings with US officials in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said there was a lot of “uncertainty” at the Kremlin at the moment. The Russian side, she said, was not happy about revisions to the peace plan because of the concessions implied for Russia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She stopped at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China for what was supposed to be a three-hour layover.</p><p>Thongdok alleged that Shanghai airport authorities instead detained and harassed her for 18 hours because her passport mentioned her place of birth as Arunachal Pradesh.</p><p>She added that the Chinese authorities at the airport said her Indian passport was “invalid”, claiming that Arunachal Pradesh was actually part of China.</p><p>“I had actually gone past the immigration gate. It was e-gate, so I put my passport through and went to the security gates,” Thongdok told the India Today news magazine over videolink from Thailand’s capital, Bangkok.</p><p>“One of the officials came and started screaming, ‘India! India!’ with my name and singled me out,” she added.</p><p>When Thongdok asked the official why she was being taken out, she said the official told Thongdok that her Indian passport is not valid because she was born in Arunachal Pradesh. Thongdok added that the official said: “Arunachal is part of China. Your passport is invalid.”</p><p>Thongdok said she responded: “Arunachal is part of India. I’ve never heard of it being part of China.”</p><p>She added that she was held up at the airport without being provided a timeline of how long the authorities would keep her.</p><p>Other Indian media outlets reported that Thongdok said she was pressured by airport authorities to buy a new ticket on China Eastern Airline and hinted that her passport would be returned only when she complied. This led to her losing money on missed flights and hotel reservations.</p><p>She added that with help from a friend in the UK, she eventually got in touch with the Indian consulate in Shanghai. Indian officials later escorted her onto a late-night flight out of the city.</p><p>The Indian Express newspaper reported that Thongdok had passed through Shanghai Pudong International Airport in October without any issues. It is unclear what was different this time.</p><p><strong>Have similar incidents happened before?</strong></p><p>In 2005, Beijing adopted a policy of issuing stapled visas to people from Arunachal Pradesh coming to China. Other Indian residents receive a stamped Chinese visa on their passports.</p><p>China’s argument: It cannot issue regular visas to people from Arunachal Pradesh when it considers them Chinese to start with.</p><p>But India has never accepted stapled Chinese visas on its passports. Doing so, it said, would be tantamount to accepting that people from Arunachal Pradesh are not Indian.</p><p>In 2013, two archers from Arunachal Pradesh were issued stapled visas  to travel to Wuxi in eastern China for the Youth World Archery Championship. India barred them from flying to China.</p><p>In July 2023, three martial arts athletes from Arunachal Pradesh were issued stapled visas for the World University Games, which took place in China’s Chengdu. The entire Indian wushu team as a result ended up not going to the games in Chengdu.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2023/9/22/china-bars-three-female-indian-athletes-from-asian-games-reports\">September 2023</a>, the same three wushu athletes from Arunachal Pradesh were unable to compete in the Hangzhou Asian Games because they were unable to download their accreditation cards, which were to serve as visas to visit China.</p><p>Indian Sports Minister Anurag Thakur cancelled his visit to Hangzhou for the inauguration of the games in protest.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-arunachal-pradesh-dispute-about\">What is the Arunachal Pradesh dispute about?</h2><p>The India-China border dispute over Arunachal Pradesh is a legacy of the British Empire, Raj Verma, a nonresident scholar at the Sigur Center for Asian Studies at George Washington University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In March 1914, the McMahon Line was established during the Simla Convention in India, which involved negotiations between Tibet, China and the British Empire. The line is named after the chief British negotiator, Henry McMahon. While Chinese delegates attended the convention, they did not sign the main agreement and did not recognise the McMahon Line.</p><p>McMahon nevertheless went ahead and decided on the line with Tibet. China has held that Tibet did not have the authority to unilaterally decide on the border with India, especially after China sent troops into Tibet and annexed it in 1951. Beijing has also turned to older maps, including from the British, that showed territory south of the McMahon Line as belonging to China.</p><p>Since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, India has treated the McMahon Line as the border with China.</p><p>Beijing has insisted that India and China need to negotiate and draw up their borders rather than relying on the British-era McMahon Line.</p><p>For decades, China claimed only a part of Arunachal Pradesh known as Tawang. But in recent years, its claim has extended to all of the northeastern Indian state.</p><p>Verma said tensions have intensified since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and adopted a much more muscular approach to Beijing’s territorial demands.</p><p>“Our stance is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. … We cannot lose one inch of territory passed down by our ancestors. Meanwhile, we want nothing from others,” Xi said in 2018.</p><p>China’s relations with many of its other neighbours have also soured over the past decade due to territorial disputes, including Beijing’s claims over all of the South China Sea.</p><p>“That [China’s posture] is the reason why it’s becoming more and more difficult for the dispute to be resolved, and it will be extremely difficult in the future for this issue to be resolved,” Verma said.</p><p>In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in power since 2014, has also adopted a more assertive foreign policy, including on border disputes. He once said he would show “red eyes” – a metaphor in Hindi meaning to show firmness and strength – to China.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-arunachal-pradesh-dispute-played-out-historically\">How has the Arunachal Pradesh dispute played out historically?</h2><p>Arunachal Pradesh, India’s least populated state, has long been at the frontier of New Delhi-Beijing tensions.</p><p>In <strong>October 1962</strong>, present-day Arunachal Pradesh became one of the two theatres of the Indo-China War, and Beijing’s troops attacked Indian positions on both sides of the Namka Chu river.  Indian soldiers fled from Tawang although the Chinese People’s Liberation Army returned the territory to India after winning the war.</p><p>In <strong>October 1975</strong>, another skirmish broke out at the Tulung La pass, which connects Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh. Each side accused the other of attacking its soldiers. Four Indian soldiers were killed in what was the last deadly border clash between the neighbours until the 2020 crisis in Ladakh, in which at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese service members were killed after hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>While the Arunachal Pradesh border has been largely peaceful for half a century, the competing Indian and Chinese claims over the region have played out in other ways.</p><p>In <strong>2012</strong>, China objected to the Dalai Lama’s scheduled visit to Arunachal Pradesh. “We firmly oppose Dalai visiting the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’,” said Jiang Yu, who was the spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time. The Dalai Lama did not visit the state in 2012.</p><p>In <strong>December 2022</strong>, minor border scuffles broke out in Tawang. Both sides blamed each other. While China accused Indian forces of obstructing a routine patrol, India alleged Chinese soldiers had encroached upon Indian territory and tried to “change the status quo”.</p><p>In <strong>January</strong>, China approved the construction of a dam in Medog County, Tibet, near the Indian border. India <a href=\"/features/2025/1/24/dam-for-a-dam-india-china-edge-towards-a-himalayan-water-war\">hit back</a>, approving the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project in Arunachal Pradesh to offset the impacts of the Chinese dam and prevent flooding. However, the Indian reservoir project risks submerging dozens of Indigenous villages in India and Bangladesh.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-arunachal-pradesh-significant\">Why is Arunachal Pradesh significant?</h2><p>The state is strategically important to India because it links the country with Southeast Asia and is also a military district, Verma said. The state shares international borders with Myanmar to the southeast and is close to Bhutan to the west. Myanmar, in turn, connects India to Thailand, Laos and beyond via the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway project.</p><p>Verma said the state is also of religious significance to China. In 1683, the sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was born near Tawang.</p><p>China insists that Arunachal Pradesh is an extension of Tibet, itself a source of tension between the neighbours: India’s decision in 1959 to give the current Dalai Lama sanctuary after he fled Lhasa during a Chinese crackdown has long been viewed by Beijing as a provocation.</p><p>In September 2024, India named a previously unnamed mountain peak in Arunachal Pradesh after the sixth Dalai Lama.</p><p>China voiced dismay about this decision. “Let me say more broadly that the area of Zangnan is Chinese territory, and it’s illegal and null and void for India to set up the so-called Arunachal Pradesh in Chinese territory. This has been China’s consistent position,” said Lin Jian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson at the time.<strong><br>\n</strong></p><p>“Beijing would be extremely reluctant to give up Arunachal Pradesh and the Tawang issue,” Verma said.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-authorities-in-china-and-india-reacted\">How have authorities in China and India reacted?</h2><p>In response to a reporter’s question about Thongdok’s experience at the Shanghai airport, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday: “Zangnan is China’s territory. The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh, illegally set up by India.”</p><p>She insisted that Chinese officials had dealt with Thongdok “in accordance with laws and regulations”.</p><p>“The law enforcement was impartial and nonabusive. The lawful rights and interests of the person concerned were fully protected. No compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called detaining or harassing. The airline provided her with resting facilities and meals,” Mao said.</p><p>In response to his Chinese counterpart’s statements, Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, said on Tuesday: “Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality.”</p><p>Jaiswal added: “The issue of the detention has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side. Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-india-china-relations\">What does this mean for India-China relations?</h2><p>Verma said the latest dispute is “a minor blip in the bilateral relationship” between India and China. “It should not be an issue when it comes to improving India-China relations.”</p><p>The relationship between New Delhi and Beijing, especially frigid from 2020 to 2024, has thawed over the past year. Both have been battered by heavy tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump, which analysts said have forced them to cooperate.</p><p>In 2020, India-China relations hit a low point after the Galwan Valley clash in Ladakh. This marked the first deadly border incident in 40 years and resulted in India banning 200 Chinese apps, including TikTok. India’s foreign minister called it the “most difficult phase” in decades.</p><p>Since late 2024, both nations have sought to reset ties. Modi and Xi met in Kazan, Russia, during a troop disengagement along the Line of Actual Control.</p><p>In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited India, leading Modi to praise their “respect for each other’s interests” and “steady progress” in relations. Later that month, Modi made his first visit to China in more than seven years and met Xi for talks.</p><p>Still, Verma pointed out, despite the thaw in ties, “the overall strategy of both countries towards each other has not changed.”</p><p>“Both countries view each other as rivals, and the competition and rivalry between the two countries will continue,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So there is no peace plan,” said Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert with Chatham House, a London-based think tank.</p><p>“However, if … this is something we have to take seriously, then … this makes Ukraine’s situation incalculably worse,” he told Al Jazeera. “The whole point of the Russian proposals is to leave Ukraine defenceless against the next round of Russian attacks.</p><p>“Ukraine is even more reliant on whatever long-term agreements for bolstering its defence it can lock in as rapidly as possible,” Giles said.</p><h2 id=\"technology-to-give-ukraine-an-edge\">Technology to give Ukraine ‘an edge’</h2><p>As Ukraine weaves itself into the defence fabric of Europe, it is offering its combat experience and its battlefields as testing grounds for new systems, particularly unmanned systems.

So that’s the symbiosis of different technologies. That’s something that would give an edge in this conflict.”</p><p>On December 31, Ukraine became the first country in the world to down enemy helicopters by mounting air-to-air Sidewinder missiles on a domestically manufactured Magura unmanned surface vessel (USV) and launching them remotely.</p><p>On May 2, it made military history again, downing two Russian Sukhoi jets from a Magura.</p><p>Last month, Ukraine’s coastal defence forces experimented again, using a Magura to deliver a first-person view (FPV) drone close to Russian vessels.</p><p>“The operation was quick, accurate, and without risk to our fighters,” the unit said.</p><p>Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) said it had modified the Magura to travel 1,500km (930 miles) autonomously and doubled its payload to 2 tonnes of explosive.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116970\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116970\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116970\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25321465962413-1763540062.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, and French President Emmanuel Macron shake hands after a joint media conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris on November 17, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4116970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, at the Elysee Palace in Paris, November 17, 2025 [Sarah Meyssonnier/Pool Photo via AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Ukraine’s Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal proudly displayed it to foreign dignitaries at the International Defence Industries Forum in Kyiv.</p><p>Its innovation could make Ukraine a valuable partner to European defence consortia.</p><p>Representatives of Greece’s largest shipyard, Skaramangas, plan to be among those travelling to Ukraine to discuss co-production deals.</p><p>“We are developing a small unmanned reconnaissance craft and a larger, 12-metre unmanned craft with heavy weaponry,” Skaramangas Shipyards chief Miltiadis Varvitsiotis told Al Jazeera. “These are going to be made of composite materials, possibly carbon fibre, which we have developed extensively, but we are also looking into other materials.”</p><p>Those other materials could perhaps come from the UK, where a startup, Expedition Zero, has patented a process to turn volcanic rock into boat hulls by creating a compound out of the silicon in the rock and resin. It calls the product EcoMinera because it was originally developed as an eco-friendly, recyclable alternative to fibreglass.</p><p>Expedition Zero builds 12-metre catamarans and has built a prototype 20-metre ocean-going sailing vessel. But EcoMinera’s properties now appear applicable to military uses as well. The material resists abrasion better than steel, so a hull made of it can survive groundings and collisions, and since it melts at volcanic temperatures of 1,500C (2,732F), it can be used to bulletproof fuel tanks and fireproof lithium batteries.</p><p>“We’ve already had discussions with companies that said, ‘If you can give us a product that will contain a lithium fire on a yacht, we’ll buy it from you tomorrow’,” Expedition Zero boss Andrew Cowen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We’re talking to a group in the UK already about an application for an underwater autonomous vehicle … It could easily have a military application as well, because a lot of these vehicles operate in harsh environments.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"transforming-europe\">Transforming Europe?</h2><p>More than a year ago, former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi named innovation as one of the three key areas where Europe was lagging behind its competitors.</p><p>“We rely on a handful of suppliers for critical raw materials and import over 80 percent of our digital technology,” he said. “Only four of the world’s top 50 tech companies are European … We must bring innovation back to Europe.”</p><p>Six months after Draghi’s speech, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the defence sector was being endowed with a 150-billion-euro ($170bn) windfall from Brussels and 650 billion euros ($750bn) in fiscal space from national budgets – a plan called RearmEU.</p><p>Another $164bn could come next month from <a href=\"/news/2025/10/2/will-europe-use-russian-assets-to-fund-ukraine-could-moscow-hit-back\">frozen Russian assets in Europe</a>.</p><p>The threat perception from Russia and the motive power of this money stand in stark contrast to the indifference of European governments to defence innovation before the Ukraine war.</p><p>In 2018, Greek company Barracuda built Greece’s first USV and the Hellenic Navy deployed it as part of a NATO exercise off Taranto in southern Italy. Its five cameras relayed live images via a Greek frigate to NATO headquarters in Brussels.</p><p>Three years later, Barracuda built Multi Mission 747, an inflatable USV that could be configured to carry two torpedoes or a rocket launcher – much like the Magura concept Ukraine developed last year.</p><p>Neither Barracuda’s reconnaissance USV nor its search-and-destroy USV were ordered by the Hellenic Navy.</p><p>“There was great interest from officers but none from the politicians who draft the budgets,” Barracuda founder Tasos Hatzistefanou told Al Jazeera. “If the Hellenic Navy in 2021 had procured Multi Mission 747, I would have built an unmanned underwater vehicle by now, but in this environment, I’m not allowed to be creative.”</p><p>That may now change, with European money and Ukrainian experience.</p><p>“It will happen,” said Hatzistefanou. “But we lost a lot of time in which we could have performed miracles.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.</p><p>“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.</p><p>“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.</p><p>The study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.</p><p>The authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.</p><h3>Adulthood – 32 to 66</h3><p>The study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.</p><p>“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.</p><h3>Early ageing – 66 to 83</h3><p>While the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.</p><p>The brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.</p><p>The early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.</p><h3>Late ageing – 83 onwards</h3><p>While there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.</p><p>“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-significant\">Why is this significant?</h2><p>The new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.</p><p>But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.</p><p>“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For two years, the world watched Gaza’s destruction unfold in real time and chose not to stop it. More than seventy thousand Palestinians were killed, and most of the Strip was reduced to rubble, while the same governments that hurried to contain other regional wars produced nothing more than empty warnings, sham ceasefires and aid arrangements that delivered death instead of relief.</p><p>Only now, after championing yet another so-called “ceasefire” that brought barely any relief on the ground, do they claim to be stepping in to help shape long-term peace and stability. Their focus, however, is already misplaced. They act as if Gaza is the side in need of stabilising, not the state that destroyed every form of stability there – Israel.</p><p>Indeed, global powers led by the United States now claim they are working to deliver “stabilising security” to our small, battered territory through structures of surveillance and control being built in collaboration with the very entity that genocided it.</p><p>So in the aftermath of this new “ceasefire”, Gaza faces a new and insidious form of control. Around 30 kilometres (19 miles) northwest of the Strip, in the so-called “Kiryat Gat” settlement built on the ruins of the Palestinian village of Iraq al-Mansheya, officials say dozens of countries and organisations are now present inside the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), a foreign-run command hub for Gaza operations, which has rapidly expanded in recent weeks. Presented as the first concrete step in the US effort to “stabilise” Gaza, it is a hub where foreign officials oversee the Strip from a distance and begin shaping the model that will govern its future.</p><p>But if these architects of stability are so devoted to Gaza’s future, why not step inside and walk among its people? Are they afraid of the devastated survivors they claim to help? Or do they know that once they enter Gaza, even their safety cannot be guaranteed from Israel’s bombs? What is clear is that, by positioning themselves alongside Israel’s military, they have chosen to work with the perpetrators, turning the promise of peace into yet another instrument of control.</p><p>I have seen these foreign “stability” missions before, long before Gaza became the centre of the world’s attention.</p><p>I still remember the first time I saw a picture of UNIFIL’s white armoured vehicle as a child. I was astonished to learn that the peaceful United Nations, whose concern-filled statements were meant to silence guns, actually endorsed holding guns in the name of peace. Their white colour seemed reassuring, as if behind these armoured beasts stood saviours who would finally bring safety. Back then, I truly believed that UN peacekeepers, or “peacemakers”, riding in those white vehicles could one day protect us whenever Israel tried to bomb us.</p><p>But growing up taught me otherwise. I realised that a force unable even to protect itself from Israel’s attacks could never protect anyone else. They weren’t saviours; they were observers, watching atrocities unfold, powerless or unwilling to intervene.</p><p>And as I grew up, I saw the supposed peacemakers not only fail to protect us, but begin enabling Israel’s killing in the most “humanely-creative” ways.</p><p>The US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US-run programme set up to control and distribute aid after Israel intensified its blockade, clearly showed how foreign involvement could directly feed Israel’s violence. It claimed a moral duty to “feed” us after Israel escalated its starvation by halting food deliveries under the pretext that aid “wasn’t reaching those who deserved it”. Then came the GHF killing traps, where more than 2,600 Palestinians were slaughtered under Israeli fire while American officers watched the hunger games they had helped create.</p><p>Now, Washington returns with more partners and promises of an “International Stabilisation Force” not only to “deliver aid”, but to secure Gaza’s entire future. Its new mission, dressed once again in the language of peace, looks even less like salvation and more like another experiment in the post-genocide laboratory, where Gaza is reshaped to fit outsider visions of “stability”. This force only required international legitimacy; a prerequisite it secured far more easily, with US backing, than any resolution aimed at halting Israel’s genocide at the UNSC.</p><p>Any remaining sense of security in Gaza has vanished, not only because of the constant roar of Israeli bombardment, but because those who tried to hold together what remained of our fragile local order were branded as “terrorists”. Israel bombed them and, in their place, empowered criminals to impose its own vision of what “security” should look like for us. The result was, and largely still is, a man-made, genocidal chaos where a bag of flour has become a coveted treasure.</p><p>Watching these imposed versions of “security” unfold while people suffer is horrifying. There can be no real security when even food is still weaponised as international “peace planners” debate how we should be fed rather than lifting the siege. Every basic necessity of life is still treated as a privilege we must prove ourselves worthy of, to convince the “peacekeepers” that we deserve them. Only then, perhaps, will they kindly petition our jailer to loosen the chains of the blockade.</p><p>Survival itself is not guaranteed. The future we were promised is already here in the so-called “post-ceasefire” era. Israel’s bombs never truly ceased; more than 340 Palestinians have been killed since the “ceasefire” began. It’s no surprise to us that Israel continues to bomb us even under a “ceasefire”, but what is truly dangerous now is that these massacres unfold under the eyes of the new self-styled “peacewatchers”, who neither dare to intervene nor even acknowledge fresh bloodshed by Israel. The level of dehumanisation we face is terrifying; we are reduced to creatures that may be killed, starved, and erased while being observed. We are trapped like beasts in a cage whose bars only tighten, punished for crimes we never committed by a jailer that doesn’t even try to hide its criminal essence.</p><p>Israel, internationally accused of genocide, has committed every imaginable crime, waged multiple unprovoked wars, and still holds an entire population hostage, even as Gaza is framed as the side in need of “stabilisation”. And yet it continues unrestrained, enjoying its role as a darling host of the very peace brokers appointed to “stabilise” Gaza. The world is prepared to deploy forces to monitor Gaza’s children struggling to fill their water buckets under siege, while an army whose soldiers proudly call themselves a “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/21/new-al-jazeera-documentary-reveals-evidence-in-hind-rajab-familys-killing\">Vampire Empire</a>” vacates freely, having already shed the blood of Gaza’s children.</p><p>For the past two years, Gaza’s people have endured the most extreme form of collective punishment. And now, these new “peace” efforts feel as if the world wants to punish Gaza even further for enduring and surviving Israel’s genocide.</p><p>The hands that vetoed ending this genocide repeatedly at the UN, while warmly embracing Israeli leaders and arming their warplanes with autographed bombs, will never bring peace to Gaza. The eyes of the world that watched Israel’s terror and chose to look away cannot absolve their complicity by suddenly pretending to monitor Gaza closely. Their focus must be on the true source of instability, on containing the state-driven, deranged violence that proudly assaults the essence of humanity on every screen. Instead of portraying Palestinians as the threatening force, the world must restrain and hold to account those who wield real power to destroy lives daily.</p><p>Our Gaza deserves the space to survive, not to be framed as an isolated enclave in a land that is being ethnically cleansed, or as the “unstable” side requiring foreign supervision. Gaza is Palestinian, inseparable from the land and its people; there is no Palestine without Gaza. The visible oppression our people have endured for over a century defies words, yet the world’s dehumanising lens treats our agony as spectacle.</p><p>We long for the moment justice is served, but how can that happen when every supposed consequence for our oppressor becomes another punishment placed on us?</p><p>As long as the rogue occupation is protected from accountability and allowed to act with impunity, there can be no stability for Gaza, wider Palestine, or the region. Stability will only be possible when the world confronts Israel’s violence, not the people who have survived it.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Like Abu Sittah, Varoufakis faced an entry ban after the furore. The Berlin Administrative Court later ruled that the ban on Abu Sittah’s political activity was unlawful.</p><p>Throughout Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza, German police and security services have repeatedly claimed protests in support of those being bombarded are anti-Semitic or are to be interpreted as revering Hamas. Thousands of individual protesters have been arrested, and many planned demonstrations have been banned outright.</p><p>Germany is Israel’s biggest diplomatic supporter in Europe and enforces strict limits on speech that criticises or attacks Israel, with some arguing this is necessary because of Germany’s genocide of six million Jews in the Holocaust.</p><p>It is a justification that Wieland Hoban rejects, saying the laws are even used against Jewish people who speak up for Palestine.</p><p>“Even if you lost family in the Holocaust, you can still be lectured by some German about what you can say,” said Hoban. “Simply mentioning the Holocaust can get you accused of relativierung” – a word that is used to suggest someone is playing down the Holocaust by drawing comparisons to other, lesser, crimes against humanity.</p><p>Last month, a group of United  Nations experts said they were alarmed by the “pattern of police violence and apparent suppression of Palestine solidarity activism by Germany”.</p><p>If this week’s case goes in favour of the conference organisers, it will be a blow to Germany’s controversial stance.</p><p>Videos of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/10/german-police-brutality-targets-pro-palestine-movement-injured-protester\">police using force</a> to shut down nonviolent protests for Gaza on the streets of German cities have coursed around the world.</p><p>But what marked the state’s intervention in the Palestine Congress apart was that it represented the silencing of an event consisting of talks and debates in an indoor venue – a sphere of political expression that lawyers had previously thought was off-limits for police repression.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly two decades later, Banzer would return to power once again, after actually winning an election in 1997.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127725\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-3269528-1763994070.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C573&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Banzer\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bolivia’s President Hugo Banzer, whom the US supported, wearing a uniform and decorations at his desk in April 1978 [Keystone/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-in-chile\">1970s in Chile</h2><p>The CIA provided funding to help end the presidency of Salvador Allende, an elected leftist leader. Allende had planned to nationalise Chilean copper companies, many of which were owned by US interests.</p><p>The CIA funding was used to back Allende’s opponent and spread anti-communist sentiment. This spiralled into the 1973 military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Allende shot himself dead using an AK-47 rifle before he was captured: Doubts about the cause of his death lingered for decades before it was confirmed by an independent autopsy years later.</p><p>The brutal US-backed dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet lasted 17 years.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127608\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127608\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127608\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-517264184-1763991383.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C534&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Chile\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Edward J Gerrity, a senior vice president for corporate relations at the US-owned International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), tells US Senate investigators in 1973 that he talked with a CIA agent in 1970 about plans designed to create economic chaos in Chile after the election of Salvador Allende as president [Bettmann collection/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-operation-condor-in-six-countries\">1970s: Operation Condor in six countries</h2><p>In 1975, the CIA supported right-wing military dictatorships in six Latin American countries by setting up a transnational network called Operation Condor. This began during the US presidency of Gerald Ford.</p><p>Targeted countries included Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. The operation was aimed at crushing political dissidents, leftists and communist sympathisers. The dictatorships used a shared database to monitor dissidents and their families across state borders.</p><p>They used tactics such as exchanging intelligence, information, prisoners and torture techniques. Under the operation, at least 97 people were killed, according to Plan Condor, a joint initiative by Latin American organisations and the University of Oxford.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-in-el-salvador\">1980s in El Salvador</h2><p>In December 1981, the Salvadoran military’s elite Atlacatl Battalion conducted a deadly massacre in the village of El Mozote, killing about 1,000 civilians, including women and children. This was during El Salvador’s civil war of 1980-92.</p><p>The battalion was trained and equipped by the US under its larger Cold War policy of suppressing leftist rebellions in Latin America. The US government greatly increased military aid to El Salvador between 1980 and 1982.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-in-grenada\">1980s in Grenada</h2><p>It was a familiar story by now.

announced a $40bn budget for defence spending over the next eight years, to get “closer to the vision of an unassailable Taiwan, safeguarded by innovation and technology”.</p><p>Taiwan has been ramping up defence spending over the past decade, but United States President Donald Trump’s administration has pushed the self-ruled island to further increase its defence spending as a means to deter a potential Chinese attempt to regain control over the territory.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Lai said on Wednesday that the military aimed to have a “high level” of joint combat readiness against China by 2027 – which US officials have previously cited as a possible timeline for a Chinese military operation on the island.</p><p>“The ultimate goal is to establish defence capabilities that can permanently safeguard democratic Taiwan,” Lai said at a news conference in Taipei after announcing the $40bn spending plan in an opinion piece in The Washington Post newspaper.</p><p>Lai’s announcement came as Tokyo and Beijing were locked in a weeks-long diplomatic spat that followed <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan\">remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi</a> suggesting Japan could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.</p><p>China claims the island is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to regain control over it.</p><h2 id=\"us-reaction\">US reaction</h2><p>The US’s top envoy in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, said he “welcomes” the government’s spending plan and urged the island’s rival political parties to “find common ground” on boosting its defences.</p><p>Lai said the extra spending would go towards new arms purchases from the US, as well as enhancing Taiwan’s ability to wage asymmetrical warfare.</p><p>But he said the spending was not tied to Taiwan’s ongoing tariff negotiations with the US, insisting the main goal was to “demonstrate Taiwan’s determination to defend” itself.</p><p>His comments also follow <a href=\"/news/2018/9/25/us-approves-330m-military-sale-to-taiwan-draws-chinese-anger\">US approval earlier this month</a> for $330m of parts and components in Washington’s first military sale to Taiwan since Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p>Lai, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), previously laid out plans to boost annual defence spending to more than 3 percent of gross domestic product next year and 5 percent by 2030.</p><p>Trump has demanded Taiwan raise its defence spending to as much as 10 percent of GDP, a proportion well above what the US or any of its key allies spend.</p><p>The government has proposed $949.5bn New Taiwan dollars ($30bn), or 3.32 percent of GDP, for defence spending next year.</p><h2 id=\"higher-than-expected\">Higher than expected</h2><p>The additional spending plan announced on Wednesday exceeds the $32bn previously revealed to the AFP news agency by a senior DPP politician.</p><p>Speaking earlier in Beijing, Peng Qingen, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was allowing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">“external forces”</a> to dictate its decisions.</p><p>In the opinion piece, Lai said he would accelerate the development of the so-called “T-Dome” – a multi-layered air defence system – which will “bring us closer to the vision of an unassailable Taiwan, safeguarded by innovation and technology”.</p><p>But the government may struggle to get the proposed spending approved by parliament, where the main opposition Kuomintang party, which advocates closer ties with China, controls the purse strings with the help of the Taiwan People’s Party.</p><p>Recently elected Kuomintang chairperson Cheng Li-wun has previously opposed Lai’s defence spending plans, saying Taiwan “doesn’t have that much money”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
