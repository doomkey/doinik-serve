This integration means African businesses can now settle payments with China directly in renminbi without the use of any intermediary currency – notably the United States dollar (USD).</p><p>The USD has been the world’s principal reserve currency since the end of World War II, and is used in more than 80 percent of international trade today.</p><p>But in recent years, talk of alternatives to the greenback has been gaining traction, particularly in the Global South, and spearheaded by the BRICS group of developing economies, of which South Africa is a part, along with Brazil, Russia, India and China as the founding members. Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates have also joined in recent years.</p><p>Like South Africa, Brazil has also integrated into CIPS. At the same time, it has increasingly been using the real and the yuan to settle bilateral trade with China, such as in the sale of soya beans, bypassing the USD.</p><p>Other countries have also been leaning into the use of local currencies. India and the UAE have traded in rupee and dirham, while China and the UAE have settled liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade in yuan. China has traded with others, including Argentina, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, using the yuan. And China and Russia have sharply shifted their bilateral trade settlement into local currencies, partly as a workaround to bypass Western sanctions. China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia has mainly been settled in renminbi. India and Russia have increased the use of roubles and rupees for their bilateral trade.</p><p>As a group, BRICS is also pushing ahead with its Bridge digital currency that, if successful, would allow them to trade bypassing both the USD and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) – a messaging network banks use to facilitate international payments, which is heavily influenced by US and European Union regulations. Although the Bridge system is not yet active, a working model is expected to be presented during this year’s BRICS summit in India.</p><p>For analysts, bilateral trade allowing countries to set their own terms has always been part of international economics. So such endeavours are not new or unexpected.</p><p>However, they are increasing in frequency as there is more incentive to move away from sole dependence on the USD, say analysts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3766309\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3766309\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2015-03-13T120000Z_325275701_GM1EB3D1PDE01_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-CURRENCIES-1749565248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Money\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A currency exchange operator counts US dollars in Abuja, Nigeria [File: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hidden-costs-that-benefit-the-us\">‘Hidden costs’ that benefit the US</h2><p>While the US, as the world’s leading economy, has historically dominated global trade, that influence has waned over the last decade, with China taking the lead, especially in the Global South, which accounts for 85 percent of the world’s population and about 50 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>In Africa, for example, China was the source of most of the continent’s imports in 2024, followed by the EU, India and the US, according to the United Nations Comtrade database. For that reason, bilateral trade in local currencies, or integrating CIPS, makes economic sense, analysts say.</p><p>“For every time you do a transaction in the dollar, there is a hidden cost that goes back to the US,” notes Sanusha Naidu, a foreign policy analyst at South African think tank, the Institute for Global Dialogue.</p><p>Now, according to the analyst, countries around the world have rightly started asking: “Why must we pay the US that cost?”</p><p>Instead of the buyer’s local currency getting converted into USD before being converted into the seller’s currency, with both parties risking losing some revenue in the process, money can now flow directly.</p><p>But for Danny Bradlow, a professor with the Centre for Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria, local currency trade faces challenges; and these are less about what is possible and more about what is practical.</p><p>Although two countries can trade in whatever currency they choose, whether each party would want stores of the other’s currency is unclear, he said.</p><p>For example, if two countries with not many transactions between them – like Botswana and Mexico – want to trade goods, it would be more practical for them to convert pulas and pesos into dollars to trade with the in-demand USD than to keep large amounts of one another’s tender.</p><p>Another challenge in bypassing the USD is that the “infrastructure that supports trade settlement in local currencies must first be in place to ensure the wide adoption of local currency transactions”, said Shirley Yu, managing director of ACME Macro Advisory and director of the China-Africa Initiative at the London School of Economics.</p><p>As well as CIPS, she pointed to BRICS Pay (a decentralised financial messaging and payment system designed for BRICS nations) and Project mBridge (a multi-central bank digital currency platform), which are enabled by blockchain technology. “The technology infrastructure itself enables countries to trade in local currencies without going through SWIFT or using the dollar as the medium of exchange”, but these need to be built up, she said.</p><p>Although the number of local currency transactions is increasing, it is still a fraction of what goes through SWIFT and the USD. The Chinese currency is still involved in less than 10 percent of global trade, for instance. While other currencies, like the European tender, are also in use globally, Yu noted that “the renminbi is a bigger trade settlement currency than the euro”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"incentives-to-change\">‘Incentives’ to change</h2><p>But what has shifted and grown dramatically are “the incentives to change and develop alternatives”, said Bradlow of Pretoria University, “and one of the ways you see that is that the price of gold is going up so much”.</p><p>Countries are no longer treating the USD as a fully stable reserve currency; instead, they are managing and hedging their risk against it, says Naidu. The rise in gold and silver prices signals this declining trust in the dollar, she adds.</p><p>Chris Weafer, an investment analyst with Macro-Advisory, a strategic consultancy that focuses on Eurasia, says political changes in the US have led to this distrust.</p><p>“President [Donald] Trump’s lack of predictability and the huge US debt mean that the US dollar is not as safe or as predictable as it used to be.” The US national debt is currently more than <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/23/us-national-debt-surpasses-a-record-38-trillion\">$38 trillion</a>.</p><p>“But even without Trump, many people around the world – even in the West – would say that the role of the dollar is a problem,” Bradlow argued.</p><p>“Having a system that’s so heavily dependent on the dollar means … vulnerability to US monetary and economic policies. Shifting to a system that is more diversified or more internationalised in some way but not subject to one country’s control would be more acceptable to everyone,” he says.</p><p>But does that mean the end – or even the beginning of the end – for the US dollar?</p><p>Most analysts still say no.</p><p>“The US dollar will remain the global reference currency, for example, pricing oil or materials, and would be the world central banks’ main reserve currency,” Weafer said.</p><p>There are currently “no alternatives to the US dollar in terms of currency”, he said.</p><p>But experts also say a replacement for the USD is not necessarily what the Global South and BRICS countries are seeking. What they want is diversification and alternative or additional trade settlement systems – ways to get around SWIFT or a Western hegemonic system through which the US asserts its dominance.</p><p>However, even these alternatives “will still rely on the US dollar as a reference currency”, Weafer noted.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US will also do all it can to protect the dominance of the dollar, Yu said.</p><p>“President Trump wants to ensure the dollar’s global dominance, through the Genius Act,” she notes, referring to the US law that creates a framework for issuing and supervising US‑dollar stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like the USD.</p><p>“The dollar is fundamental to the US national power, therefore, national security. The global dominance of the dollar will be protected at all costs.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"usd-in-a-slow-burn-decline\">USD in a ‘slow burn’ decline</h2><p>Although the USD faces no real competition and will maintain its position, for international relations expert Naidu, the debate playing out is about more than just the “hard currency” value of the dollar. It is about the rise and fall of nations and how hegemonic power tends to peak and unravel after 70-80 years.</p><p>The USD, like the US empire itself, is a “wounded hegemon”, she said.</p><p>When a hegemon becomes wounded and feels its dominance challenged, “it becomes very dangerous and unpredictable”.</p><p>Naidu said the four pillars of US structural power – security, finance, knowledge and production – have all been anchored in the dollar. As more countries become risk-averse to the dollar, and as alternative payment systems emerge, these pillars weaken.</p><p>So while the USD is not about to be suddenly replaced, it is undergoing a “slow burn” decline, she said, arguing that this is more dangerous and consequential than if it were a rapid collapse.</p><p>Although the world is a long way away from having another currency to rival the dollar, if one were to emerge in the “very long term”, many experts say it might be China that is next in line.</p><p>If countries lose confidence in the US economy, political leadership and dollar, “eventually, it will be the rise and greater use of the Chinese yuan that will break the global dominance of the US dollar,” Weafer said, especially in the Global South.</p><p>Yu said “the scale of dedollarisation will certainly expand among Global South countries”, especially in the light of recent geopolitical events in Venezuela, and US tensions with Iran.</p><p>But “the quantum shift for the global currency architecture will happen when the petroyuan replaces the petrodollar”, she added, referring to a scenario where the yuan becomes the currency used for global oil pricing and settlement – a function currently performed by the USD.</p><p>“This event, if it does happen, will signal the end of the US dollar as the global central reserve currency,” Yu said, noting how China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia over the past few years has already largely been conducted in renminbi.</p><p>The bottom line, according to analysts, is that there is no imminent or even medium-term threat to the USD, but that is less because of anything the greenback is doing right, and more because international trade, for the most part, has few other options at the moment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Shawon had gone to jail with Musabbir four times under the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which was widely accused of brutal crackdowns on the political opposition, including through mass arrests, killings and forced disappearances.</p><p>That era of fear, many Bangladeshis believed, had ended with Hasina’s ouster in the popular student-led uprising, which forced her to flee to India on August 5, 2024.</p><p>But while the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who replaced Hasina, is not accused of orchestrating any such excesses, political violence in Bangladesh is surging again ahead of the upcoming vote.</p><p>“Police say there was no political motive [behind Musabbir’s killing], but fear doesn’t disappear,” said Shawon, a leader of the BNP’s student wing in the capital, Dhaka. “We don’t want killings or confrontation with anyone. But the reality is, during elections, violence feels inevitable.”</p><p>Bangladesh is heading to the polls for the first time since Hasina was removed from power, ending more than 15 years of hardline government.

It represents both a chance for reunion after a long separation, and an opportunity to secure treatment for their son, whose life, schooling, and normal childhood have all been destroyed by the two-year war.</p><p>With the United States pushing a deeply intransigent Israel to progress to phase two of the ceasefire that began on October 10, the reopening of the Rafah crossing was directly tied by the far-right government to the recovery of the remains of the final Israeli captive, and only partially for pedestrian use under strict military supervision.</p><p>On Monday, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/remains-of-last-israeli-captive-in-gaza-retrieved-says-israel\">retrieval of the last Israeli captive’s body</a> appeared to open that locked door, with thousands in urgent need of treatment or family reunification in a state of anxious anticipation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>From her family’s displacement site in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Khitam, 50, a mother of six, sits trying to organise her thoughts as news circulates about Rafah.</p><p>Next to her is her 14-year-old son, Yousef, unable to walk, suffering from a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a painful condition primarily affecting his bone development, with potential cardiac complications.</p><p>“Yousef has been undergoing treatment for this syndrome since he was very young … he has had around 16 surgeries,” Khitam tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We got used to hospitals, but before the war, there was some monitoring and a little hope.”</p><p>Since long before October 2023, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been a lifeline for Palestinians, not only as a natural exit and entry point, but also as a symbol of connection with the outside world.</p><p>Before the war, the crossing was heavily used by patients seeking medical treatment, families visiting relatives abroad, and the movement of goods and supplies that helped ease Gaza’s economic pressure under Israeli blockade.</p><p>Its closure, beginning in May 2024 after Israeli forces took control, marked a dramatic turning point in the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>The shutdown affected not just the movement of people, but also significantly reduced the flow of medical aid and essential supplies, impacting thousands of patients waiting for treatment outside Gaza, including children and the wounded, amid a severe shortage of health services and medical equipment.</p><h2 id=\"opening-the-crossing-shouldn-t-be-a-miracle\">‘Opening the crossing shouldn’t be a miracle’</h2><p>Before the war, Khitam and her family monitored Yousef’s condition regularly, and he could walk and move.</p><p>But the war halted everything. <a href=\"/news/2025/4/13/timeline-israels-attacks-on-hospitals-throughout-its-war-on-gaza\">Hospitals were routinely bombed by Israel</a>, and most ceased functioning. Medics were killed by the hundreds, medications ran out, and medical checkups became nearly impossible.</p><p>“Since the war, Yousef’s condition has deteriorated. His legs are weaker, walking is harder, he uses crutches,” Khitam pauses before continuing: “He falls often… and my heart is in my throat every time.”</p><p>The mother no longer knows the full extent of her son’s health. “I don’t know if he has heart complications, or if his spine has worsened … we are living with him with no answers.”</p><p>The war also separated the family. Weeks before the conflict erupted, Khitam’s 52-year-old husband, Hatim, had left Gaza for Egypt, as an initial step to secure a chance for the family to migrate and access advanced medical care for Yousef.</p><p>“Since then, I’ve been alone. Six children, one with a special medical condition, war, displacement, hunger,” Khitam says, her voice exhausted.</p><p>“Being displaced alone is so difficult. You don’t know where to go, how to protect your children, how to provide food or safety. The constant anxiety and fear have affected everyone, but Yousef suffers the most.”</p><p>“No school, no play, no outings, no treatment … even psychologically, he is exhausted. A child his age should be living his life, not caught between war and illness.”</p><p>But, she adds, “just the idea of travelling eases us a bit psychologically. It feels like a door might open” for treatment outside of the besieged enclave.</p><p>She still fears how the crossing will operate, even as hope keeps her going.</p><p>“Even if the crossing opens, not everyone can leave, and not every case will be approved,” she adds. “Opening the crossing shouldn’t be a miracle… it’s a right.”</p><p>Yousef’s story intersects with those of hundreds of families of sick children in Gaza, for whom Rafah is not just a crossing, but a lifeline.</p><h2 id=\"the-family-started-a-new-battle-against-time\">‘The family started a new battle against time’</h2><p>Local estimates indicate that more than 22,000 patients and injured people, including about 5,200 children, are unable to travel for treatment due to the Israeli closure, with thousands more waiting for approved medical transfers that cannot be executed.</p><p>Among them is Hur Qeshta, a newborn girl only 15 days old, born with a large, unusual tumour in her neck, affecting breathing and swallowing.</p><p>She requires urgent surgery outside Gaza, according to doctors at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.</p><p>Her mother, Doaa Qeshta, 32 and a mother of five, tells Al Jazeera, “From the first moment she was born, the family started a new battle against time to ensure she could urgently travel for treatment.”</p><p>Hur was delivered via Caesarean section and now lies in the Nasser Hospital neonatal ICU, on oxygen and fed via a tube from her abdomen.</p><p>“She can’t breastfeed, everything is through a tube, and the mass is growing rapidly … all within 15 days,” says her mother.</p><p>Doctors confirmed that surgery inside Gaza is currently impossible due to a lack of facilities.</p><p>Doaa links her daughter’s condition to the circumstances during her pregnancy, including displacement in a tent in al-Mawasi, exposure to nearby shelling, smoke, gunpowder, hunger, and lack of nutrition.</p><p>“I was pregnant during famine … no food, no vitamins, no safety,” she recalls. “Shelling was nearby, 300 metres (980 feet) away… the tent shook; we thought we were dead.”</p><p>“Opening the crossing means saving my daughter’s life,” she says. “I’ve registered the whole family as companions … the most important thing is Hur goes, gets treatment, and survives.”</p><p>Of the reopening of the Rafah crossing, Doaa says, “We hear news and live on hope, but we are really in a limbo… we don’t know what’s happening or when. We just pray this is true.”</p><h2 id=\"our-lives-and-futures-hang-on-a-hope\">‘Our lives and futures hang on a hope’</h2><p>The effects of Rafah’s closure go beyond medical access, affecting an entire generation of youth whose education has been halted at a closed gate.</p><p>Among those affected is Rana Bana, a 20-year-old from the Daraj neighbourhood in Gaza City.</p><p>She graduated from high school in 2023 with a 98 percent average in the science track, with a focus on pharmacy. Within a single year, she received multiple opportunities abroad, but none materialised due to Rafah’s closure.</p><p>“In 2024, I was accepted for a scholarship in Egypt, ready to leave, but the crossing closed. A year later, I got a scholarship to Turkiye, did the online interviews, was accepted, and since then I’ve been stuck,” Rana tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>Her Turkish scholarship includes 220 students from Gaza, all from different disciplines, most with high academic grades.</p><p>Over the past two years, Rana tried not to stagnate, taking Turkish language courses and exploring alternatives like local universities. But she would hold back each time she heard news of Rafah possibly reopening.</p><p>“Every time there’s news the crossing might open, I tell myself, ‘Let me wait a bit’… but it turns out to be just talk, and my hopes are dashed,” she adds. “A lot of our time and life has been wasted waiting … our lives and futures hang on a hope.”</p><p>Rana is displaced with her family of eight. They returned briefly to northern Gaza during the first ceasefire, found their home intact, but fled again after fighting resumed, and are now settled in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“My biggest fear is leaving and not being able to come back,” she says. “Before, they [her family] were 100 percent supportive. Now there’s fear because the travel process is unclear, and they don’t know how many will be allowed or registered to travel.”</p><p>Many Palestinians fear leaving Rafah would be a one-way ticket as part of an openly touted Israeli plan to permanently expel the population from Gaza.</p><p>“We students and youth are the most affected group during the war,” Rana says. “Our years have gone by silently, our studies destroyed by war, and no one talks about us. All we want is education — not travel for tourism or anything else.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The military said in a statement that parts of the primary oil processing facility were hit. There were no initial reports of casualties.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">One person was injured, and two business enterprises caught fire in the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban – also in Russia’s Krasnodar – after fragments fell from a destroyed drone, the regional emergencies centre said.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 34 in the Krasnodar region.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"military-aid\">Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Ukraine’s interception rate of Russian missiles and drones has decreased due to Kyiv having fewer weapons to protect it from incoming attacks.

Moscow has insisted that for the war to end, Russia must take over all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Johann Wadephul denounced Russia’s “stubborn insistence on the crucial territorial issue” following the talks in Abu Dhabi.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>European Union countries have approved a ban on Russian gas imports by late 2027, a move to cut ties with their former top energy supplier nearly four years after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal welcomed the ban, saying in a statement that independence from Russian energy “is, above all, about a safe and strong Europe”.</li>\n<li>Germany’s Wadephul said that Russia is testing European countries’ resilience with hybrid tactics, such as the damaging of undersea cables, the jamming of GPS signals and the deployment of a shadow fleet of vessels to break sanctions, as its deadly war in Ukraine continues.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Hungarian <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/hungary-protesters-demand-pm-viktor-orban-quits-over-child-abuse-cases\">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> said that Budapest would summon Ukraine’s ambassador over what Orban said were attempts by Kyiv to interfere in a Hungarian parliamentary election due on April 12.

We think they’re going to. If they don’t disarm, then they’ve breached the deal.

Even so, the fact that that was put out there for reporters to discuss publicly is a significant step,” she said.</p><p>“How long is it going to take to work out these terms? Well, it certainly depends on what the Israelis, the Americans , their various interlocutors – the Qataris, the Turkish, the Egyptians – what they are all able to bring to the table with Hamas in order to get this figured out. But some sort of amnesty has now been publicly floated,” she added.</p><p>On Monday, Israel confirmed that the remains of the last captive held in Gaza, Ran Gvili, had been positively identified and that all those held in the war-torn Palestinian territory “have now been repatriated”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hamas said on Monday the return of remains of captives underscored its commitment to phase one of the ceasefire agreement, and that it had “fulfilled all its obligations in a clear and responsible manner”.</p><p>Israel must now hold up its side of the ceasefire deal “without any deduction or delay”.</p><p>“Especially the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/hamas-says-gave-israel-mediators-details-about-last-gaza-captives-remains\">opening of the Rafah crossing</a> in both directions without restrictions, the entry of the Gaza Strip’s needs in the required quantities, the lifting of the ban on any of them, the complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and facilitating the work of the National Committee for the management of the Gaza Strip,” the group said.</p><p>Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan states that once all captives are returned, Hamas members who decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage under the plan. The plan also states that aid must flow “freely” into the enclave, and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt is to be reopened.</p><p>Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan met Hamas officials in Ankara on Monday and discussed the second phase of the ceasefire agreement and humanitarian conditions in the enclave, a ministry source told Reuters.</p><p>The minister briefed the Hamas officials about Turkiye’s efforts in international platforms, including Trump’s Board of Peace, to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza, the source added.</p><p>Turkiye’s official Anadolu news agency reported that Fidan said efforts to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to Gaza “would continue with determination”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In the following weeks, Hamas releases two Israeli-American captives and two elderly captives, and Israeli forces recover an Israeli soldier taken captive during the attack.</p><p><strong>November:</strong> A deal is reached between Israel and Hamas that will result in the largest release of captives until the 2025 ceasefire deal, with 81 Israeli women and children and 24 foreign captives released. The agreement includes a slight increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza, choked off by Israel in defiance of international law, and the release of 240 Palestinian women and teenage detainees and prisoners held by Israel, many of them being held without charge.</p><p><strong>December:</strong> Israeli forces in Gaza shoot and kill <a href=\"/news/2023/12/16/israeli-hostages-mistakenly-killed-in-gaza-were-had-a-white-flag-official\">three Israeli captives</a> holding a white flag and attempting to be rescued, underscoring the lax rules around the use of force by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip.</p><h2 id=\"2024\">2024</h2><p><strong>February:</strong> Israeli forces recover two captives during a raid in southern Gaza as protesters in Israel call for a deal to bring the remaining captives home.</p><p><strong>June:</strong> Israeli forces conduct a raid in the Nuseirat neighbourhood of central Gaza to recover four captives, accompanied by indiscriminate bombing and attacks in the surrounding area that kill at least 274 Palestinians.</p><p><strong>July:</strong> <a href=\"/news/2024/7/31/israel-subjecting-palestinian-detainees-to-torture-and-abuse-un-report\">A report</a> by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights finds that Israel is holding about 9,400 Palestinians as “security detainees”, often without giving them a reason for their detention, in facilities where abuses such as torture and sexual assault are widespread.</p><p><strong>August:</strong> The discovery of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/new-footage-shows-six-israeli-captives-held-in-gaza-tunnel-prior-to-deaths\">six dead Israeli captives</a> in a Hamas tunnel in southern Gaza sparks anger in Israel and mounting pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives. The Israeli leader is accused of sabotaging negotiations on several occasions in order to continue the war. A video is released of several Israeli security force members gang-raping a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman detention facility in Israel, notorious for abuse and torture.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>December:</strong> United States President-elect Donald Trump says there will be “hell to pay” if remaining captives are not released before his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Israeli forces detain Doctor <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/a-year-on-israel-still-holds-gaza-doctor-hussam-abu-safia-without-charge\">Hussam Abu Safia</a>, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, keeping him imprisoned without charge or trial. His lawyers later say he is tortured in Israeli detention, where he remains despite international calls for his release.</p><h2 id=\"2025\">2025</h2><p><strong>January:</strong> A ceasefire deal is reached for the release of 33 Israeli captives, 25 of them living and eight dead, and hundreds of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Under the deal, a second phase of negotiations is supposed to lead to the release of the remaining captives and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, but Netanyahu unilaterally breaks off the agreement and resumes the war after six weeks. Hamas additionally releases five Thai workers who were among those taken captive by Palestinian fighters on October 7, 2023.</p><p><strong>February:</strong> Israel releases 600 Palestinian detainees after a delay, while Hamas releases Israeli-American Keith Siegel, Israeli-French Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas, along with six other captives. The group later releases six more captives, and returns the bodies of Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were aged four years and nine months respectively when kidnapped, along with their mother, Shiri Bibas, and a man in his 80s named Oded Lifshitz. The fate of the family causes anguish and anger in Israel and the UN condemns the “abhorrent” treatment of captives and their remains by Hamas.</p><p><strong>March:</strong> Israel breaks the ceasefire and <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/israel-launches-gaza-assault-killing-hundreds-and-shattering-ceasefire\">resumes the war</a> with a wave of bombings and attacks across Gaza that kill at least 404 Palestinians in the first day, many of them children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>May:</strong> Hamas hands over Israeli-American Edan Alexander, the last surviving US captive held in Gaza.</p><p><strong>October:</strong> A ceasefire agreement is reached between Hamas and Israel to secure the release of the remaining captives and the remains of the deceased held in Gaza, and Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel. Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/what-we-know-about-the-torture-abuse-of-palestinian-prisoners-by-israel\">releases the bodies</a> of more than 100 dead Palestinians, most of whom are unidentified and many showing signs of torture, and continues to regularly bomb Gaza and restrict the flow of humanitarian aid.</p><p><strong>November:</strong> The rights group Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHRI) <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/its-israeli-policy-report-reveals-abuse-of-palestinians-in-prisons\">releases a report </a>stating that at least 94 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention from causes such as torture, medical neglect, malnutrition, and assault. The report states that the true number is likely higher.</p><h2 id=\"2026\">2026</h2><p><strong>January:</strong> Central Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital says it received nine living Palestinian detainees released by Israel, shortly after the military said it had recovered the body of the last captive held in the Palestinian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"
