Critics say it’s deepening poverty and pushing the country into chaos, while Milei continues to make headlines for bizarre behaviour, including claims he takes political advice from his dead dog’s clones.</p><p>So who is really running Argentina – and at what cost?</p><p>Mehdi Hasan goes head-to-head with Diana Mondino, who served as Milei’s foreign minister before being abruptly fired. She defends the president’s policies, brushes off Milei’s personal attacks, and distances herself from his more extreme views, including his support for organ sales and his insults towards the late Pope Francis.</p><p><strong>Joining the discussion are:<br>\n</strong>Matias Vernengo – Economics professor at Bucknell University and former official at Argentina’s Central Bank<br>\nMaxwell Marlow – Director of public affairs at the Adam Smith Institute<br>\nMartina Rodriguez – Member of the Argentina Solidarity Campaign and the Feminist Assembly of Latin Americans</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thank you for your attention to this problem!”</p><p>Trump’s post appeared to be a response to reports that Tan has invested nearly $200m in Chinese technology manufacturing and chip firms, including some with links to the country’s military.</p><p>But the president’s social media message also raises concerns about his apparent willingness to get involved in the affairs of private companies, even calling for dramatic changes in leadership and direction.</p><h2 id=\"scrutiny-on-tan-s-ties-to-china\">Scrutiny on Tan’s ties to China</h2><p>Tan, a longtime technology investor, is relatively new to his post. He <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/tan-joins-intel-ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was appointed</a> as Intel’s CEO on March 12, and he also serves on the company’s board of directors.</p><p>Previously, Tan served in leadership positions at the software company Cadence Design Systems, and he was a founding partner for the venture capital firm Walden Catalyst Ventures.</p><p>His personal investments — and the investments of the venture funds he manages — caught the public’s attention shortly after his appointment at Intel, though.</p><p>In April, the news agency Reuters reported that, between March 2012 and December 2024, Tan invested in Chinese firms that create technology for the People’s Liberation Army, China’s armed forces.</p><p>For some US politicians, that raised a conflict of interest.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On Wednesday, for instance, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1953108003525185686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a letter on social media written to the chairman of Intel’s board of directors, Frank Yeary.</p><p>In it, he demanded more information about Tan’s hiring and his investments in China.</p><p>Cotton pointed out that, on July 28, Cadence Design Systems agreed to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cadence-design-systems-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-over-140-million-unlawfully-exporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plead guilty</a> to federal charges concerning the sale of technology and intellectual property to China’s National University of Defense Technology.</p><p>That plea deal resulted in criminal and civil penalties of more than $140m.</p><p>“I write to express concern about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on US national security,” Cotton wrote in his letter to Yeary.</p><p>“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”</p><p>In an accompanying message to his social media followers, Cotton added that Intel “owes Congress an explanation”. Intel and Tan have yet to respond to the concerns.</p><h2 id=\"trump-pushes-america-first-plan\">Trump pushes ‘America First’ plan</h2><p>For years, the US and China have been locked in tense competition for economic and political dominance, and the US has repeatedly accused China of attempting to poach American innovation and spy on its technology firms.</p><p>China, meanwhile, has denied such allegations, describing them as part of a US smear campaign.</p><p>Founded in 1968, Intel has long been a flagship US technology firm, known for producing computer parts like microprocessors. But in recent decades, the company has struggled to keep pace with its competitors, particularly as artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed Silicon Valley, Intel’s longtime home.</p><p>Trump, however, has sought to bolster domestic manufacturing with his “America First” economic agenda, which leverages tariffs to discourage the import of products from abroad.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Republican leader even said he planned to impose <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/6/white-house-says-apple-to-invest-billions-in-us-manufacturing\">100-percent tariffs</a> on foreign chips and semiconductors sold in the US.</p><p>But Trump has faced criticism for testing the boundaries of his executive power — and, in some cases, seeking to impose his will on the running of private companies.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term, for instance, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">has withheld federal funds</a> from private universities in order to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/columbia-university-to-pay-200m-to-settle-anti-semitism-claims\">extract guarantees</a> that those institutions would eliminate their diversity initiatives and implement disciplinary reforms, among other demands.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters, analysts appeared split over whether Trump was overplaying his hand.</p><p>“Many investors likely believe that President Trump has his hand in too many cookie jars, it’s just another signal that he’s very serious about trying to bring business back to the US,” said David Wagner, the head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has invested in Intel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phil Blancato, the CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, told Reuters that Trump ousting Tan could have a chilling effect on US business.</p><p>“It would be setting a very unfortunate precedent,” Blancato said. “You don’t want American presidents dictating who runs companies, but certainly his opinion has merit and weight.”</p><p>It is unclear how Trump’s pressure campaign against Tan may affect Intel’s future.</p><p>Last year, Intel received $8bn in subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, to build further chip manufacturing plants in the US.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said Arab forces.</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>In an interview with Fox News, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel intends to take control of the entire Gaza Strip, but does not want to govern it.</span></p><p>His comments came on Thursday shortly before Israel’s cabinet meets to consider his proposal to take over the Strip.</p><p>“We intend to [take over] in order to ensure our security, remove Hamas [from] there … and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel,” he said.</p><p>Netanyahu said in the interview that Israel wants a security perimeter, and wants to hand Gaza over to Arab forces to govern the territory.</p><p>“We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don’t want to govern it. We don’t want to be there as a governing body.”</p><p>The Israeli security cabinet meeting comes as international outrage over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with United Nations agencies warning of famine in the devastated territory.</p><p>Gaza’s hospitals have recorded four new deaths “due to famine and malnutrition over the past 24 hours”, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry, raising the total number of hunger-related deaths to 197, including 96 children, since Israel’s war on Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid noted that Netanyahu’s statements were quite different from what had been reported in Israeli media about a full-blown occupation of Gaza, but cautioned that “this is an interview that he gave to one of the American networks”.</p><p>For days now, Israeli media has been reporting that Netanyahu is set to seek approval to expand military operations, including in densely populated areas where captives are believed to be held.</p><p>This comes despite growing concern among Israelis about the fate of the remaining captives, some of whose families set sail from the port of Ashkelon on Thursday seeking to approach the Gaza Strip.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In the run-up to the meeting, rumours have been rife in the Israeli press about disagreements between the cabinet and Israel’s military chief, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, who is said to oppose plans to fully reoccupy Gaza.</p><p>On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz had weighed in on social media, saying that “it is the right and duty of the chief of staff to express his position”, but the military must ultimately respect any policies adopted by the government.</p><p>In a statement released by the military on Thursday, Zamir underscored his independence, promising to “continue to express our position without fear”.</p><p>“We are not dealing with theory – we are dealing with matters of life and death, with the defence of the state, and we do so while looking directly into the eyes of our soldiers and citizens,” Zamir said in the statement.</p><p>Gideon Levy, an Israeli journalist at local newspaper Haaretz, says the Israeli prime minister’s remarks about another governing body taking over Gaza are “far-fetched” and not realistic.</p><p>“What does he mean, another force will take over Gaza? Who is going to get into Gaza, who will be willing to do so, except for the Israeli military, obviously?” Levy told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said it appeared clear that the real goal of such a move is “aiming at an ethnic cleansing of Gaza.”</p><p>“There is a goal for this war … to push all the people of Gaza to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/israel-presses-ahead-gaza-concentration-camp-plans-despite-criticism\">this ‘humanitarian’ concentration camp</a> and then offer them to leave Gaza,” Levy said.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

There’s a kind of cognitive dissonance at play that helps them make sense of it.”</p><p>Then there is the language used by politicians, the media and, ultimately, the public to discuss the war, Israeli sociologist Yehouda Shenhav-Shahrabani said.</p><p>“They’ve corrupted language. Instead of ‘<a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/lapid-olmert-slam-israels-plans-for-concentration-camps-in-gazas-rafah\">concentration camps</a>‘, they say ‘humanitarian city’. Instead of talking about ‘killing’, they say ‘elimination’. Every military operation has a biblical name, which we now use to measure time.</p><p>“We don’t say ‘such and such a thing’ happened in June. We say, ‘during Operation Whatever’. It helps people make sense of everything. The jargon’s become a new type of speech. It’s become Orwell’s 1984,” he said, referring to the dystopian novel in which language is dictated by the state.</p><h2 id=\"changing-tides\">Changing tides</h2><p>However, while most Israelis have continued to see Gaza’s starvation through the lens of its media and politicians, there are signs that, at its fringes, the mood is beginning to shift, observers say.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3726635\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3726635\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3726635\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Standing-Togethers-Alon-Lee-Green-is-arrested-while-protesting-near-the-Israeli-Gaza-border-1747911704.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Standing Together's Alon-Lee Green is arrested while protesting near the Israeli-Gaza border [Courtesy of Standing Together]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3726635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Standing Together’s Alon-Lee Green is arrested while protesting near Gaza [Courtesy of Standing Together]</figcaption></figure><p>“This isn’t going to hold up,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al party, said.</p><p>“More and more, people are beginning to understand that there is real hunger in Gaza, and if Israel is making such a big deal of sending food now, then how can it not have been responsible for the hunger before?”</p><p>Meanwhile, activists such as Alon-Lee Green of the Israeli-Palestinian group Standing Together say resistance to the war is growing across all parts of Israeli society – albeit for often widely differing reasons.</p><p>“We don’t care why people are protesting the war. We don’t care if it’s because you don’t want to do another tour with the army, or you don’t want your children to go to Gaza and kill people. If you’re against the war, you’re welcome,” he said.</p><p>However, despite the killing of more than 61,000 Palestinians since October 2023 – and thousands more lost under the rubble and presumed dead – much of Israeli society has yet to accept that the suffering Israel is inflicting on Gaza is real.<strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>“From my perspective, we’ve reached the point where the Israeli state and society has lost whatever moral claims they had as a result of the Holocaust,” Shenhav-Shahrabani said.</p><p>“They’ve spent whatever symbolic capital that was associated with it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

One AI-driven tool reportedly assigns risk scores to text messages based on certain trigger words, including discussions of weapons or martyrdom.</p><p data-start=\"2582\" data-end=\"2819\">Sariel, who resigned in 2024 after Israel’s intelligence failure on October 7, 2023, had long championed cloud-based surveillance.</p><p data-start=\"2821\" data-end=\"3104\">As Israel’s war on Gaza continues, with more than 61,250 Palestinians killed, including 18,000 children, the surveillance programme remains active.

Russia offered no official comment on the potential <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/white-house-says-trump-is-open-to-talks-with-putin-and-zelenskyy\">trilateral meeting</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2047\" data-end=\"2319\">Zelenskyy signalled support for such a summit, writing on X that “Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side”. He added that discussions had included “two bilateral and one trilateral” format, insisting Europe must be involved in efforts to end the war.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"639\">Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said there are growing fears in Ukraine over the Trump-Putin meeting, especially since Zelenskyy is not expected to take part in the initial talks.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"639\">“People in Ukraine remember back in February that the notorious meeting in the Oval Office between Zelenskyy and Trump, his dressing down by the US president,” Stratford said, adding that many Ukrainians believe their leader was “effectively being strong-armed into … a minerals deal.” Concerns are mounting that Zelenskyy may once again be sidelined while decisions are made that directly affect Ukraine’s future.</p><p data-start=\"641\" data-end=\"1350\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Despite this, Zelenskyy has been reaching out to European allies. He has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Stratford reported, noting that Zelenskyy insisted “it is vital to coordinate any kind of process with Europe because he says that Ukraine is part of Europe”.</p><p data-start=\"2321\" data-end=\"2632\">Despite multiple visits to Moscow by Witkoff since Trump entered office in January after promising to end the war, no breakthrough has materialised. Trump acknowledged the lack of progress, saying: “I don’t call it a breakthrough … we have been working at this for a long time. There are thousands of young people dying … I’m here to get the thing over with.”</p><p data-start=\"2634\" data-end=\"2877\">The Kremlin described Witkoff’s latest discussions as “constructive” and said both sides had exchanged “signals”, though it provided few specifics. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy confirmed he had spoken with Trump about the meeting, alongside European leaders.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"744\">Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst speaking from Moscow, told Al Jazeera that there is confusion surrounding what was actually agreed in recent diplomacy with Witkoff. “Because in Washington they say one thing, in Moscow, they say the other,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"744\">While Witkoff may have raised the possibility of Ukraine joining talks, Felgenhauer said Russia’s silence on the matter can be interpreted as a flat rejection.</p><p data-start=\"746\" data-end=\"1164\">Felgenhauer argued that Moscow is not aiming for a ceasefire, but is instead focused on securing a high-level summit with Trump. “That’s what Putin always wanted. He wants a summit to lecture Trump on why Russia should have a large part of Ukraine and why Ukraine is an artificial state,” he said. While the agenda for the summit is still being formed, he warned that it is unlikely to produce tangible results in terms of a ceasefire.</p><p data-start=\"1166\" data-end=\"1408\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Still, Felgenhauer noted that there is hope in Moscow that the summit could pave the way for improved US-Russia relations. “That’s Putin’s main objective – to improve relations with America and push Ukraine to the side,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2879\" data-end=\"3196\">Expectations remain low that a peace deal will be reached before Trump’s deadline. Russia continues to launch air strikes across Ukraine, and Moscow’s conditions for ending the war, such as Kyiv’s demilitarisation, neutrality and renunciation of NATO membership, remain non-starters for Ukraine and its Western allies.</p><p data-start=\"3198\" data-end=\"3378\">Putin also demands Ukrainian withdrawal from Russian-occupied regions, the formal recognition of Crimea, and the lifting of international sanctions. Kyiv has consistently rejected those terms.</p><p data-start=\"3380\" data-end=\"3674\">Meanwhile, the White House has approved an additional $200m military aid package for Ukraine, including support for drone manufacturing. And in a separate move, Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday imposing 25 percent tariffs on Indian imports over India’s ongoing purchases of Russian oil.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s an extension of yourself; your portal to the world, your way of reaching loved ones scattered across the prison or outside it.</p><p>Through its lens, you sometimes capture joy and beauty, but more often, it only captures falling rockets or the rubble of houses covering the corpses of their residents.</p><p>But what are you left with when that loyal companion is disappeared by the genocidal chaos?</p><h2 id=\"my-phone-succumbed-to-its-injuries\">My phone succumbed to its injuries</h2><p>My phone succumbed to its injuries.</p><p>I can’t believe I’m describing it this way, with the same phrase I use when reporting on thousands of my people killed after being denied urgent medical treatment, punished simply for surviving Israeli bombs.</p><p>But in its own way, my phone endured its share of this prolonged Israeli cruelty, the technocide of power-starvation, corrosion by dust and sand, suffocation in overheated tents, and the constant torment of poor connection.</p><p>It tried to hold on, but everyone has a limit of endurance. It fell the day we left our damaged home for our 14th displacement amid chaotic stampeding crowds.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Somehow it survived the heavy blow, but it only lasted 70 days after its screen cracked, its body blistered, until its wounds spread too far to bear.</p><p>And then it went dark for good.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Oddly, I felt consoled. Not because it wasn’t painful, but because I wasn’t alone. I’ve seen the same happen to others: Friends, relatives watching their phones slowly perish, just like the people they loved.</p><p>Strangely, we find comfort in these small shared losses. Our loved ones have perished, and our wellbeing is shattering, and yet we expect our phones not to. The real miracle is that they lasted this long at all.</p><p>Smartphone addiction is thrown around as a buzzword. But in Gaza, if you’re lucky enough to still have one, it’s not an addiction, it is survival.</p><p>It’s an escape. A small, glowing portal you cling to. It helps you slip briefly into the past, scrolling through memories, staring at the faces of loved ones who are now names on graves or names you still whisper in hope.</p><p>Your phone’s emotionless memory still holds their beautiful smiles. It connects you to people you can’t reach, voices you can’t otherwise hear. It dulls the pain not by healing it, but by distracting you.</p><p>Like a hunger you can’t satisfy, so you scroll through reels of mouth-watering food, mocking your emptiness.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3871799\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3871799\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3871799\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Phone3-1754296478.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The author, dark-haried, wearing glasses, out reporting, wearing his press vest and holding his phone\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3871799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The author reporting, holding his phone tight, on May 3, 2025 [Ahmed Al-Najjar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>You watch strangers at family dinners while your table is buried under rubble.

Yet the quest is disastrous in Gaza.</p><p>You might think it’s impossible to find one here, where life has become ruins and even bread is scarce, but surprisingly, there are plenty of options, even the latest high-end brands that somehow found their way through the blockade.</p><p>But this is Gaza, where a bag of flour costs $700, so the cost of a phone is on a whole different level.</p><p>Even the lowest-quality phones in makeshift shops sell for more than what it costs to build the shop itself, inflated by genocidal conditions.</p><p>And it doesn’t stop there. You must pay in cash, in a place where almost nothing is free except the air you breathe.</p><p>An iPhone might cost $1,000 elsewhere, but here it costs $4,200.</p><p>So you turn to cheaper options, hoping for something more affordable, but the calculations remain the same.</p><p>But that’s not me – because either way, by spending such unthinkable amounts, you’re solidifying the very reality your captors are trying to impose, and doing it with your own money.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>You realise that you’re feeding into their design. We’re already draining whatever’s left in our pockets just for flour during this genocidal siege, and we don’t know how long it will last.</p><p>So you cling to what you have, to avoid paying your soul at a GHF centre for deadly “aid” you’ll never get.</p><p>For a while now, I’ve felt paralysed, a helplessness especially familiar during June’s two-week total communication blackout imposed by Israel – during which my phone finally died in total silence.</p><p>When the captor cuts yet another lifeline, it’s more than just being unable to check on loved ones. It means ambulances can’t be called. It means a wounded person might die in the dark, unheard.</p><p>It’s like someone is out there, cruelly deciding when you’re allowed to contact the world or to be contacted, to receive the now-typical: “Are you alive?”</p><p>There’s a cruel irony in Israel issuing expulsion orders online even as it cuts off the networks people in Gaza need to receive them. You only find out when you see thousands flooding the streets, the earth trembling beneath their feet from Israeli attacks.</p><p>The hand that controls your digital lifeline is the same one that’s been blockading and colonising your land for years.</p><p>And you realise, with certainty, that if they could block the very air you breathe, they would not hesitate.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3871797\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3871797\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3871797\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Phone1-1754296470.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A non-functioning phone on a light-coloured table.

It wasn’t just a phone. It was your sword, your shield, your witness.</p><p>And in the face of this tyranny, surrendering is something you cannot afford. So, you rise.</p><p>You whisper, “Rest in power, my companion,” because we refuse to be slaughtered in silence.</p><p>We will keep telling our truth, even if all we have left is a scrap of paper and a drop of ink.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”</p><p>Trump repeated the idea to reporters on August 6, saying he was “going to look at” revoking the city’s home rule, citing the attack on Coristine.</p><p>Data shows that in recent years, the district has had a significant crime problem, but offences such as homicide, gun-related and aggravated assault, carjacking, vehicle theft, robbery and sexual assault have declined from COVID-19-era peaks.</p><p>But a big question remains: can Trump undertake a federal takeover of the District of Columbia?</p><p>Experts say it’s possible, but not necessarily simple – he’d have to get Congress to agree.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-dc-s-home-rule\">What is DC’s ‘home rule’?</h2><p>The United States Constitution created the District of Columbia as a 10-square-mile seat of the federal government.</p><p>Because the district is not a state, its residents lack full congressional representation; it has one House delegate who cannot vote on the floor, and no senators.</p><p>For about a century until 1973, the city was run by three presidentially appointed commissioners. That year, President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act, enabling district residents to elect a mayor and city council.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>While the home rule law granted the district significant autonomy for local governance, the city still answers to Congress on certain matters, including budgetary oversight and the ability to overturn local legislation.</p><p>“Since 1974, and indeed for all of DC history, members of Congress have interfered in city affairs to fiddle with everything from how long pools are open to banning the city from using its own tax money for a needle exchange programme,” said George Derek Musgrove, a University of Maryland-Baltimore County historian.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-to-federalise-dc\">What does it mean to federalise DC?</h2><p>Trump hasn’t detailed how federalisation would work, or said whether there are specific services he wants to take over.</p><p>Legal scholars agreed, given the explicit language in the Constitution, that Trump cannot simply take over the district and oust its home rule-elected leadership. He would have to work with Congress, the entity entrusted with overseeing the capital.</p><p>“Congress may exercise this authority, not exercise it, or delegate it,” Musgrove said. “With the Home Rule Act of 1973, it delegated a good bit of that authority – though not all – to a local government. It would have to act to reclaim that authority, or to delegate it to another entity, like the executive branch.”</p><p>Congress’s Republican majorities have so far supported Trump’s agenda with near-unanimity, but a repeal of home rule isn’t a sure thing.</p><p>It would need to win passage in the House, which the Republicans narrowly control and where Trump might be able to enforce his will with the majority. But it would also need to clear the Senate, which would take 60 votes, including at least seven Democratic votes, to proceed to final consideration. Democrats have generally been supportive of home rule for the district.</p><p>In February, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andrew Ogles introduced legislation to repeal home rule. But the measure has only three Senate co-sponsors and three House co-sponsors.</p><p>“According to the Constitution, Congress makes the laws for the district,” said University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt. If Trump wants to “federalise DC in order for him to wipe out its Democratic leadership and replace it with people who are loyal only to him, that strikes me as precisely what the framers did not want”.</p><p>Short of a law, the president has other ways to exert influence in the district, including the authority to mobilise the DC National Guard without local consent. That’s a possibility he floated in remarks to reporters on August 6.</p><p>The Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control over the city’s police department in an emergency – something Trump threatened to do in 2020 amid nationwide protests over the killing of <a href=\"/news/2020/6/11/a-timeline-of-the-george-floyd-and-anti-police-brutality-protests\">George Floyd</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-over-time-about-this\">What has Trump said over time about this?</h2><p>Trump has talked broadly since his 2024 campaign about expanding the federal government’s powers over the district, including enhanced oversight and direct management.</p><p>During the March 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump spoke about driving through the district, lamenting dirty roads. “It looked like somebody just took their garbage and just threw it all over the highways, the Beltway. It’s so disgraceful, so disgusting,” Trump said. “… Frankly, the federal government should take over control and management of Washington, DC.”</p><p>During a July 2024 Florida campaign rally, Trump promised to “take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world”.</p><p>Trump echoed this in February, again focusing on blight and crime: “I think the federal government should take over the governance of DC and run it really, really properly.”</p><p>In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the “DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force”. It mandates beautification efforts such as graffiti removal and enhanced park maintenance, and it includes provisions to address violent crime and issues related to homelessness.</p><p>In a July Cabinet meeting, Trump pitched the idea again: “We have tremendous power at the White House to run places where we have to. We could run DC. I mean, we’re … looking at DC. We don’t want crime in DC. We want the city to run well.”</p><h2 id=\"has-home-rule-been-revoked-before\">Has home rule been revoked before?</h2><p>There is precedent for removing home-rule powers, but not recently.</p><p>In 1874, local conservatives angry about voting rights for local Black and working-class white residents teamed up with opponents of Reconstruction-era voting in the South and some of their Northern allies to roll back democratic laws in the district, Musgrove said.</p><p>The changes lasted until Nixon signed the home rule bill a century later.</p><p>A repeal of home rule would not be popular with Washingtonians. In 2024, Trump won less than 6.5 percent of the district’s vote.</p><p>While no city is perfect, the district has built a functioning city government under home rule, Musgrove said.</p><p>“There is no question that people would be mad,” Musgrove said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
