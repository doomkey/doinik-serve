But in late 2024, that stable career hit a speed bump.</p><p>He was laid off from his job amid a round of restructuring. The news landed without warning. One day he had a job, and the next he was sitting at home, staring at the numbers, trying to figure out how to keep paying the mortgage and putting food on the table.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>He is married, and his partner is a teacher, but the math did not work. One salary might cover things for a little while, but not long enough to maintain long-term stability.</p><p>So he started applying for new work immediately. Over three months, he submitted 350 job applications. He got six interviews.</p><p>After months of searching, something moved.</p><p>He advanced in the hiring process for a Washington, DC–based nonprofit, making it far enough to sit across from senior leadership. It felt like he finally caught a break.</p><p>Then the ground shifted again. As Dodge was interviewing for a new job, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, was advising the administration of US President Donald Trump on how to shrink the federal government, and that meant cutting funding to agencies that provide contracts and funds to swaths of nonprofit organisations around the country. The effects rippled outward, and Dodge was caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>Contracts were cancelled and funding streams dried up. Nonprofits that depend on government support had to pull back and scale down ambitions — those very same nonprofits from whom Dodge sought employment.</p><p>“I got a call from HR saying they weren’t going to hire for the position, and that all hiring was on hold. I couldn’t argue with them, because I’d been hearing the same thing from organisations I’d spoken to since I started applying. ‘We were relying on federal funds, and now they’re gone,’” Dodge said.</p><p>Then it was back to the drawing board. He began searching yet again, but this time with a cloud of uncertainty looming over the entire industry he works in. Dodge finally took what he could get — part-time work in his field. The pay was well below what he had been earning before, but he accepted it anyway. Some income, he reasoned, was better than none.</p><p>The result is underemployment. Underemployment can manifest in several ways, often when workers are seeking full-time work but can only find part-time positions, or when the jobs they work do not fully utilise their skills and training. It is generally associated with industries like restaurants or retail, but it also reaches into fields with fewer resources and shrinking opportunities, including the nonprofit sector, where jobs are increasingly precarious and full-time stability is harder to find because of the wave of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/obama-bush-decry-travesty-of-trumps-gutting-of-usaid-on-its-last-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government funding cuts in 2025</a>.</p><p>The upshot is lower incomes for underemployed workers, sometimes below the cost of living or even pushing them into the ranks of the working poor.</p><p>Underemployment has been on the rise, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which has tracked the rate of underemployment since 1978. Today, 8 percent of the US population is underemployed, up 0.5 percent from 2024 and it is up 1.1 percent from 2023.</p><p>At the same time, many in the US are seeing their expenses increase.</p><p>The impact of tariffs has hit low-to-middle-income earners harder than others. Analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found that lower-income households are paying a higher percentage of their post-tax income on goods subject to tariffs as opposed to higher-income households, all while costs for necessities like healthcare are increasing.</p><p>Earlier this year, Congressional leaders failed to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies. Premiums increased by an average of 144 percent, according to analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>“Some people have lost their jobs and found new ones that pay less, but others have kept their jobs, but their healthcare premiums have increased. Their electric bills have also gone up. Their salaries no longer cover basic living costs,” Jillian Hishaw, a personal bankruptcy lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina, said.</p><p>She said that because of increased costs like these and a stalling job market, she is seeing an increase in inquiries about personal bankruptcy filings in efforts by potential clients not to lose their homes to foreclosure.</p><p>“In one day last week, 85 foreclosures were filed in Mecklenburg County [where Charlotte is located]. Foreclosures happen daily, but 85 in a single day is unusually high. Two years ago, the daily average was 10 to 20, but now filings are approaching triple digits each day,” Hishaw said.</p><h2 id=\"shrinking-options\">Shrinking options</h2><p>The surging economic pressures hit workers across various sectors, including financial and administrative services. An Ohio-based accountant who did not want his name to be published, has worked a patchwork of accounting and administrative jobs over the past few years. In March, he was laid off from a research organisation in central Ohio.</p><p>After months of searching, he found new work, but not as an accountant, and the pay falls far short of covering his cost of living.</p><p>“I’m working as a sales coordinator, which I really don’t want to be doing, but it was the only thing I could land with how bad things are. It’s not enough to live on,” he said.</p><p>The labour market is under strain. Layoffs reached more than 1.1 million in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, while job creation failed to keep pace, with just 584,000 jobs added. As a result, more workers are settling for underpaid or part-time work that does not meet basic living expenses, including Dodge and the accountant.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, says that economic uncertainty driven by tariffs and developments in <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/28/amazon-cuts-thousands-of-jobs-amid-ai-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">artificial intelligence</a> has put businesses across a wide set of sectors essentially on pause — maintaining the status quo or scaling back.</p><p>“People who are already at the margins are getting kicked out entirely, and that’s placing pressure on everyone who is clinging to a job,” Evermore told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In January, one of the key measures of underemployment, the number of people who work part-time for economic reasons, such as an inability to find full-time work or had their hours reduced, hit 4.9 million. It was a 453,000 decline from the month before, but is up 410,000 from this time last year, according to the January jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday.</p><p>Long-term unemployment jumped 386,000 from this time a year ago to 1.8 million, although it remains unchanged compared with the previous month.</p><p>The nonprofit sector has been hit particularly hard in the last year, losing 28,729 jobs in 2025, up sharply from 5,640 losses the year before, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p><p>Like the Ohio accountant, Dodge has been searching for new opportunities since he lost his full-time role a year and a half ago. He has applied for 460 jobs and only landed a handful of interviews.</p><h2 id=\"working-weekends-washing-dishes\">Working weekends, washing dishes</h2><p>The market is only getting tighter. US employers cut more than 108,000 jobs in January, while employers only announced intentions to hire 5,300 new roles for the month, the lowest on record since Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas started tracking that in 2009.</p><p>“Employers aren’t wanting to make any big investments right now, including increasing salaries to their workforce,” Evermore, who served as a policy adviser in the US Labor Department during the administration of former US President Joe Biden, added.</p><p>In December, labour market turnover remained stagnant. Amid economic uncertainty and a slowdown in new job growth, many Americans are hanging on to the jobs they already have. Job openings fell to 6.5 million, down 386,000 from the previous month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS).</p><p>Hiring and separations, which include layoffs and firings, were unchanged. That followed November’s report, which similarly showed little movement in both new hiring and the number of workers leaving their jobs.</p><p>Combined, that means that for the underemployed, finding a new role, either part-time to augment their existing income, or to replace it altogether, is increasingly difficult for people like the accountant.</p><p>“I’m also working weekends at a friend’s cafe, washing dishes, and I’m still applying and interviewing for other opportunities. But it’s the same story, no offers. At the same time, I’m debating whether to switch professions or even go back to school, even though I already have a master’s degree,” he said.</p><p>That shared distress has also created an unlikely sense of camaraderie among those struggling to get by, even as the outlook remains bleak.</p><p>Dodge finds it in late-night scrolls through Reddit, watching strangers narrate versions of the same stalled search.</p><p>“I doomscroll a lot,” he said, “getting depressed about the state of politics and the global economy, and taking some solace in knowing I’m not the only one struggling to find viable employment after 12, 13, 14, even 15 months.”</p><p>For now, that recognition of others stuck in the same place, hitting the same walls, is enough to keep him moving forward, submitting applications and waiting for a response that might not even come.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has gone far beyond Washington’s decades-long embargo on the island, threatening crippling tariffs on any country that provides fuel shipments, and, in turn, stifling lifeline supplies from Venezuela and Mexico.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But as the impact of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-countries-supplying-cuba-with-much-needed-oil\">US policy</a> on the lives of Cubans just 90 miles (145 km) away from the US state of Florida comes into increasing focus, the same clarity has not emerged on what the Trump administration actually hopes to achieve in its strategy, analysts have told Al Jazeera.</p><p>That comes as Trump has sent a contradicting message: He has both told reporters he seeks to “work a deal” with the communist government led by Miguel Diaz-Canel and, alternately, plans to make Cuba “free again”, hinting at the regime change long sought by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>“One possibility is that they actually do come to some kind of a deal,” William LeoGrande, a professor focusing on US foreign policy in Latin America at American University, told Al Jazeera. “But the $64,000 question is, what would be the terms of such a deal be?”</p><p>“The second possibility, of course, is that this oil embargo causes social collapse on the island, no electricity, no gasoline, no fuel for anything, and the society literally begins to crumble,” he said.</p><p>A third possibility, LeoGrande explained, is that the US could adopt a Venezuelan-style approach, keeping the government in place while installing a more pliable leader.</p><p>“But I think even if there were such a person high enough up in the Cuban government that they could actually win the loyalty of the armed forces and the government and party bureaucracies, which I doubt, I don’t think the Trump administration has any way to identify them or to communicate with them,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"try-and-bend-the-cuban-government\">‘Try and bend the Cuban government’</h2><p>In the short term, Trump, who has long portrayed himself as the dealmaker-in-chief, appears to be leaning into messaging that calls for an agreement with Diaz-Canel’s strained government, according to Tiziano Breda, a Latin America and the Caribbean senior analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).</p><p>Trump has said both sides are in discussions, although the nature of any contacts and the terms of any proposal have not yet emerged.</p><p>“Trump has shown less interest and eagerness to engage with these left-wing governments on ideological battles,” Breda told Al Jazeera.”The circumstances give me the impression that Trump’s goal would be rather to try and bend the Cuban government, rather than prompting its collapse.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Diaz-Canal, meanwhile, has said he was open to talking to the US, but would only enter dialogue “without pressure or precondition” and with respect to sovereignty.</p><p>In the same breath, he decried Washington’s “criminal policy against a country, as it affects food, transportation, hospitals, schools, economic production and the functioning of our vital systems”.</p><p>Cuba, Diaz-Canel added in statements last week, sought peace, but was developing a defence plan “in case we have to move to a state of war”.</p><h2 id=\"unclear-terms\">Unclear terms</h2><p>Several analysts assessed that some type of new agreement between the US and Cuba remained on the table, but any terms seen as an existential threat to the government in Havana would be non-starters.</p><p>It remained unclear what extractions Trump would consider satisfactory.</p><p>Cuba has far less to offer economically than Venezuela, a South American country with the world’s largest proven oil reserves. However, it contains significant deposits of rare and critical earth minerals, including the world’s third-largest reserve of cobalt, a key mineral used in lithium-ion batteries and other advanced technologies.</p><p>“Economically, Cuba has little to offer beyond agreements on the tourism industry or some trade deals,” according to Breda, although he added that Trump may try to pressure Havana to “give in on certain conditions, such as migration, the presence of US competitors in the country, and security cooperation between Russia and China”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In an executive order declaring Cuba an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US last month, Trump focused heavily on relations between Russia and China, which both cooperate with Cuba on defence, but do not have known military bases on the island.</p><p>The order, which also highlighted crackdowns on dissent by Cuba’s government, further accused Havana of hosting what Washington considers “transnational terrorist groups”, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p>Cuba experts have regularly dismissed the threat posed by Cuba as overblown, while noting there is scant evidence to support the “terrorist group” claims.</p><p>That has raised further questions over what tangible concessions the government could offer Trump, if his order is seen as a prelude to negotiations.</p><h2 id=\"regime-change\">Regime change?</h2><p>To be sure, Trump’s stated desire to pursue talks with Cuba’s current government puts him at odds with the decades-old ideology of the US Republican Party writ large, which has long eschewed any form of engagement with the communist government founded by Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1959.</p><p>That approach has been particularly championed by Trump’s top diplomat, Rubio, who is himself the son of Cuban immigrants with a political career <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio\">predicated</a> on a hawkish approach to the island.</p><p>Rubio has for months pushed the notion that the government in Havana is on the verge of collapse, laying the groundwork for Trump’s current pressure campaign. His stance dovetails with an influential Cuban-American voting bloc, which has been a key part of the Republicans’ electoral coalition.</p><p>“Rubio’s goal is to get rid of this regime in Cuba,” LeoGrande said, “so he would not be happy with any kind of deal like that Trump has cut in Venezuela, particularly if it were more or less a permanent deal.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>LeoGrande, meanwhile, downplayed the likelihood of Trump deploying boots on the ground in Cuba, noting the president has so far avoided prolonged military engagement.</p><p>A more surgical operation like the one targeting Maduro also remains unlikely, he assessed, with top roles in the armed forces still dominated by direct appointees of former President Raul Castro, who served as the Communist Party’s top official until his retirement in 2021.</p><p>Instead, according to ACLED’s Breda, any approach to topple the government would likely result in a continuation of the current pressure campaign to fuel dissent among a population beleaguered by shortages.</p><p>“But it remains to be seen whether Rubio will be able to convince Trump that there would not be great consequences in terms of migration, instability and violence in the island, and that this cannot have a spillover effect,” Breda said.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Discerning Trump’s motives may be akin to reading tea leaves, according to Louis Perez, a professor who has long focused on Cuban history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who notes that “deep historical antecedents” to his current actions may help illuminate what comes next.</p><p>Perez pointed to US policy that preceded the Cuban Revolution in 1959, reaching back to the US-established military government in Cuba in the early 20th century, and the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which first sought to assert US influence across Latin America.</p><p>“So widening the screen and pulling back, one sees the long view of a remarkable continuity of policy that reveals itself in many iterations,” he told Al Jazeera. “But the thread that links all of these iterations together in one package is the determination to deny Cuba sovereignty and self-determination.”</p><p>The Trump administration has recently elucidated its own goal of restoring US “pre-eminence” in the Western Hemisphere, what Trump and his allies have dubbed the “Donroe doctrine”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The American political leadership want the Cubans to say ‘uncle’, to surrender, to acquiesce,” Perez said. “This sounds simplified, but somewhere deep inside the US national psyche, this is driving policy, especially in an administration that is now presuming to redefine the ‘Donroe doctrine’.”</p><p>A prolonged impasse, meanwhile, could have unintended consequences for Washington, including driving Cuba closer to Russia and China.</p><p>Russia, already under heavy US sanctions, has not increased oil deliveries to Cuba in recent weeks, but could choose to do so as the US pressure campaign continues, American University’s LeoGrande explained. China and other regional allies could provide alternative forms of aid, freeing funds for energy purchases.</p><p>“The more pressure the United States puts on Cuba, the more threatening the United States is towards Cuba, the more incentive Cuba has to look for patrons among US adversaries,” he said.</p><p>ACLED’s Breda, in turn, pointed to the toll of a prolonged diplomatic stalemate, which could lead to further hardship under a government long accused of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/07/11/cuba-crackdown-protests-creates-rights-crisis\">cracking down</a> on internal dissent.</p><p>“The main risk is to trigger a humanitarian crisis within the island, which could have repercussions for outbound migration and also trigger a wave of unrest,” he said.</p><p>“Of course, this will test the government’s ability to remain in power, but it would also increase the likelihood that we would witness renewed rounds of repression and mass arrests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The government’s fiscal year starts on October 1.</p><p>While revived investment tax incentives and bigger individual tax refunds provide a boost in 2026, the CBO said that this is attenuated by the drag from larger fiscal deficits and reduced immigration that slows the growth of the labour force.</p><p>Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of economic and health policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center said “large deficits are unprecedented for a growing, peacetime economy”, though “the good news is there is still time for policymakers to correct course.”</p><h2 id=\"urgent-warning\">‘Urgent warning’</h2><p>Lawmakers have recently addressed rising federal debt and deficits primarily through targeted spending caps and debt limit suspensions, as well as deploying “extraordinary measures” when the US is close to hitting its statutory spending limit, though these measures have often been accompanied by new, large-scale spending or tax policies that maintain high deficit levels.</p><p>And Trump, at the start of his second term, deployed a new “Department of Government Efficiency”, which set a goal to balance the budget by cutting $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse; however, budget analysts estimate that DOGE cut anywhere between $1.4bn to $7bn, largely through workforce firings.</p><p>Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation, said the CBO’s latest budget projection “is an urgent warning to our leaders about America’s costly fiscal path.”</p><p>“This election year, voters understand the connection between rising debt and their personal economic condition. And the financial markets are watching. Stabilising our debt is an essential part of improving affordability, and must be a core component of the 2026 campaign conversation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

You’re running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.”</p><p>Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump and his administration have consistently faced questions about the decision to withhold or redact documents related to Epstein.</p><p>Trump himself has come under the microscope for his personal relationship to the late financier, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting federal charges.</p><p>At Wednesday’s hearing, women who had come forward as survivors of Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking ring and their families sat in the audience behind Bondi. They included Teresa Helm, Jess Michaels and Lara Blume McGee, as well as the family of the late Virginia Giuffre.</p><p>Representative Pramila Jayapal asked Bondi to apologise to Epstein’s victims. She and other Democrats criticised the Trump administration for not meeting with the survivors — and for the heavy redaction of the released Epstein files.</p><p>“Your department has shown a pattern of redacting the names of powerful predators,” Jayapal said.</p><p>She then asked the survivors to raise their hands if they had been unable to meet with the Department of Justice.</p><p>“For the record,” Jayapal added, “every single survivor has raised their hand.”</p><h2 id=\"bondi-rejects-criticism\">Bondi rejects criticism</h2><p>Bondi responded harshly to the criticism she faced, saying that she would not “get in the gutter” with Jayapal and her fellow Democrats.</p><p>She also accused Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who helped spearhead a law forcing the release of the Epstein files, of having “Trump derangement syndrome”.</p><p>When asked whether she would investigate Trump’s links to Epstein, Bondi said that Democrats were using the Epstein affair to “deflect from all the great things Donald Trump has done”.</p><p>Trump himself has faced criticism for calling the Epstein scandal a Democratic “hoax”.</p><p>But Al Jazeera correspondent Rosiland Jordan explained that Democrats were trying to leverage outrage over an issue that has transcended political parties.</p><p>After all, members of Trump’s own “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) base were among those publicly clamouring for the release of the government’s Epstein files.</p><p>“Congressional Democrats believe that they are tapping into the broadening public disgust with the way that the Trump administration has handled the release of the Epstein files,” Jordan reported from the US Capitol.</p><p>“This is a situation where the officials on the Democratic side try to get Pam Bondi to apologise for not doing enough, including not complying fully with a new law that compels the Justice Department to release all six million pages of evidence in the Epstein case.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"compliance-with-the-law\">Compliance with the law?</h2><p>That new law, called the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed into law in November with bipartisan support.</p><p>It requires the Justice Department to publish all of its documents related to Epstein in an easily searchable format.</p><p>Though the law does allow for some limited redaction to protect the identities of victims, critics argue that scores of documents have been published with heavy redactions.</p><p>Some of those blacked-out sections appear to shield the identity of powerful figures involved with Epstein.</p><p>During her opening statement on Wednesday, Bondi, a prosecutor from Florida, defended her record of addressing sexual abuse.</p><p>“ I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,” she said.</p><p>She added a message directed at the Epstein survivors: “I am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.”</p><p>But Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, accused Bondi of using the redactions to “spare” abusers and accomplices from “embarrassment and disgrace”.</p><p>He also questioned the volume of records that have been released, arguing that they fell short of the full disclosure required by November’s law.</p><p>“ You’ve been ordered by subpoena and by Congress to turn over six million documents, photographs, and videos in the Epstein files,” Raskin said.</p><p>“But you’ve turned over only three million. You say you’re not turning over the other three million because they’re somehow duplicative. But we know that there are actual memos of victim statements in there.”</p><h2 id=\"questions-about-prosecutions\">Questions about prosecutions</h2><p>Bondi also faced questions about the numerous investigations and lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Trump’s political rivals.</p><p>In September, for instance, the Justice Department announced charges against Trump critic James Comey, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>The following month, it also unveiled charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a politician who had brought a successful civil case against Trump.</p><p>Both charges were dropped, amid questions about the legality of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan’s appointment. But those charges and other investigations have fuelled criticism that Trump is using the Justice Department to settle political scores.</p><p>On Wednesday, Democratic Representative Mary Gay Scanlon asked Bondi if the administration was curating an “enemies list” based on an October order to crack down on alleged “left-wing terrorism”.</p><p>Bondi responded that she was “not going to commit to anything to you because you won’t let me answer questions”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

By late morning, though, the FAA announced that flights would resume in and out of the area as normal, prompting questions about the legitimacy of the drone claims.</p><p>“The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted. There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal,” the agency said in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/FAANews/status/2021583720465969421\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>El Paso is one of the largest cities in Texas, and it is located on the banks of the Rio Grande River, directly across from Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.</p><p>Securing border areas, however, has been a focus of President Donald Trump’s second term in office.</p><p>The Trump administration has asserted that Wednesday’s brief airspace closure was a result of a drone operated by a Mexican drug cartel infiltrating US airspace. It has since suggested the drone was destroyed.</p><p>“The FAA and [the Department of Defense] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on <a href=\"https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/2021594420806639787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media</a> at 9:37 US Eastern time (14:37 GMT).</p><p>“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”</p><p>But the Mexican government has not confirmed the drone incursion.</p><p>At her morning news conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters, “There is no information about drone use on the border,” but she added that the security cabinet would investigate the incident.</p><p>Anonymous US officials have told media outlets like CNN and CBS News that the sudden airspace closure may have been a false alarm, caused by the US military’s tests of its laser-based counter-drone system near El Paso.</p><p>CBS and Fox News also reported that, earlier this week, a party balloon was misidentified as a drone, prompting it to be shot down, according to official sources.</p><p>The El Paso airspace closure began abruptly late on Tuesday night and lasted until early Wednesday morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, the Trump administration framed the airspace closure as evidence of the threat from Mexican cartels.</p><p>Speaking to lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the alleged drone incident as she spoke of “striking crucial blows against terrorist organisations”.</p><p>“I think you’ve seen the news this morning,” Bondi told Congress members. “The news is reporting that cartel drones are being shot down by our military. That’s what we all should care about right now: protecting America.”</p><p>The Trump administration has frequently referred to criminal groups operating in Mexico as a threat to US national security.</p><p>Since taking office on January 20, 2025, Trump has started designating cartels across Latin America as “foreign terrorist organisations”, spurring fears that the US could launch aggressive, cross-border military actions.</p><p>Trump himself has threatened to strike drug trafficking groups in Mexican territory, despite criticism that such an attack would constitute a violation of Mexican sovereignty.</p><p>Already, Trump has authorised military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, on the pretext of disrupting international drug trafficking. He has alluded to land-based targets as an extension of that military campaign.</p><p>“We are going to start now hitting land. With regard to the cartels, the cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview published on January 9.</p><p>“You see what’s happened to that country. But the cartels are running it.”</p><p>Some elected officials, however, have expressed scepticism about the Trump administration’s claims about a drone incursion on Wednesday. Democratic Congress member Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, was among those asking for more information.</p><p>“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a news conference.</p><p>“The information coming from the federal government does not add up.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

on comments made by his ministry last week that said Russia considered itself no longer bound by the treaty’s terms.</p><p>“We proceed from the fact that this moratorium, which was announced by our president, remains in effect, but only while the United States does not exceed the outlined limits,” said Lavrov.</p><p>“We have reason to believe that the United States is in no hurry to abandon these limits and that they will be observed for the foreseeable future,” he said, without explaining the basis for that assumption.</p><p>US President Donald Trump rejected an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin to voluntarily abide by the limits set out in New START for another year, saying he wanted a “new, improved and modernised” treaty rather than an extension of the old one.</p><p>Russia has also indicated it wants to strike a new arms control agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Washington is pushing for China to be included in the talks, pointing to its growing nuclear arsenal.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than that of any other country by about 100 new warheads a year since 2023.</p><p>However, Beijing refuses to negotiate with the US and Russia because it says it has only a fraction of their warhead numbers – an estimated 600, compared with about 4,000 each for Russia and the US.</p><p>As the treaty expired, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China would not be joining the bilateral arms-reduction talks.</p><p>Moscow says if China is brought into a new deal, then so too should the US’s nuclear allies, the United Kingdom and France, which have 290 and 225 warheads, respectively.</p><p>New START, first signed in Prague

Relations between the two countries have long been marked by what many Lebanese describe as nearly 30 years of occupation and a tutelage rule by Syria over Lebanon, which ended when Syria withdrew its troops in 2005.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>About 2,400 Syrian prisoners are currently in Lebanese prisons. Some are held on “terrorism” charges while others are held for links to attacks against the Lebanese army. But most have never been tried despite having spent years in jail, largely due to a myriad of issues, including political gridlock, judicial strikes and general political indifference.</p><p>And while the deal reached on Friday may signal the beginning of a new relationship between Syria and Lebanon – one built on mutual respect rather than Syria’s direct or indirect control of the smaller state on its western border – it did not come about without any public controversy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Syrian eyes, many of the prisoners are being held for political rather than judicial reasons. The government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa believes they are in prison mostly due to the influence of the former al-Assad regime and its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.</p><p>But for many Lebanese, anyone accused of attacks against the Lebanese armed forces should not be released.</p><p>“Lebanon has long insisted that anyone Syrian or otherwise accused of committing serious crimes against the Lebanese army should not be extradited,” David Wood, the senior Lebanon analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera. “That has been one key obstacle to resolving this prisoner agreement up until now.”</p><h2 id=\"political-prisoners\">Political prisoners?</h2><p>Lebanese-Syrian relations have long been complex.

Lebanon and Syria signed a historic judicial agreement allowing convicted inmates to be transferred from the country where their sentence was issued to their country of nationality. This marks a significant step in judicial cooperation between the two neighbors.

It spilled over into <a href=\"/news/2012/12/5/fatal-sectarian-clashes-in-lebanons-tripoli\">clashes in the northern city of Tripoli</a>; the <a href=\"/video/al-jazeera-world/2017/5/24/lebanon-the-battle-of-abra\">Battle of Abra</a>, which involved firebrand anti-Assad sheikh Ahmad al-Assir and Lebanese-Palestinian pop star Fadel Shaker; <a href=\"/news/2017/8/19/offensives-target-isil-on-lebanon-syria-border\">battles</a> with Hezbollah and the Lebanese army on one side and ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda-aligned groups on the other; and <a href=\"/news/2013/7/9/car-bomb-rocks-shia-suburb-in-beirut\">attacks</a> on Beirut’s southern suburbs.</p><p>In the intervening years, hundreds of Syrians were arrested by Lebanese authorities and held in Lebanon’s overcrowded prisons.</p><p>When the al-Assad regime fell, the new Syrian government quickly looked to reframe the relationship with Lebanon, expressing an interest in building ties based on mutual respect and interests.</p><p>Among Damascus’s priorities were delineating their shared border and economic and security cooperation. But it also prioritised the repatriation of Syrians in Lebanese prisons.</p><p>“The allegation from Damascus is that in many cases the reason for [imprisonment] is political and specifically due to perceived ties between the inmates and groups that were opposed to the former regime of Bashar al-Assad,” Wood said. In its view, “it was actually Assad’s Lebanese allies who conspired to make sure that these people were imprisoned in Lebanon.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>By that logic, the fall of al-Assad and the weakening of Hezbollah after <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">Israel’s 2024 war on Lebanon</a> meant that these prisoners should be released.</p><p>Some Lebanese disagree and see the issue as more of a grey area. Even if the Syrian prisoners in question had fought Hezbollah, it had been at a time when the Shia group had been coordinating with the Lebanese army – and, for many Lebanese, fighting the army is a red line.</p><h2 id=\"an-important-step\">An important step</h2><p>On Friday, the agreement was signed with a number of Lebanese ministers present, including Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri and the two countries’ justice ministers.</p><p>“This is a very important first step on the road of a comprehensive treatment regarding Syrian prisoners in Lebanese prisons,” Mitri said to reporters on Friday.</p><p>Syrian Justice Minister Mazhar al-Wais said: “This step will boost existing confidence, and we hope that relations will progress more.”</p><p>The agreement reportedly stipulates that over the next three months, about 300 prisoners will be repatriated to Syria and those serving time for serious crimes, such as rape or murder for example, must have served 10 or more years of their sentences in Lebanese prisons to be eligible for repatriation.</p><p>Lebanese prisoners, such as al-Assir, are not included in the deal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But other issues remain. Among them are Lebanon’s backlogged judicial system and issues related to Lebanese inmates in Syrian prisons.</p><p>Only about 750 Syrian prisoners out of the 2,400 have been convicted. That means roughly 65 percent of prisoners are not eligible for repatriation yet.</p><p>Fadel Abdulghany of the Syrian Network for Human Rights described this as a “two-track” problem. On his personal website, Abdulghany noted that the transfer of prisoners convicted with final sentences can be carried out with a “swift step”.</p><p>However, for those who have yet to be convicted, the issue is not as straightforward. A mechanism for pretrial detention has not yet been agreed by the respective authorities.</p><p>“This is not merely a Syrian issue but one that touches the very structure of the Lebanese criminal justice system,” Abdulghany wrote. “Therefore, transferring convicts will not resolve the problem, because the root cause is the slow pace of procedures in Lebanon and the accumulation of detainees held without trial, along with the ensuing issues concerning the legality and continuation of their detention.”</p><p>He warned that such detainees could be used as political bargaining chips by Hezbollah. Some members or supporters of the group blame these prisoners for <a href=\"/news/2015/11/14/hezbollah-chief-vows-to-continue-fight-against-isil\">car bombings</a> or other such <a href=\"/news/2014/2/2/jabhat-al-nusra-claims-deadly-lebanon-bombing\">attacks on their villages</a>. While many of those attacks were on Shia Muslim areas where Hezbollah support is predominant, Christian villages, such as al-Qaa and Ras Baalbeck in the Bekaa Valley, were also subject to attacks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"there-are-no-names\">‘There are no names’</h2><p>Marcel Baloukji, a former brigadier general who oversaw the Lebanese army’s border committee with Syria, told Al Jazeera that the 300 or so prisoners who are to be transferred do not include many of the more hardened prisoners associated with ISIL or al-Qaeda whom Lebanese authorities have apprehended over the years.</p><p>But Baloukji also pointed out that the issue of Lebanese prisoners in Syrian jails is still important for the Lebanese side. Under the al-Assad regime, more than 100,000 people were forcibly disappeared, including hundreds or potentially thousands of Lebanese, going as far back as the Lebanese Civil War.</p><p><a href=\"/video/birds-eye-view/2025/2/3/patterns-of-mass-graves-in-syria\">Mass graves</a> have been found around Syria since the fall of the regime. However, much work needs to be done to identify all the bodies. Until now, the vast majority have still not been identified – neither Syrian nor Lebanese.</p><p>“There’s still a problem because there has to be an exchange between Lebanon and Syria,” Baloukji said. “There’s no one there. Most of them are not identified. There are no names.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s a little bit of a farce.”</p><p>The Justice Department began allowing members of Congress to view the unredacted files on Monday at its headquarters in Washington, DC. They may see the files on computers and may not bring any electronic devices with them. They are permitted only to take notes and may not make any electronic copies.</p><p>The Justice Department is believed to be in possession of nearly 6 million pages of documents related to Epstein.

No criminal charges were ever brought against the billionaire in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>On Tuesday after Khanna’s speech, the Justice Department unredacted parts of an internal document dated August 15, 2019, from the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, which included a reference to Wexner as a coconspirator.

The chairman and chief executive officer of the logistics giant DP World exchanged messages with Epstein for years before and after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p><p>The friendly exchanges between the two include discussions about deals and also mention bin Sulayem visiting Epstein’s private island while sharing contacts in business and politics. The two men also shared salacious comments about women.</p><p>The removals of the redactions also confirmed that bin Sulayem’s email address was used in a correspondence with Epstein in which Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00774231.pdf\">remarked</a>, “I loved the torture video.”</p><p>Khanna named four other men: Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov and Nicola Caputo.

ISIL (ISIS) in Sahel Province, or ISSP – a Niger-based outfit earlier known as the ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara or ISGS – has since <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/isil-claims-deadly-attack-on-air-base-near-niger\">claimed responsibility</a> and says it killed several soldiers, although the Nigerien army disputes this.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Analysts say the daring attack shows ISSP’s growing confidence at a time when the swarm of armed groups operating across the troubled Sahel region in Western Africa is expanding its areas of operation with advanced technology. Many of its fighters had breached military drone hangars using RPGs and mortars, and managed to damage several aircraft and one civilian aeroplane, according to videos from the group.</p><p>“This is unprecedented,” Heni Nsaibia, a senior analyst at the conflict monitoring think tank, ACLED, told Al Jazeera, noting that ISSP usually limits offences to rural areas and uses rudimentary weapons like AK-47s.</p><p>“They are refining their attacks and becoming more experienced in guerrilla warfare. To be able to infiltrate and penetrate the capital speaks to itself that they have tactical strength and boldness,” he said.</p><p>Although officially unconfirmed, conflict trackers suggest that ISSP may have deployed a drone in the assault, in what would mirror a region-wide trend that analysts say marks a dangerous escalation in the Sahel crisis. ISIL affiliates have used explosives-laden drones in rural attacks in Nigeria, but never in Niger.</p><p>“We have videos showing there was nocturnal gunfire from the Nigerien air defence,” Nsaibia added. “It’s possible they detected drones [from ISIL] used for surveillance, but it’s only a hypothesis.”</p><p>Military-ruled Niger has seen a rise in armed attacks since July 2023, when the army seized power and expelled hundreds of French and US troops that previously provided air and combat support.</p><p>Neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also governed by the military, are also facing similar violence as several armed groups lay claim to swaths of territory across their porous borders. The groups aim to control territory without Western influence, and according to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.</p><p>All three countries have pivoted from French troops to the Russian government-controlled <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/wagner-vs-africa-corps-the-future-of-russian-paramilitaries-in-mali\">Africa Corps</a>, a paramilitary group whose effectiveness has been mixed. In a statement following the Niamey attack, the Nigerien and Russian governments said Africa Corps fighters helped “repel” the assault and that 20 of the attackers were killed, with four soldiers wounded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274984\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274984\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274984\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-29T201535Z_299532347_RC2WAJAGBNQQ_RTRMADP_3_NIGER-SECURITY-1769723703.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C431&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A satellite image shows Diori Hamani International Airport and military bases after gunfire and explosions, in Niamey, Niger\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4274984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A satellite image shows Niamey international airport and military bases after gunfire and explosions in Niger, January 29, 2026 [Handout/Vantor via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"drone-use-surges-across-the-sahel\">Drone use surges across the Sahel</h2><p>Military drone attacks by the Nigerien forces and other parties to the conflict are common, but the armed groups themselves are increasingly repurposing easy-to-buy, easy-to-smuggle Chinese-made commercial drones for strikes by attaching improvised explosive devices (IEDs), grenades, or small mortar shells to them.</p><p>It is a “low-cost, high-impact” capability that provides the groups with real-time intelligence, minimises their need to risk fighters as suicide bombers, and makes it harder for militaries to detect and counter them, Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South (PCNS), said.</p><p>The most prolific drone user is the al Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which is primarily based in Mali and Burkina Faso. The group has cells in Niger, Togo, and on the Benin-Nigeria border.</p><p>JNIM first used a drone in 2023, but without a significant impact. However, the group has since rapidly integrated the technology into battlefield operations, often pairing drone attacks with ground assaults in a two-pronged approach. Between 2023 and 2025, ACLED recorded JNIM using drones at least 89 times, with 69 incidents being for attacks. At least five other events saw JNIM drones crash or be intercepted.</p><p>“What’s alarming is how quickly they’ve developed this knowledge,” Lyammouri said.</p><p>The real risk, he added, lies beyond the group’s ability to use drones as a weapon.</p><p>“The drones used are very small, and they don’t carry an important amount of explosives, so the damages a lot of times are not as significant. But what is important is how they use drones to collect information and gather intelligence,” he said.</p><p>JNIM relies on the DJI M30T model, a high-end drone with an in-built camera ideal for night-time surveillance. The cheaper DJI Mavic, which costs between $500 and $700, is also part of the fleet.</p><p>Drones are likely helping the group monitor fuel trucks attempting to break its blockade on the Malian capital of Bamako, experts say. Since September, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/is-mali-about-to-fall-to-al-qaeda-affiliate-jnim\">JNIM has sealed off</a> highways used by fuel tankers importing oil from neighbouring Senegal and the Ivory Coast, causing periods of fuel shortages across Mali.</p><p>Similarly, the separatist Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is fighting for an independent state in northern Mali, released videos last February showing its fighters controlling a first-person view (FPV) drone – advanced models that help pilots have a “cockpit” viewing experience via special goggles. The FLA conducted 28 drone attacks between 2024 and 2025, according to ACLED. It used an FPV to down a Malian military helicopter in the northern Tessalit region in July 2024, according to the conflict reporting website, Military Africa.</p><p>ISIL affiliates are meanwhile using drones to a much lesser extent.</p><p>The Nigeria-based ISIL affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has deployed armed drones 10 times between 2024 and 2026, according to ACLED. In January, the group targeted Nigerian forces raiding one of its hideouts in northern Borno State with multiple armed drones.</p><p>The new shift is being accelerated by offline artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can help drones avoid traditional detection and jamming methods, Lyammouri said. They are also using these tools to generate training material, AI-generated images and press releases, he added. The open-source MISTRAL, a ChatGPT rival that is useful for everything from offline searches to content generation, is one such tool.</p><p>The shift to drone use by armed groups is global. ACLED in 2025 reported that 469 armed groups – including rebel groups, militias, gangs, and transnational cartels around the world – deployed a drone at least once in the past five years, up from only 10 groups using the technology in 2020.</p><h2 id=\"cooperation-at-a-time-of-tensions\">Cooperation at a time of tensions</h2><p>The likely next stage for drone use by armed groups could be AI-enabled “drone swarms” that could launch large-scale remote attacks on government positions featuring several drones at a time, analysts note.</p><p>For the groups, there is plenty of incentive to evolve quickly. Each group is willing to lay claim to its territory, and attacks like the one on Niamey not only aim to undermine the Nigerien government but also to signal to rival groups like JNIM not to intrude on that area, Nsaibia said.</p><p>Countries in the region will need to work together to jointly fight the groups’ new strategies, especially as they expand geographically and share technologies, Lyammouri warned.</p><p>Their “tactics are spreading and require a coordinated response”, he said, one that will necessitate bringing together drone warfare experts, AI researchers, and regional military planners to simulate the recorded drone warfare scenarios, like JNIM’s drone-assisted ground assaults and intelligence-gathering patterns.</p><p>That is tricky, however, amid regional tensions and a fragmented security response.</p><p>Following the 2023 coup in Niger, relations with neighbouring Nigeria became strained. Soon after, the two called off formal defence cooperation following threats by Abuja to lead the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc into a military intervention to restore civilian rule.</p><p>Wider tensions between ECOWAS and the military governments in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso escalated last year and led to the three exiting to form their own union, the <a href=\"/features/2025/12/31/a-marriage-of-three-will-mali-niger-burkina-faso-bloc-reshape-the-sahel\">Alliance of Sahel States</a>.</p><p>However, this week, Nigerien and Nigerian security officials met in Abuja to discuss stronger border security to hamper smuggling routes that the armed groups use to transport weapons.</p><p>A collective regional solution is the only one that may succeed, experts agree.</p><p>Barring strong counters, important urban centres like Niamey, usually deemed safe, are going to be more “at risk in the medium to long term”, Nsaibia said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
