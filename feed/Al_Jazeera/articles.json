            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty_694d52ae85-1766675118.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In June 2025, the UK government proscribed the UK-based group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. This was not a security decision, but a political one, marking an unprecedented escalation in the criminalisation of Palestine solidarity in the United Kingdom. Palestine Action members have engaged in non-violent direct action aimed at disrupting the UK’s complicity in the Gaza genocide, targeting facilities linked to Israel’s arms industry operating in the UK, including Elbit Systems sites and elements of British military infrastructure.</p><p>Rather than confronting its own actions, the government has sought to divert attention from the central issue: the UK’s role in the Gaza genocide. Throughout Israel’s assault on Gaza, the UK has provided sustained political and diplomatic support, supplied vital components for F-35 fighter jets, and conducted R1 surveillance flights over Gaza. Taken together, these actions render the British government not merely complicit, but materially involved in the violence itself.</p><p>At the same time, the UK has sought to obstruct international accountability. It has attempted to interfere with proceedings at the International Criminal Court — conduct that may constitute an offence under Article 70(1) of the ICC Statute — by intimidating the ICC Prosecutor and creating procedural obstacles designed to delay or prevent the issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. Rather than reassessing policies that expose it to legal and moral liability, the government has turned on those who insist on holding it to its own professed values — values it readily invokes when geopolitically convenient, such as in Ukraine and Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"anti-terror-laws-to-justify-political-imprisonment\">Anti-terror laws to justify political imprisonment</h2><p>The persecution of individuals on political grounds through the law is by no means new. As early as 399 BCE, Socrates was tried and executed in Athens on charges of “impiety”, “not recognising the gods the state recognises”, and “corrupting the youth”, with the law itself serving as the instrument of repression.</p><p>Today, Russia’s crackdown on dissent, carried out through formally lawful means, stands as one of the most widely criticised contemporary examples of political imprisonment, routinely condemned by Western governments, including the UK.</p><p>Attempts to define and legally operationalise the concept of political imprisonment have long faced resistance. While there is no consensus on what constitutes a “political prisoner” or “prisoner of conscience”, the criteria established by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), of which the UK is a member, offer clear and authoritative guidance:</p><p><em>“a. if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols (ECHR), in particular freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association; </em></p><p><em>b. if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence; </em></p><p><em>c. if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;</em></p><p><em>d. if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or, </em></p><p><em>e. if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.”  (SG/Inf(2001)34, paragraph 10).</em><br>\nThese criteria are directly relevant to the UK’s treatment of Palestine Action. The British government is complicit in Israel’s systematic unmaking of Palestine, including its illegal occupation, its system of apartheid, and its role in the Gaza genocide, and Palestine Action has directly challenged this complicity. Where public order and civil disobedience laws once failed to suppress this activism, the state escalated to the use of exceptional anti-terror legislation.</p><p>The government has since resorted to the Terrorism Act to preemptively criminalise activists and expose them to sentences of up to 14 years’ imprisonment, a level of punishment grossly disproportionate to non-violent direct action. This disproportionality and choice of legislation signal a political motive.</p><p>The application of the Terrorism Act 2000 to non-violent direct action strips activists of ordinary legal protections and subjects them to an exceptional penal regime, including extended pre-charge detention, heightened surveillance powers, restrictions on association and expression, and dramatically increased sentencing exposure. Such measures are ordinarily reserved for acts involving mass violence, not protest aimed at preventing harm.</p><p>Under the PACE criteria, detention may be considered political where punishment is clearly disproportionate or where legal proceedings are unfair and politically motivated. Here, non-violent activism is met with the prospect of lengthy imprisonment alongside reputational destruction through terrorist designation. This combination satisfies multiple indicators of political imprisonment, particularly criteria (c) and (e).</p><p>The use of anti-terror law in this context does not merely criminalise conduct; it redefines dissent itself as a security threat, preempting fair adjudication and conditioning the public to accept extraordinary punishment for ordinary political opposition.</p><h2 id=\"the-broader-picture\">The broader picture</h2><p>In penology, a penal system may serve several recognised purposes, including just deserts and retribution, incapacitation, and deterrence. What is unfolding in the UK fits none of these aims. Instead, the penal system is being deployed to expand executive power and suppress political opposition, deviating from the purposes a penal system in a liberal democracy should serve.</p><p>The UK is complicit in grave violations of international law and has not only failed to meet its international legal obligations, but has actively breached them. Some British citizens, concerned with justice, international law, and human rights, have peacefully stepped in to challenge their government’s wrongdoing. The state’s response has been to criminalise dissent while presenting repression as democratic self-defence.</p><p>Let us be clear: proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation is not an isolated act. It is part of the UK’s broader complicity in Israel’s oppression and genocide, and it functions domestically to silence those who seek to disrupt that complicity.</p><p>This is not the first attempt to rule by law in the UK to support Israel’s policies in Palestine. The introduction of the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism was another such attempt to control and intimidate opposition through legal means. With the weaponisation of anti-terror laws, the UK government has taken a further step towards shrinking the space for dissent.</p><p>The exceptional selectivity of legal tools and the disproportionality of the chosen penal regime cannot be justified when measured against the conduct in question: non-violent activism aimed at compelling the government to halt violence and uphold the international legal obligations it claims to champion. Those participating in violence are branding the non-violent as terrorists.</p><p>Finally, it is striking that after all these decades, the UK continues to ignore its unique historical responsibility towards the Palestinians. The UK imposed its mandate over Palestine by force, governing the territory while systematically privileging colonial and settler interests, before abandoning its obligations and withdrawing unilaterally. This withdrawal was crucial to creating the conditions in which the Nakba unfolded, in breach of the responsibilities the UK had assumed under the Mandate.</p><p>Among those obligations was the commitment articulated in the White Paper of 1939 to establish a Palestinian state for all its citizens within 10 years, a promise that was never honoured. The UK planted the seeds of Palestinian suffering and then exited Palestine without securing political self-determination for its indigenous people, leaving a legacy of dispossession that continues to shape the present.</p><p>More than a century after the Mandate, it remains Palestinians — supported by allies across the world — who are risking everything to defend the values of humanity and the principles of international law. The British state, by contrast, has chosen evasion over responsibility, and repression over reckoning.</p><h2 id=\"any-hopes\" data-start=\"586\" data-end=\"600\">Any hopes?</h2><p>Hope lies in refusing the normalisation of this moment. By challenging the proscription of Palestine Action, activists are not only resisting the UK’s complicity in Israel’s crimes, but defending the space for dissent itself. The struggle is not simply to reverse one decision, but to prevent the erosion of democratic limits through the misuse of law. In the UK right now, defending democracy and acting against complicity in Israeli atrocities go hand in hand.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”</p><p>The Palestinian activist, born in Syria and holding Algerian citizenship, is a lawful permanent resident and married to a US citizen.</p><p>Khalil, who was pursuing a graduate degree at Columbia University, is one of dozens of foreign students that the Trump administration has targeted for deportation over their criticism of Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rights advocates argue that the campaign violates US <a href=\"/video/the-stream/2025/6/3/is-free-speech-under-attack-in-the-us\">free speech rights</a> to stifle criticism of a foreign nation.</p><p>Khalil’s case was advancing on two tracks: one in federal court through a habeas corpus petition, which argued that his detention was illegal, and another in the administrative immigration courts, which challenged his removal.</p><p>The appeals panel sided with the government’s argument that only the immigration courts had jurisdiction over the matter, in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p><p>“Our holdings vindicate essential principles of habeas and immigration law,” the court said.</p><p>“The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on—in a petition for review of a final order of removal. We will therefore VACATE and REMAND with instructions to dismiss Khalil’s habeas petition.”</p><p>Immigration courts are part of the Justice Department, not the independent judicial branch, raising questions on whether Khalil can receive a fair hearing to his claims.</p><p>An immigration judge <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/us-judge-orders-deportation-of-activist-mahmoud-khalil-to-syria-algeria\">has already sided</a> with the government in ruling that Khalil is deportable.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has invoked a seldom-used provision of the INA, asserting his authority to remove individuals he deems “adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US, to target Khalil and other pro-Palestine students.</p><p>In the immigration court system, Khalil can appeal his case to a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) before the case can be taken to a federal court of appeals.</p><p>But it’s not clear whether the immigration system will allow Khalil to adequately make an argument about the violation of his constitutional rights, namely free speech – a possibility highlighted by Judge Arianna Freeman in her dissenting opinion.</p><p>“Khalil claims that the government violated his fundamental constitutional rights. He has also alleged— andproven —irreparable injuries during his detention,” Freeman wrote.</p><p>“Precedent and principles of statutory interpretation lead me to conclude that ‘it is most unlikely that Congress intended to foreclose all forms of meaningful judicial review’ over his claims,” she added, quoting from a 1991 Supreme Court ruling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It is not clear how the ruling will immediately affect Khalil’s broader case and the ordeal of other students like him. Federal courts have released several students – including Turkish scholar <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/us-court-orders-trump-admin-to-restore-rumeysa-ozturks-legal-status\">Rumeysa Ozturk</a> – based on habeas petitions.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/us-deportation-drive-against-pro-palestine-students-is-illegal-judge-rules\">a judge ruled</a> in a separate civil case that the Trump administration’s drive to deport pro-Palestine students based on their speech is illegal.</p><p>Khalil’s legal team can ask the entire Third Circuit Court to review the panel’s decision before taking the came to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Bobby Hodgson, deputy legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is helping represent the Palestinian activist, said Thursday’s ruling “undermines the role federal courts must play in preventing flagrant constitutional violations”.</p><p>“The Trump administration violated the Constitution by targeting Mahmoud Khalil, detaining him thousands of miles from home, and retaliating against him for his speech,” Hodgson said in a statement.</p><p>“Dissent is not grounds for detention or deportation, and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure Mahmoud’s rights are vindicated.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

For months, Trump and his team accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading mass-scale narcotics smuggling operations, again without evidence. Amid the boat bombings, Trump even said that the US might strike Venezuelan land next.</p><p>But in late November, Trump revealed to reporters that he had spoken to the Venezuelan leader. A few days later, the call was confirmed by Maduro himself, who described it as “cordial”.</p><p>The US then hit what Trump described as a docking facility for alleged drug boats in Venezuela. After that, on January 1, Maduro offered Trump an olive branch, saying he was open to talks with Washington on drug trafficking and even on enabling US access to oil. Trump appeared to be getting what he ostensibly wanted – access to Venezuelan oil and blocks on drugs from the country.</p><p>Yet only hours later, US forces targeted the capital, abducting Maduro and his wife on charges of narcotics trafficking and transporting them to the United States.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4242090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Trump_Attacks_Jan15_2026_2-1768477777.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Trump_Attacks_Jan15_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"iran-bombed-when-two-weeks-of-diplomacy-appeared-imminent\" data-start=\"1474\" data-end=\"1639\">Iran bombed – when ‘two weeks’ of diplomacy appeared imminent</h2><p>Venezuela was not the first time Trump launched a dramatic attack at a time when diplomacy appeared to be taking hold.</p><p>In June, Iran learned the hard way that Trump’s words and actions do not match.</p><p>Amid rising tensions over US accusations that Iran was racing towards enriching uranium for nuclear weapons, Washington and Tehran engaged in weeks of hectic negotiations. Trump frequently warned Iran that time was running out for it to strike a deal, but then returned to talks.</p><p>On June 13, he wrote on Truth Social that his team “remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue.”</p><p>His “entire” administration, he said, had been “directed to negotiate with Iran”.</p><p>But barely hours later, US ally Israel struck Iran. Most experts believe Israel would not have attacked Iran without Trump’s approval.</p><p>As Israel and Iran traded fire in the subsequent days, Trump faced questions over whether the US would bomb Iran.</p><p>On June 20, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quoted Trump as saying that he would “make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks”.</p><p>Far from utilising the full two weeks he gave himself, Trump made his decision in two days.</p><p>In the early hours of June 22, US B-2 Spirit bombers dropped fourteen bunker-busting bombs on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility, buried deep inside a mountain near Qom. The US also bombed nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan using the most powerful conventional bombs in the US arsenal.</p><p>The attack shocked many observers, in part because of what appeared to have been an elaborate diplomatic ruse preceding it.</p><h2 id=\"iran-protest-calculus-what-s-trump-s-plan\">Iran protest calculus: What’s Trump’s plan?</h2><p>Now, all eyes are on Iran again, where <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">demonstrations</a> against the government have been under way for the past two weeks, before calming down earlier this week.</p><p>As the unrest turned deadlier last week, Trump urged Iranians to continue demonstrating.</p><p>“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!… HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on January 13, without elaborating on what form that help might take.</p><p>But within 24 hours, during a meeting with reporters in Washington, DC, Trump said he had been assured that the killing of protesters in Iran had stopped.</p><p>“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place – there were supposed to be a lot of executions today, and that the executions won’t take place – and we’re going to find out,” Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">in an interview</a> with Fox TV, also denied that Tehran planned to execute antigovernment protesters. “Hanging is ‌out of the ‌question,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-is-trump-threatening\" data-start=\"4292\" data-end=\"4323\">Which other countries is Trump threatening?</h2><p>Beyond Iran and Venezuela, longstanding US rivals, Trump’s aggression has increasingly extended towards Washington’s own allies, including Canada and Greenland.</p><p>The most striking example is Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/greenland-and-denmark-say-trump-set-on-conquering-territory-after-meeting\">eagerness to take over</a> Greenland, a Danish territory, which has evolved from a campaign talking point into a focal element of his administration’s Western Hemisphere strategy.</p><p>On January 5, the State Department posted a black-and-white image of Trump on social media, declaring: “This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened.”</p><p><br>\nThe president has refused to rule out the use of military force, with administration officials openly discussing US interest in Greenland’s strategic location and mineral resources.</p><p>Denmark has categorically rejected any sale, while <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any\">Greenland’s leadership</a> insists the territory is not for sale.</p><p>But experts such as Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argue that Trump uses threats to intimidate adversaries and typically employs force only against weaker targets.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/the-bullys-pulpit-finding-patterns-in-trumps-use-of-military-force/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">paper published</a> last May titled, The bully’s pulpit: Finding patterns in Trump’s use of military force, Shapiro suggested that Trump frequently invokes military threats but often fails to follow through.</p><p>According to Shapiro, Trump is more likely to act when threats carry “low escalation risk”, while threats against nuclear-armed or militarily strong states largely serve rhetorical purposes. The most extreme or theatrical warnings, he argues, tend to function as tools of “political signalling rather than precursors to real military action”.</p><p>“Trump often deploys grandiose threats but only accepts limited, low-risk military operations. He uses foreign policy as political theatre, aiming threats as much at his domestic base and media cycle as at foreign adversaries,” Shapiro writes.</p><h2 id=\"calculated-unpredictability\" data-start=\"6667\" data-end=\"6705\">Calculated unpredictability?</h2><p>Some analysts believe Trump’s approach offers tactical advantages.</p><p>“The intent is to keep opponents off balance, heightening psychological pressure and extracting maximum strategic leverage,” a Pakistani government official told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “Even his European allies are not always certain what to expect.”</p><p>Others remain sceptical. Qandil Abbas, a specialist on Middle East affairs at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, described Trump’s behaviour as erratic, citing his repeated threats against multiple countries.</p><p>“Look at his threats against Cuba, or Iran, or Venezuela, and yet this is the same president who also wants to win a Nobel prize and is desperate for it,” Abbas told Al Jazeera.</p><p>So is Trump actually pulling back from the prospect of attacking Iran – or is he bluffing?</p><p>According to Abbas, Trump’s apparent change in tone might be the result of feedback from US allies in the region “that attacking Iran is not smart”.</p><p>Still, Abbas said that “with Israel’s support, I feel he will find a way to strike the country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are increasingly engineered in the digital sphere, where actors, often with a self-serving agenda, compete to control the narrative, define its meaning and decide who speaks for whom.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">In recent weeks as protests erupted in Iranian cities, the hashtag #FreeThePersianPeople trended on X.

Instead, it carried a rigid political framework designed to reframe and actually pour on the unrest.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"16\">The discourse portrayed developments inside Iran as a “moment of collapse” and relied on sharp binaries: “The People vs. The Regime”, “Freedom vs. Political Islam” and “Iran vs. The Islamic Republic”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"17\">The campaign heavily promoted Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, as the sole political alternative. Pahlavi himself engaged with the campaign, a move that was immediately amplified by Israeli accounts describing him as the “face of the alternative Iran”. But he is not thought of in those terms by a majority of Iranians, many of whom have memories of his father’s abuses and how the CIA restored him to power in 1953 in a United States-United Kingdom-orchestrated coup.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: I am sharing my first call with you today and invite you to start chanting slogans this Thursday and Friday, 18th and 19th of Dey, simultaneously at 8 PM, all of you whether in the streets or even from your own homes. Based on the feedback from this action, I will announce the next calls to you.</em></p><h2><strong>Direct Israeli involvement</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"19\">The campaign was not limited to anonymous activists. It also involved direct participation from current and former Israeli officials during the campaign’s peak.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"20\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted a tweet in Persian addressed to the Iranian people, calling for the “fall of the dictator” and expressing support for the protests.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\"><em>Translation: The people of Iran deserve a free life, liberated from the killer dictator, Khamenei. We stand with you!</em></p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\">Similarly, tweets by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett were widely circulated within the hashtag’s network, repurposed to fit the “liberation” narrative.</p><h2><strong>Turning protests into an ideological war</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"23\">One of the campaign’s most prominent features was its attempt to reframe the protests as a conflict against religion rather than against economic mismanagement and political repression.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">Posts describing the Iranian government as an “oppressive Islamist regime” circulated alongside narratives portraying the “Persian people” as victims of Islam. This attempt to distinguish between “Persians” and “Muslims” appeared aimed at isolating the regime from Iranian society and framing the unrest as a civilizational clash.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"25\">Israeli activists, including Eyal Yakoby and Hillel Neuer, also pushed content accusing the Iranian authorities of excessive violence while attacking what they termed the “silence of international media”.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Calls for foreign intervention</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"27\">The discourse quickly evolved from solidarity to explicit calls for foreign military intervention. And this narrative was pushed by US President Donald Trump, who bombed Iran’s nuclear sites as part of Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> against Iran in June.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"28\">The network amplified statements attributed to Trump regarding Washington’s readiness to intervene. Pahlavi publicly welcomed these statements, framing them as support for “change”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"29\">Simultaneously, members of the US Congress, including Representative Pat Fallon, a member of Trump’s Republican Party, further amplified these sentiments while dozens of accounts within the network directed tweets at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging direct Israeli intervention.</p><p></p><figure id=\"attachment_4242268\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4242268\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4242268\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%A9-Tweet-Binder-%D9%8A%D9%8F%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%91%D8%B2%D8%A9-1768482131.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C455&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tweet Binder’s timeline reveals activity peaks coinciding with intensive posting intervals.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4242268\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tweet Binder’s timeline reveals activity peaks coinciding with intensive posting intervals [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>The ‘puppet masters’ behind the network</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"31\">Al Jazeera’s network analysis identified specific “central nodes”, or accounts that played a pivotal role in amplifying the hashtag.</p><ul>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"32,0,0\"><strong>“Rhythm of X”:</strong> This account emerged as a central hub for interaction.

In particular, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) put the death toll at 2,615 on Wednesday.</p><p>However, the Iranian government said these numbers have been exaggerated, and Iranian state TV reports put the figure at about 300.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Trump’s tone softened when he said he had received assurances from Iran that the killings of protesters in Iran had stopped and that executions of detained demonstrators would not go ahead.</p><p>But his earlier threats to attack Iran prompted Tehran to warn of retaliation and, on Wednesday, Qatar ‌confirmed some personnel ‍had been removed from the Al Udeid air‌base, which hosts US armed forces, saying it was ‌in ⁠response ‌to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/diplomatic-contact-reportedly-suspended-between-us-and-iran\">“current ‍regional ‌tensions”</a>.</p><p>There have been some clashes between demonstrators and security forces in Iran, resulting in deaths. An ongoing internet blackout – which entered its eighth day on Thursday – has made it particularly difficult to track the actual number of deaths, according to watchdog NetBlocks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-death-toll-in-iran\">What do we know about the death toll in Iran?</h2><p>Iran has not released an official death toll, but authorities stated this week that more than 100 members of the security forces have been killed in clashes with protesters. Opposition activists said the toll is much higher and includes more than 1,000 protesters.</p><p>HRANA said the number of people killed had climbed to at least 2,615 on Wednesday.</p><p>Norway-based organisation Iran Human Rights (IHR) reported on Wednesday that at least 3,428 protesters had been killed in a crackdown on demonstrations.</p><p>But the same day, Iranian state TV said mass funerals were taking place in Tehran that would include 300 bodies of security force members and civilians.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Iranian ‍Foreign ‍Minister Abbas <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">Araghchi denied</a> that Tehran had plans to execute protesters. During this interview, Araghchi downplayed the death toll that is being reported.</p><p>“I certainly deny the numbers and figures they have said. It is an exaggeration, it is a misinformation campaign, only to find excuses, only to do another aggression against Iran,” Araghchi said, adding that the number was being exaggerated to involve Trump in the conflict.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify any of the figures that have been reported.</p><p>Among all of these figures, HRANA’s numbers are the ones that are most cited by news organisations worldwide.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hrana\">What is HRANA?</h2><p>According to its website, US-based HRANA is the news agency affiliated with Human Rights Activists in Iran (also known as HRAI and HRA), which is described as “a non-political and non-governmental organisation comprised of advocates who defend human rights in Iran”.</p><p>The website states that HRAI was formed in 2005 but does not name or provide details about who formed the organisation.</p><p>It says that in February 2006, a small group of Iranian activists gathered to organise protests against human rights violations in the country.</p><p>“That effort lay the foundation of a larger vision that ultimately led to the establishment of an organization later known as Human Rights Activists in Iran,” the website states, adding that, initially, the effort was focused on political prisoners. It supported victims’ families, documented abuses and ran public education campaigns in Iran.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-group-now-based-in-the-us\">Why is the group now based in the US?</h2><p>By March 2010, the group was legally registered inside Iran, shifting from a “semi-secret organization into one which openly operated in Iran”, it states.</p><p>The organisation adds that during this time, the group decided to publicly disclose the names of its leaders. “By publicly disclosing the names of our leaders, we hoped to neutralize such suspicions that have historically led to brutal crackdowns in the past.”</p><p>However, the government did crack down on it, it says.</p><p>The website adds: “The military-style crackdown of our organization on March 2, 2010 left our members even more determined than before to re-group and ultimately rebuild the necessary infrastructure needed to continue our work despite the security risks that threatened each and every one of us.”</p><p>According to a document published by Amnesty International on March 12, 2010, HRAI reported that Iranian security forces raided the house and workplace of at least 29 of its members between March 2 and March 3, arresting 15 people.</p><p>The website adds that soon after the crackdown, HRAI registered in the US as a nonprofit organisation, and focused on recruiting skilled members, integrating technology into its operations and “obtaining appropriate sources of financial support”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hrana-s-assessment-of-the-crisis-in-iran\">What is HRANA’s assessment of the crisis in Iran?</h2><p>This week, HRANA reported that of the 2,615 people killed, 2,435 were protesters, 153 were affiliated with the government or military, and 14 were civilians who were not protesting.</p><p>Besides the death toll, HRANA has reported that 18,470 people have been arrested over the course of 617 protests in 187 cities, beginning on December 28 in Tehran.</p><p>HRANA has also published news articles online with names, photos, ages and more information about some of the people who it says have been arrested or killed.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-hrana-s-backers-members-and-methodology\">What do we know about HRANA’s backers, members and methodology?</h2><p>Al Jazeera contacted HRANA for comment, but a spokesperson declined to disclose information about the group’s members or funding sources, citing security concerns.</p><p>The spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the organisation confirms all data with primary sources, but said it could not disclose the identities of individuals or organisations in Iran with whom HRANA corroborates information. Its methodology for collecting and analysing data is not provided on its website.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-hrana-s-previous-reporting-compared-with-official-government-figures\">How has HRANA’s previous reporting compared with official government figures?</h2><p>Iran fought a 12-day war with Israel from June 13 to 24 in 2025.</p><p>HRANA reported that over the course of the conflict, 1,190 people were killed and 4,475 were injured in Iran. These figures included civilian and military casualties. The organisation additionally reported that during the war, 1,596 people were arrested by Iranian security forces.</p><p>By contrast, according to Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education, 610 people <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">were killed</a> and 4,746 people were injured over the course of the war.</p><p>In September 2022, a young woman named Mahsa Amini, aged 22, was arrested in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. She collapsed while in custody and died in hospital a few days later.</p><p>Her death caused national outrage and widespread protests in Iran that lasted for several weeks. The slogan “woman, life, freedom” was chanted in the streets.</p><p>HRANA reported in October 2022 that 200 people died and about 5,500 people were arrested during those protests.</p><p>That death toll matched figures of the state security council of the Iranian interior ministry, which said in December 2022 that <a href=\"/news/2022/12/3/iran-says-over-200-killed-in-countrys-ongoing-unrest\">more than 200</a> people had been killed since September. The security body said the deceased included security forces, those killed in “terrorist acts”, those killed by foreign-affiliated groups and described those killed by state forces as “rioters” and “armed anti-revolutionary elements who were members of secessionist groups”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Donald Trump is doing very scathing about Denmark’s capabilities for doing so, saying that Denmark’s forces here amounted to dog sleds,” he said.</p><p>“But also, there is an element … of deterrence in all of this,” he continued. “No one is thinking that any of the troops here could stop a US invasion if that happened, but it would make it more complicated, because these are now NATO allies who are coming here with their military personnel.”</p><p>“And that’s a strange thought, isn’t it?

The attack on Caracas, the abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the threats towards the Colombian and Mexican presidents by the US president are an ominous sign of the years ahead. In addition to armed external meddling, elections have sharpened political tensions from La Paz to Santiago, Buenos Aires to Quito, and the region’s biggest democracies are heading to the polls again later in 2026. Unequal dividends from decades of growth, combined with the post-pandemic erosion of state capacity, have widened the appeal of hard-line, populist responses. The danger is not only domestic: the region’s drift towards militarised politics, and the open threats by the US, surface the risks of external influence, a modern rehash of the banana republic and gunboat diplomacy playbook.</p><p>Taken together, these dynamics point to a dangerous convergence. Rising insecurity, hollowed-out political representation and renewed external coercion are reinforcing one another, weakening institutions and making the region once again vulnerable to domination rather than self-determination.</p><p>Peru is a stark cautionary tale. For two decades, the country had above-average economic growth, attracted heavy foreign investment, and even sought OECD membership. By early 2026, the sol is widely regarded as South America’s most stable currency. Yet prosperity has not translated into institutional stability: seven presidents in nine years speak to a deeper political dysfunction. The sociologist Julio Cotler has argued that Peru’s elites, enriched by exports of raw materials, had scant incentives to share gains or build capable and inclusive institutions. The result is a brittle political economy, where colonial hierarchies linger, inequalities across gender, class and ethnicity persist, and state services are dysfunctional, weakening legitimacy and representation.</p><p>That brittleness is now colliding with insecurity. In Lima, transport strikes over rising violence and extortion have repeatedly paralysed the city; dozens of bus drivers were murdered in broad daylight throughout 2025. Protests turned deadly in October 2025, when a rapper and street artist was shot near the government palace during demonstrations against the new president, José Jerí. The president of Congress called the victim a “terruco” (once a label for terrorists), illustrating the toxicity of Peru’s political landscape, as this term is a slur aimed at dissenters, often Indigenous or peasant, to delegitimise their protests and demands. This is not an isolated phenomenon, but a symptom of how political systems treat social conflict as a policing problem, something to be repressed rather than addressed.</p><p>Peru’s response has been the militarisation of public space. Under Jerí, the government declared a state of emergency and sent soldiers to patrol the streets “until insecurity is eradicated”. Ecuador has tried something similar, going so far as to declare an “internal armed conflict”, leading to increasing human rights violations. When political demands are marginalised in favour of military or police force, political representation collapses into patronage or fear. Peru’s Congress illustrates this collapse of representation. It has become a plutocratic trading house where vested interests are waved through, rather than a forum for undertaking the reforms necessary for the state to respond to the demands of its citizens.</p><p>The 2026 presidential campaign in Peru is amplifying this logic. Frontrunners promise mega-prisons, drone surveillance, and even transferring inmates to Salvadoran prisons. Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori, openly invokes “mano dura” (a militarised response to the crisis of the state and representation). Across the Andes, “order” is back as a magical solution and political proposal, reinforced by US support for repression as a policy response, though it rarely fixes the causes of violence: social exclusion, impunity and hollowed-out states.</p><p>Chile offers a cautionary example. The celebratory chants for Pinochet heard after Jose Antonio Kast’s electoral victory illustrate a nostalgia for the certainty of authoritarianism and dictatorship, one that was sponsored by US intervention. Yet the appeal of “strong hand” governance is less about ideology than about disillusionment with parties and governments that feel distant and self-serving. When elites ignore citizens’ needs, toughness is performed, replacing political representation. The military is politicised and society is militarised. From this shift, it is a short step to a symbiosis in which politicians and uniforms defend predatory interests, local or foreign, under the banner of security, as authoritarian arrangements take hold and soldiers receive “warrior dividends”.</p><p>The return of hard-line populism in the region, as well as open US military intervention and bombing, resonates with a wider revival of militarised responses to social and political problems. The revival of the Monroe Doctrine in the Caribbean, the breach of international law and the use of sheer force, the so-called “Don Doctrine”, point to a governing logic that substitutes coercion for political legitimacy. Financial pressure, visible in Argentina’s most recent legislative elections, and the summary execution of alleged drug traffickers follow the same pattern. These are not isolated phenomena but variations of the same response: the gaslighting of social problems through force. Ultimately, this produces fragile states, fragmented societies and politicised militaries that undermine the very capacity needed to deliver safety, fairness and democracy, making external interference easier, not harder.</p><p>As leaders in the region pursue militarisation as a means of repressing dissent, they weaken states and position countries much as they were when banana republics first emerged. Weak institutions, corrupted legislatures and politicised security forces once again define political life. Today, the script is updated, more overt, raw and transactional, as the missiles and the aftermath of the abduction of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela illustrate.</p><p>A different path is possible, but it begins by describing the problem correctly. Violence is real, yet security without legitimacy is ephemeral, and force without institution-building is brittle. The Andes will not escape the current trend of insecurity and instability by doubling down on emergency powers, larger prisons and sweeping the streets with soldiers in full gear. The only way to bypass this path is to invest in justice and tackle the institutionalised inequalities that make violence feasible and profitable. This cannot happen without recasting political representation away from current predatory dynamics.</p><p>If the region continues the chant of right-wing populism in 2026, it will see more states of emergency, more “internal conflicts” and more militarised campaigns, and inevitably more room for foreign actors to set the terms and priorities in the region. A reboot of banana republics with a “security” add-on. It might even hand the US president the geopolitical equivalent of a “FIFA Peace Prize”, something that resembles a prize for the performance of success, but that ultimately fails in real life. The only way out of this trajectory is to ensure that politics takes place without the shadow of a uniform and populism, and that citizens’ voices are not eclipsed by the interests of cliques and short-sighted elites. This task will be more difficult given the pressures from the US for transactional deals that do not care for democracy, human rights or legitimacy.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
