Maduro denies the accusations amid growing fears of potential US military action in the region, and his government has called the cartel an “invention”.</p><p>The US designation comes after continued US interceptions of boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific and the recent arrival of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-amid-hardening-stance-towards-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group</a> in the Caribbean this month. The US says the military build-up is targeting drug trafficking, but Caracas accuses Washington of using it as a pretext for <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/is-trump-pushing-for-regime-change-in-venezuela-where-else-is-he-meddling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“imperialist” plans</a> to topple Maduro’s administration – a view echoed by some analysts.</p><p>Venezuela has long grappled with political instability and economic decline, rooted partly in its reliance on oil. This fragility, compounded by years of sanctions, has also led to one of the world’s largest exoduses as Venezuelans seek stability and better opportunities abroad.</p><p>Here are 10 charts to help explain how Venezuela reached this point:</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-at-a-glance\">Venezuela at a glance</h2><p>Venezuela is home to about 28.4 million people, making it the 53rd most populous country in the world.</p><p>About 85 percent of Venezuela’s population lives in urban areas in the north of the country, a coastal mountainous region where most of the country’s major cities are located. The most populous cities are the capital, Caracas (3 million people), Maracaibo (2.4 million) and Valencia (2 million).</p><p>According to the latest World Bank data, Venezuela’s life expectancy is about 73 years with a fertility rate of two, meaning each woman on average has two children. This is much higher than in many Western nations, where fertility rates are far below the replacement rate of 2.1, the number of children a woman must have if a population is to remain at current levels.</p><p>Venezuela’s gross domestic product (GDP) stands at $108.5bn, placing it among the smallest economies in Latin America despite its vast natural resources.</p><p>Nearly 90 percent of Venezuela’s population is Christian, primarily Catholic.</p><p>Venezuela gained independence from Spain in 1811. Spanish is the official language of Venezuela, but several Indigenous languages are also spoken.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129625\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-AT-A-GLANCE-2025-1764062410.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-AT-A-GLANCE-2025-1764062410\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-big-is-venezuela\">How big is Venezuela?</h2><p>By area, Venezuela is the 32nd largest country in the world and South America’s sixth largest country, covering 916,445sq km (353,841sq miles). Venezuela is roughly the same size as Nigeria or Pakistan and about 1.5 times the size of the US state of Texas.</p><p>Its landscape is made up of mountains, namely the Andes to the west and the Montanoso coastal range to the north and east; tropical jungles, including the Amazon rainforest; river plains; and coastal plains.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129642\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA_SIZE_2025-1764062791.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA_SIZE_2025-1764062791\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"political-leadership\">Political leadership</h2><p>Venezuela’s political landscape has historically swung between democratic rule, populism and hardline rule. Since the end of military rule in 1958, alternating governments have taken power in the country, largely led by two major parties, Democratic Action, a social democratic party, and the Christian democratic COPEI party.</p><p>By the 1980s, the country’s oil-dependent economy began to falter. The global oil glut triggered a severe downturn, forcing Venezuela to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and adopt unpopular austerity measures. Economic decline, corruption and growing public disillusionment with traditional parties weakened the two-party system through the 1990s.</p><p>This turmoil paved the way for the rise of Hugo Chavez, a former military officer who had led a failed coup in 1992. Capitalising on public anger towards what many Venezuelans saw as a corrupt political order, Chavez was elected president in 1999 after he promised to abolish the old political system.</p><p>Once in power, he launched what he called the Bolivarian Revolution, named after Simon Bolivar, the South American independence leader. Chavez redirected oil revenues into social programmes that expanded access to housing, education, healthcare and military spending instead of going directly to the political elite via a patronage system. While Chavez’s populist government initially reduced poverty and inequality, Venezuela’s unsustainable spending and deep reliance on oil left the country vulnerable.</p><p>By the mid-2010s, an oil bust and tightening US sanctions had triggered a major economic crisis, leading to one of the largest mass emigrations in the world.</p><p>After Chavez’s death in 2013, Maduro, his handpicked successor, ascended to the presidency and consolidated Chavez’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela into the country’s dominant political force.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129715\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-POLITICAL-LEADERSHIP-1764064638.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-POLITICAL-LEADERSHIP-1764064638\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"venezuela-s-economy-and-trading-partners\">Venezuela’s economy and trading partners</h2><p>Venezuela funds the majority of its government budget from oil revenues. In 2024, oil export revenues and taxes paid by the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, were estimated to make up about 58 percent of state income.</p><p>The country’s economy has been deeply turbulent for more than four decades, and its GDP shrank by more than 70 percent from 2014 to 2024. However, in 2023, US President Joe Biden’s administration eased some sanctions on oil and gas, leading to an annual growth rate of 5 percent in 2023.</p><p>Government officials forecast 8 percent growth in 2024. According to <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/gdp-growth-annual/news/495105\">Trading Economics</a>, third-quarter growth this year was 8.7 percent year-on-year, driven largely by a rise in oil activity.</p><p>In 2023, crude petroleum accounted for half of Venezuela’s exports. The US was Venezuela’s largest trading partner, buying half of Venezuela’s exports, mostly crude petroleum.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129718\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-EXPORTS-1764064769.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-EXPORTS-1764064769\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Petroleum coke is the second biggest export from Venezuela, accounting for more than 7 percent of overall exports.</p><p>In 2023, China was Venezuela’s second largest trading partner, accounting for almost 10 percent of its total exports, half of which were petroleum coke.</p><p>Spain was Venezuela’s third largest trading partner in 2023, accounting for about 9 percent of its exports, mostly crude petroleum.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-TRADE-PARTNERS-1764064881.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-TRADE-PARTNERS-1764064881\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"world-s-largest-proven-oil-reserves\">World’s largest proven oil reserves</h2><p>Venezuela is home to the largest known reserves of oil, estimated at 303 billion barrels (Bbbl) as of 2023.</p><p>However, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn).</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a vast region in the eastern part of the country that stretches across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>The Orinoco Belt holds extra heavy crude oil, which is highly viscous and dense, making it much harder and more expensive to extract than conventional crude. Producing oil from this region requires advanced techniques, such as steam injection and blending with lighter crudes to make it marketable.</p><p>Because of its density and sulphur content, extra heavy crude usually sells at a discount compared with lighter crudes.</p><p>In addition to crude oil, Venezuela exports smaller volumes of refined petroleum products, such as petrol and diesel, but its potential to increase these is limited due to ageing refinery infrastructure, technical challenges and sanctions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925530\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925530\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Worldwide-proven-oil-reserves-1756989583.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Worldwide proven oil reserves-1756989583\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-migration-crisis\">The migration crisis</h2><p>About 2015, Venezuela’s net migration dipped sharply with a record 1.4 million people emigrating in 2018.</p><p>Over the past decade, Maduro has tightened his grip on power, eroding democratic institutions through censorship, restricted internet access and the persecution of political opponents.</p><p>Combined with sanctions and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis has deepened, leading to severe shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Half the population still lives in poverty although the rate has slightly improved since 2021. Meanwhile, the inflation rate for 2025 is estimated at 180 percent, according to figures from Statista, meaning people are grappling with a severe cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>The majority of those leaving Venezuela have fled to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said the economic crisis has been “driven by devastating policies and a kleptocracy that has characterised the political landscape during the last 20 years”.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-unemployment-rate\">What is the unemployment rate?</h2><p>Venezuela’s unemployment rate stood at 5.5 percent in 2024. Unemployment averaged 10 percent from 1999 to 2024, reaching an all-time high of 21 percent in 2003.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"how-equipped-is-venezuela-s-military\">How equipped is Venezuela’s military?</h2><p>Venezuela’s armed forces are mainly responsible for protecting the country, its borders, internal security and counternarcotics operations. However, according to Military Balance, an open-source documentation of military forces and spending around the world, Venezuela’s economic decline has weakened its military’s modernisation efforts.</p><p>As of 2018, the armed forces had 123,000 active personnel and 8,000 reservists.</p><p>Venezuela maintains close military ties with China, Russia, Iran and Cuba, relying on them for weapons and training. Joint military exercises with these countries have taken place in recent years in China and Russia, most recently the 2022 International Army Games, hosted by Russia.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"us-attacks-in-the-caribbean\">US attacks in the Caribbean</h2><p>The US military has carried out at least 21 deadly strikes on vessels off Venezuela’s coast, in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since September 2, marking the most intense American military activity in Latin America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989.</p><p>The strikes, conducted under the authority of the US Southern Command, have killed at least 83 people, according to statements by US President Donald Trump and senior US defence officials.</p><p>The map below shows the approximate locations of these attacks, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data. Most of the attacks occurred close to the Venezuelan coast and in international waters, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/can-us-strikes-on-suspected-drug-boats-off-venezuela-be-legally-justified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raising questions</a> about the legality of the US use of force, especially when no imminent threat was present.</p><p><strong><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129919\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-US_ATTACKS_VENEZUELA_VESSELS_NOV25-1764071362.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - US_ATTACKS_VENEZUELA_VESSELS_NOV25-1764071362\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></strong></p><h2 id=\"drug-routes-into-venezuela\">Drug routes into Venezuela</h2><p>Trump has defended the US attacks by saying the US is dismantling drug-trafficking routes from Venezuela, including the flow of cocaine and fentanyl.</p><p>However, data from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) show that most cocaine is not produced in Venezuela and the country plays a minor role in the drugs trade, mostly as a transit route. Some shipments and flights originate from or pass through Venezuela due to its border with Colombia. Venezuela has borders with three countries – Brazil to the south, Colombia to the west and Guyana to the east.</p><p>Colombia, Peru and Bolivia produce the vast majority of the world’s cocaine, accounting for an estimated 99 percent of global production, according to the UNODC.</p><p>In addition, most cocaine bound for the US is smuggled via the Pacific, often passing through Central America and Mexico.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129738\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-DRUG-ROUTES-USA-1764065274.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-DRUG-ROUTES-USA-1764065274\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

Gerasimov is just a liar,” and he repeated the claim a week later.</p><p>Ukraine has also had successes on the ground, according to its commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskii. “Despite enemy pressure, the Defence Forces of Ukraine managed to carry out counteroffensive actions in the Dobropillia direction from the end of August to October this year,” he said, referring to a failed Russian flanking manoeuvre towards a town northwest of Pokrovsk.</p><p>“As a result, the units split the enemy’s offensive group and liberated over 430 square kilometres [166 square miles] north of Pokrovsk. Russian losses amounted to more than 13,000 killed and wounded.”</p><p>Russia also kept up pressure on Ukraine’s rear, launching 1,169 drones and 25 missiles at its cities during the week of November 20-26. Ukraine downed 85 percent of the drones and 14 of the missiles, but Zelenskyy called for more short- and medium-range defences.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127618\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127618\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127618\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1763991689.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1763991689\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"questionable-diplomacy\">Questionable diplomacy</h2><p>Europe, Ukraine and members of the US Congress have all pushed back against a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point peace plan</a> presented by the US administration of Donald Trump last week, describing it as too Russia-friendly.</p><p>In its original form, the plan granted key points that Russia has demanded. That included a promise from Ukraine never to join NATO and the surrendering of almost all the territory Russia has taken by force, along with the unoccupied remainder of Donetsk. The US and Ukraine’s other Western allies would have to recognise those annexations as legal.</p><p>Ukraine would have to hold an election within 100 days of the plan’s signature – one that Russia seems to believe would unseat Zelenskyy.</p><p>Russia has also demanded that Ukraine effectively disarm. The 28-point plan suggests reducing its armed forces by about a third, to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Right now is one of the hardest moments in our history,” Zelenskyy told the Ukrainian people after seeing the plan, describing it as a choice between “either the loss of our dignity or the risk of losing a key partner”.</p><p>The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Senator Roger Wicker said in a statement: “This so-called ‘peace plan’ has real problems, and I am highly skeptical it will achieve peace.”</p><p>Polish Premier Donald Tusk politely said on social media: “It would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.”</p><p>The plan drew heavily from a Russian non-paper submitted to the White House in October, said the Reuters news agency.</p><p>“Trump’s 28-point plan, which we have, enshrines the key understandings reached during the Alaska summit,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters.</p><p>“I would say not all, but many provisions of this plan, they seem quite acceptable to us,” Putin aide Yury Ushakov told the TASS Russian state news agency.</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany drafted a counter-proposal on Sunday, and a Ukrainian delegation led by former Defence Minister Rustem Umerov met with US negotiators under Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva to discuss both documents.</p><p>Europe ruled out accepting territorial exchanges resulting from aggression, and suggested territorial negotiations begin from the line of contact without prior Ukrainian concessions. It also suggested Ukraine maintain a strong army of no fewer than 800,000 people, and receive an effective NATO security guarantee.</p><p>Their joint statement on Monday simply said they would “continue intensive work”, with final decisions to be made by Trump and Zelenskyy.</p><p>Much had been done to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/russia-ukraine-peace-plan-whats-the-latest-version-after-us-kyiv-talks\">refine the original 28 points</a> into a workable agreement, said Zelenskyy. “Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable,” he told Ukrainians somewhat cryptically, describing the work that remained as “very challenging”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ukraine has pushed for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump before December to thrash out the plan’s final form, but on Tuesday, Bloomberg released transcripts of a leaked telephone conversation between Trump confidant Steve Witkoff and Putin aide Yury Ushakov, in which Witkoff advised Ushakov to have Putin call Trump before Zelenskyy had a chance to meet him. Witkoff suggested that Putin flatter Trump as a peacemaker to win his favour and shape the peace plan directly with him.</p><p>That leak prompted opposition to Witkoff travelling to Moscow next week to discuss the reworked plan with Russian officials. The White House said he is to replace General Keith Kellogg, who resigned as mediator for Ukraine after seeing the original 28-point plan.</p><p>“It is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” wrote Republican Congressman Don Bacon on social media.</p><p></p><p>In his first extensive remarks on the peace proposal, in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin backed away from an agreement with Ukraine, saying, “Signing documents with the Ukrainian leadership is pointless,” because Zelenskyy was a president who had outlived his mandate.</p><p>“I believe that the Ukrainian authorities made a fundamental and strategic mistake when they succumbed to the fear of participating in the presidential elections,” he said, referring to the spring of 2025, when Zelenskyy’s four-year term expired.</p><p>Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, and the parliament has twice extended his tenure under the constitutional provision of a national emergency.</p><p>Putin said the 28 points did not amount to a peace treaty, calling them “a set of questions that were proposed for discussion and final wording”.</p><p>“In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,” Putin said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127614\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127614\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127614\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-Ukraine-Refugees-1763991679.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE Ukraine Refugees-1763991679\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

While the IMF wants the West African nation to undertake a painful restructuring before it will agree to a bailout, Senegal, which was recently downgraded to deep within “junk bond” status, is resisting this plan.</p><p>Earlier this month, credit rating agency S&amp;P lowered Senegal to CCC+, citing the fragile country’s poor government finances. “Despite actions taken to boost growth and tax collection, the level of debt and size of the interest bill mean Senegal’s public finances remain precarious, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive official support programme,” S&amp;P said on November 14.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Last year, the IMF suspended a $1.8bn funding package for Senegal after the government discovered $7bn in borrowing, which had been concealed by the previous administration.</p><p>Negotiations between Dakar and the IMF for a new bailout package are continuing as they hammer out what the government must do to restore public finances. But the two sides have so far failed to agree on a path forward.</p><h2 id=\"how-high-is-senegal-s-public-debt\">How high is Senegal’s public debt?</h2><p>In its latest <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3479905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rating review</a>, S&amp;P estimated Senegal’s public debt had risen to $42.1bn, or 119 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), at the end of 2024, making it one of the most indebted countries in Africa. That figure excluded about 9 percent of GDP in debt owed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).</p><p><span>Since 2008, Senegal has leaned heavily on borrowing to fund infrastructure projects. But during the <a href=\"/economy/2022/4/20/imf-world-bank-warn-of-huge-buildup-of-debt-in-poorest-nations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 crisis</a> and subsequent jump in global interest rates, </span>which made debt more expensive, costs soared as income fell. In turn, Senegal’s fiscal pressures grew significantly.</p><p>To address its debt load, the government is now hoping to shrink the fiscal deficit – the amount by which public spending exceeds taxes coming into the public purse – from 12.6 percent of GDP in 2024 to to 5.4 percent by next year and narrowing to just 3 percent of GDP by 2027.</p><p>But S&amp;P’s outlook is far less rosy. The agency is forecasting a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP next year and 6.8 percent of GDP in 2027. As such, S&amp;P estimates that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 123 percent next year, before falling slightly in 2027.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-led-to-the-current-impasse-with-the-imf\">What has led to the current impasse with the IMF?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2024/3/27/senegal-oppositions-faye-won-over-54-of-vote-full-provisional-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">March 2024</a>, Bassirou Diomaye Faye won Senegal’s presidential election. He <a href=\"/news/2024/3/15/we-want-sonko-senegal-opposition-boosted-after-leaders-freed-before-vote\">ran in place</a> of the disqualified opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, who had been barred from the election over a libel case involving the then-tourism minister. But after the vote, Sonko became Faye’s prime minister.</p><p>In September 2024, the new <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/senegals-ruling-pastef-party-secures-large-majority-in-parliament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pastef party</a> government ordered an audit of the country’s public finances. Senegal’s court of auditors discovered that the previous administration, under President Macky Sall, had significantly understated the level of public debt.</p><p>The court estimated that Senegal’s real debt-to-GDP ratio was closer to 100 percent, compared with the roughly 70 percent which had earlier been reported, revealing almost $7bn in undisclosed borrowing, which largely stemmed from not including the liabilities of SOEs.</p><p><span>The IMF endorsed the auditors’ assessment, calling it a “conscious decision” by the Sall administration to mask the true extent of Senegal’s debt. The IMF then suspended its $1.8bn loan package with</span> Senegal, which it had approved in 2023.</p><p>IMF loan packages are typically paid over in tranches. By the time it pulled the plug on the Senegal programme, the IMF has already disbursed $700m of the full amount. The IMF’s executive board must now decide whether to continue with the arrangement. If its review goes against Dakar, the board could ask the government to repay the disbursed funds.</p><p>If its review is favourable, the IMF could decide to keep the programme in place and release the next instalment of funding soon.</p><p>For context, the IMF’s $1.8bn loan is equivalent to roughly half of Senegal’s 2024 deficit. The upshot is that it would provide essential funds for public spending. Without it, Senegal will face a big financing shortfall.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135880\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135880\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135880\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024-03-24T135203Z_1869916670_RC2AS6A1TV7X_RTRMADP_3_SENEGAL-ELECTION-1764257606.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Faye\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Presidential candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye, backed by Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, gestures after casting his vote in the presidential election at the polling station at Ndiaganiao in Mbour, Senegal, on March 24, 2024 [Abdou Karim Ndoye/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-hasn-t-the-imf-reached-a-decision-about-this-yet\">Why hasn’t the IMF reached a decision about this yet?</h2><p>On November 6, following a two-week visit to the West African nation, the IMF mission chief for Senegal, Edward Gemayel, said, “We’re engaged and determined to move as fast as possible to help.”</p><p>A few days later, Prime Minister Sonko revealed that Gemayel’s team had urged Senegal to carry out a restructuring – in which old debt is swapped for new debt with longer maturities, lower interest rates, or a reduced debt stock – so the country repays less. But these arrangements generally lead to reduced public spending and slower growth.</p><p>Countries that default on their debt typically struggle because they are forced to cut spending to stabilise their finances, leaving less money for public services and investment. Investor confidence also tends to fall, making it harder and more expensive for governments to borrow.</p><p>At a meeting of Pastef officials on November 8, Sonko, who has considerable influence over economic policy, said he had rejected the IMF’s proposal to restructure Senegal’s debt. But his decision to reject the IMF’s plan has left Dakar with few options to narrow his country’s fiscal gap.</p><p>Looking ahead, the prime minister will have to convince the Washington-based IMF to release its paused loan by presenting a credible fiscal plan that restores Senegal’s finances without resorting to a debt restructuring.</p><p>But Gemayel has already cautioned that the government’s 2026 budget is “very ambitious”, citing large tax increases. “We’ve never seen this before,” he said. “So, they need to be careful.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-impact-of-this-been-on-senegal-s-economy\">What has the impact of this been on Senegal’s economy?</h2><p>Sonko’s decision to reject the IMF’s restructuring plan has rattled investors. On Monday, November 10 – the first trading day after Sonko’s cabinet meeting – Senegal’s 2031-dollar bonds fell by 4 percent to $73.1. Elsewhere, its notes due in 2048 fell by 2.4 cents to $60.30.</p><p>“The bonds dropped as market players reacted to the IMF having requested a restructuring,” said Leeuwner Esterhuysen, an Africa analyst at Oxford Economics. “There’s clearly a high degree of debt distress and little prospect of IMF funding anytime soon.”</p><p>“It seems the Fund is making a new loan contingent on Dakar accepting a restructuring,” Esterhuysen told Al Jazeera. “For now, the government isn’t playing ball … which will extend the stalemate,” he said.</p><p>Another sign of market anxiety is that the cost of insurance against default – in the form of credit-default swaps – almost doubled in the days leading up to November 12, rising from 750 to 1,120 basis points, or 3.7 percentage points.</p><p>During a speech at a rally in Dakar on November 11, Sonko insisted, “Senegal is a proud nation. We will not be treated like a failed state. Mobilising tax revenue is better than accepting a debt restructuring.”</p><p>Since 2020, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Chad have all been forced to <a href=\"/features/2023/7/4/is-a-global-debt-bomb-about-to-explode\">restructure their debt</a>. But the long and drawn-out process, and accompanying economic hardship, have made debt rewrites unpalatable for other African governments.</p><p>Kenya, another debt-strapped country, instead opted for costly trade-offs – tax hikes and subsidy cuts – last year. The measures were aimed at reducing Kenya’s budget deficit. But they also sparked <a href=\"/features/2024/6/27/not-afraid-to-die-kenya-tax-protests-inspire-broader-demand-for-change\">deadly protests</a>, highlighting the political risks associated with austerity.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135888\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135888\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024-03-21T050227Z_531916148_RC2QP6ATVCBP_RTRMADP_3_SENEGAL-ELECTION-1764257756.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Faye Sonko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An electoral billboard for the Senegalese presidential candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye, backed by opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, in Dakar, Senegal, on March 20, 2024 [Luc Gnago/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-this-affected-the-political-situation-in-senegal\">How has this affected the political situation in Senegal?</h2><p>Sonko is opposed to an IMF-backed restructuring because “he doesn’t want to undermine his 2024 election campaign pledge to restore Senegal’s sovereignty”, said Paul Melly, a consulting fellow on the Africa programme at Chatham House.</p><p>Melly also noted that Sonko is contending with “tensions” between himself and President Faye. Earlier this month, it emerged that Sonko’s party rejected Faye’s attempt to lead a revamped coalition, a move viewed as an effort to consolidate power.</p><p>And though Sonko serves under Faye, he is widely viewed as a key power broker, often shaping policy on his own terms. “Sonko was never going to be a subordinate prime minister,” Melly told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As such, Senegal’s fiscal position represents a major political challenge for Sonko. He still wants to assert his “sovereignty” line, but may need to impose unpopular spending cuts to stay ahead of debt repayments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-else-could-senegal-address-its-debt-problem\">How else could Senegal address its debt problem?</h2><p>In recent weeks, the government has introduced new levies on tobacco, alcohol, gambling and widely used mobile money transfers. It has also made efforts to cut back on travel outlays and car purchases as part of its internal efforts to cut spending.</p><p>“It’s a tricky balance,” said Melly.  “Expectations remain high even as the economic challenges are huge.”</p><p>If the government concedes to the IMF, “it may result in voter disillusionment at the next municipal elections in early 2027.” It may also result in civil strife.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If they do not pull back, we will achieve this by military means,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine has said that such a withdrawal would leave the way open for a Russian assault on its capital, Kyiv.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-president-has-lost-his-legitimate-status\">‘The president has lost his legitimate status’</h2><p>Putin also suggested that he was open to a negotiated settlement with Kyiv, but once again branded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government illegitimate, adding that it was “legally impossible” to sign any agreements with them.</p><p>“Broadly speaking, of course, we ultimately want to reach an agreement with Ukraine.
