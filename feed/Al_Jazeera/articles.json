Mogadishu has warned that Israel plans to set up a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/somali-minister-says-israel-plans-to-displace-palestinians-to-somaliland\">military base</a> in the breakaway region, which could be used to launch attacks on neighbouring countries.</p><p>Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/somalias-mohamud-slams-israels-interference-rejects-base-on-somaliland\">told Al Jazeera</a> last week that Mogadishu “will never allow” the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland and will “confront” any such move.</p><p>“We will fight in our capacity. Of course, we will defend ourselves,” he said. “And that means that we will confront any Israeli forces coming in, because we are against that and we will never allow that.”</p><p>A Somaliland official told Israel’s Channel 12 in January that an Israeli military base is “on the table”, though terms were still being negotiated.</p><p>Separately, Somalia also <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/somalia-cancels-all-agreements-with-uae-over-alleged-sovereignty-violations\">cancelled all agreements</a> with the United Arab Emirates last month – including port operations, security and defence deals – citing “harmful actions” that undermine its “national unity and political independence”.</p><p>The move came amid reports that the UAE had facilitated Israel’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence.</p><p>The Gulf state, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020 under the Abraham Accords, has cultivated deep economic and security ties with Somaliland. These include a 30-year concession at the strategic Berbera port held by the UAE company DP World.</p><p>The UAE declined to sign a joint Arab-Islamic statement condemning Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, but it released a joint statement with the African Union in January pledging “support for Somalia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability”.</p><p>Somalia’s break with the UAE coincided with a deterioration in Saudi Arabian-Emirati relations.</p><p>Tensions erupted in December when Saudi forces bombed what Riyadh described as a UAE weapons shipment to the separatist Southern Transitional Council in Yemen. Saudi Arabia also backed a call by Yemen’s internationally recognised government for Emirati forces in the country to withdraw.</p><p>The UAE denied the allegations.</p><p>Separately, Abu Dhabi has also been accused of supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan, which has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces for nearly three years.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, an ally of Khartoum, condemned the RSF on Saturday over attacks in Sudan’s Kordofan region, which have killed dozens of people, including women and children.</p><p>Riyadh also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/saudi-arabia-slams-foreign-interference-in-sudan-after-deadly-rsf-attacks\">denounced “foreign interference”</a> by unspecified parties in Sudan, saying the “continued influx of illegal weapons, mercenaries and foreign fighters” was prolonging the continuation of the nearly three-year-old war.</p><p>It did not name the parties.</p><p>Sudan, meanwhile, filed a case against the UAE at the International Court of Justice last year, accusing it of “c<a href=\"/news/2025/3/6/sudan-files-case-against-uae-at-top-un-court-over-complicity-in-genocide\">omplicity in genocide</a>” allegedly committed by the RSF against the Masalit community in West Darfur state.</p><p>The UAE slammed the move as “nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt” and said it would seek the “immediate dismissal” of the case.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of the drones launched, 116 were shot down or neutralised, and some missiles were intercepted and did not reach their targets, the Air Force said.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian attacks have damaged production sites of Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas company Naftogaz in the Poltava and Sumy regions of the country, the company’s CEO, Sergii Koretskyi, said in a Facebook post. Koretskyi said it was the 20th attack on the company’s infrastructure since the start of this year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian forces are trying to press forward around the city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv’s military said, hoping to conclude a months-long campaign to seize the strategic hub as Moscow seeks to capture the whole of the Donetsk region. The fall of Pokrovsk would mark Russia’s biggest battlefield victory since it seized the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kyiv’s General Staff said its forces still hold the northern part of <a href=\"/features/2025/11/10/is-the-fall-of-pokrovsk-ukraines-key-eastern-stronghold-inevitable\">Pokrovsk</a>, a city with a pre-war population of 60,000, and are also defending the smaller city of Myrnohrad nearby. Pokrovsk has been the site of fierce fighting since last year.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h3>Weapons</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine is opening up exports of its domestically produced weapons, including combat drones, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, as a way for Kyiv to earn money from wartime technology and generate badly needed funds for the country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Zelenskyy said that 10 “export centres” for Ukrainian weapons would be opened in 2026 across Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Ukraine and France have agreed to start “large-scale” joint weapons production, Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on the Telegram messaging app, after hosting his French counterpart, Catherine Vautrin, in Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Fedorov did not specify what arms would be produced with France or when manufacturing would be launched.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>An agreement on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine must also take into consideration security guarantees for Russia, Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Grushko told the Izvestia media outlet. These guarantees include the rejection of any deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO states, he said.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia remains open to cooperation with the United States, but is not hopeful about economic ties despite Washington’s ongoing efforts to end the war in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the Russia-based media outlet TV BRICS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has claimed that suspects held for the shooting of one of the country’s most senior military intelligence officers in Moscow last week, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/senior-russian-officer-shot-in-moscow-in-apparent-assassination-attempt\">Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev,</a> have confessed that they were carrying out orders from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The FSB also claimed that Polish intelligence was involved in their recruitment. Neither Ukraine nor Poland has commented on the allegations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">India plans to maintain multiple sources of energy supply and diversify them when needed, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said. The minister’s comments come after US President Donald Trump said last week that New Delhi had “committed to stop directly or indirectly” importing fuel from Russia.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Germany has indicted a Ukrainian national in connection with allegations of a plot linked to Russian intelligence to detonate parcel packages in Europe, German prosecutors said in a statement. The suspect was arrested in Switzerland in May of last year and extradited to Germany in December. Moscow has previously denied involvement in the alleged plot.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The European Union has proposed extending its sanctions against Russia to include ports in Georgia and Indonesia that handle Russian oil, the first time the bloc would target ports in third countries that deal with Russia, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a proposal document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The proposal bars EU companies and individuals from conducting transactions with the ports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The EU also proposed adding two Kyrgyz banks – Keremet and OJSC Capital Bank of Central Asia – to its sanctions list for providing crypto asset services to Russia, as well as banks in Laos and Tajikistan, while removing two Chinese lenders.

A separate case in Los Angeles, which accuses Meta and the Google-owned YouTube of deliberately designing their platforms to be addictive for children, is set to begin later this week.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>TikTok and Snap were also named in the original California lawsuit but later settled under undisclosed terms.</p><p>The New Mexico and California lawsuits are the first of a wave of 40 lawsuits filed by state attorneys general around the US against Meta, specifically, that allege that the social media giant is harming the mental health of young Americans.</p><h2 id=\"new-mexico-case\">New Mexico case</h2><p>In the opening argument in the New Mexico case, which was first filed in 2023, prosecutors told jurors on Monday that Meta – Facebook and Instagram’s parent company – had failed to disclose its platforms’ harmful effects on kids.</p><p>“The theme throughout this trial is going to be that Meta put profits over safety,” said lawyer Donald Migliori, who is representing the state of New Mexico against Meta.</p><p>“Meta clearly knew that youth safety was not its corporate priority… that youth safety was less important than growth and engagement.”</p><p>Prosecutors say they will provide evidence and testimony that Meta’s algorithms and account features not only enticed young people and made them addicted to social media, but also fostered a “breeding ground” for predators who target children for sexual exploitation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Late last month, in the process of discovery, the New Mexico attorney general’s office said the company did not put in safeguards to protect children from accessing sexualised chatbots on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>In emails obtained by the court, some of Meta’s safety staff had expressed objections that the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing do not include messages or memos authored by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In October 2025, Meta added parental controls to the chatbots.</p><h2 id=\"california-case\">California case</h2><p>The California case is more wide-reaching and alleges that Meta and YouTube, which is a unit of Alphabet-owned Google, used deliberate design choices that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits.</p><p>The case centres around a 19-year-old identified only by the initials KGM. The case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out.</p><p>KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age made her <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\">addicted to the technology</a> and exacerbated her depression and suicidal thoughts.</p><p>“Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>Executives, including Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. It is unclear if they will attend the New Mexico case.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevvy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>“Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,” Meta said in a recent blog post. “But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens’ well-being aren’t clear-cut or universal.</p><p>Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.”</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said in a recent statement that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it is “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people”.</p><p>Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesperson, said the allegations against YouTube are “simply not true”.</p><p>“Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” he said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"high-stakes\">High stakes</h2><p>The outcome of the cases could shape the future of social media.</p><p>“In my mind, an existential question for social media services is whether they’re liable for harm suffered by users from using the services. If so, the damages could be more money than the defendants have, Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We’re talking about massive financial stakes, and we’re also talking about the ability of the plaintiffs to veto or potentially override editorial decisions by the services about what’s in the best interests of their audiences,” he said.</p><p>“It’s essentially taking away power from the services to decide and handing it to plaintiffs’ lawyers. So, not only could there be existential damages, but there could also be a massive loss of editorial control over their services. The stakes could not be higher for social media services or the internet.”</p><p>Goldman said this was because the same argument could be used to shape claims against video game makers and generative AI, which refers to AI that can create original content, including text and video.</p><p>“If these theories work against social media, they might also work against video games, against generative AI, and who knows what else. That’s why I said the stakes are so high for the internet,” he added.</p><p>There are already lawsuits that claim that interactions with OpenAI’s ChatGPT led to instances of suicide and murder-suicide.</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock is trending up by more than 3 percent in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

agreement signed between the two countries, granting exemptions for some textiles and garments manufactured with US material.</p><p>The trade deal was announced on Monday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Muhammad Yunus, the chief adviser heading Bangladesh’s interim government, said Washington had “committed to establishing a mechanism for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh using US-produced cotton and man-made fibre to receive zero reciprocal tariff in [the] US market”.</p><p>The White House said Bangladesh had agreed to provide significant preferential market access for US industrial and agricultural goods, including chemicals, medical devices, machinery, motor vehicles and parts, soya products and dairy goods, beef, poultry, tree nuts and fruit.</p><p>Bangladesh will also ease non-tariff barriers by accepting US vehicle safety and emissions standards, recognising US Food and Drug Administration certifications, and removing import restrictions on remanufactured goods, the White House added.</p><p>The nations also noted recent and upcoming commercial deals including aircraft procurement, around $3.5bn in purchases of US agricultural products, and an estimated $15bn in US energy product purchases over 15 years.</p><p>Yunus said the agreement followed nine months of negotiations that began in April last year.</p><p>Bangladesh also pledged to uphold internationally recognised labour rights and strengthen environmental protections.</p><p>The South Asian nation in August had secured a reduction in US tariffs on its exports to 20 percent, down from 37 percent initially proposed by Washington, offering much-needed relief to the nation’s apparel exporters.</p><p>The ready-made garments sector is the backbone of Bangladesh’s economy, accounting for more than 80 percent of total export earnings, employing about four million workers and contributing about 10 percent to gross domestic product.</p><p>At the 19 percent tariff rate, Bangladesh will compete comfortably with next-door neighbour India, for which the tariff rate has been set at <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 percent</a>, down from a crippling 50 percent. Both countries make clothing and footwear for clients in the US. When the first round of tariffs was announced on April 2, India had been slammed with 25 percent while Dhaka had been given a much stiffer 37 percent. At the time, Bangladeshi manufacturers feared that they would lose clients to the Indian market. Now both are on an equal footing.</p><p>Bangladesh goes to the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polls on Thursday</a> to elect new leadership after being governed by an interim government since August 2024, when ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, where she remains.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The files show that both Trump and Clinton spent time with the sex offender in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>Clinton and his wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are both set to sit for depositions later this month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-got-nothing\">‘We got nothing’</h2><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said that “people were waiting to hear answers to important questions” during the deposition, “but we got nothing”.</p><p>“What she did say, very briefly, was that she never saw any evidence of Trump or Clinton involved in anything that was illegal,” Fisher said. “Many people suggest that was a deliberate ploy on her part to say, ‘Look, you buy my silence, but I want clemency.’ She’s appealing to both parties here to say, ‘I will clear the people that you care most about’.”</p><p>Asked about Maxwell’s appeal, the White House on Monday pointed to previous remarks from the president that indicated the prospect of a pardon was not on his radar.</p><p>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, meanwhile, expressed frustration with Maxwell’s refusal to testify, noting that she had previously spoken with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who had worked as Trump’s personal lawyer.</p><p>“This position appears inconsistent with Ms Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter,” Khanna said.</p><p>Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas after <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-justice-department-to-discuss-epstein-with-ghislaine-maxwell\">meeting twice with Blanche</a> last year. The deputy attorney general cited “numerous threats against her life”, without providing details.</p><p>The move prompted questions from Democratic lawmakers, who asked whether Maxwell had “been given special treatment in exchange for political favours” as Trump’s own relationship with Epstein comes under growing scrutiny.</p><p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the Epstein scandal a “hoax”, and saying he broke off ties in the early 2000s, before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a prostitution charge.</p><p>Maxwell is the only person convicted of crimes related to Epstein, whose connections to powerful individuals worldwide have been revealed in the Epstein files.</p><p>The release of the documents has set in motion political crises in multiple countries, including in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer is clinging to his job after it was revealed that his former ambassador to the US had maintained close ties with Epstein.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers, however, bemoaned that political figures in the US seem to be escaping unscathed so far.</p><p>“I’m just afraid that the general worsening and degradation of American life has somehow conditioned people not to take this as seriously as we should be taking it,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unredacted-files\">Unredacted files</h2><p>Separately, on Monday, several Democratic and Republican lawmakers also visited a Justice Department office in Washington, DC, to look through the unredacted versions of the Epstein files. The lawmakers were given access to the more than 3 million released files in a reading room with four computers, as part of an arrangement with the Justice Department.</p><p>The lawmakers can only make handwritten notes, and their staff are not allowed in with them.</p><p>In a news conference after their visit, Khanna and Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who sponsored the legislation to force the release of the files, expressed concern that some names had been removed from the records that have been made public.</p><p>The law allows redactions to protect the identities of victims, but says no records could be withheld “on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary”.</p><p>Massie told reporters that he has identified six individuals who are “likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files”, but whose names were redacted.</p><p>Khanna said that “there’s no explanation” why the names of those people were withheld.</p><p>The two lawmakers declined to name the six individuals, but Massie said one was “pretty high up” in a foreign government, and Khanna noted that another is a “prominent individual”.</p><p>Massie also called on the Justice Department to pursue accountability for the men, but said he could potentially name them in a House floor speech, where his actions would be constitutionally protected from lawsuits.</p><p>In a subsequent social media post, Massie shared an image of a redacted document relating to a “co-conspirator”, stating that the person was a “well known retired CEO” and that the redaction should be removed.</p><p>The Justice Department has previously said no new prosecutions are expected over the Epstein case.</p><p>Trump fought for months to prevent the release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein, but a rebellion among Republicans forced him to sign off on the law mandating that all the records be released.</p><p>The move reflected intense political pressure to address what many Americans, including Trump’s supporters, have long suspected to be a cover-up to protect rich and powerful men in Epstein’s orbit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under the proposal, federal employees seeking to challenge their termination would be required to appeal directly to OPM, which reports to the president, rather than to an independent body known as the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The MSPB acts as a mediator between federal workers and the government and has been in place since 1978. After Trump took office, the board’s caseload surged by 266 percent between October 2024 and September 2025. Federal workers who were cut in early 2025 and accepted buyouts received their final paycheques at the end of September.</p><p>If implemented, the proposal would build on Trump’s broader push to shrink the federal government and limit workers’ ability to challenge those decisions. The administration forced out roughly 317,000 federal employees last year.</p><p>The move comes amid a separate proposal announced last week that would reclassify high-level career civil servants as “at will” employees. That change would give the administration broader authority to fire career officials who do not align with the sitting president’s agenda, affecting roughly 50,000 workers at the nation’s largest employer.</p><p>Outlined in a more than 250-page document, the directive would <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/5/new-trump-administration-rule-makes-it-easier-to-fire-career-civil-servants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allow workers to be fired</a> if they were “intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.</p><p>“Congress gave OPM the authority to set how reduction-in-force appeals are handled, and this rule puts that responsibility to work,” an OPM spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement. “It replaces a slow, costly process with a single, streamlined review led by OPM experts. That means agencies can restructure without years of litigation, and employees get faster, fairer resolution if mistakes occur.”</p><p>The proposal also comes as the administration has sought to fire political appointees from previous administrations without just cause. Since last year, the White House has been attempting to remove US Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.</p><p>Cook challenged the decision in federal court, which ruled that the president did not have the authority to fire her. The White House appealed, and the case is now before the Supreme Court.</p><p>While the court <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has not yet issued a ruling</a>, a decision in the president’s favour would make it easier to remove political appointees who do not align with a given administration’s agenda.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The set even featured a live wedding ceremony during the song Titi Me Pregunto – a track about having many girlfriends and a wedding.</p><p>However, the celebration was underscored by tension; many viewed the performance as an act of defiance amidst ongoing deadly raids by <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/public-opinion-shifts-on-ice-as-advocates-warn-of-us-inflection-point\">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE</a>) targeting immigrant communities across the country.</p><p>And US President Donald Trump contributed to the political atmosphere of the event, blasting Bad Bunny’s act as “the worst performance ever” and “a slap in the face to our country”, skipping the live show and watching the game instead from an event in Florida.</p><p>“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the USA, and all over the World,” Trump railed in a Truth Social post.</p><p>His “Make America Great Agains” (MAGA) supporters followed suit, also questioning why it was in a “foreign” language and decrying it as “anti-American”. Many conservatives instead tuned in to the “All-American Halftime Show”, a live entertainment event featuring country artists presented as an alternative, and organised by the right-wing non-profit Turning Point USA, which was founded by the late Charlie Kirk.</p><p>The divisive political climate in the US is why those with Latin American heritage felt pride in Bad Bunny’s cultural performance, in which he strutted and swayed to his most famous songs, from Titi Me Pregunto to Baile Inolvidable.</p><p>“Bad Bunny symbolises hope for the Latino community in a deeply divided time, when Latinos are often reduced to harmful stereotypes,” Claudia Ruiz, a Cuban-American who lives in Modesto, California, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He represents unity in a rich, cultural, family- centred, and joyful way that restores pride.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-re-not-savages-we-re-not-aliens\">‘We’re not savages … we’re not aliens’</h2><p>Last week, the singer and rapper, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, and who is one of the most listened-to artists worldwide, made history at the Grammy Awards, with his album, Debi Tirar Mas Fotos, scooping up the Best Album award, the first Spanish-language one to ever do so.</p><p>During his acceptance speech, Bad Bunny <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/stars-target-ice-crackdown-at-grammys-ceremony\">spoke against ICE</a> and stated, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans”, a stance that was amplified by his Super Bowl performance.</p><p>Ruiz said that Bad Bunny is a reminder that she should not be made to feel apologetic for celebrating her identity, which is very much a part of the American fabric.</p><p>“As a Latina, I want to be reminded of my roots positively and feel grounded in who I am, without needing to shrink myself to make others comfortable,” she said. “Seeing our culture celebrated without apology feels powerful.”</p><blockquote><p>“Our music can [take] a stand in the most ‘US’ event in existence to say we’re more than just land you can take militarily or recreationally. We also matter; we have a voice.”</p></blockquote><p>In one climactic moment, after crooning cameos by Lady Gaga and another Puerto Rican star of a past generation, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny belted out the words “God Bless America!”</p><p>The only English phrase of the performance was followed by a roll call of the countries of North, South and Central America, from Cuba to Canada, and a parade of their flags.</p><p>For Bernardo Garcia Espinosa, who watched the Super Bowl from Mexico, the roll call was the “most powerful moment” of the whole show.</p><p>“Benito took this well-known US-ism of ‘God bless America’ and then flips it on its head by reciting the names of the countries in the Americas,” Espinosa told Al Jazeera from Mexico City.</p><p>“Since I’ve been young, there’s this sense that people from the US claim the whole continent by reserving the ‘American’ demonym exclusively for themselves, and this was Bad Bunny saying, ‘Screw that, we are all Americans because we all live in the Americas’,” said Espinosa, who used to live in Canada.</p><p>Espinosa referenced Trump’s recent actions in the region, including the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/26/the-discombobulator-did-us-use-secret-weapon-in-maduro-abduction\">abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a>. The US leader had justified his action by invoking <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/what-is-the-monroe-doctrine-which-trump-has-cited-over-venezuela\">the Monroe Doctrine</a>, a 19th-century policy that urged the division of the world into spheres of influence overseen by different powers.</p><p>“When the US is renewing its Monroe Doctrine approach, it feels very empowering that our music can [take] a stand in the most ‘US’ event in existence to say we’re more than just land you can take militarily or recreationally. We also matter; we have a voice.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300344\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300344\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300344\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6989e0fe615e-1770643710.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A message is displayed while Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performs during the Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4300344\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A message is displayed while Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performs during the Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on February 8, 2026 [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trump-s-supporters-forget-that-we-are-all-americans\">Trump’s ‘supporters forget that we are all Americans’</h2><p>For Mariana Limon Rugerio, a Mexican from the city of Monterrey, the performance was necessary considering the US’s “delicate political landscape” amidst ICE raids. But beyond overt political statements, Rugerio enjoyed the simple, everyday nods to Latino culture in Bad Bunny’s performance.</p><p>“There were so many hints to Latin American culture that we all share, like a kid sleeping in a chair while the adults are still partying,” Rugerio told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She said she could never have dreamed of a Super Bowl performance entirely in Spanish.</p><p>“I think it was well deserved for all the Latino immigrants to see this,” Rugerio said.</p><p>Bad Bunny’s show also featured roving dancers dressed as mechanics, shopkeepers, and hairdressers – jobs taken up by many Latino immigrants in the US. Those scenes moved Natalia Bustamante, a Chilean-Ecuadorean living in Montreal, Canada.</p><p>“Our immigrant brothers and sisters go through hell in order to get to the States,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that it felt good to be celebrated “for once”.</p><p>“It was so overwhelming, [by] the end, I was crying.”</p><p>Abril Boniche Porras, a Costa Rican-American from Richmond, Virginia, meanwhile, said it was disheartening to witness the alternative halftime show organised by Turning Point USA. She was also dismayed to see people post photos to social media using headphones to block out Bad Bunny’s performance during the live event.</p><p>“[All] because they didn’t want to hear someone speak in a language they could not understand,” Porras told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The show was all about love, and community, and music … [Trump] supporters forget that we are all Americans.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300346\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300346\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300346\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6989e132107d-1770643762.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Performers wave the flags of sovereign countries in the Americas at the conclusion of Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performance during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4300346\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Performers wave the flags of sovereign countries in the Americas at the conclusion of Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny’s performance during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California [AFP]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
