It has at times issued its own statistics on people killed, then changed them, while accusing Palestinians and Gaza officials of exaggerating the death toll, especially of civilians.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But on Thursday, an Israeli army official told journalists in the country that the army accepted that about 70,000 people had been killed in Gaza during the war.</p><p>The Gaza Health Ministry estimates that as of January 27 this year, at least 71,662 people have been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/gazas-unequal-dead-10000-palestinians-under-rubble-one-israeli-captive\">killed </a>since the start of the war on October 7, 2023. Of those, 488 people have been killed since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on October 10, 2025.</p><p>Thousands more are missing and believed to be buried under rubble. <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/gazas-unequal-dead-10000-palestinians-under-rubble-one-israeli-captive\">According to</a> the National Committee for Missing Persons, that figure could exceed 10,000. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has said that at least 440 people died of starvation during the war.</p><p>The senior Israeli military official did not acknowledge that a vast majority of those killed in Gaza are civilians – most are children and women – or that hundreds have <a href=\"/news/2025/8/18/israel-starving-gaza-hundreds-of-deaths-including-many-children\">starved to death</a> and that thousands more are buried under rubble in Gaza.</p><p>Still, the acceptance of the Gaza Health Ministry’s death toll marks a break from Israel’s past claims.</p><p>At the same time, it follows a pattern: during its war on Gaza, and well before, Israel has frequently denied narratives of killings its forces have perpetrated, despite evidence to the contrary, only to later grudgingly acknowledge what happened – often when the facts became impossible to deny.</p><p>So what’s behind Israel’s sudden acceptance of the Gaza death toll – and its history of denialism?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-real-number-of-dead-and-injured-in-gaza\">What do we know about the real number of dead and injured in Gaza?</h2><p>Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has been counting the number of dead bodies by recording their names and keeping a track of ID numbers.</p><p>The Health Ministry has also recorded the number of people <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/gazas-unequal-dead-10000-palestinians-under-rubble-one-israeli-captive\">injured</a> and the number of people who have starved to death as a result of Israel cutting off vital aid supplies to Gaza during the war.</p><p>As of January 27, the ministry said that at least 171,428 people were injured in the war and 1,350 more have been injured since the ceasefire.</p><p>The United Nations and human rights groups have also backed the Health Ministry’s figures.</p><p>Human rights organisations have also accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting civilians.</p><p>In particular, between May and July 2025, more than 1,000 Palestinian people were <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/inside-israels-role-in-the-killings-at-gazas-food-aid-sites\">killed</a> by the Israeli military at United States-led food distribution sites, according to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor and a retired US special forces officer, Anthony Aguilar.</p><p>Aguilar was formerly employed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a nonprofit backed by the US and Israel to provide those distribution sites, after Israel accused the United Nations Palestinian refugee authority, UNRWA, of aiding Hamas.</p><p>“Without question, I witnessed war crimes by the [Israeli military],” Aguilar told the BBC in an exclusive interview in 2025.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4269256\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Death-toll-tracker-1769525572.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-jan 27, 2026_Death toll tracker-1765554400\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-has-israel-responded-to-these-figures\">How has Israel responded to these figures?</h2><p>During its war on Gaza, Israel mostly rejected these figures and claimed they were misleading or manipulated.</p><p>Israeli army officials have also denied the claims that civilians were targeted at food distribution sites in 2025, instead claiming that “chaos” at the sites posed an “immediate threat” to its soldiers, forcing them to fire shots.</p><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also repeatedly denied allegations that Israeli forces deliberately targeted civilians in Gaza, and argued that such claims amount to “blood libel” against Israel, and referred to a false and anti-Semitic accusation that Jewish people murder Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals.</p><p>In September 2024, Netanyahu <a href=\"/news/2025/8/24/did-israel-know-over-80-percent-of-those-it-killed-in-gaza-were-civilians\">bragged</a> that Israel had the “lowest ratio of civilian to combatant deaths in the history of modern urban warfare”, claiming the army was killing only one civilian for every fighter it killed. But a leaked military report in August 2025 concluded that more than 80 percent of those Israel had killed in Gaza were civilians.</p><p>An April 2024 <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/\">investigation</a> carried out by the independent magazine +972, which reports on news from Israel and Palestine, revealed that an Israeli army artificial intelligence targeting system codenamed Lavender had marked tens of thousands of people in Gaza as potential fighters and eligible to be killed, according to Israeli intelligence sources.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-israel-say-about-the-death-toll-during-the-gaza-war\">What did Israel say about the death toll during the Gaza war?</h2><p>Throughout the war, Israel’s military released its own death toll figures, refuting the Gaza Health Ministry’s figures. But it kept changing its figures.</p><p>On October 7, Israeli authorities initially said Hamas-led fighters killed 1,400 people in their attack on southern Israel, apart from taking more than 200 people captive. However, later, Israel reduced its death toll to fewer than 1,150. Meanwhile, reports in Israeli publications like Haaretz suggested that at least some of those killed in Israel that day might have been shot dead by the Israeli military themselves, as part of a controversial policy known as the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/7/israeli-army-used-hannibal-directive-during-october-7-hamas-attack-report\">Hannibal Directive</a>, aimed at preventing the enemy from taking captives.</p><p>In November 2023, a senior Israeli security official suggested that Israel had killed 20,000 people in Gaza, most of them fighters. The following month, that number had fallen to 7,860 fighters. In August 2024, Israel said it had killed 17,000 fighters but changed that to 14,000 two months later.</p><p>Separately, Israel’s allies in the West – as well as Western media – have systematically cast doubt on the death toll compiled by Gaza’s Health Ministry during the war.</p><p>In October 2023, some two weeks into the war, after the Health Ministry in Gaza had released a list documenting the deaths of more than 7,000 Palestinians, including nearly 3,000 children, then-US President Joe Biden <a href=\"/news/2023/10/26/appalling-why-has-biden-cast-doubt-on-the-palestinian-death-count\">said</a> that he had “no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using”.</p><p>“I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,” Biden had said.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-israel-acknowledging-the-death-toll-now\">Why is Israel acknowledging the death toll now?</h2><p>Thursday’s announcement from Israel acknowledging the 70,000 death toll in Gaza follows more than two years of repeatedly trying to deny or undermine the number of deaths in the enclave.</p><p>Sultan Barakat, senior professor in public policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha, told Al Jazeera that it was important to understand why Israel might be now acknowledging the scale of deaths in Gaza.</p><p>“As always, the devil is in the details,” he said. “Internationally, increased access to the field by the UN and other humanitarian agencies – including those from some Israeli allied states [the US, United Kingdom, France, and others] – along with the beginning of rubble removal [in Gaza], made continued outright rejection untenable [for Israel],” he said.</p><p id=\"at-this-stage-partial-acceptance-can-help-preserve-institutional-credibility-and-signal-seriousness-to-key-partners-particularly-the-us-and-european-governments-he-added\">“At this stage, partial acceptance can help preserve institutional credibility and signal seriousness to key partners, particularly the US and European governments,” he added.</p><p>Barakat noted that there might also be a strategic recalibration under way.</p><p>“Accepting the figures allows Israel to reposition its argument in the international arena, especially as recent developments around the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trumps-board-of-peace-an-effort-to-curtail-middle-powers-says-expert\">Board of Peace”</a> have shifted global attention away from the question of whether genocide and mass death occurred and toward reconstruction – reframing the debate around responsibility and the circumstances of those deaths,” he said.</p><p>He added that this includes placing an emphasis on Hamas’s conduct, the conditions of urban warfare, or the use of civilian infrastructure.</p><p>“Lastly, this acceptance may serve a defensive legal purpose. Acknowledging the scale of harm does not necessarily imply acceptance of wrongdoing, but it can form part of constructing a more coherent record in anticipation of future investigations, inquiries or legal proceedings,” he added.</p><p>This shift – from outright denial to changing numbers to acceptance of some facts – is part of a pattern.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-record-of-denialism\">Israel’s record of denialism</h2><p>Besides denying the death toll during its war on Gaza in the past, Israel has also denied accusations by the media and human rights groups that it has killed children and journalists in both Gaza and the <a href=\"/tag/occupied-west-bank/\">occupied West Bank</a>.</p><h3>Hind Rajab, five-year-old child</h3><p>On January 29, 2024, after five-year-old Hind Rajab was killed when an Israeli tank targeted her family’s car in Gaza, Israel denied its soldiers were in the area. After the rest of her family had been killed, Hind pleaded with rescue workers on the phone for three hours for help, before she, too, was shot dead. During her phone call, she described a “tank” drawing up next to the car.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When rescuers found the remains of Hind and her family on February 10, the car was riddled with bullet holes likely coming from more than one direction. It was later determined that more than 300 bullets had been fired into the car.</p><p>But a statement from the Israeli army read, “It appears that … troops were not present near the vehicle or within firing range of the described vehicle in which the girl was found,” according to a Times of Israel report.</p><p>In February 2024, Sanad, Al Jazeera’s investigations unit, however, <a href=\"/news/2024/2/26/hind-rajab-were-israeli-troops-in-the-area-where-6-year-old-was-killed\">analysed</a> phone records and satellite imagery to determine whether Israeli troops had, in fact, been near the car.</p><p>The vehicle, the investigation found, had been stopped by the Israeli military near a petrol station in Tal al-Hawa in the early afternoon on January 29.</p><p>Other investigative media outlets also questioned Israel’s claims regarding Hind’s death, and the US, Israel’s number-one ally, called for probes into the killing of Hind, her family, and the medics who were sent to try and save them.</p><p>The Israeli army has since told the BBC that Hind’s case is still being reviewed by Israel’s Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFAM) — in effect, pulling back from its initial full-throated rejection of the possibility of an Israeli tank having fired at the car.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2718192\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2718192\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2718192\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-02-10T153232Z_492768313_RC2RZ5AJXM4Q_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-CHILD-1708349566.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian girl Hind Rajab poses for a photograph, in this undated handout picture\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2718192\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, 5, poses for a photograph [File: Palestine Red Crescent Society/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h3>Shireen Abu Akleh, Al Jazeera journalist</h3><p>Israel issued similar denials when Al Jazeera’s journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a US and Palestinian citizen, was <a href=\"/news/2022/9/6/israels-shifting-narratives-on-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh\">killed</a> while reporting from Jenin in the occupied West Bank on May 11, 2022. Shireen had been wearing her “press” jacket. Autopsy results later showed she was shot at medium range in the head by a sniper, just below the rim of her helmet.</p><p>Witnesses, including Al Jazeera journalists, said Israeli forces had carried out the shooting, a claim that was later backed up by numerous investigations by media outlets, human rights organisations, and the United Nations.</p><p>But Israel sought to evade responsibility, initially claiming that she had been caught in crossfire from Palestinian fighters. However, video footage from the incident shows the street Abu Akleh was standing on was mostly quiet, and no such fighters were in her near vicinity.</p><p>In September that year, following a military investigation, Israel changed its stance, acknowledging that it was “highly possible” that one of its soldiers had fired the bullet that killed Abu Akleh. However, the military ruled out any further investigation, saying they found no evidence of a criminal offence.</p><p>In June 2022, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also said Shireen was killed by Israel, but Israel called the UN report biased.</p><p>On May 11, 2023, however, an Israeli army spokesperson was asked by CNN whether the military was “ready” to apologise for her murder.</p><p>“I think it’s an opportunity for me to say here that we are very sorry of the death of the late Shireen Abu Akleh,” the spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, responded.</p><p>Shireen’s family say they are still seeking accountability.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2196013\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2196013\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2196013\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/youtube-1683744655.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"shireen-memorial\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2196013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A portrait of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is framed with flowers with a cross in the foreground during a memorial mass held at a church in Beit Hanina in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h3>Ambulance workers in Gaza</h3><p>On March 30, 2025, the bodies of five Palestinian Civil Defence responders, a UN employee and eight Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) workers were discovered in a shallow grave in Gaza. A ninth PRCS ambulance driver, Assaad al-Nassasra, was being held by Israel, the PRCS confirmed later. In total, <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/4/9/know-their-names-the-gaza-red-crescent-paramedics-israel-attacked\">15 emergency workers</a> had been killed – with one body found a few days earlier.</p><p>It was later determined that at about 4am (01:00 GMT) on March 23, a Palestinian ambulance had been dispatched to join an earlier one helping people injured in an Israeli air strike in Rafah’s al-Hashaashin area.</p><p>Contact with the ambulance was lost and, at 5am, the first ambulance went back out to find it. Paramedics radioed back that they could see casualties on the ground on the way to Tal as-Sultan, another area in southern Gaza.</p><p>Two more ambulances were dispatched along with a fire truck and other emergency vehicles. They came under Israeli gunfire for more than five minutes. Minutes later, soldiers also fired at a United Nations car that had stopped at the scene. The PRCS lost contact with its team.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/unprecedented-video-shows-last-moments-of-gaza-medics-killed-by-israel\">video later found on the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan</a> showed the team’s final moments. Filmed from inside one of the last two ambulances to head out, it shows a fire truck and ambulances driving ahead through the night.</p><p>All vehicles were clearly identified with emergency lights flashing.</p><p>The vehicles stopped when they reached an ambulance and bodies by the roadside, and first responders in reflective uniforms exited the vehicles. Moments later, intense gunfire erupted.</p><p>However, Israel initially claimed its soldiers opened fire because the convoy approached “suspiciously” in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said the movement of the vehicles had not been previously coordinated or agreed with the army. The video footage clearly shows the ambulances with their lights on.</p><p>The day after the attack on the ambulance, Israeli forces blocked all entry to the site where it occurred. But a few days later, UN and Palestinian officials gained limited access to the area, and managed to recover buried vehicles and the body of a Gaza civil defence member.</p><p>Then, they discovered a shallow grave with 14 bodies of emergency workers. It later transpired that Israeli troops had bulldozed over the bodies and their vehicles.</p><p>In April, the Israeli military appeared to climb down from its claims, and described the killings – as well as the burial of victims and their vehicles – as a “professional error” and a “misunderstanding”.</p><p>An investigative report from Israel found that the soldiers failed to recognise the ambulances due to “poor night visibility” and because flashing lights are less visible on night-vision drones and goggles.</p><p>It also blamed a now-dismissed deputy commander, saying he mistakenly thought an ambulance was being used by Hamas and opened fire first.</p><p>It denied that burying vehicles and bodies was an attempt to conceal the attack.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-denying-such-incidents\">What is the point of denying such incidents?</h2><p>Barakat told Al Jazeera this pattern of denial in the first instance by Israel is not unique, as information warfare is a “real consideration” in every conflict.</p><p>“The United States employed similar practices in both Afghanistan and Iraq,” he said “However, based on Israel’s wars in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere, this behaviour appears to follow a recurring pattern of obfuscation and deceive, aimed at creating confusion while restricting opportunities for independent verification, particularly by international media.”</p><p>He noted that Israel, like the US and other militaries conducting offensive operations, also tends to be extremely cautious in the early stages of reporting during active conflict.</p><p>“Initial denials or non-acceptance are often framed as the result of a need for internal intelligence verification, particularly when figures originate from adversarial authorities such as the Gaza Health Ministry,” he said.</p><p>He added that there are also legal and diplomatic dimensions to Israel’s behaviour.</p><p>“Early acceptance of responsibility or casualty figures [in Israel’s war on Gaza] could have had consequences for cases brought against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC),” he said.</p><p>“Delaying acknowledgement allowed Israel time to assess its legal exposure and coordinate messaging with allies.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The province has had an independence movement for decades.</p><p data-start=\"662\" data-end=\"832\">Trump has repeatedly threatened to make <a href=\"/opinions/2025/2/26/canada-already-is-americas-51st-state\">Canada the “51st state”</a> of the American Union.</p><p>Here is what we know:</p><p data-start=\"1626\" data-end=\"1841\">Leaders of the APP have reportedly met with US State Department officials in Washington at least three times since last April. Trump entered office for a second time in January.</p><p data-start=\"1846\" data-end=\"1952\">These meetings have prompted concern in Ottawa regarding potential US interference in Canadian domestic politics.</p><p data-start=\"1846\" data-end=\"1952\">This follows comments by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week, who described Alberta as “a natural partner for the US” and praised the province’s resource wealth and “independent” character during an interview with the right-wing broadcaster Real America’s Voice.</p><p>“Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they [the Canadian government] won’t let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,” he said. “I think we should let them come down into the US,” Bessent said during an interview with the right-wing broadcaster.</p><p>“There’s a rumour they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not.”</p><p>Asked if he knew something about the separation effort, Bessent said, “People are talking. People want sovereignty. They want what the US has got.”</p><p></p><p data-start=\"139\" data-end=\"390\">After Bessent’s comments, Jeffrey Rath, a leader of the APP, said that the group was seeking another meeting with US officials next month, where they are expected to ask about a possible $500bn credit line to support Alberta if a future independence referendum – which has not yet been called – were to be held.</p><p></p><p> </p><p data-start=\"395\" data-end=\"616\">The developments come at a sensitive moment in US-Canada relations, with trade tensions still simmering and after a recent speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos where Carney warned that Washington was contributing to a “rupture” in the global order.</p><p data-start=\"395\" data-end=\"616\">Trump has repeatedly threatened to make Canada part of the American Union. His expansionist ambitions have been further underscored by his recent push to acquire<a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any\"> Greenland</a> from Denmark, which, like Canada, is a NATO ally. At the start of the year, the US military also abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and has since attempted to take control of the South American nation’s massive oil industry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-have-canadian-leaders-reacted-to-the-reports\">How have Canadian leaders reacted to the reports?</h2><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Speaking on Thursday, British Columbia Premier David Eby described the reported behind-the-scenes meetings as “treason”.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">“To go to a foreign country and to ask for assistance in breaking up Canada, there’s an old-fashioned word for that – and that word is treason,” Eby told reporters.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">“It is completely inappropriate to seek to weaken Canada, to go and ask for assistance, to break up this country from a foreign power and – with respect – a president who has not been particularly respectful of Canada’s sovereignty.”</p><p></p><p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford appealed for Canadian unity on Thursday morning.</p><p>“You know, we have a referendum going on out in Alberta. The separatists in Quebec say they’re gonna call a referendum if they get elected. Like, folks, we need to stick together. It’s Team Canada. It’s nothing else,” he said.</p><p>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, however, said she won’t demonise the Albertans who are open to separation because of “legitimate grievances” with Ottawa and said she did not want to “demonise or marginalise a million of my fellow citizens”.</p><p>Smith has long been pro-Trump and visited the US president’s Mar-a-Lago estate in January 2025, at a time when most other Canadian leaders were joining hands to criticise his demand that the country become a part of the United States.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275440\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275440\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275440\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2022-11-18T214455Z_702951184_RC2IOX94IYRT_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-POLITICS-ALBERTA-1769757713.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C544&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith speaks at the Calgary Chamber \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alberta Premier Danielle Smith [FILE: Todd Korol/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-a-potential-referendum-in-alberta\">What do we know about a potential referendum in Alberta?</h2><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkzvfawd000f3b6plytf1f3b@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">Anger towards Ottawa has been building in Alberta for decades, rooted largely in disputes over how the federal government manages the province’s vast oil and gas resources.</p><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkzvfawd000f3b6plytf1f3b@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">Many Albertans feel federal policies – particularly environmental regulations, carbon pricing and pipeline approvals – limit Alberta’s ability to develop and export its energy.</p><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkzvfawd000f3b6plytf1f3b@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">As a landlocked province, Alberta depends on pipelines and cooperation with other provinces to access global markets, making those federal decisions especially contentious.</p><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkzvfawd000f3b6plytf1f3b@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">Many Albertans believe the province generates significant wealth while having limited influence over national decision-making.

That was how they [the bandits] missed us,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But I heard every shout, every cry and footstep as they picked up people from our house and surrounding houses,” she added, between sobs.</p><p>With tears streaming down her face, Idris recounted how she kept calling out the names of her missing family members – men, women and children.</p><p>Her house sits on the edge of the village, close to a bandits’ crossing point.</p><p>“I don’t know what they are doing to them now. I don’t know if they’ve eaten or not,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A total of 177 people were abducted that day. Eleven escaped their captors, but about a quarter of Kurmin Wali’s population remains captive.</p><p>Initially, state officials denied the attack had taken place.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath, Kaduna’s police commissioner called reports a “falsehood peddled by conflict entrepreneurs”.</p><p>Finally, two days later, Nigeria’s national police spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, admitted an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/nigerian-police-confirm-gunmen-abducted-villagers-after-initial-denials\">“abduction”</a> had indeed occurred on Sunday. He said police had launched security operations with the aim of “locating and safely rescuing the victims and restoring calm to the area”.</p><p>Uba Sani, Kaduna state’s governor, added that more than just rescuing the abductees, the government was committed to ensuring “that we establish permanent protection for them”.</p><p>There has been a police presence in Kurmin Wali since then.

We trekked a long distance before taking a break,” he said of his journey with his captors.</p><p>Shekarau, a father of five, was holding his three-year-old daughter when he and others were taken.</p><p>“When we reached an abandoned village, I ducked inside a room with my little daughter when the attackers weren’t looking. I closed the door and waited. After what seemed like eternity, and sure they were gone, I opened the door and walked back home, avoiding the bush path,” he said, now back in the village.</p><p>But on returning home, his heart sank. He and his three-year-old were the only ones who made it home. The rest of the family is still held by the kidnappers.</p><p>Standing in a parched field of long dried grass, Shekarau says the village no longer feels like home.</p><p>The village chief was also taken, but managed to escape. He now presides over a community hopeful for the return of the missing – but too scared to stay.</p><p>“Everyone is on edge. People are confused and don’t know what to do. Some haven’t eaten. There are entire families that are missing,” said Ishaku Danazumi, the village chief.</p><p>Danazumi says the kidnappers regularly visit and loot the village grain stores and the villagers’ possessions, including mobile phones.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Two days after the attack, residents said the bandits rode through their village again.</p><p>On that day, the community also received a ransom demand.</p><p>“They accused us of taking 10 motorcycles they hid in the bush to evade soldiers who operated here the week before,” Danazumi said. “But we didn’t see those bikes.”</p><p>The chief said the captors told him the return of the 10 bikes was a precondition for the return of his people.</p><p>But deep inside, he knows, more demands will follow.</p><p>In the village, residents wait in their thatch and mud-brick houses, hoping for their loved ones to return.</p><p>But because of fear and the tense situation, many are leaving the farming community.</p><p>“Anyone thinking about remaining in this village needs to reconsider,” said Panchan Madami, a resident who also survived the attack.</p><p>“Only the recklessly bold can stay with the current state of security here.”</p><p>Villagers said that before the January 18 attack, 21 people kidnapped by the bandits were returned to them after a ransom was paid. But just two days later, a quarter of the village was taken.</p><p>“It will be stupid to stay here, hoping things will be OK,” added Madami.</p><p>The government says it will establish a military post to protect the community from further attacks. But that is not comforting enough for Idris, who has also made up her mind to leave.</p><p>“I’m not coming back here,” she said, gathering her belongings to leave the village where she grew up and married. “I just hope the rest of my family gets back.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274561\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274561\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274561\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_697b8cbe-1769704638.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A drone view of Kurmin Wali, where churches were attacked by gunmen and worshippers were kidnapped, in Kurmin Wali, Kaduna, Nigeria, January 20, 2026.

He was articulating a view that has become increasingly central to British immigration politics. The UK’s first ethnic minority home secretary said he opposed admitting unskilled workers and those who do not speak English. By his own criteria, neither his father, who arrived as an unskilled worker, nor his mother, who did not speak English, would have been permitted to settle in the country. Promoting his memoir, The Colour of Time, Javid was unambiguous: immigration must fall, English-language requirements should be tougher, and entry should be limited to skilled workers.</p><p data-start=\"1183\" data-end=\"1429\">Far from being exceptional, Javid’s position points to a broader and increasingly visible pattern in British politics. Some of the most prominent anti-immigration positions of recent years have been articulated by ethnic minority politicians.</p><p data-start=\"1431\" data-end=\"1888\">This pattern is most visible at the Home Office, the government department responsible for borders, asylum, detention and deportation. Since 2018, the role of home secretary has repeatedly been held by ethnic minority politicians, including Javid himself, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and James Cleverly under Conservative governments, followed by Shabana Mahmood under Labour. Each, in turn, has advanced a tougher approach to immigration control.</p><p data-start=\"1890\" data-end=\"2397\">Under Priti Patel, a points-based immigration system was introduced and the controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was developed. Braverman went further still, declaring that seeing deportation flights take off would be her “dream” and her “obsession”. Yet despite the increasingly punitive tone, overall immigration numbers rose during this period. Rhetoric and outcomes diverged. Even so, the political signal from the Home Office was unmistakable: firmness on borders above all else.</p><p data-start=\"2399\" data-end=\"2867\">The explanation for this phenomenon lies not simply in personal biography or individual conviction. Drawing on my research on ethnic minority representation in Britain, I argue that these appointments reflect a clear political logic. When political parties harden their stance on immigration, they often rely on minority politicians to act as reputational shields, figures who can front restrictive policies while insulating parties from accusations of racism.</p><p data-start=\"2869\" data-end=\"3337\">Reputational shields matter because immigration control in the UK has long been racialised. From post-war restrictions on Commonwealth migration to the “hostile environment” policies associated with former Prime Minister Theresa May, border control has frequently intersected with race and belonging. When such policies are championed by ethnic minority politicians, criticism can more readily be reframed as ideological disagreement rather than racial exclusion.</p><p data-start=\"3339\" data-end=\"3854\">Nowhere is this dynamic clearer than at the Home Office. The department effectively demands a hard line on immigration from its secretary, and appointing minority politicians to the role has repeatedly proven politically expedient. This does not mean white politicians are more liberal, as Theresa May’s record makes clear, but it does help explain why parties have been willing to place minority figures at the forefront of border enforcement. Four consecutive Conservative home secretaries were non-white.</p><p data-start=\"3856\" data-end=\"4263\">This logic now extends beyond the Conservative Party. Labour’s appointment of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-is-shabana-mahmood-the-home-secretary-is-the-face-of-labours-most-hardline-immigration-policies-to-date-269977\">Shabana Mahmood</a> as home secretary marks a notable shift for a party that has historically sought to signal greater nuance on immigration. Since taking office, Mahmood has announced and is implementing sweeping asylum reforms, which she has described as “the most substantial reform to the UK’s asylum system in a generation”.</p><p data-start=\"4265\" data-end=\"4869\">That Keir Starmer has placed a minority politician at the forefront of Labour’s tougher turn on immigration suggests an implicit recognition of this reputational logic. Mahmood’s identity does not determine her policy positions, but it does shape how those positions are received, particularly in a media and political environment where immigration debates are routinely filtered through accusations of racism. In this sense, Labour appears to have absorbed a lesson from Conservative governments about how ethnic minority representation can function as political cover when tightening border policy.</p><p data-start=\"4871\" data-end=\"5598\">Immigration is now cited by about four in 10 Britons as the most important issue facing the country. For Labour, long uneasy talking about borders and enforcement, Mahmood’s stance represents a recalibration. Her measures include tightening the route from asylum to permanent settlement, reforming human rights legislation to facilitate removals, and suspending visas for countries that refuse to accept returned nationals. She has been unapologetic, arguing that the pace and scale of immigration has destabilised communities and fuelled perceptions of unfairness. While Labour backbenchers and the Green Party have accused her of scapegoating migrants, figures on the political right have welcomed her approach.</p><p data-start=\"5600\" data-end=\"6069\">It would, however, be a mistake to portray minority politicians as mere symbols or cynical mouthpieces. Many articulate their positions through narratives of fairness, legality and contribution. Javid has spoken of his family’s experiences of racism while emphasising that they entered the UK legally and worked hard. Mahmood has similarly argued that constituents who “did things the right way” feel aggrieved by irregular arrivals crossing the Channel in small boats.</p><p data-start=\"6071\" data-end=\"6430\">These arguments reflect a broader shift in how immigration is discussed: less overtly in racial terms and more through the language of fairness, order and control. Yet this reframing does not escape the UK’s longer history of racialised immigration policy. Instead, ethnic minority politicians increasingly play a visible legitimising role within it.</p><p data-start=\"6432\" data-end=\"7086\">The prominence of politicians of colour at the forefront of the UK’s immigration crackdown is therefore not a paradox. It is a window into how representation is operationalised in practice. When Sajid Javid says his parents would not be admitted today, he is not disavowing his background but signalling his political credibility. The deeper question is what happens when such credibility is no longer enough to contain the moral and social consequences of a system built on exclusion. Race, borders and political legitimacy, and enduring questions about belonging and citizenship, remain tightly bound together in contemporary British politics.</p><p data-start=\"6432\" data-end=\"7086\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

These are allegations UNRWA has vehemently denied, stressing that it takes disciplinary action against any employee proven to be involved in wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2025, the Israeli Knesset passed legislation effectively banning the agency’s operations in areas it considers part of “Israeli sovereignty”, including occupied East Jerusalem, claiming the agency poses a security threat.</p><p>The agency rejected the law as illegal and said it places it in direct confrontation with Israeli authorities.</p><p>As of this month, the UN agency has recorded deaths in Israeli attacks of more than 380 of its staff members in Gaza since October 2023.</p><p>Earlier this month, Israel sent in bulldozers, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/israel-bulldozes-unrwa-buildings-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">partially destroying UNRWA’s headquarters</a> in East Jerusalem. Israeli lawmakers and members of the far-right government were also present, according to Lazzarini, who said the attack came “in the wake of other steps taken by Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”.</p><p>As a UN agency, it enjoys international legal status. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in January that he could take Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if it does not repeal <a href=\"/features/2024/1/31/israels-allegations-unrwa-effort-eliminate-agency\">laws targeting UNRWA</a> and return its seized assets and property.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"by-what-law-does-this-happen\">‘By what law does this happen?’</h2><p>Maryam herself sustained minor injuries in the Israeli attack, while five of her children also suffered injuries. Her husband was critically wounded in the neck.</p><p>In April 2024, she left Gaza as a medical companion to her spouse, who was referred for treatment at an Egyptian hospital. She was forced to leave behind the rest of her children in Gaza, including those who were wounded.</p><p>“It feels like leaving for treatment and escaping death has become a crime we are being punished for,” Maryam told Al Jazeera by phone, her voice breaking with tears.</p><p>“Wasn’t it enough that I spent all this time grieving for my injured children, being away from them and constantly worried about them while accompanying my husband in treatment? They added to our wounds by dismissing us from our jobs. By what law does this happen?”</p><p>For Maryam and many others who were displaced outside Gaza during the war, the blow was especially severe, as it followed a February 2025 decision to place them on “exceptional leave” despite the fact that many of them continued teaching remotely.</p><p>“All my children are injured and have metal plates in their limbs. They suffered immensely after my salary stopped,” said the mother of eight.</p><p>In the past two weeks, the crisis has extended to employees who remain in the Strip, after the agency decided to cut their salaries by 20 percent, a move that has further deepened their humanitarian suffering amid Gaza’s catastrophic conditions.</p><p>The financial shortfall comes amid a decline in international donations, which had long formed the backbone of UNRWA’s budget, particularly after several donor states froze their contributions following Israeli allegations against some of its employees.</p><p>UNRWA provides essential services to millions of Palestinian refugees, who make up about 70 percent of the Gaza population, including education, healthcare, and social assistance, playing a central role in maintaining a minimum level of stability amid repeated Israeli wars and restrictions on crossings.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4266846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4266846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4266846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/873A5243-copy-1769426398.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dr Mustafa Al-Ghoul, a dentist with UNRWA for 29 years, who heads the UNRWA staff union\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4266846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr Mustafa al-Ghoul, a dentist with UNRWA for 29 years, who heads the agency’s staff union, is currently leading protests against its recent decisions [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-gaza-first\">Why Gaza first?</h2><p>There has been widespread anger and protests among UNRWA staff in Gaza, both inside and outside the Strip, who argue that the measures disproportionately target Gaza compared with the agency’s other five areas of operation: the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.</p><p>Mustafa al-Ghoul, head of the UNRWA staff union in Gaza and a dentist who has worked with the agency for 29 years, questioned why Gaza — the most devastated and afflicted area — was chosen as the first sacrifice.</p><p>“All the measures started in Gaza, as if Gaza is not already overwhelmed by death, destruction, and hunger,” he told Al Jazeera, standing in front of their partially destroyed headquarters in Gaza City.</p><p>Of some of the 600 dismissed Palestinian employees who were outside Gaza, the cutting off of their salaries and savings without prior notice, al-Ghoul said, “Some are sick. Some have cancer. Some were on official leave. Some lost their entire families. Some left to treat a grandchild, and then they are punished with dismissal and deprivation of their rights.”</p><p>“Gaza needs someone to heal its wounds. Gaza is dying.

It provided everything,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>That reality, however, has changed dramatically since the war began.</p><p>“Now, there is nothing,” Jihan said, referring to the food aid that UNRWA has not been able to distribute for months.</p><p>Since October 2023, all humanitarian agencies, particularly the UN egency, have faced persistent obstacles in delivering aid to Gaza.</p><p>On multiple occasions, Lazzarini accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a political tool.

It was established by a UN General Assembly resolution and has operated for decades,” he said.</p><p>Al-Shawa said the agency is facing “continuous Israeli incitement” alongside Israeli bans on its operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly Gaza, and the obstruction of humanitarian aid.</p><p>He warned that weakening UNRWA serves Israel’s agenda to erase the Palestinians’ right of return and compensation. That has been a key goal of the successive Israeli governments.</p><p>Linking the agency’s cuts to a broader campaign against humanitarian work in Gaza, al-Shawa noted Israel has faced <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/israel-faces-widespread-condemnation-as-ngo-ban-comes-into-effect\">global condemnation</a> after a ban on dozens of international aid organisations working to provide life-saving assistance to Palestinians in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip came into effect.</p><p>“There is a war being waged against humanitarian work, including UNRWA, and we are paying the price for our commitment to international humanitarian law, a law the Israeli occupation refuses to uphold.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He might still vote, but faces a dilemma over whom to support since the Awami League’s boat symbol will not appear on the ballot.</p><p>The boatman, about 50 years of age, said that his family fears that if they don’t vote, they might be identified as Awami League supporters in a country where Hasina and her party today draw widespread anger for the decades of killings, forced disappearances, torture and political crackdowns that they oversaw.</p><p>Under Hasina’s rule, the Jamaat-e-Islami party and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the Awami League’s two biggest opponents – were systematically persecuted. The Jamaat was banned, some of its leaders were executed, and many others were imprisoned. Thousands of BNP leaders were arrested, including former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December. Her son and current BNP leader Tarique Rahman lived in exile in London for 17 years before returning to Bangladesh in December.</p><p>Widespread political violence continues to trouble Bangladesh’s preparations for the elections, with leaders from the BNP, Jamaat and other parties<a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/fear-and-hope-in-bangladesh-how-political-violence-is-haunting-elections\"> killed in recent weeks.</a> But now, like their counterparts from other parties, common supporters of the Awami League no longer enjoy immunity either from the anger the actions of their leaders have triggered.</p><p>“If we don’t vote, we risk being singled out,” Mridha told Al Jazeera. “So our family will go to the polling centre.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Conversations with longtime Awami League voters in areas where the party once dominated reveal a divided mood.</p><p>While many say they will still go to polling centres, others say they may not vote at all.</p><p>Like Solaiman Mia, a rickshaw puller in Gopalganj, the Hasina family’s bastion and the hometown of her father and Bangladesh’s founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose grave lies in the district south of Dhaka as an enduring symbol of the Awami League’s powerful grip on the region. Hasina won huge victories in Gopalganj in every election since 1991.</p><p>Mia is unequivocal that he and his family would not vote this year. “An election without the boat on the ballot is not an election,” he told Al Jazeera, a sentiment shared by many residents of Gopalganj.</p><h2 id=\"awami-league-will-return\">‘Awami League will return’</h2><p>In central Dhaka’s Gulistan area lies the Awami League’s head office – now abandoned after it was vandalised and set on fire during the uprising. Since then, the building has been used as a shelter by homeless people and sections of it as a public toilet.</p><p>Outside the office, street vendor Abdul Hamid says he has not seen Awami League activists anywhere near the area for months.</p><p>“You won’t find any Awami League supporters here,” he said. “Even if someone is a supporter, they would never admit it. The Awami League has faced crises before, but it has never almost disappeared like this.”</p><p>Nearby, another street vendor, Sagor, is selling woollen scarves draped in the symbols of the BNP and its former ally and now rival, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Jamaat-e-Islami party</a>.</p><p>“The scarves belonging to the parties are selling well,” he said as pedestrians surrounded him.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vendors-selling-BNP-and-Jamaat-party-symbol-designed-woolen-scarf-nearby-the-awami-league-central-party-office-in-dhaka-1769597450.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vendor selling scarves with BNP and Jamaat party symbols in Dhaka [Masum Billah/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Still, some Awami League supporters are optimistic about the party’s resurgence.</p><p>Arman, a former leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, said the party may be maintaining a strategic silence, but is far too entrenched to disappear from Bangladesh’s politics.</p><p>“The Awami League will return,” he told Al Jazeera. “And when it does, it will return with Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>But Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst and editor of Joban magazine, is not so sure. He thinks surviving the February election will be difficult for the Awami League.</p><p>“If an election takes place without the Awami League, its voters will gradually go through a form of reconciliation at the local level,” Rony told Al Jazeera. “They will be absorbed locally – aligning themselves with whichever influential forces or parties dominate their areas – and begin rebuilding their everyday lives that way.”</p><p>As a result, Rony said, it will be difficult for the Awami League to recover its support base once the election is over. He said while a section of the party’s supporters still sees no future for the party without Hasina, a sizeable group within it is frustrated by her authoritarian rule when she was in power.</p><p>“With supporters divided, with or without Hasina, returning to its previous political position is extremely difficult – almost impossible – for the Awami League,” Rony said.</p><h2 id=\"feels-like-a-political-wipeout\">‘Feels like a political wipeout’</h2><p>Other analysts argue that a recent surge in support for Jamaat-e-Islami could, paradoxically, offer a reference point for a possible future revival of the Awami League. The Jamaat supported Pakistan during Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971, a role that its critics – including Hasina – have repeatedly used to challenge its credibility.</p><p>The party was banned twice, and its top leaders were hanged and jailed during Hasina’s rule. Still, it survived, and is now – according to polls – on the cusp of its best ever performance in the February elections.</p><p>“Jamaat’s current level of activism, influence and assertiveness – what might even be described as a show of dominance – can paradoxically be seen as a kind of blessing for the Awami League,” Anu Muhammad, a retired economics professor at Jahangirnagar University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Muhammad said the appeal of the Awami League extends far beyond its formal political structure, making its total political erasure unlikely. “The Awami League is not just its leadership,” he said. “It is connected to cultural, social and other forces.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271085\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271085\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vandalised-awami-league-office-in-rajbari-copy-1769597383.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vandalised and deserted Awami League office in Rajbari, Bangladesh [Golam Mohiuddin Shohan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>A pre-election survey by the International Republican Institute, a United States think tank focused on democratic governance, suggested the Awami League still retains a support base of about 11 percent.</p><p>Yet, the party does not feature in the ongoing <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/tiktok-facebook-youtube-bangladeshs-latest-election-battlegrounds\">election campaign</a>, and its leaders have instead been seen organising events from India, including a controversial <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/bangladesh-slams-india-over-fugitive-ex-pm-hasinas-first-public-address\">address by Hasina</a> – her first since ouster – at a “Save democracy in Bangladesh” event at New Delhi’s Foreign Correspondents Club.</p><p>“To overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime of this national enemy at any cost, the brave sons and daughters of Bangladesh must defend and restore the Constitution written in the blood of martyrs, reclaim our independence, safeguard our sovereignty, and revive our democracy,” Hasina said in a prerecorded audio message.</p><p>A furious Dhaka said it was “surprised and shocked” that Indian authorities allowed such an event to take place.</p><p>Back home, however, Hasina’s party is struggling to assert political relevance, raising questions about its survival.</p><p>Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, argued that, by strict democratic standards, an election in Bangladesh without the Awami League cannot be considered fully credible, calling the vote “an election with an asterisk”.</p><p>At the same time, he argued, the Awami League had – in the eyes of many Bangladeshis – forfeited its rights to be treated as a legitimate party because of the repression that Hasina had overseen and its earlier efforts to tilt the electoral playing field. The 2014, 2018 and 2024 elections – which Hasina won with a landslide – were all widely seen as manipulated, with opposition boycotts and crackdowns on rivals.</p><p>Still, Kugelman said the nature of dynastic political parties in South Asia is such that they rarely die.</p><p>“Even though the Awami League is in a bad place, it is essentially out of the political picture indefinitely in Bangladesh; one certainly should not rule out a potential future comeback. Political circumstances can change very quickly,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kugelman compared the party’s current crisis with what its bitter rival, the BNP, suffered during Hasina’s regime when the main opposition party struggled to mount a meaningful political or electoral challenge – only to re-emerge now as the most likely contender for power.</p><p>He said the Awami League is likely to adopt a “waiting strategy”. As long as Hasina remains politically active, she is likely to “want to stay in the game” and might also announce her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed as her dynastic successor.</p><p>“It could take time,” Kugelman said. “Given how politics play out in this region, they can be quite volatile. If an opening emerges down the road and the Awami League is in a better position to operate as a viable political force, it could well come back. But for now, it is essentially dead in the water.”</p><p>That is not a happy portent for Mridha, the boatman in Rajbari, for whom the uncertainty over his party’s future is deeply unsettling.</p><p>“My father used to talk about how the Awami League struggled after Bangabandhu [as Hasina’s father is fondly called] was assassinated,” he said, referring to Rahman’s assassination during a coup by the army in 1975, which pushed the Awami League into its first major crisis.</p><p>“But this year feels like a political wipeout.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
