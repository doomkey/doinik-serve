The fact is that Brazilians are allowed to leave, while Venezuelans face restrictions. But this could change at any time,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak on the matter.</p><p>The head of Brazil’s Federal Police also announced the temporary closure, and the governor of the state of Roraima told Reuters that the border had been reopened after the brief closure.</p><p>Brazil’s government said it is monitoring the border and has sent military personnel to the region to bolster security.</p><p>“The Minister of Defense indicated that there is no abnormal activity on the border between Brazil and Venezuela, which will continue to be monitored, and that he is in contact with the Governor of Roraima,” read a statement from Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Venezuelans make up <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/brazil-venezuelan-migrants-find-refuge-in-forest-shantytown\">Brazil’s largest foreign population</a>, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The state of Roraima alone is home to 77,563 immigrants from the country. In all, some 8 million Venezuelans have fled their homes in the past decade, with more than 6 million resettling in other Latin American countries.</p><p>“I think it’s very possible that there will be an exodus of Venezuelans to Brazil, and, in fact, we are already seeing concrete signs of it,” Jessica Leon Cedeno, a Venezuelan journalist who lives in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Millions of people have left the country in search of better living conditions and opportunities.”</p><h2 id=\"lula-says-us-attacks-could-destabilise-the-region\">Lula says US attacks could ‘destabilise’ the region</h2><p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump’s actions <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-bombs-venezuela-us-captures-maduro-all-that-we-know\">inside Venezuela</a> were “unacceptable”.</p><p>“The bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” wrote Lula on X. “These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela’s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”</p><p>Brazil’s leader has urged restraint for months amid an increased US <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">military buildup</a> off Venezuela’s coast.</p><p>Analysts worry that Maduro’s removal could plunge Venezuela into chaos, potentially resulting in another wave of <a href=\"/news/2022/8/31/over-6-8-million-have-left-venezuela-since-2014-and-exodus-grows\">mass migration</a>, as it witnessed in 2019 after a failed attempt to remove Maduro.</p><p>Joao Carlos Jarochinski Silva, a professor of international relations at the Federal University of Roraima, said that a potential wave of migration would depend on multiple factors, including whether Washington continues its military campaign inside the country and whether what remains of Maduro’s regime will put up a fight.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What is the resilience capacity of Chavismo within Venezuela?” Jarochinski Silva said, referring to the political movement named after former President Hugo Chavez. “This could have consequences that are truly worrying, but given the current scenario, there is no context of fear.”</p><p>He added that Trump has so far focused on applauding his military’s action inside Venezuela and has not addressed key humanitarian concerns. Earlier this year, the Trump administration cut funding to the US government’s main agency for foreign aid, USAID, which heavily affected Venezuela’s neighbours, Brazil and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/colombia-braces-with-alarm-after-maduros-removal-in-venezuela-by-us\">Colombia</a>.</p><p>“The United States has been cutting humanitarian resources lately,” he said, adding that there will be consequences to the US military actions inside the country. “For example, refugees, other people who may be affected by this. He doesn’t commit to this agenda at any point.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He claimed that “hostile elements” were behind the incident, without elaborating.

The attacks were widely denounced as extrajudicial killings.</p><p>Washington had accused the Venezuelan leader, who has been in power since 2013, of having ties to drug cartels. Maduro had rejected the claim, saying the US was working to depose him and take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.</p><p>During Saturday’s news conference, Trump said that “very large United States oil companies” would move into Venezuela to “fix the badly broken… oil infrastructure and start making money for the country”.</p><p>He added that his administration’s actions “will make the people of Venezuela rich, independent and safe”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has defended Maduro’s “capture, saying the left-wing leader faced drug-related charges in the US.</p><p>These charges include “narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States”, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said.</p><p>“They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” she added in a post on X.</p><p>A Justice Department official told the Reuters news agency that Maduro is expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"illegal-abduction\">‘Illegal abduction’</h2><p>But legal experts, world leaders and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/us-lawmakers-react-to-attack-on-venezuela-capture-of-maduro\">Democratic Party lawmakers</a> in the US have condemned the administration’s actions as a violation of international law.</p><p>“Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step towards a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wrote on X.</p><p>Ben Saul, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, slammed what he called Washington’s “illegal abduction” of Maduro. “I condemn the US’ illegal aggression against Venezuela,” Saul wrote on social media.</p><p>A spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed” by the situation, describing the US’s actions as setting “a dangerous precedent”.</p><p>“The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect – by all – of international law, including the UN Charter. He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,” Guterres’s office said in a statement.</p><p>Earlier on Saturday, Venezuela’s defence minister released a defiant statement in response to the US attacks, urging people to remain united.</p><p>“We will not negotiate; we will not give up,” Vladimir Padrino Lopez said, stressing that Venezuela’s independence is not up for negotiation. “We must maintain calm and [be] united in order to prevail in these dire moments.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"uncertainty-prevails\">Uncertainty prevails</h2><p>It remains unclear how exactly the US plans to “run” Venezuela, and how long the purported transitional period will last.</p><p>During Saturday’s news conference, Trump said that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.</p><p>“She was sworn in as president just a little while ago,” Trump told reporters. “She had a long conversation with [Rubio], and she said, ‘We’ll do whatever you need’. I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn’t have a choice.”</p><p>Rodriguez appeared to contradict that in a news conference in Caracas later in the day.</p><p>“We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. The only president of Venezuela is President Nicolas Maduro,” she said.</p><p>“We are ready to defend Venezuela. We are ready to defend our natural resources, which should be for national development,” she added.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Latin America editor Lucia Newman, reporting from Chile, said that, if Rodriguez is “on board” with the US plan for Venezuela, as Trump and Rubio have suggested, “she certainly didn’t sound like it” during her address.</p><p>“She sounded like her typical, fiery self, very much on the side of… Maduro, demanding that he be released and saying that Venezuela would not be a colony of the United States,” Newman said.</p><p>The events of the day have brought “a rollercoaster of emotions” to “Venezuelans both inside and outside of the country”, said Caracas-based journalist Sissi de Flaviis.</p><p>“When we first heard that Maduro was taken out of the country, there was a mix of reactions,” she said. “A lot of people couldn’t believe it. Other people were pretty much celebrating. Other people were kind of on standby, waiting.”</p><p>After Trump’s news conference announcing US plans to run Venezuela, “there’s been a shock”, de Flaviis added.</p><p>“People are a bit concerned about what this will actually mean for us, what this will mean for the government and who is going to lead us in the next few days, months and years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Harlan Ullman, a former US naval officer, told Al Jazeera that “the notion of America taking over Venezuela is going to explode in our faces”.</p><p>“When Trump says, ‘We’re going to run the country’: We’re not capable of running America, how are we going to be able to run Venezuela?” Ullman said.</p><p>“I do not believe that we have a plan for dealing with Venezuela,” he added. “A country is extraordinarily complex. We lack the knowledge, understanding and all the logistics to do this.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

These are the actions of a rogue state,” Tlaib wrote on social media.</p><p>“The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.”</p><h2 id=\"democratic-senator-andy-kim\">Democratic Senator Andy Kim</h2><p>The Democratic senator accused US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of lying when they told lawmakers during a Senate briefing last month that the US pressure campaign against Venezuela was not about regime change.</p><p>“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on X.</p><p>“Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”</p><p>He added that the US strike “doesn’t represent strength” and is not “sound foreign policy”.</p><p>“It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"democratic-congresswoman-betty-mccollum\">Democratic Congresswoman Betty McCollum</h2><p>McCollum, the ranking Democrat on the US House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, called on Trump to immediately halt US strikes against Venezuela.</p><p>“The actions taken today by the Trump administration are blatantly illegal,” she said in a statement.</p><p>“Venezuela poses no imminent national security threat to the United States and Congress has not voted to authorize any use of force in the region.”</p><p>She urged Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to call the House of Representatives back into session immediately “to rein in this out-of-control President”.</p><h2 id=\"democratic-senator-reuben-gallego\">Democratic Senator Reuben Gallego</h2><p>“This war is illegal, it’s embarrassing that we went from the world cop to the world bully in less than one year. There is no reason for us to be at war with Venezuela,” Gallego wrote on X.</p><h2 id=\"democratic-congressman-jim-mcgovern\">Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern</h2><p>McGovern also raised questions about the lack of Congressional oversight, saying that “without authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela.”</p><p>“He says we don’t have enough money for healthcare for Americans—but somehow we have unlimited funds for war??” the Democratic lawmaker wrote on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"republican-house-speaker-mike-johnson\">Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson</h2><p>Johnson, the Republican leader in the US House of Representatives, welcomed the US attacks on Venezuela as a “decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives”.</p><p>“President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,” he said on social media.</p><p>Johnson added that the Trump administration would schedule briefings for US lawmakers when Congress returns next week.</p><h2 id=\"republican-senator-tom-cotton\">Republican Senator Tom Cotton</h2><p>Cotton, a top Trump ally in Congress, hailed the US president as well as US troops and law enforcement officers for an “incredible operation”.</p><p>“Nicolas Maduro wasn’t just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation. That’s why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism,” Cotton wrote on X.</p><p>He said he spoke with Rubio, the US secretary of state, who confirmed that Maduro was in US custody and “will face justice for his crimes against our citizens”.</p><p>Cotton then appeared to threaten the interim government in Venezuela, saying it needed to “decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world”.</p><p>“I urge them to choose wisely,” Cotton wrote.</p><h2 id=\"republican-senator-mike-lee\">Republican Senator Mike Lee</h2><p>Lee, who had been critical of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Venezuela, said Rubio told him that Maduro had been arrested “to stand trial on criminal charges” in the US.</p><p>Lee also wrote on social media that Rubio told him the US military action in Venezuela “was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant”.</p><p>“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” Lee said in a post on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"republican-senator-rick-scott\">Republican Senator Rick Scott</h2><p>The Florida senator said “the strikes against and capture of narco-terrorist Nicolas Maduro” were conducted “with a level of professionalism and precision”.</p><p>He said they also send a message to the world that Trump “is a man of his word, and the United States will not tolerate terrorists.”</p><p>“Maduro was indicted in a U.S. Court and was told to stop sending drugs into our country to kill our kids and grandkids, but he refused. This is peace through strength on full display. Today, America and the world are a safer place,” Scott wrote on X.</p><h2 id=\"republican-congresswoman-marjorie-taylor-greene\">Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene</h2><p>Taylor Greene, a one-time Trump ally-turned-critic, has raised serious questions about an apparent double-standard in the Republican leader’s strategy to fight drug trafficking.</p><p>In a social media post, Taylor Greene blamed most drug-related deaths in the US on Mexican drug cartels, but noted that Trump had not carried out strikes against those groups.</p><p>She also challenged the Trump administration’s claim that it is fighting “narco terrorists” by noting that Trump recently pardoned the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/juan-orlando-hernandez-freed-after-trumps-full-and-complete-pardon\">former president of Honduras</a>, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of trafficking massive amounts of cocaine into the US.</p><p><span>“The next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran,” she wrote on X.</span></p><p>“And of course why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-vice-president-jd-vance\">US Vice President JD Vance</h2><p>Vance said that the operation to “capture” Maduro shows that Trump “means what he says”.</p><p>“The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States,” Vance said on social media.</p><p>Before Saturday’s attacks, senior Trump administration officials had said Venezuela’s oil belongs to Washington, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">falsely describing</a> the nationalisation of the South American country’s petroleum industry as “theft”.</p><p>In his X post, Vance also addressed the experts, world leaders and US lawmakers who have denounced the administration’s actions against Venezuela as illegal.</p><p>“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism. You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,” the US vice president said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In December, it ordered Colombians to stay home and bombed state installations across the country, an action it described as a response to US aggression.</p><p>The Colombian government has ramped up security measures in anticipation of possible retaliatory action by the ELN following Maduro’s removal.</p><p>“All capabilities of the security forces have been activated to protect the population, strategic assets, embassies, military and police units, among others, as well as to prevent any attempted terrorist action by transnational criminal organisations, such as the ELN cartel,” read a statement on Saturday morning issued by Colombia’s Ministry of Defence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mass-influx-of-refugees\">‘Mass influx of refugees’</h2><p>In addition to fears of increased violence, Colombia also stands to bear the brunt of any migration crisis initiated by a conflict in Venezuela.</p><p>In an X post on Saturday morning, Petro said the government had bolstered humanitarian provisions on its eastern border, writing, “all the assistance resources at our disposal have been deployed in case of a mass influx of refugees.”</p><p>To date, Colombia has received the highest number of Venezuelan refugees worldwide, with nearly 3 million of the approximately 8 million people who have left the country settling in Colombia.</p><p>The previous wave of mass migration in 2019 – which followed opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/venezuelan-opposition-leader-guaido-expelled-from-colombia\">Juan Guaido’s failed attempt to overthrow Maduro</a> – required a massive humanitarian operation to house, feed, and provide medical attention to refugees.</p><p>Such an operation is likely to prove even more challenging now, with Colombia losing roughly 70 percent of all humanitarian funds after the Trump administration shuttered its USAID programmes in the country last year.</p><p>“There is a real possibility of short-term population movement, both precautionary and forced, especially if instability, reprisals, or power vacuums emerge,” said Juan Carlos Viloria, a leader of the Venezuelan diaspora in Colombia.</p><p>“Colombia must prepare proactively by activating protection mechanisms, humanitarian corridors, and asylum systems, not only to respond to potential arrivals, but to prevent chaos and human rights violations at the border,” added Viloria.</p><h2 id=\"a-further-collapse-in-us-colombia-relations\">A further collapse in US-Colombia relations</h2><p>Analysts say Maduro’s removal raises difficult questions for Petro, who has been engaged in a war of words with Trump since the US president assumed office last year.</p><p>The Colombian leader drew Trump’s ire in recent months when he condemned Washington’s military buildup in the Caribbean and alleged a Colombian fisherman had been killed in territorial waters. In response, the White House sanctioned Petro, with Trump calling him a “thug” and “an illegal drug dealer”.</p><p>“Petro is irascible at the moment because he sees Trump and his threats no longer as empty, but as real possibilities,” said Sergio Guzman, Director at Colombia Risk Analysis, a Bogota-based security consultancy.</p><p>Indeed, Trump has on multiple occasions floated military strikes against drug production sites in Colombia. However, experts say it is unlikely the White House would take unilateral action given their historic cooperation with Colombian security forces.</p><p>Despite Petro condemning Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, he previously called Maduro a “dictator” and joined the US and other nations in refusing to recognise the strongman’s fraudulent re-election as president in 2024.</p><p>Rather than supporting Maduro, the Colombian leader has positioned himself as a defender of national sovereignty and international law.</p><p>On Saturday, Petro called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which Colombia joined as a temporary member just days ago.</p><p>“Colombia reaffirms its unconditional commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,” wrote the president in an X post.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><em>This story has been published in conjunction with Latin America Reports.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But, hey, it’s all in a day’s work for an administration that couldn’t care less about legal justification for its behaviour, much less human rights and other such silly concepts.</p><p>The US has also hijacked various oil tankers, with Trump unleashing blissfully ludicrous <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/20/venezuela-oil-nationalization-expropriation/\">allegations</a> that Venezuela is guilty of stealing US oil, land and assets.</p><p>This latest bout of US aggression comes on the heels of decades of US sanctions, which have crippled the Venezuelan economy and which have constituted a <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/12/the-us-is-already-at-war-with-venezuela\">form of warfare</a> unto themselves. As of 2020, former UN special rapporteur Alfred de Zayas <a href=\"https://venezuelanalysis.com/sanctions-kill/\">calculated</a> that 100,000 Venezuelans had already perished as a direct result of coercive economic measures.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/2007396201600258094\">According to</a> a post earlier today on X by US Senator Mike Lee of Utah, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed him that Maduro has been arrested to stand trial in the United States on criminal charges, and that the air strikes on Venezuela were necessary to protect the US military personnel who were carrying out the arrest warrant.</p><p>And while the Trump administration has converted Maduro into the latest international bogeyman and existential menace, this narrative leaves much to be desired. Objectively speaking, the US itself is guilty of far more extensive and comprehensively criminal behaviour than the bumbling Maduro.</p><p>Ditto for top US ally Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been repeatedly feted by US presidents over the past two-plus years of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/two-years-of-israels-genocide-in-gaza-by-the-numbers\">Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip</a>.</p><p>Of course, no one in Washington would ever suggest that Netanyahu be bundled off to stand trial in the US, which prefers instead to fling billions of dollars at the Israeli military in order to aid in the mass slaughter.</p><p>Oil-rich Venezuela, on the other hand, has long been a thorn in the side of the US empire, starting with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, who propagated such <a href=\"/opinions/2019/1/2/how-capitalism-is-killing-us\">dangerous anti-capitalist ideas</a> as universal healthcare.</p><p>Now, the Trump administration accuses Maduro of serving as a ringleader for “narcoterrorism”, which would be laughable if it didn’t result in such large-scale destruction and the flagrant violation of international law.</p><p>Obviously, Trump is hardly the only US president in recent history to engage in blatantly illegal action abroad – although he does manage to add a certain dramatic layer of dementedness to everything he does.</p><p>One recalls the case of the late Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, who remained on the CIA payroll for years, despite the US government’s full knowledge of his drug trafficking activities.</p><p>When Noriega ceased to be regarded as a valuable anti-communist ally in the 1980s, the US turned on him, spontaneously converting him into the face of evil.</p><p>In December 1989, President George H W Bush launched a <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/24/letter-from-panamas-little-hiroshima\">patently insane attack</a> on Panama, where up to several thousand civilians were killed in the impoverished Panama City neighbourhood of El Chorrillo.</p><p>Noriega was eventually captured by US forces in 1990, after his brief stay at the Vatican embassy in the Panamanian capital was rendered unsustainable by the US tanks parked outside. The armoured vehicles’ speakers subjected him to a continuous playlist of musical torture, including singer Jon Bon Jovi’s song Wanted Dead or Alive and Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA.</p><p>The Panamanian was carted off to stand trial in – where else? – the United States, where the government apparently detected zero hypocrisy in holding its former buddy to judicial account for activities it had previously signed off on.</p><p>There was also the war on Iraq in 2003, which was waged on the basis of lies fabricated by Bush’s son President George W Bush and his administration. The US invaded the country, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction. Those were naturally nowhere to be found, but the US army nonetheless pulverised various parts of the country and killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.</p><p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured, tried and summarily executed by the US-appointed interim Iraqi government.</p><p>Indeed, wherever the US has intervened militarily, nothing good has tended to follow. This latest attack on Venezuela will hardly be the end of the story, contrary to Senator Lee’s contention that Rubio anticipates “no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.</p><p>Rest assured that, as US impunity rages on, the deadly spectacle is far from over.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 100 people have been killed in at least 30 such boat bombings, but the Trump administration is yet to present any public evidence that there were drugs on board, that the vessels were travelling to the US, or that the people on the boats belonged to banned organisations, as the US has claimed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US began its largest military deployment in the Caribbean Sea in at least several decades, spearheaded by the USS Gerald Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier.</p><p>In December, the US hijacked two ships carrying Venezuelan oil, and has since imposed sanctions on multiple companies and their tankers, accusing them of trying to circumvent already stringent American sanctions against Venezuela’s oil industry.</p><p>Then, last week, the US struck what Trump described as a “dock” in Venezuela where he claimed drugs were loaded onto boats.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925528\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Crude-oil-reserves-vs-exports-1756989578.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Crude oil reserves vs exports-1756989578\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"could-all-this-be-about-oil\">Could all this be about oil?</h2><p>Trump has so far framed his pressure and military action against Venezuela and in the Caribbean Sea as driven by a desire to stop the flow of dangerous drugs into the US.</p><p>But he has increasingly also sought Maduro’s departure from power, despite a phone call in early December that the Venezuelan president described as “cordial”.</p><p>Later on Saturday, Trump told a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence: “We’re going to have our very large American oil companies go in and spend billions of dollars, and fix the badly broken oil infrastructure” in Venezuela.</p><p>He added: “We will make the great people of Venezuela very rich, independent and safe.”</p><p>In recent weeks, some senior aides of the US president have been even more open about Venezuela’s oil: the country’s vast reserves of crude, unmatched in the world, amounted to an estimated 303 billion barrels (Bbbl) as of 2023.</p><p>On December 17, Trump’s top adviser Stephen Miller <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">claimed</a> that the US had “created the oil industry in Venezuela” and that the South American country’s oil should therefore belong to the US.</p><p>But though US companies were the earliest to drill for oil in Venezuela in the early 1900s, international law is clear: sovereign states – in this case Venezuela – own the natural resources within their territories under the principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources (PSNR).</p><p>Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976.

He wrote: “Now begins a greater task. The governments of Latin America must ensure that the entire apparatus of the regime abandons power and is held accountable.”</p><p>Trump’s closest ally in the region is Argentinian President Javier Milei, who expressed approval of the Trump administration’s move via videos posted to X, while the right-wing president of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, wrote on X: “All the criminal narco-Chavistas will have their moment. Their structure will finally collapse across the continent.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-venezuelans-reacted-so-far\">How have Venezuelans reacted so far?</h2><p>On Saturday morning, the streets of Caracas were mostly quiet on Saturday, patrolled by security forces as people stayed indoors. Later in the day, however, supporters of Maduro’s government – some chanting “We want Maduro” – began to gather in Caracas to protest against his capture.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">They were being led in a march by Caracas Mayor Carmen Melendez, wearing a military uniform. She described the US action as Maduro’s “kidnapping”.</p><p>Many members of the Venezuelan diaspora, however, have taken to the streets in other countries to celebrate Maduro’s removal.</p><p>About 20 percent of the population of Venezuela – about 7.7 million people – have left the country since 2014, mostly to seek better economic opportunities elsewhere, according to data from the United Nations International Organization for Migration. About 85 percent have moved to neighbouring countries in Latin America and to the Caribbean.</p><p>“We are free,” Khaty Yanex, a Venezuelan woman who has lived in Chile for the past seven years, told Reuters. “We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.”</p><p>Another Venezuelan celebrating in Chile, Jose Gregorio, said: “My joy is too big. After so many years, after so many struggles, after so much work, today is the day. Today is the day of freedom.”</p><p>In Spain, Venezuelan Agustin Rodriguez told a local television broadcaster that the strikes “may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, where there can be a future”, Reuters reported.</p><p>Andres Losada told Reuters he has lived in Spain for three years, where the Venezuelan diaspora is approximately 400,000 people. He said: “Although what people are going through in Caracas is tough, I believe that beyond that, there is a light that will lead us to freedom.”</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-to-maduro-next\">What happens to Maduro next?</h2><p>In a statement posted on X, Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Maduro has been charged with “narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy”, among other charges, Bondi said. It was unclear if his wife is facing the same charges, but she referred to the Maduro couple as “alleged international narco traffickers.”</p><p>“They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” she added.</p><p>Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, earlier posted on X that he had spoken to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had told him that Maduro had been “arrested by US personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.”</p><p>In 2020, US prosecutors had charged Maduro with running a cocaine-trafficking network.</p><p>But US officials remain silent on the illegality of Maduro’s capture and the attacks on Venezuela, which violate UN Charter principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations.</p><p>Russia and Cuba, close Maduro allies, condemned the attack. Colombia, which neighbours Venezuela and has itself been in Trump’s crosshairs, said that it “rejects the aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and of Latin America” – even though Bogota itself does not recognise Maduro’s government.</p><p>Most other nations have been relatively muted in their response to the US aggression so far.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4211302\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4211302\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4211302\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25134041174208-1767444006.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, left, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, second from left, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, center, and Russian Ambassador to Venezuela Sergey Melik-Bagdasarov, second from right, inaugurate a monument commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, May 13, 2025.(AP Photo/Cristian Hernandez)\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4211302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, left, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, second from left, and Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, centre, seen here at a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday, May 13, 2025.

In a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/the-homeland-is-the-homeland-venezuelans-brace-for-possible-us-attack\">November poll in Venezuela</a>, 55 percent of participants were opposed to military intervention in their country, and an equal number were opposed to economic sanctions against Venezuela.</p><p>In a post on X on Saturday, Machado said her opposition colleague, Edmundo Gonzalez, who many claim won the last election against Maduro, should now assume the presidency. She added that the opposition would restore order and free all political prisoners.</p><p>But Trump might be mistaken if he thinks the US can stay out of the chaos that is likely to follow in a post-Maduro Venezuela, suggests Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America, the US and North America programme at Chatham House.</p><p>“Assuming even if there is regime change – of some sort, and it’s by no means clear even if it does happen that it will be democratic – the US’s military action will likely require sustained US engagement of some sort,” he said.</p><p>“Will the Trump White House have the stomach for that?”</p></div></div></body></html>"
