            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"318\" data-end=\"918\">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was shot 19 times inside his compound in Zintan, a mountain town in western Libya, where he had lived since his capture in 2011. Four masked men entered the compound after disabling the security cameras. Roughly 90 minutes earlier, his guards had withdrawn from the area for reasons that remain unexplained. When the shooting ended, the assailants did not flee. They left. No gunfight. No pursuit. No claim of responsibility. The perpetrators vanished into the kind of silence that, in Libya, usually means the killers have nothing to fear from an investigation.</p><p data-start=\"920\" data-end=\"1545\">Saif was the son of Muammar Gaddafi, who ruled Libya for more than four decades before being overthrown and killed in the 2011 revolution. Since 2014, the country has been divided between two rival power centres. In the west, successive governments in Tripoli, the latest led by Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, derive their authority from United Nations recognition. In the east, renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar controls territory through military force, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia, and Egypt, while a paper government in Benghazi provides civilian cover for what is effectively military rule. Neither side has faced a national election, nor intends to.</p><p>The mechanics of the killing tell their own story. This was not violence born of chaos. It was an operation, executed within a narrow window by actors who understood Saif’s movements, his protection, and the informal rules governing both. Members of his inner circle have described it as an inside job. Reaching him required more than weapons. It required access to his routines, to his guards, and to the layered arrangements that had kept him alive in secret. For years, Saif had lived in varying degrees of concealment, protected by local understandings and, at times, by Russian-linked security support. By the night of the attack, all that protection had been withdrawn. Whoever planned the operation knew it would be.</p><p data-start=\"2279\" data-end=\"2352\">Motive alone is not evidence. But method and capability narrow the field.</p><p data-start=\"2354\" data-end=\"3201\">When Abdelghani al-Kikli, the commander of Tripoli’s largest militia, Stabilisation Support Apparatus (SSA), was assassinated last year by a rival brigade, the result was immediate chaos. Armed clashes shut down large parts of the capital – factional and noisy, and instantly legible. The Zintan operation bears no resemblance. Its precision and the silence that followed point to a different kind of actor. Critics, liabilities, and inconvenient figures within Haftar’s orbit have often been removed quietly. Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a senior officer in Haftar’s forces and a man wanted by the International Criminal Court, was shot dead in broad daylight in Benghazi in 2021. No serious investigation followed. Others have disappeared in a similar fashion. These operations do not require total territorial control. They rely on networks, intimidation and the expectation of impunity.</p><p data-start=\"3203\" data-end=\"3310\">None of these constitutes proof. Libya rarely offers proof. Only patterns. But patterns have infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"3312\" data-end=\"3776\">The political order Muammar Gaddafi built did not disappear in 2011. It was disassembled and repurposed. Haftar took its fragments, tribal patronage networks, security hierarchies, and the militia economy, and reassembled them around his own family, anchored by a praetorian guard, the Tariq bin Ziyad Brigade, commanded by his son Saddam, the recently appointed deputy general commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army and the most likely successor to his father.</p><p data-start=\"3778\" data-end=\"4277\">Former loyalists of the old regime were not excluded from this system, but they were never trusted within it. Pro-Gaddafi political figures and commanders were encouraged to return under Haftar and absorbed after 2014 only on strictly conditional terms. Figures such as Hassan Zadma, once aligned with Saif’s brother Khamis’s infamous 32nd Brigade, were coopted for their utility, not integrated as partners. When their presence threatened Haftar’s control, they were marginalised or dismantled.</p><p data-start=\"4279\" data-end=\"4567\">Saif himself was never offered even that conditional inclusion. He remained outside the system, tolerated, contained, and watched, a reminder of an alternative line of inheritance that could never be fully neutralised. He had lived under the persistent threat of assassination since 2017.</p><p data-start=\"4569\" data-end=\"5397\">Saif did not represent change. He represented an alternative. The danger he posed was structural. Haftar’s coalition is held together not by ideology but by patronage, and patronage is distributed unevenly. Some tribes and armed groups receive more than others. Loyalty is transactional, calibrated to what each faction can extract. In the event of Haftar’s death, those who feel short-changed would see succession as an opportunity to renegotiate their terms, or defect to whoever offers a better deal. The only figure with a history and surname symbolic enough to draw them in was Saif, heir to the very system Haftar had repurposed. He would not have dismantled it. He would have ruled through it, with the same patronage logic and the same authoritarian reflexes. Same system, different family.</p><p data-start=\"5399\" data-end=\"6688\">That made him extraordinarily difficult to accommodate. Forty-eight hours before the killing, Saddam Haftar met Ibrahim Dbeibah, the prime minister’s nephew and head of Libya’s national security apparatus, secretly at the Elysee Palace in Paris. There was no official readout. Leaks suggest a single agenda: whether Libya’s rival camps could form yet another interim unity government, one that would bring the LAAF formally under the state, divide ministries and institutions between the Haftar and Dbeibah families, and postpone elections for what would now be over a decade. Libyans have not voted since 2014. That grievance has deepened with every failed transition, every broken promise of elections, every new interim arrangement designed to keep the same people in power. A family carve-up negotiated in Paris would have made it volcanic. Saif did not need a programme to exploit that. He only needed to be on the ballot. In the aborted 2021 presidential election, he polled significantly ahead of Haftar. If the only viable candidates are authoritarians, the anti-establishment authoritarian wins. He could not be absorbed into such an arrangement without destabilising both sides, and he could not be left outside it without becoming the vehicle for every Libyan’s rage against it.</p><p data-start=\"6690\" data-end=\"7273\">Five days after his killing, Saif’s tribe buried him in Bani Walid, a town long associated with loyalists of his father. They had wanted Sirte, his father’s tribal seat. Haftar’s forces denied them. Condolence receptions were blocked. Public mourning was prevented. Saif spent a decade being told where he could live, who he could see, and when he could speak. His killers decided where he could die. His rivals decided where he could be buried. No one has been arrested. No one will be. In Libya, silence after a killing is never the absence of an answer. It is the answer.</p><p data-start=\"6690\" data-end=\"7273\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

There’s been no interest to deal using cheques for even one to two months,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Shops are also open around the nearby Jomhouri business area of downtown, where the protests were <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">originally sparked by shopkeepers</a> on December 28 against the freefall in the value of  the national currency. But there is still a heavy presence of security forces in the area, who at times set up checkpoints and patrol the streets.</p><p>A report on Monday by the reformist Shargh newspaper said many parents are questioning whether schools, which were shut down along with universities by the authorities during the unrest, are now safe places to send their children. Their indecision has left many classrooms nearly empty.</p><h2 id=\"celebrations-to-mark-1979-revolution-planned\">Celebrations to mark 1979 revolution planned</h2><p>The theocratic establishment is planning events across the country on Wednesday to celebrate the anniversary of the 1979 revolution, which ousted Iran’s last shah, US-backed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.</p><p>In a speech on Monday, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei told Iranians to “make the enemy disappointed” by participating in state-organised rallies and demonstrations, which he said are “unparalleled” in the world.</p><p>President Masoud Pezeshkian and other top officials have also addressed state media to ask the people to join the rallies.</p><p>The confession letter signed by Saedinia also said the businessman and his son would participate in the rallies to demonstrate “hatred for criminal America”.</p><p>Earlier this week, Iranian authorities also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/iran-arrests-prominent-reformists-over-deadly-january-unrest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arrested leading reformist figures</a> who had called for changes in the aftermath of the government’s deadly protest crackdown.

Opinion polls put Scottish Labour some distance behind the Scottish National Party, followed by the far-right Reform party, led by Nigel Farage.</p><p>But cabinet members came out in support of Starmer, ultimately ending the coup that never was. Angela Rayner, former deputy prime minister and a senior member of the Labour Party, was the first to show him support.

I fought to change the Labour Party to allow us to win an election again,” he told them.</p><p>“But I’ll tell you this, after having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I’m not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country or to plunge us into chaos as others have done.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301896\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301896\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96P79VC__v1__MidRes__BritainUsPoliticsEpsteinMandelson-1770714140.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C501&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"starmer\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301896\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Journalists gather outside 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain’s prime minister, on February 9, 2026, as Starmer was ‘getting on with the job of delivering change across the country’, a spokesman told them.

Rayner has denied any links to the website.</p><p>Another politician gearing up to replace Starmer is Wes Streeting, the health secretary.</p><p>Streeting, 43, has also been called out for his ties with Mandelson. In a bid to distance himself from the former ambassador, Streeting this week shared private chats he had with Mandelson that questioned the government’s growth plan.</p><p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, 45, is another possible successor to Starmer.

However, the prime minister has since had a difficult time in Downing Street.</p><p>In the 2024 elections, Reform UK, the right-wing, populist, anti-immigration party led by Farage, won just five of the 650 seats in parliament. However, it has gone on to become one of the best polling British parties. In July, a YouGov <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">poll</a> put Reform in the lead, predicting it could win 271 seats if elections were held then.</p><p>In his speech on Monday, Starmer called the challenge posed by the rise of the Reform party, which has won over a number of high-profile defectors from the Conservative Party in recent weeks, “a fight for our lives”.</p><p>Starmer is also facing domestic pressure to put a stop to undocumented immigration to the UK. More than 32,000 people tried to cross the English Channel from France in small boats last year. These crossings are dangerous and have resulted in many deaths.</p><p>The UK and France have laid the blame on each other for the rising numbers. This led to a “<a href=\"/news/2025/9/24/how-effective-is-uks-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-with-france-so-far\">one-in-one-out</a>” migrant deal signed between the UK and France last year, under which the UK returns one migrant to France for each accepted refugee. The scheme has had little success, however, with only a handful of migrants returned.</p><p>Starmer himself has dropped in popularity by 20 percentage points from July 2024 to January this year, according to YouGov.</p><p>“Reform has obviously spooked some in the Labour Party,” Bale said, adding, however, that Reform is eating into the Conservatives’ base more. “And Labour probably needs to worry more about the Greens and the Liberal Democrats at this stage.”</p><p>“The break-up of the two-party duopoly that has dominated British politics for a century is no longer simply an aspiration among challenger parties but an ongoing reality,” Bale said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

instructed the Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p><p>The move came amid ongoing political tensions between India and Bangladesh, which the BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia termed “recent developments which are going on all across”.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-bangladesh-refuse-to-play-in-india\">Why did

Bangladeshi government, citing safety and security concerns for its players and staff.</p><p>It requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to relocate Bangladesh’s fixtures – all of which were to be held in India – to tournament cohosts Sri Lanka.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-icc-remove-bangladesh-from-the-t20-world-cup\">Why did the ICC remove Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup?</h2><p>The ICC and BCB were engaged in negotiations for more than two weeks, during which the game’s global governing body <a

the team’s fate at the World Cup after consultations with the government.</p><p>One week after Bangladesh’s expulsion, Pakistan’s government sent shockwaves through the cricketing world by <a

have a <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/5/pakistan-confirms-india-t20-world-cup-boycott-can-it-face-sanctions-bans\">negative effect</a> on cricket in the country.</p><p>However, when Pakistan refused to change its position, the ICC <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/7/icc-in-pakistan-talks-to-revive-india-t20-world-cup-clash\">initiated</a> a series of meetings and negotiations with PCB officials to persuade them otherwise.</p><p>PCB chief Naqvi hosted BCB Chairman Aminul Islam and top ICC officials on Sunday and reportedly put forth a series of demands, most of which involved Bangladesh.</p><h2

agreed that Bangladesh would not face any penalties or sanctions for refusing to play in India.</p><p>It also promised an ICC event would be hosted in Bangladesh between 2028 and 2031.</p><p>Within an hour, Pakistan’s government said it had ordered the cricket team to <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/9/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-on-feb-15\">take the field</a> against India on

She found her husband screaming, but of Saad, there was no trace.</p><p>“I went into the mosque and found myself stepping on flesh and blood,” Mahani told Al Jazeera Arabic for an investigation that aired on Monday. She searched hospitals and morgues for days. “We found nothing of Saad. Not even a body to bury. That was the hardest part.”</p><p>Mahani is one of thousands of Palestinians whose loved ones have simply vanished during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people.</p><p>According to the Al Jazeera Arabic investigation, The Rest of the Story, Civil Defence teams in Gaza have documented 2,842 Palestinians who have “evaporated” since the war began in October 2023, leaving behind no remains other than blood spray or small fragments of flesh.</p><p>Experts and witnesses attributed this phenomenon to Israel’s systematic use of internationally prohibited thermal and thermobaric weapons, often referred to as vacuum or aerosol bombs, capable of generating temperatures exceeding 3,500 degrees Celsius [6,332 degrees Fahrenheit].</p><h2 id=\"grim-forensic-accounting\">Grim forensic accounting</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"11\">The figure of 2,842 is not an estimate, but the result of grim forensic accounting by Gaza’s Civil Defence.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"12\">Spokesperson Mahmoud Basal explained to Al Jazeera that teams use a “method of elimination” at strike sites. “We enter a targeted home and cross-reference the known number of occupants with the bodies recovered,” Basal said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">“If a family tells us there were five people inside, and we only recover three intact bodies, we treat the remaining two as ‘evaporated’ only after an exhaustive search yields nothing but biological traces—blood spray on walls or small fragments like scalps,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"the-chemistry-of-erasure\">The chemistry of erasure</h2><p>The investigation detailed how specific chemical compositions in Israeli munitions turn human bodies into ash in seconds.</p><p>Vasily Fatigarov, a Russian military expert, explained that thermobaric weapons do not just kill; they obliterate matter. Unlike conventional explosives, these weapons disperse a cloud of fuel that ignites to create an enormous fireball and a vacuum effect.</p><p>“To prolong the burning time, powders of aluminium, magnesium and titanium are added to the chemical mixture,” Fatigarov said. “This raises the temperature of the explosion to between 2,500 and 3,000 degrees Celsius [4,532F to 5,432F].”</p><p>According to the investigation, the intense heat is often generated by tritonal, a mixture of TNT and aluminium powder used in United States-made <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-made-bombs-used-in-deadly-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-schools-hrw-says\">bombs</a> like the MK-84.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3172453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3172453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INTERACTIVE-Israel-2000lbs-mk-84-mk-84-bomb-1726052230.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel 2000lbs mk 84 mk-84 bomb-1726052230\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3172453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Dr Munir al-Bursh, director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, explained the biological impact of such extreme heat on the human body, which is composed of roughly 80 percent water.</p><p>“The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius [212F],” al-Bursh said. “When a body is exposed to energy exceeding 3,000 degrees combined with massive pressure and oxidation, the fluids boil instantly. The tissues vaporise and turn to ash. It is chemically inevitable.”</p><h2 id=\"anatomy-of-the-bombs\">Anatomy of the bombs</h2><p>The investigation identified specific US-manufactured munitions used in Gaza that are linked to these disappearances:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>MK-84 ‘Hammer’:</strong> This 900kg [2,000lb] unguided bomb packed with tritonal generates heat up to 3,500C [6,332F].</li>\n<li><strong>BLU-109 bunker buster:</strong> Used in an attack on al-Mawasi, an area Israel had declared a “safe zone” for forcibly displaced Palestinians in September 2024, this bomb evaporated 22 people. It has a steel casing and a delayed fuse, burying itself before detonating a PBXN-109 explosive mix. This creates a large fireball inside enclosed spaces, incinerating everything within reach.</li>\n<li><strong>GBU-39:</strong> This precision glide bomb was used in the al-Tabin school attack. It uses the AFX-757 explosive. “The GBU-39 is designed to keep the building structure relatively intact while destroying everything inside,” Fatigarov noted. “It kills via a pressure wave that ruptures lungs and a thermal wave that incinerates soft tissue.”</li>\n</ul><p>Basal of the Civil Defence confirmed finding fragments of GBU-39 wings at sites where bodies had vanished.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2474448\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/INTERACTIVE-Israels-precision-guided-missiles-1699530503.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1069&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -Israels precision guided missiles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"a-global-genocide-not-just-an-israeli-one\">A ‘global genocide, not just an Israeli one’</h2><p>Legal experts said the use of these indiscriminate weapons implicates not just Israel but also its Western suppliers.</p><p>“This is a global genocide, not just an Israeli one,” said lawyer Diana Buttu, a lecturer at Georgetown University in Qatar.</p><p>Speaking at the Al Jazeera Forum in Doha, Buttu argued that the supply chain is evidence of complicity. “We see a continuous flow of these weapons from the United States and Europe. They know these weapons do not distinguish between a fighter and a child, yet they continue to send them.”</p><p>Buttu emphasised that under international law, the use of weapons that cannot distinguish between combatants and noncombatants constitutes a war crime.</p><p>“The world knows Israel possesses and uses these prohibited weapons,” Buttu said. “The question is why are they allowed to remain outside the system of accountability.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/INTERACTIVE-What-damage-a-bomb-can-do-Gaza-war-1699764224.png?w=770&amp;quality=80\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"collapse-of-international-justice\">Collapse of international justice</h2><p>Despite the International Court of Justice issuing provisional measures against Israel in January 2024, ordering it to prevent acts of genocide, and an arrest <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza\">warrant</a> from the International Criminal Court issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in November 2024, the killing intensified.</p><p>Tariq Shandab, a professor of international law, argued that the international justice system has “failed the test of Gaza”.</p><p>“Since the ceasefire agreement [in October], more than 600 Palestinians have been killed,” Shandab said. He highlighted that the war has continued through siege, starvation and strikes. “The blockade on medicine and food is itself a crime against humanity.”</p><p>Shandab pointed to the “impunity” granted to Israel by the US veto power at the UN Security Council. However, he noted that universal jurisdiction courts in countries like Germany and France could offer an alternative path to justice, provided there is political will.</p><p>For Rafiq Badran, who lost four children in the Bureij refugee camp during the war, these technical definitions mean little. He was only able to recover small parts of his children’s bodies to bury.</p><p>“Four of my children just evaporated,” Badran said, holding back tears. “I looked for them a million times.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Just over two years in power, and the United Kingdom’s Labour government is facing an existential crisis.</p><p data-start=\"298\" data-end=\"861\">Disclosures linked to the Epstein files have triggered intense criticism of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s appointment of Peter Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, prompting senior resignations and fuelling speculation about Starmer’s political survival. But even if Starmer weathers the immediate political storm, a more profound challenge is looming: the steady fracturing of the political centre that has defined his leadership and electoral appeal.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">UK politics has been marked by years of churn, volatility, and repeated shocks. Yet, through that instability, the political centre largely kept control of the steering wheel – presenting itself as the only credible governing alternative and containing pressure from both flanks. That dominance reinforced the view, particularly abroad, that the UK was largely insulated from the destructive polarisation reshaping other Western democracies, most notably the US.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">Starmer is perhaps the clearest and most explicit embodiment of that centrism, having won the 2024 election on a promise of competence and restraint at a moment when the Conservative Party had lost much of its own reputation for managerial authority and “grown-up” government.</p><p data-start=\"863\" data-end=\"1675\">That centrist settlement is now beginning to fracture.</p><p data-start=\"1677\" data-end=\"2073\">The strain is now visible across multiple fronts. It is visible in polling, electoral behaviour, policy choices, and the tone of public debate. For Starmer, this creates a governing dilemma: how to hold the centre when the forces pulling away from it are becoming louder, sharper, and more confident – and when the authority of the centre itself looks increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2075\" data-end=\"2613\">On the right, Reform UK has emerged as a persistent and disruptive force. Its significance is not primarily electoral – it is unlikely to form a government – but discursive. Reform has succeeded in dragging political debate towards its framing on immigration, borders, and sovereignty. Recent defections and polling momentum have amplified its presence, forcing mainstream parties to respond to its agenda rather than define their own. Even where Reform does not win seats, it shifts the conversation, narrowing the space for moderation.</p><p data-start=\"2615\" data-end=\"3183\">Labour’s response illustrates the bind. Starmer’s leadership has been built around restoring credibility after years of Conservative turmoil: fiscal discipline, institutional stability, and reassurance to voters and markets. But this caution has its limits. Under pressure from the right, Labour has overseen tougher immigration enforcement and deportation rhetoric, moves that signal responsiveness to public anxiety but risk reinforcing Reform’s framing rather than displacing it. The centre adapts, but in doing so, it appears reactive rather than authoritative.</p><p data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3779\">Pressure from the left is no less significant. The Green Party is no longer a marginal protest movement confined to environmental activism. Its growing visibility in local elections and national debates reflects a broader appetite – particularly among younger voters – for sharper positions on climate change, civil liberties, and foreign policy. Where Labour emphasises managerial competence, the Greens speak the language of moral urgency. This contrast matters. Politics is not only about governing capacity, it is about meaning – and on that terrain, the centre increasingly looks hesitant.</p><p data-start=\"3781\" data-end=\"4215\">This tension is now being mirrored inside Labour itself. Recent internal upheaval – including the resignation of Starmer’s chief of staff amid controversy and criticism over appointments and strategy – has exposed unease within the governing project. The centre is no longer just under attack from the outside; it is being questioned from within. That internal turbulence weakens the claim that stability alone can anchor authority.</p><p data-start=\"4217\" data-end=\"4666\">Starmer’s governing style reflects this broader moment. His approach prioritises calm, caution, and predictability – virtues in a country fatigued by crisis. But managerial politics, by definition, struggles to inspire loyalty when social, economic, and geopolitical pressures feel unresolved. The more politics is framed as administration rather than direction, the more space opens for challengers on both flanks to claim clarity and conviction.</p><p data-start=\"4668\" data-end=\"5170\">This dynamic is increasingly visible in the UK’s foreign policy too. Starmer has sought to reposition the UK as a pragmatic global actor, signalling openness to engagement with China while maintaining transatlantic ties. Diplomatically, this is defensible. Domestically, it is harder to sell nuance in a fragmented political environment. Foreign policy, once buffered by elite consensus, is now pulled into domestic culture wars and moral disputes, further narrowing the centre’s room for manoeuvre.</p><p data-start=\"5172\" data-end=\"5568\">Polling reinforces the sense of drift. Surveys showing greater openness to electoral coalitions and rising support for smaller parties point to a loosening grip of the traditional centre. Voters appear less committed to inherited alignments and more willing to experiment – not necessarily out of ideological zeal, but out of frustration with a politics that feels risk-averse and unresponsive.</p><p data-start=\"5570\" data-end=\"5900\">None of this means the UK is on the brink of US-style polarisation. But it does suggest that the old assumptions underpinning centrist dominance no longer hold. The post-war consensus that once stabilised UK politics has eroded. What remains is a thinner centre that must be actively argued for, not simply occupied.</p><p data-start=\"5902\" data-end=\"6255\">The danger is gradual hollowing out rather than sudden collapse. If the centre comes to be seen as evasive, overly technocratic, or morally cautious, it risks losing legitimacy, even as it retains power. In that scenario, politics becomes less about governing choices and more about symbolic confrontation, with the centre permanently on the defensive.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\">For Starmer, the challenge is therefore not just electoral management, but narrative reconstruction. Governing from the centre can no longer mean merely avoiding extremes. It must articulate why the centre is a destination in its own right – capable of leadership, not just restraint. Whether the UK’s political centre can make that transition may determine not only the future of this government, but the shape of UK politics in the years ahead.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6711\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He introduced dozens of innovations that simplified bureaucracy and business, according to a four-star general.</p><p>“Fedorov managed to sort it out with Musk – somehow, because we couldn’t do it earlier,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukrainian armed forces, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said the shut-off “significantly lowered” the effectiveness of Russia’s drone attacks and disrupted the communication of small groups of Russian soldiers trying to infiltrate Ukrainian positions.</p><p>The effect was so devastating that it made Russian forces “howl” with despair, said Andriy Pronin, one of the pioneers of military drone use in Ukraine.</p><p>“They’re like blind kittens now,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Russian servicemen in places like the contested eastern town of Kupiansk are now “deprived of any way of getting in touch with mainland”, one of them <a href=\"https://t.me/apwagner/54919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complained</a> on Telegram on February 4.</p><p>Other servicemen and war correspondents decried the shortsightedness of Russian generals who built communications around Starlink and did not create an alternative based on Russian technologies and devices.</p><p>However, the shutdown affected Ukrainian users of Starlink that were not supplied to the Defence Ministry but were procured by civilians and charities.</p><p>“The communications were down for two days until we figured out the white list procedure,” Kyrylo, a serviceman in the northern Kharkiv region, told Al Jazeera. He withheld his last name in accordance with the wartime protocol.</p><p>The effect, however, is short-term and is unlikely to turn the tables in the conflict that is about to enter another year.</p><p>“It’s not a panacea, it’s not like we’re winning the war,” Pronin said. “It will be hard [for Russians], but they will restore their communications.”</p><p>According to Romanenko, “it’ll take them several weeks to switch to older” communication devices such as radio, wi-fi, fibre optic or mobile phone internet.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A second round of talks has been confirmed, but a date has not been announced.</p><p>IRNA reported on Tuesday that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had held a series of phone calls with his counterparts in Turkiye, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to brief them on the latest developments in the negotiations with Washington in Muscat.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tehran-condemns-israeli-influence\">Tehran condemns Israeli influence</h2><p>At a news briefing on Tuesday, Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Larijani’s visit was part of regional consultations in line with Tehran’s policy of strengthening relations with neighbouring countries, and had been planned in advance.</p><p>Regarding the negotiations with the US, Baghaei said Washington “must act independently, free from the destructive pressures being exerted that harm the region and American interests”.</p><p>He urged the US to resist Israeli pressure over the nuclear issue, saying that “one of the United States’ problems in the region is its subservience to the demands of the Zionist entity, which is the primary factor destabilising security in the region”.</p><p>Baghaei said that after the collapse of the diplomatic process last year, it was “unrealistic to expect detailed discussions in the very first meeting”.</p><p>“The Muscat meeting itself was brief, lasting about half a day, and from our perspective was mainly aimed at assessing the other side’s seriousness and exploring how the process might proceed,” he said.</p><p>The focus, he said, had been on general principles, and Iran’s “core positions” were clear – “securing the Iranian people’s interests based on international law and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy”.</p><p>He added that European countries had “missed past opportunities to play a constructive role and failed to act independently or positively in diplomatic processes, choosing instead to follow others and making serious miscalculations”.</p><p>He said recent moves by the European Union to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-slams-selective-outrage-after-eu-labels-irgc-a-terrorist-group\">designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps</a> as a terrorist organisation were “both illegal and a strategic mistake”.</p><p>“Rather than persisting in such actions and media rhetoric, they should reflect on how to restore Europe’s role in regional and international affairs,” he said.</p><p>He added that Larijani would visit Qatar after his trip to Oman.</p><h2 id=\"iran-hints-at-uranium-dilution\">Iran hints at uranium dilution</h2><p>Both sides have given mixed signals about their progress in the negotiations.</p><p>However, on Monday, Iran’s atomic energy chief <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/iran-suggests-it-could-dilute-highly-enriched-uranium-for-sanctions-relief\">Mohammad Eslami said</a> Tehran was open to diluting its highly enriched uranium if the US ends sanctions, signalling flexibility on a key US demand.</p><p>Eslami said the prospects of Iran diluting its 60 percent enriched uranium, a threshold close to weapons-grade, would hinge on “whether all sanctions would be lifted in return”, IRNA reported.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Iran to be subject to a total ban on enrichment, a condition Tehran has dubbed unacceptable.</p><p>Washington has also demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile – estimated last year by the United Nations nuclear agency at more than 440kg (970lb) – of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90 percent ⁠that is considered weapons-grade.</p><p>Araghchi, speaking to diplomats at a summit in Tehran on Sunday, had signalled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be allowed to enrich uranium.</p><p>“The Americans are now saying that they are looking for a package of comprehensive negotiations to include other controversial issues such as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/iran-says-oman-mediated-talks-with-us-a-good-start\">the ballistic missiles</a>, defence capabilities, regional activities of the country,” said Al Jazeera’s Asadi.</p><p>“Meanwhile, Tehran is saying it wants talks to be focused and concentrated around the nuclear policy, and for the knots to be untangled one by one.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"further-talks-expected\">Further talks expected</h2><p>The date of the next round of talks has yet to be announced, although Trump has said they will be held this week.</p><p>Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process stalling largely owing to disputes over uranium enrichment.</p><p>Washington then joined Israeli strikes on Iran in June, targeting the Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan nuclear facilities with bunker-buster hits.</p><p>Since those strikes, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity.</p><p>It has always maintained that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-to-meet-trump\">Netanyahu to meet Trump</h2><p>Larijani’s Oman trip comes as Benjamin Netanyahu left for the United States <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-in-us-to-discuss-iran-says-israeli-pm\">for a meeting with Trump</a> to discuss Washington’s ongoing negotiations with Iran, the Israeli prime minister’s office said on Monday.</p><p>The planned meeting will be the seventh between Trump and Netanyahu since the US president returned to office last year.</p><p>During his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu will highlight Israel’s concerns over Iran’s missile arsenal, and not just the nuclear programme, the Israeli prime minister’s office said over the weekend.</p><p>He “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”, said Netanyahu’s office, referring to Iran’s allies in the region such as Hezbollah.</p><p>Analysts have said Netanyahu will likely urge Trump to push Tehran on its ballistic missile programme, seen as a red line by Tehran.</p><p>Reporting from the White House, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said Netanyahu will likely push to appear “forceful and strong” to his domestic base in Israel in lobbying for a hardline approach to Iran in Washington, DC.</p><p>“He’ll be talking about making sure that Israel’s demands remain intact,” Halkett said. “But again, this has a lot to do with the fact that he wants to be seen doing it versus just picking up the telephone.”</p><p>The US has sought to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out, with Araghchi insisting its missile programme is “non-negotiable”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’re embedded in the state, as well, controlling contracting companies, which means other companies bidding for work have to go through them.”</p><p>The outcome has been neighbourhoods unrecognisable to the Jewish Israelis who rarely venture into territory considered dangerous and unsafe.</p><p>“They [Jewish Israelis] refer to the Palestinian nature or the Arab nature, and of course, not to the fact that the Israeli state stays at arm’s length from the [Palestinian] enclaves and they let the murders and crime just happen,” prominent Israeli sociologist Yehouda Shenhav-Shahrabani told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"toxic-crop\">Toxic crop</h2><p>At one of the most recent protests against the violence, demonstrators walked through the streets of Tel Aviv, carrying banners and photos of relatives killed.</p><p>Placards, reading “Enough violence and murder”, “No more silence”, and “Arab Lives Matter”, told of a tide of anger that even Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who had few qualms with the genocide of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/israel-accepts-gazas-70000-death-toll-a-record-of-denialism-lies\">more than 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza</a>, has accepted must be addressed.</p><p>On Tuesday, in light of the nationwide concern over the violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be preparing to name Ben-Gvir as the head of a task force addressing the issue.</p><p>Asked to describe the contrasting childhoods of two similarly aged boys, one from an Israeli Jewish town and one from a Palestinian one, Jabareen, the Adalah director, was blunt.</p><p>“One will have safety. He will go to sleep and know that he is safe. He will go to school, and he will know that he will be OK,” Jabareen said.</p><p>“The other boy will not be able to sleep for the sound of guns. He will worry about being shot accidentally on his way to school, or his bus being targeted,” he continued. “At school, he will worry about one of his classmates or teachers being shot.

Some estimates put the number of <a href=\"/gallery/2026/2/9/sydney-police-use-pepper-spray-on-protesters-during-herzog-visit\">demonstrators at 50,000</a>.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Organisers of the protest said police “pepper-sprayed” and “assaulted” rallygoers. Police said 27 people were arrested, including 10 allegedly for assault.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Abigail Boyd, an opposition Greens lawmaker in Australia’s state parliament, said she was punched by police officers at the rally and witnessed police violence against others.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“The police were just running at groups of people and sort of corralling them into an area,” Boyd told journalists.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“There was a group of people who were praying because it was evening prayer time. There was maybe 12 of them. They were praying peacefully and it was clear that the police were wanting to move them on in the middle of their prayer,” Boyd said, telling how she was punched by police officers shortly after.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“I got lifted off the ground and then you could see in the video, as I’m trying to regain my balance, another police officer punches me in the head and then I get another one after that, that punches me in the shoulder,” she said.</p><p></p><p>“I don’t understand how that is a proportionate response to anything. I was not doing the wrong thing. Nor was anybody around me. They then went in and grabbed these people who were praying. You can’t get anything more peaceful than prayer. Picking them up and just throwing them on the ground again,” she added.</p><p>“These people were just treated so, so incredibly poorly.”</p><h2 id=\"excessive-police-force\">‘Excessive police force’</h2><p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, the Australian racial justice group Democracy in Colour said it was “horrified” by the “excessive police force” used against the protesters who had gathered to express their objection to Herzog’s visit.</p><p>“What we saw last night was not ‘community safety’ – it was a violent display of state power designed to silence people protesting for human rights,” said Noura Mansour, Democracy in Colour’s national director.</p><p>“To see police turn pepper spray on peaceful protesters and assault people in the middle of prayer, is a profound violation of dignity and a direct attack” on people’s democratic rights, Mansour said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Protest organisers say the Israeli president, whom a United Nations commission of inquiry has found to be responsible for inciting genocide against Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli forces, should not be immune from protests against his visit to Australia.</p><p>Amnesty International’s Australia chapter said “welcoming President Herzog as an official guest undermines Australia’s commitment to accountability and justice. We cannot remain silent.</p><p>“President Herzog has unleashed immense suffering on Palestinians in Gaza for over two years – brazenly and with total impunity,” Amnesty added.</p><p>Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023, with support from the US, killing at least 72,032 people, including almost 600 killed after the latest ceasefire in October 2025.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301452\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301452\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301452\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260209__96NA6CV__v1__MidRes__AustraliaIsraelPalestinianConflict-1770698084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police stand in front of Pro-Palestinian protesters during a demonstration against Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit to Australia in Sydney on February 9, 2026.Police in the Australian city of Sydney deployed pepper spray and scuffled with protesters on February 9 as a march against a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog turned violent, an AFP journalist said.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301452\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police stand in front of pro-Palestinian protesters during a demonstration against Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit to Australia in Sydney, February 9, 2026 [Saeed Khan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “devastated” by the events and appealed for calm.</p><p>“Australians want two things.
