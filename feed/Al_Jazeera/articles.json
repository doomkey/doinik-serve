notably the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p><p>Although <a href=\"/news/2022/11/6/what-the-latest-ipcc-science-says-about-climate-change\">the IPCC</a> was included in the list of non-UN bodies by the White House, it is a UN organisation that brings together top scientists to assess the evidence related to climate change and provide periodic scientific assessments to help inform political leaders.</p><p>In addition, the White House said it was withdrawing from 31 UN entities, including the UN’s top climate change treaty body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Democracy Fund and the top UN entity working on maternal and child health, the UNFPA.</p><p>Several of the UN entities targeted also focused on protecting at-risk groups from violence during wars, including the UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children in Armed Conflict.</p><p>In a note to correspondents on Wednesday evening, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that the UN expected to respond to the announcement by Thursday morning.</p><p>Despite publicly claiming he wants the US to have less involvement in UN forums, Trump has not held back from influencing decision-making at the

sanctions</a> on diplomats who formally adopted a levy on polluting shipping fuels that had already been agreed to at an earlier meeting, effectively sinking the deal for 12 months.</p><p>The Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/us-sanctions-un-expert-albanese-over-israel-criticism\">imposed sanctions</a> on UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, after she published a <a

during his first administration, but the withdrawals were all later reversed by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.</p><p>The US withdrawal from the WHO is set to come into effect on January 22, 2026, one year after it was ordered by the White House.</p><p>Between 2024 and 2025, the US contributed $261m in funding to the WHO, amounting to about 18 percent of the funding the organisation receives for its work encouraging global cooperation on a wide range of pressing health issues, including <a

So until it’s clear which way this is going, and how much stability is there … the idea that the capture of Maduro will cause US oil companies to jump into Venezuela is also a myth,” Arnson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is a chance things could worsen for the Venezuelan economy before they get better, especially as it is not clear how soon – if at all – the US government will reimburse the country for its sanctioned oil.</p><p>According to Tim Hunter, senior economist for Latin America at Oxford Economics, 78 percent of the Venezuelan government’s budget is allocated to social spending.</p><p>With those finances squeezed, there could be “very quick knock-on consequences in terms of social spending, which in turn comes with a risk of social unrest”, Hunter told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Already, locals are experiencing a sharp increase in prices in some daily essentials, as Al Jazeera has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/price-hikes-queues-and-tension-venezuela-shoppers-uneasy-after-us-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, oil revenues will be key to the revival of Venezuela’s economy, said Benjamin Radd, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations.</p><p>But getting the Latin American country’s oil market ready will take massive investment in infrastructure, “so we are years away before we see any of that in Venezuela”, Radd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While Trump has pledged to “run” Venezuela and control energy sales, there has been little clarity on what that would entail.</p><p>“Trump has been very vague on this entire process,” Radd said.</p><p>A key factor is the structure of Venezuela’s government, which has been left largely in place, in contrast to the de-Ba’athification of Iraq following the US’s 2003 invasion.</p><p>“It is also not clear what is the status of the legitimacy of the current Venezuelan government, [or] what economic measures can they even undertake,” Radd said.</p><p>“There are a lot of unknowns here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That share allows the Trump administration to essentially have a veto over any major action US Steel may take to reorganise or dissolve.</p><p>Then, in August, the technology firm Intel <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/28/intel-receives-5-7bn-as-trump-administration-buys-10-percent-stake\">struck a deal to sell the US government</a> a 10-percent stake in its company, amid <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trump-calls-on-ceo-of-tech-firm-intel-to-resign-over-china-investments\">pressure</a> from Trump.</p><p>The Trump administration has continued to snap up stakes in other private firms, most notably mining companies involved in the production of rare earth minerals and other raw materials used in technology.</p><p>It is not yet clear how Trump plans to enforce his demands for the defence contractors he blasted in Wednesday’s social media messages. Nor is it certain that Trump could legally enforce his orders.</p><p>But Trump aired a list of grievances against the companies, including that their executives’ pay was simply too large.</p><p>“Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies,” he wrote at one point.</p><p>At another, he called on the private firms to invest in new construction projects, a request he has made across industries, from the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\">pharmaceutical sector</a> to <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/2/are-us-car-plants-being-built-at-record-rates-as-trump-claims\">automakers</a>.</p><p>“From this moment forward, these Executives must build NEW and MODERN Production Plants, both for delivering and maintaining this important Equipment, and for building the latest Models of future Military Equipment,” Trump said.</p><p>“Until they do so, no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.”</p><p>He also complained that the defence companies were “far too slow” in offering repairs for their equipment.</p><p>Defence contractors are responsible for a range of services and products, from software to training to missiles and tanks. RTX, for example, designed the Patriot Missile, the US’s flagship surface-to-air missile system, and it keeps the US military supplied with spare parts and other updates.</p><p>Based in Virginia, the company boasted sales exceeding $80bn in 2024. Just this week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded RTX a $438m contract to update its radar system.</p><p>Still, Trump maintained that too much of that income was going to shareholders, executive pay and stock buybacks, wherein a company purchases its own shares in order to limit their supply and increase their value.</p><p>“Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They will continue indefinitely.”</p><p>In the hours afterwards, Trump himself weighed in on how the proceeds might be spent, suggesting that Venezuela had agreed to use its funds to buy products solely from the US.</p><p>“I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115856078669121098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>“These purchases will include, among other things, American Agricultural Products, and American Made Medicines, Medical Devices, and Equipment to improve Venezuela’s Electric Grid and Energy Facilities.”</p><p>The announcement comes just days after the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-after-nicolas-maduro-seized\">abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a> on Saturday in what legal experts say was a clear violation of international law.</p><p>The US has said it plans to “run” the country and take control of its vast oil reserves, with Trump saying on social media on Tuesday that Caracas would hand between <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/7/trump-says-venezuela-to-hand-over-up-to-50-million-barrels-of-oil-to-us\">30 and 50 million barrels of oil</a> over to Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US actions against Venezuela come amid a months-long pressure campaign by the Trump administration against Maduro, who has been charged in New York with drug trafficking offences <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/5/live-venezuelas-maduro-to-appear-in-court-trump-threatens-more-strikes\">that he denies</a>.</p><p>That has included a partial US <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">naval blockade against Venezuela</a> and the seizure of several vessels that the Trump administration says were transporting oil to and from the country in violation of US sanctions.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, US special forces seized <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/us-attempting-to-seize-venezuela-linked-russian-oil-tanker-reports\">two Venezuela-linked vessels</a> – including a Russian-flagged ship in the North Atlantic – for allegedly breaching those sanctions.</p><p>The seizures came as senior US officials briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the Trump administration’s plans in Venezuela.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said most Republicans have backed Trump’s actions while Democrats have raised a slew of questions.</p><p>That includes “how long this operation in Venezuela will continue, what it will cost, [whether] any American servicemen actually be deployed on the ground in Venezuela, and what is the Venezuelan reaction,” Fisher explained.</p><p>“The Trump administration [is] hoping to get everyone on side before the end of the day,” he added.</p><p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote on social media that Wednesday’s briefing was “worse” than imagined.</p><p>“Oil company executives seem to know more about Trump’s secret plan to ‘run’ Venezuela than the American people. We need public Senate hearings NOW,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"three-phased-plan\">Three-phased plan</h2><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that the Trump administration is pursuing a three-phased plan that begins with the sales of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>“That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it’s dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio said.</p><p>The second phase would see US and other companies gain access to the Venezuelan market, and “begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally … so that opposition forces can be amnestied and released from prisons or brought back to the country”.</p><p>“And then the third phase, of course, would be one of transition,” Rubio added.</p><p>Gregory Brew, a senior analyst on Iran and energy at Eurasia Group, said the US announcement about controlling Venezuelan oil sales hints at “a return to the concessionary system” in place before the 1970s.</p><p>Brew explained in a <a href=\"https://x.com/gbrew24/status/2008925332837892550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media post</a> that, under that system, “producer states own the oil but it is Western firms that manage production and marketing, ultimately retain the bulk of the profits”.</p><p>A group of United Nations experts <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/un-experts-condemn-us-aggression-against-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also warned</a> that recent statements from Trump and other administration officials about plans to “run” Venezuela and exploit its oil reserves would violate international law.</p><p>Specifically, the experts said the US position contravenes “the right of peoples to self-determination and their associated sovereignty over natural resources, cornerstones of international human rights law”.</p><p>“Venezuela’s vast natural resources, including the largest proven oil reserves in the world, must not be cynically exploited through thinly veiled pretexts to legitimise military aggression, foreign occupation, or regime-change strategies,” they said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"political-situation-unstable\">Political situation unstable</h2><p>Renata Segura, the Latin America and Caribbean programme director at the International Crisis Group, noted Venezuelan authorities have not commented on the US saying it plans to control sales of the country’s oil.</p><p>“And so we have to assume that either [the Venezuelan authorities] have accepted these terms, or that they’re just going to be forced to accept them,” Segura told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">sworn in as president</a> earlier this week following Maduro’s abduction, stressing on Tuesday that “there is no foreign agent governing Venezuela” despite US claims to “run” the country.</p><p>Segura explained, “There’s a lot of debate within the [Venezuelan] regime itself about how to move forward” amid the US pronouncements, stressing the political situation remains far from stable.</p><p>“It’s very important what the army might do,” she said.</p><p>“The military forces in Venezuela control enormous amounts of power – both economic but also on the streets – and there might be a moment in which they think they’re not going to be on board with this particular arrangement that the United States is presenting.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And we’re actually seeing it play out in real time,” Vance said.</p><p>“The way that we control Venezuela is we control the purse strings, we control the energy resources, and we tell the regime, ‘You’re allowed to sell the oil, so long as you serve America’s national interest.'”</p><p>But the question of who is in charge in Venezuela remains a volatile one.</p><p>Before dawn on Saturday, the Trump administration launched a military offensive in Venezuela to capture and remove President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, describing the couple’s abduction as a law enforcement operation.</p><p>Maduro and Flores have since been transported to New York City, where they face charges that they oversaw the shipment of “tons of cocaine into the United States”.</p><p>In the hours immediately after the attack, it was unclear whether the Trump administration would seek to expel the remnants of the Maduro government.</p><p>Trump delivered a news conference from his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, claiming that the country was under US control.</p><p>“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said from his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p><p>“We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rodriguez-maintains-no-foreign-agent-in-charge\">Rodriguez maintains ‘no foreign agent’ in charge</h2><p>Since then, however, the Trump administration has signalled it would prioritise stability in Venezuela over quickly installing new leadership. It has declined to set a timeline for new elections.</p><p>“ It’s too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now,” Leavitt said on Wednesday.</p><p>Earlier this week, Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, was officially sworn in as Venezuela’s interim leader, and the Trump administration has indicated it would work with her as it pursues the extraction and sale of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Still, Rodriguez’s government and the Trump administration have described their relationship in starkly different terms.</p><p>According to the Trump White House, Rodriguez is answerable to US demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.</p><p>On Wednesday, Leavitt echoed that position, saying that the US would wield influence over Venezuela’s decisions.</p><p>“We obviously have maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela right now,” she said.</p><p>Already, in a Tuesday night <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115850817778602689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on Truth Social, Trump announced that Venezuela would be surrendering 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, so that the US could sell it on the international market.</p><p>“That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,” Trump wrote.</p><p>The Rodriguez government, meanwhile, has repeatedly denied that the US is puppeteering its decisions.</p><p>Though Rodriguez has, at times, struck a conciliatory posture towards the Trump administration, she has rejected the idea that foreign powers are leading the country.</p><p>“We are here governing together with the people,” Rodriguez said in remarks broadcast on state television.</p><p>“The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no one else. There is no foreign agent governing Venezuela.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-continuation-of-maduro-era-policies\">A continuation of Maduro-era policies?</h2><p>Like Maduro before her, Rodriguez is part of a political movement founded by the late socialist President Hugo Chavez, known as “chavismo”.</p><p>As a “chavista”, Rodriguez has spoken out against US imperialism in Latin America, and she denounced the recent abduction of Maduro — Chavez’s handpicked successor — and his wife as an unwarranted “kidnapping” and a “brutal attack”.</p><p>Chavez is also seen as a key figure in the nationalisation of Venezuelan oil, expanding state control over the country’s rich petroleum reserves during his time as president.</p><p>Trump and his officials have called such efforts, including the 2007 expropriation of foreign oil assets, as an act of theft against the US.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration has described Rodriguez’s government as cooperative so far.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether behind-the-scenes demands — including reports that Trump has asked Rodriguez to sever ties with key allies, including Russia, China, Cuba and Iran — will lead to public discord.</p><p>“The president has made it very clear that this is a country within the Western Hemisphere, close by the United States, that is no longer going to be sending illegal drugs to the United States of America,” Leavitt said.</p><p>“The president is fully deploying his ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy agenda.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Rodriguez government has continued Maduro’s campaign of stifling internal dissent, according to human rights monitors.</p><p>As part of an emergency declaration, the interim president authorised Venezuelan law enforcement to detain those who supported Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>The nonprofit Foro Penal has reported that, on January 5, in the wake of the US attacks, Venezuelan authorities arrested 14 journalists, all of whom were eventually released. One was deported.</p><p>Another human rights group, Caleidoscopio Humano, has announced that two elderly men from the state of Merida were also arrested for celebrating Maduro’s capture by firing guns into the air.</p><p>The international community has long denounced the human rights abuses in Venezuela. But the US has also faced broad criticism for its attack to remove Maduro, which has been denounced as a violation of sovereignty.</p><p>On Wednesday, a group of United Nations experts <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/un-experts-condemn-us-aggression-against-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> that Trump’s actions constitute an “international crime of aggression”.</p><p>“These actions represent a grave, manifest and deliberate violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, set a dangerous precedent, and risk destabilising the entire region and the world,” they wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Three other protesters, all reported to be teenagers, were injured in the incident. Israeli media reports say the bus driver had previously been attacked by demonstrators before driving into the crowd.</p><p>Netanyahu issued a statement on Wednesday morning, pledging that the incident would be thoroughly investigated and urging “restraint to prevent the mood from becoming further inflamed so that, heaven forbid, we do not have additional tragedies”.</p><p></p><p>Anger over the exemption of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox students dates back to early attempts in 1999 to formalise what had previously been a de facto arrangement, with Haredi leaders arguing that young men should be allowed to focus on full-time religious study to preserve Jewish law and tradition, rather than be conscripted to join the army, as other Israeli Jews are.</p><p>However, legal challenges to the exemption, most recently from the Supreme Court late last year demanding that Haredi recruitment be enforced, combined with reports of manpower shortages linked to Israel’s military conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight.</p><p>Polls show broad public support for the ending of the exemption, a notion publicly backed by Netanyahu. But two of the prime minister’s key coalition partners, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and Shas, have repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the government or vote against the state budget, triggering new elections, unless legislation is passed preserving Haredi exemptions or limiting conscription for students at Israel’s ultra-Orthodox schools, known as yeshivas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“You need to remember, these aren’t political parties in the conventional sense,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said, characterising UTJ and Shas as operating to the benefit of their community and not wider society. “They are elected as parties to operate as pressure groups inside the Knesset [parliament]. They know that no one outside of their own ultra-Orthodox community will vote for them, and they really have no interest in persuading them to do so.”</p><p>“All they have is their own religious base, with a proportion in society that is constantly increasing,” added Mekelberg. “Preserving that base, for the large part, is about keeping them out of the army where they might encounter different types of approaches to religion, including secularism, which their rabbis are afraid would tempt and corrupt them.”</p><h2 id=\"bitter-debate\">Bitter debate</h2><p>Despite the limited deaths, the Israeli army has incurred compared to the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed during its genocidal war on Gaza, anger over the Haredi communities’ apparent exemption from the draft has grown among a society <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/two-years-into-its-war-on-gaza-israel-is-fractured-isolated-analysts\">fractured</a> from two years of unrelenting conflict.</p><p>An autumn poll last year showed an overwhelming number of Israeli respondents saw the societal schism between secular and ultra-Orthodox Israelis as one of the most divisive issues facing contemporary Israel.</p><p>Responding to the death of Eisenthal, UTJ’s Meir Porush told reporters, “It is impossible to ignore the fact that more than once during demonstrations by the ultra-Orthodox public, there is a public atmosphere that it is permissible to harm the demonstrators.”</p><p>“The situation in which incitement is rampant against the ultra-Orthodox public is causing Jews to fear for their safety in the Land of Israel,” Porush continued. “I call on all public leaders to call for an end to the harm and incitement against the ultra-Orthodox public.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-22T172528Z_145204992_RC25HHAT7N13_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-CONSCRIPTION-PROTEST-1765889244.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An Israeli police officer pulls an ultra-Orthodox Jew during a protest.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police clash with ultra-orthodox protesters during a previous protest over compulsory enlistment in West Jerusalem [Ammar Awad/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>“There’s very little sympathy for the ultra-Orthodox among much of Israeli society,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst, said. “They’ve gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the rest of the population, so most people don’t really care … Israeli society is broken.”</p><h2 id=\"divisive\">Divisive</h2><p>From Israel’s creation in 1948, a handful of highly skilled ultra-Orthodox scholars were granted exemptions from Israel’s mandatory military service, which applies to most Jewish citizens. However, over the years, the influence of influential religious parties, such as Shas and UTJ, has led to a significant increase in the number of military exemptions, currently estimated at about 90 percent of the <a href=\"/features/2024/7/21/who-are-israels-ultra-orthodox-and-will-conscripting-them-sow-discord\">13,000 ultra-Orthodox</a> men who reach conscription age each year.</p><p>While Shas and UTJ only hold 18 seats in the parliament, the fractured nature of Israeli politics and Netanyahu’s reliance upon the right have given the ultra-Orthodox a disproportionate level of influence.</p><p>“It’s true that they don’t have many seats, but Netanyahu absolutely needs their support to maintain his coalition and remain prime minister,” Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. “It’s true that the ultra-Orthodox parties also need Netanyahu and his government to have any power and relevance in their own communities. But the draft issue is everything. To them, if they lose this: they have nothing.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3898351\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3898351\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250819__69XX4R6__v2__HighRes__TopshotIsraelPoliticsMilitaryReligion-1755640109.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man stands in front of a burning fire during a protest against Israeli army conscription in Kfar Yona [John Wessels/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"increasing-influence\">Increasing influence</h2><p>Across Israel, the Haredi are a growing social and political constituency, with both their political heft and the influence of religion across society increasing as their numbers do.</p><p>In 2009, the Haredi made up 9.9 percent of Israel’s population. By 2065, they are forecast to make up more than 30 percent. Alongside this growth, ultra-Orthodox parties are making sure their members’ interests are served and that they remain loyal: all of which could spell problems for Israel’s future.</p><p>“Parties like Shas and UTJ rely on keeping its younger members religious and reliant upon benefits,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>“This is a serious problem, because their numbers are growing,” he added. “An ultra-Orthodox family will typically have six to seven children. It’s unlikely that any of the boys will ever study core subjects like maths or science. Instead, they’ll go to the yeshiva and live off benefits. This is a real demographic problem. And this isn’t a future problem. It’s one that’s happening now.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being,” Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the newspaper.</p><p>Following the shooting, protesters quickly gathered at the scene, shouting, “Shame! Shame! Shame,” and “ICE out of Minnesota!”</p><p>Some were met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical munitions at the demonstrators.</p><p>Snap protests were also organised in other cities and towns across the United States on Wednesday evening as the Trump-administration claimed that the agent who allegedly shot Good was acting in “self-defence”.</p><p>“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bulls***,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a fiery news conference.</p><p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz also decried the shooting as “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable”. He urged anyone participating in protests to remain peaceful, adding he had put the state’s National Guard on alert.</p><p>“I feel your anger,” he told Minnesotans at a separate news conference.</p><p>The shooting took place in a modest neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area.</p><p>Notably, the area was just 1.6km (one mile) from where <a href=\"/news/2020/6/3/what-happened-the-day-george-floyd-died-in-police-custody\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by policeman Derek Chauvin in May 2020, sparking mass Black Lives Matter protests during Trump’s first presidency.</p><h2 id=\"defensive-shots\">‘Defensive Shots’</h2><p>Authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), are investigating the shooting, which took place after agents on foot surrounded a car on a snow-lined street, according to video shared online of the incident.</p><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed that Good was targeting agents when she was killed, alleging she had “weaponised” ⁠her vehicle.</p><p>“An ICE officer, fearing for ​his ‌life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and ‌the safety of ‌the public, ⁠fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin wrote in a post ‌on the social media platform X, calling the incident an “act of domestic terrorism”.</p><p>After the gunfire, Good’s SUV could be seen with a bullet hole through its windshield and blood splattered ‌across the headrest.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the woman killed was a “professional agitator”. He broadly blamed the situation on the “radical left”, an amorphous label he regularly applies to critics of his policies.</p><p>But a witness at the scene said that Good had been trying to leave when she was shot.</p><p>Emily Heller, who said the incident unfolded near her home, told Minnesota Public Radio that she heard ICE agents tell the driver, “Get out of here.”</p><p>“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like, his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller said.</p><p>Venus de Mars, 65, who also lives nearby, described watching paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car. Shortly ‌after, they loaded her into an ambulance and drove away without their sirens on.</p><p>“There’s been lots of ICE activity, but nothing like this,” de Mars said. “I’m so angry. I’m so angry, and I feel helpless.”</p><p>Congresswoman Ilhan Omar accused the Trump administration of spreading false information.</p><p>“You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt,” she wrote on X. “Get out of our city,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"deadly-immigration-crackdown\">Deadly immigration crackdown</h2><p>The midwestern cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, known as the Twin Cities, are the latest to be targeted in immigration raids under the second Trump administration, which have seen thousands of people detained and violent confrontations between immigration agents and protesters.</p><p>The city is home to thousands of Somali Americans, who have become the recent target of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration rhetoric, including over allegations that some members of the community misused <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/white-house-looking-at-denaturalising-somali-americans-for-alleged-fraud\">federal subsidies</a> for low-income childcare.</p><p>At a December cabinet meeting, Trump called Somali residents “garbage” and said, “ I don’t want them in our country” as his administration withdrew millions of dollars in funding for the childcare in the city.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4222662\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4222662\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4222662\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695ead747ee3-1767812468.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA - JANUARY 07: An onlooker holds a sign that reads \"Shame\" as members of law enforcement work the scene following a suspected shooting by an ICE agent during federal law enforcement operations on January 07, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The board of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) has unanimously turned down Paramount Skydance’s latest attempt to acquire the studio, saying its revised $108.4bn hostile bid amounted to a risky leveraged buyout that investors should reject.</p><p>In a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the WBD board said <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/17/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-takeover-bid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paramount’s offer </a>hinges on “an extraordinary amount of debt financing” that heightens the risk of closing. It reaffirmed its commitment to streaming giant Netflix’s $82.7bn deal for the film and television studio and other assets.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Some investors, however, pushed back on Warner Bros. Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said that the media giant’s board had “made an error” by not considering Paramount’s bid.</p><p>On CNBC on Wednesday, Halbower called the deal “economically superior”.</p><p>Paramount’s financing plan would saddle the smaller Hollywood studio with $87bn in debt once the acquisition closes, making it the largest leveraged buyout in history, the Warner Bros board told shareholders after voting against the $30-per-share cash offer on Tuesday. The letter accompanied a 67-page amended merger filing that laid out its case for rejecting Paramount’s offer.</p><h2 id=\"paramount-deal-remains-inadequate\">Paramount deal ‘remains inadequate’</h2><p>The revised Paramount offer “remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in Paramount Skydance ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should Paramount Skydance fail to complete the offer”, the Warner Bros board wrote.</p><p>Paramount, which has a market value of about $14bn, proposed to use $40bn in equity, which would be personally guaranteed by Oracle’s billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David is Paramount’s CEO, and $54bn in debt to finance the deal.</p><p>Its financing plan would further weaken its credit rating, which S&amp;P Global already rates at junk levels, and strain its cash flow – heightening the risk that the deal will not close, the Warner Bros board said. Netflix, which has offered $27.75 a share in cash and stock, has a $400bn market value and investment-grade credit rating.</p><p>The decision keeps Warner Bros on track to pursue the deal with Netflix, even after Paramount amended its bid on December 22 to address the earlier concerns about the lack of a personal guarantee from Ellison, who is Paramount’s controlling shareholder.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount and Netflix have been vying to win control of Warner Bros, and with it, its prized film and television studios and its extensive content library. Its lucrative entertainment franchises include  Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, and the DC Comics universe; as well as coveted classic films such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-applauds\">Netflix applauds</h2><p>Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters welcomed Warner Bros’ decision on Wednesday, saying it recognises the streaming giant’s deal “as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry”.</p><p>Warner Bros Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC that the company was not currently in talks with Paramount but remains open to a transaction with the Ellison-led firm, and both the deals have a path to regulatory approval.</p><p>“From our perspective, they’ve got to put something on the table that is compelling,” he said, referring to the Paramount offer.</p><p>Wednesday’s filing said Warner Bros’ board met on December 23 to review Paramount’s amended offer and noted some improvements, including Ellison’s personal guarantee and a higher reverse termination fee of $5.8bn, but found “significant costs” associated with Paramount’s bid compared with a Netflix deal.</p><p>Warner Bros would be obligated to pay the streaming service a $2.8bn termination fee for abandoning its merger agreement with Netflix, $1.5bn in fees to its lenders and about $350m in additional financing costs. Altogether, Warner Bros said it would incur about $4.7bn in additional costs to terminate its deal with Netflix, or $1.79 per share.</p><p>The board repeated some concerns it had laid out on December 17, such as that Paramount would impose operating restrictions on the studio that would harm its business and competitive position, including barring the planned spin-out of the company’s cable television networks into a separate public company, Discovery Global.</p><p>Paramount offered “insufficient compensation” for the damage done to the studio’s business, if the Paramount deal failed to close, Warner Bros said.</p><p>Paramount “repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal” to Warner Bros shareholders, the board wrote, “despite clear direction” on the deficiencies in its bid and potential solutions.</p><p>The jockeying for Warner Bros has become Hollywood’s most closely watched takeover battle, as studios race to scale up amid intensifying competition from streaming platforms and volatile theatrical revenues.</p><p>While Netflix’s offer has a lower headline value, analysts have said it presents a clearer financing structure and fewer execution risks than Paramount’s bid for the entire company, including its cable TV business.</p><p>“WBD does not want to sell to Paramount, so it will keep rejecting Paramount as long as it is able to,” said Ross Benes, an analyst at eMarketer.</p><p>“But this process is not over … Paramount will have opportunity to make further attempts.”</p><p>Harris Oakmark, Warner Bros’ fifth-largest investor, previously told Reuters that Paramount’s revised offer was not “sufficient”, noting it was not enough to cover the breakup fee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount has argued its bid would face fewer regulatory obstacles, but a combined Paramount-Warner Bros entity would create a formidable competitor to industry leader Disney and merge two major television operators and two streaming services.</p><p>The valuation of Warner Bros’ planned Discovery Global spin-off, which includes cable television networks CNN, TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service, is seen as a major sticking point. Analysts peg the cable channels’ value at up to $4 per share, while Paramount has suggested just $1.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about further consolidation in the media industry, and US President Donald Trump has said he plans to <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weigh in</a> on the landmark acquisition.</p><p>On Wall Street, Warner Bros Discovery is up 0.3 percent in midday trading amid the news of the rejected bid. Netflix is also up 0.3. Meanwhile, Paramount is down 0.1 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"
