I remember a family gathering when every girl my age was asked where she planned to study – in Gaza, they meant, naming local universities as if the question had no other geography.</p><p>When it was my turn, I blurted: “Study in Gaza? I’m going abroad. I’ll be a journalist like my father.”</p><p>Some people encouraged me. Others laughed. But I already felt the world outside calling.</p><p>When I left Gaza in 2019 at 17 to study international relations, it was the first time I flew on my own, and because I was under 18, I carried a court document permitting me to travel alone.</p><p>At the Rafah crossing, I stood between my father and older brother, Omar, memorising their faces.</p><p>Once I crossed into Egypt, long hours of waiting rooms and security checks began, the quiet panic of not knowing whether my name would be called to go through or be sent back.</p><p>Cairo Airport, then Istanbul, and finally Cyprus – each stop a threshold I had to pass.</p><p>At every airport, I was pulled aside for extra searches because of my black passport. Officers asked why I was travelling alone, where I was going, what I planned to study – ordinary questions to them that felt like tests I had to pass to earn a life outside the only world I knew.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4201040\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4201040\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4201040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6187-copy-1766987159.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Young woman in cap and gown on a football pitch\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4201040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Asil Ziara on the beach in Gaza in 2010 [Courtesy of Asil Ziara]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"you-re-not-in-gaza-anymore\">‘You’re not in Gaza anymore’</h2><p>My first night in Cyprus, I slept more deeply than I ever had in my life.</p><p>When I woke to a loud sound, my body panicked, as if it were an explosion. I ran into the corridor only to find suitcase wheels dragging across the floor.</p><p>Then my mind caught up with my body: You’re not in Gaza anymore.</p><p>That morning, I wandered the dorms looking for a mini market. Someone told me it was in the basement, but I got lost in the corridors, trying to buy an adapter and some toast.</p><p>Everything felt unfamiliar – especially the silence.</p><p>Nothing hummed, nothing hovered, nothing threatened. The stillness almost frightened me.</p><p>My first real conversations were at the English prep course at the university. It was a small classroom that felt like a tiny world: Classmates from Cyprus, Turkiye, Lebanon, Morocco, Libya.</p><p>We traded words and accents, and my teacher loved how quickly I learned new vocabulary.</p><p>When I told people I am from Palestine, some heard “Pakistan”, or pointed vaguely at their maps; I showed them pictures, then places.</p><p>In classes, some asked whether we “actually had a life” there. One person asked, sincerely, if Gaza existed. The confusion wasn’t malicious; it was a vacuum in the world’s imagination where my home is.</p><p>Once, in a market, I helped an elderly man find a carton of milk. After thanking me, he introduced himself, mentioning he was Israeli. My chest tightened. I told him my name anyway.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"carrying-gaza-in-exile\">Carrying Gaza in exile</h2><p>Within my first year, Gaza began to feel far away, like a vivid dream I had woken from too quickly.</p><p>Every street I learned, every bus route, every ordinary morning added a layer of distance. That lasted for years – until October 7, 2023, when the dream ended, and the distance collapsed.</p><p>During the war, I worked remotely with my father, a journalist in Gaza – translating, monitoring, waiting for his messages to know he was still alive.</p><p>Fear found me; I shut myself in a room for months, terrified to sleep.</p><p>When I finally slept after weeks, I woke to the news that my cousin Ahmed had been killed.</p><p>Ahmed was in his 30s, and everyone used to call him Saddam because he was born on the day Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles on Israel.</p><p>He used to call me “ya koshieh”, a teasing nickname that meant “dark-skinned one” – a silly, small joke that somehow felt like protection.</p><p>The guilt over his death was immediate and irrational, as if my wakefulness could have kept him alive.</p><p>We lost more family: my uncle Iyad and his only daughter, and my uncle Nael and his wife, Salwa. Israel erased an entire branch of our family in a night.</p><p>I began to understand how much of Gaza I had carried into exile.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4201042\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4201042\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4201042\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9615-copy-1766987163.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Young woman in cap and gown on a football pitch\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4201042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Asil Ziara on her graduation day, July 12, 2023, in Cyprus [Courtesy of Asil Ziara]</figcaption></figure><p>I started therapy in Cyprus: talk sessions, then trauma-focused work once I got a diagnosis – post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.</p><p>I’m steadier now, but I don’t think trauma ever fully ends – not for people from Gaza. It shifts, softens, resurfaces. The work is not to “get over it”, but to learn how to live while it continues.</p><p>I often say I was born in Palestine, but shaped in Cyprus. Gaza gave me awareness; exile gave me the language to understand it.</p><p>Egypt, and later Oman, added new layers to the same unanswered question: How do you carry a home that keeps breaking?</p><p>Maybe this is why, over the past two years, I’ve worked and planned to rebuild my life, to pursue a master’s degree in diplomacy.</p><p>I want to try to understand the world whose decisions shaped my childhood, the power structures that determined so much of my story.</p><p>When people hear “Gaza,” they often think “destruction”.</p><p>The people of Gaza are like anyone else – except their struggle is multiplied by forces beyond their control.</p><p>My story is one of millions. But I hope it makes someone somewhere feel that Gaza is more than a headline.</p><p>Gaza is people.</p><p>And people deserve to live.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Chinese President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart, Donald Trump, in November that Taiwan’s “return to China” after World War II was central to Beijing’s vision of the global order.</p><p>Taiwan rejects China’s claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island’s future.</p><p>In an interview broadcast on Sunday, <a href=\"/news/2024/1/14/who-is-taiwans-president-elect-lai-ching-te\">Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te</a> told Sanli E-Television that the island must continue to raise the cost of aggression and strengthen its indigenous defence capabilities to deter China, stressing that peace can only be secured through strength.</p><p>“If China sets 2027 as the year to be ready for an invasion of Taiwan, then we have only one choice: to keep raising the difficulty so that China can never meet that standard. Taiwan will naturally remain safe,” Lai said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.</li>\n<li>The two leaders did not offer further details or a deadline for completing the deal, but Zelenskyy said any peace agreement would have to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament or by a referendum.</li>\n<li>Shortly after the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, wrote on X that the “whole world appreciates” Trump and his team’s peace efforts.</li>\n<li>Ahead of the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin spoke for more than two hours on the telephone. The US president described the call as “excellent” and “productive”.</li>\n<li>Trump said he would call Putin again after the meeting with Zelenskyy.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the initial call was “friendly” and that Putin had told Trump that a 60-day ceasefire, proposed by the European Union and Ukraine, would simply prolong the war.</li>\n<li>Ushakov said that a “bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv” on the Donbas region and other disputed matters for there to be a “complete cessation” of hostilities.</li>\n<li>European leaders, including those from Finland, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom, joined at least part of the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting by phone.</li>\n<li>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that Europe was ready to keep working with Ukraine and the US, and that having ironclad security guarantees would be of “paramount” importance.</li>\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron said that progress had been made on security guarantees at the meeting. Macron said that countries in the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” would meet in Paris in early January to finalise their “concrete contributions”.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said that Trump had agreed to host European leaders again, possibly at the White House, sometime in January. Trump said the meeting could be in Washington, DC, or “someplace”.</li>\n<li>Earlier on Sunday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov warned that any European troop contingents deployed to Ukraine would become legitimate targets for Russia’s forces. Lavrov also accused European politicians of being driven by “ambitions” in their relations with Kyiv, and disregarding the people of Ukraine and of their own nations.</li>\n</ul><h3>Fighting</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces attacked a heating plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, wounding one person and causing “significant damage” to the facility, state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s leading private energy provider, DTEK, said it had restored power to more than a million households in and around Kyiv a day after a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/russia-hammers-ukraines-capital-ahead-of-trump-zelenskyy-meeting\">massive Russian air attack</a> had forced emergency outages.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military said it had struck the Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region in a drone attack. The strike caused a fire, and damages were still being assessed, the army said in a statement.</li>\n<li>The military also said that only part of the southeastern town of Huliaipole was under Russian control, contradicting an earlier claim by Moscow that it had been captured. It added that fighting was also still under way for Stepnohirsk, another town in the southeastern Zaporizhia region that Russia claimed it had captured.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement that its troops had taken control of four other settlements in the Donetsk region. It identified them as Myrnohrad, Artemivka, Rodynske and Vilne.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Certainly, that’s one of the big issues, and… it’s unresolved,” Trump said.</p><p>Zelenskyy reiterated his position that the issue of territory should be decided by the people of Ukraine and said that different aspects of the peace plan could be put to the public in referendums.</p><p>“Of course, our society has to choose… because it’s their land… not of one person. It’s the land of our nation, for a lot of generations,” he said.</p><p>After their talks, Trump and Zelenskyy held a joint phone call with key European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Trump has been trying to end Russia’s nearly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/will-the-russia-ukraine-war-end-in-2026\">four-year war in Ukraine</a> since returning to the White House in January.</p><p>He has variously shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin, while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of resolving the conflict.</p><p>Before his meeting with Zelenskyy on Sunday, Trump said that Moscow and Kyiv were in the “final stages of talking” and had the “makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, good for everybody”.</p><p>Russia <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/russia-hammers-ukraines-capital-ahead-of-trump-zelenskyy-meeting\">intensified its attacks</a> on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, in the days before the Florida meeting.</p><p>During talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators in Berlin earlier this month, the Trump administration agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO.</p><p>The proposal came after Zelenskyy said he could agree to no longer seek membership of the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like guarantees to protect the country from Russian attacks.</p><p>Oleksandr Kraiev, an analyst with the think tank Ukrainian Prism, said that the people of Ukraine were “quite cynical” about the US-brokered talks.</p><p>“We tried this in 2015, 2016, 2017, and unfortunately, each time, the Russians broke even the ceasefire regime, not even talking about the peace process,” Kraiev told Al Jazeera, referring to previous accords such as the 2015 Minsk II Agreement, which aimed to end the war in Donbas between Ukraine’s army and pro-Russian separatists.</p><p>“So, we have little faith that a proper peace process will take place. As of now, we’re striving for a ceasefire as a precondition for any kind of talks… We cannot trust the Russians with a peace deal, but a ceasefire is something we’re working on.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"blindsided-yet-again\">‘Blindsided yet again’</h2><p>Trump’s optimistic tone comes despite widespread scepticism in Europe about Putin’s intentions after Russia carried out heavy bombardment of Kyiv just as Zelenskyy headed to Florida.</p><p>Before Zelenskyy arrived, Trump spoke with Putin by phone for more than an hour and said he planned to speak with him again after the Zelenskyy meeting, catching Ukrainian leaders off guard, according to Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi.</p><p>“From what we’re hearing, the Zelenskyy delegation here have been blindsided yet again by Donald Trump. And according to the Russians, it was at the Americans’ insistence [that] there should be a call with Vladimir Putin the hour before Zelenskyy arrived,” said Rattansi, speaking from Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call with Putin as “very good” and “productive”.</p><p>The Kremlin offered a more pointed account in its readout of the call, saying that Trump agreed that a ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict” as it demanded Ukraine make concessions on territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland if Russia also pulled back and the area became a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/ukraine-accepts-demilitarised-zone-to-end-russia-war-but-do-dmzs-work\">demilitarised zone</a> monitored by international forces.</p><p>Putin has stated that all areas in four key regions captured by his forces – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, should be recognised as Russian territory. The Russian leader has also demanded that Ukraine withdraw from parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces have not occupied.</p><p>Kyiv has publicly rejected those demands.</p><p>Trump has appeared sympathetic to some of Putin’s demands, arguing that the Russian president could be persuaded to end the fighting if Kyiv gives up Ukrainian land in the Donbas region, and if Western countries welcome Russia back into the global economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

And increasingly, that fact alone is treated as a provocation.</p><p>In recent months, I have watched anti-Semitism — a real, lethal form of hatred with a long and horrific history — be stripped of its meaning and weaponised to silence Palestinians, criminalise solidarity with us, and shield Israel from accountability as it carries out a genocide in Gaza. This is not about protecting Jewish people. It is about protecting power.</p><p>The pattern is now impossible to ignore.</p><p>A children’s educator, Ms Rachel, whose entire public work is built around care, learning, and empathy, is branded “Anti-Semite of the Year” — not for her engaging in any form of hate speech, but for expressing concern for Palestinian children. For acknowledging that children in Gaza are being bombed, starved, and traumatised. For expressing compassion.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I hear the message clearly: even empathy for our children is dangerous.</p><p>Then there is Palestine Action, a protest movement that targets weapons manufacturers supplying Israel’s military. Instead of being debated, challenged, or even criticised within a democratic framework, it is proscribed as a “terrorist” organisation, casually equated with ISIL (ISIS) – a group responsible for mass executions, sexual slavery, and genocidal violence.</p><p>This comparison is not just obscene. It is deliberate. It collapses the meaning of “terrorism” so completely that political dissent becomes extremism by definition. Resistance becomes pathology. Protest becomes “terror”. And Palestinians, once again, are framed not as a people under occupation, but as a permanent threat.</p><p>Language itself is now being criminalised. Phrases like “globalise the Intifada” are banned without any serious engagement with history or meaning. Intifada — a word that literally means “shaking off” — is torn from its political context as an uprising against military occupation and reduced to a slur. Palestinians are denied even the right to name their resistance.</p><p>At the same time, international law is being actively dismantled.</p><p>Staff and judges at the International Criminal Court are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">sanctioned</a> and intimidated for daring to investigate Israeli war crimes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on Palestine, has not only been sanctioned, but also relentlessly smeared — because she uses the language of international law to describe occupation, apartheid, and genocide.</p><p>When international law is applied to African leaders, it is celebrated.<br>\nWhen it is applied to Israel, it is treated as an act of hostility.</p><p>This brings us to Australia — and to one of the most revealing moments of all.</p><p>After the horrific Bondi Beach attack, which shocked and horrified people across Australia, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Australian government of encouraging anti-Semitism. Not because of any incitement, not because of inflammatory rhetoric — but because Australia had moved towards recognising Palestine as a state.</p><p>Read that again.</p><p>The diplomatic recognition of Palestinian statehood — long framed as essential to peace and grounded in international law — is presented as a moral failing, even as a contributor to anti-Semitic violence. Palestinian existence itself is treated as the problem.</p><p>What makes this moment so disturbing is not only that Netanyahu made this claim, but that so many centres of power ran with it rather than challenged it.</p><p>Instead of forcefully rejecting the idea that recognising Palestinian rights could “encourage anti-Semitism”, governments, institutions, and commentators allowed the premise to stand. Some echoed it outright. Others stayed silent. Almost none confronted the dangerous logic at its core: that Palestinian political recognition is inherently destabilising, provocative, or threatening.</p><p>This is how moral collapse happens — not with thunder, but with acquiescence.</p><p>The result is not safety for the Jewish people, but erasure of the Palestinian people.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I find it devastating.</p><p>It means my identity is not merely contested — it is criminalised. My grief is not simply ignored — it is politicised. My demand for justice is not debated — it is pathologised as hatred.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is real. It must be confronted seriously and without hesitation. The Jewish people deserve safety, dignity, and protection — everywhere. But when anti-Semitism is stretched to include children’s educators, UN experts, international judges, protest movements, chants, words, and even the diplomatic recognition of Palestine, then the term no longer serves to protect Jewish people.</p><p>It protects a state from accountability.</p><p>Worse still, this weaponisation endangers Jews by collapsing Jewish identity into the actions of a government committing mass atrocities. It tells the world that Israel speaks for all Jews — and that anyone who objects must therefore be hostile to Jews themselves. That is not protection. It is recklessness masquerading as morality.</p><p>For Palestinians like me, the psychological toll is immense.</p><p>I am tired of having to preface every sentence with disclaimers.</p><p>I am deeply pained by watching my people starve while being lectured about tone.</p><p>I am angry that international law seems to apply only in certain politically convenient cases.</p><p>And I am grieving — not just for Gaza, but for the moral collapse unfolding around it.</p><p>Opposing genocide is not anti-Semitism.</p><p>Solidarity is not “terrorism”.</p><p>Recognising Palestine is not incitement.</p><p>Naming your suffering is not violence.</p><p>If the world insists on calling me an anti-Semite for refusing to accept the annihilation of my people, then it is not anti-Semitism that is being countered.</p><p>It is genocide that is being justified.</p><p>And history will remember who helped make that possible.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied <a href=\"/news/2022/3/25/three-years-on-us-still-views-syrias-golan-as-israeli-territory\">Golan Heights</a> and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).</p><p>Since returning to the White House this year, Trump has shown a greater willingness to publicly disagree with Netanyahu. Still, his administration has provided unflinching support for Israel, including the decision to renew the genocidal war on Gaza in March after a brief ceasefire.</p><p>Trump joined the Israeli attack on Iran in June to the dismay of some segments of his base. And he pushed to secure the current truce in Gaza.</p><p>The US president also opposed the Israeli <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/9/13/how-will-israels-attack-on-doha-affect-the-us-and-gulf-states\">attack on Doha</a> in September. And he swiftly lifted sanctions against Syria despite some apparent Israeli reservations.</p><p>The ties between the two leaders have seen some peaks and valleys. In 2020, Trump was irked when Netanyahu rushed to congratulate Joe Biden on his election victory against Trump, who has falsely insisted the election was fraudulent.</p><p>“I haven’t spoken to him [Netanyahu] since,” Trump told the Axios news site in 2021. “F*** him.”</p><p>The strong ties between the two leaders were rekindled after Trump won the presidency again in 2024 and unleashed a crackdown on Palestinian rights activists in the US.</p><p>In November, Trump formally asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/trump-formally-asks-israeli-president-to-pardon-netanyahu-after-gaza-truce\">pardon Netanyahu</a>, who is facing corruption charges at home.</p><p>The two leaders, however, are not in complete alignment, and cracks in their positions are showing up over issues that include Gaza, Syria and the US partnerships with Turkiye and the Gulf states.</p><p>During his US visit, Netanyahu may seek to flatter Trump and project a warm relationship with the US president to advance his agenda and signal to his political rivals in Israel that he still enjoys support from Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-netanyahu-dealt-with-the-us-since-october-7-2023\">How has Netanyahu dealt with the US since October 7, 2023?</h2><p>Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has asked for unchecked US diplomatic and military support.</p><p>Then-President Biden travelled to Israel 11 days after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, and he declared that support for the US ally is “vital for America’s national security”.</p><p>His “bear hug” of Netanyahu on arrival at the airport in Tel Aviv would set the stage for the US backing of Israel as it unleashed horror and destruction on Gaza, which has translated into more than $21bn in military aid and multiple vetoes at the UN Security Council over the past two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has seized on the notion that Israel is an extension of US interests and security structure. In a speech to the US Congress last year, the prime minister argued that Israel is fighting Iran indirectly in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>“We’re not only protecting ourselves. We’re protecting you,” he told US lawmakers.</p><p>Throughout the war, there have been countless reports that Biden and Trump have been displeased or angry with Netanyahu. But US weapons and political backing for Israel have continued to flow uninterrupted.

Defence Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-will-never-fully-withdraw-from-gaza-defence-minister-says\">Israel Katz</a> said on Tuesday that the country is looking to re-establish settlements in Gaza, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>He later walked back those comments but stressed that Israel would maintain a permanent military presence in the territory, which would violate the Trump plan.</p><p>Expect Gaza to be a key topic of discussion between Netanyahu and Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-a-syria-agreement-be-reached\">Can a Syria agreement be reached?</h2><p><span>Trump has literally and figuratively embraced Syrian President <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> over the past year, lifting sanctions against the country and beginning security cooperation with his government’s security forces.</span></p><p>But Israel is pursuing its own agenda in Syria. Hours after the collapse of the government of former President Bashar al-Assad a year ago, Israel began expanding its occupation of Syria beyond the Golan Heights.</p><p>Although the new Syrian authorities stressed early on that they did not seek confrontation with Israel, the Israeli military launched a bombardment campaign against Syria’s state and military institutions.</p><p>Israeli forces have also been conducting raids in southern Syria and abducting and disappearing residents.</p><p>After the Israeli military killed 13 Syrians in an air raid last month, Trump issued a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/trump-says-israel-must-seek-strong-and-true-dialogue-with-syria\">veiled criticism</a> of Israel.</p><p>“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous state,” he said.</p><p>Syria and Israel were in talks earlier this year to establish a security agreement short of full diplomatic normalisation. But the negotiations appeared to collapse after Israeli leaders insisted on holding onto the land captured after al-Assad’s fall.</p><p>With Netanyahu in town, Trump will likely renew the push for a Syria-Israel agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-iran-back-in-the-headlines\">Why is Iran back in the headlines?</h2><p>Netanyahu’s visit comes amid louder alarm bells in Israel about Iran rebuilding its missile capacity after their 12-day war in June.</p><p>NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/netanyahu-plans-brief-trump-possible-new-iran-strikes-rcna250112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> last week that the Israeli prime minister will brief the US president about more potential strikes against Iran.</p><p>The pro-Israel camp in Trump’s orbit seems to be already mobilising rhetorically against Iran’s missile programme.</p><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham visited Israel this month and called Iran’s missiles a “real threat” to Israel.</p><p>“This trip is about elevating the risk ballistic missiles pose to Israel,” Graham told The Jerusalem Post.</p><p>Trump authorised strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites during the June war, which he said “obliterated” the Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">nuclear programme</a>.</p><p>Although there is no evidence that Iran has been weaponising its nuclear programme, fears about a possible Iranian atomic bomb were the driving public justification for the US involvement in the conflict.</p><p>So it will be hard for Netanyahu to persuade Trump to back a war against Iran, said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy.</p><p>The president is portraying himself as a peacemaker and prioritising a possible confrontation <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">with Venezuela</a>.</p><p>“It could just as well backfire on Netanyahu,” Toossi said of the push for more strikes against Iran.

It was Israel. That’s no longer true,” Trump said.</p><p>“You have to be very careful. You have a Congress in particular which is becoming anti-Semitic.”</p><p>Despite Trump’s position, analysts said the gap between the strategic priorities of the US and Israel is growing.</p><p>While Washington is pushing for economic cooperation in the Middle East, Israel is seeking “total dominance” over the region, including US partners in the Gulf, Toossi said.</p><p>“Israel is pushing this uncompromising posture and strategic objective that I think is going to come to a head more with core US interests,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-the-us-israel-alliance\">What’s next for the US-Israel alliance?</h2><p>If you drive down Independence Avenue in Washington, DC, you will likely see more Israeli than American flags displayed on the windows of congressional offices.</p><p>Despite the shifting public opinion, Israel still has overwhelming support in Congress and the White House. And although criticism of Israel is growing within the Republican base, Israel’s detractors have been pushed to the margins of the movement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> is leaving Congress; commentator Tucker Carlson is facing constant attacks and accusations of anti-Semitism; and Congressman Tom Massie is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is filled with staunch Israel supporters, including Rubio, megadonor <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/who-is-miriam-adelson-the-pro-israel-donor-trump-lauded-at-the-knesset\">Miriam Adelson</a> and radio show host Mark Levin.</p><p>But amid the erosion of public support, especially among young people, Israel may face a reckoning in American politics in the long term.</p><p>On the Democratic side, some of Israel’s strongest supporters in Congress are facing primary challenges from progressive candidates who are centring Palestinian rights.</p><p>The most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), is increasingly becoming <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/centrist-us-democrat-says-he-returned-aipac-donations-cites-netanyahu-ties\">a toxic brand</a> for Democrats.</p><p>On the right, the faultlines in the consensus in support of Israel are growing wider. That trend was put on display at the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/turning-point-usa-held-its-americafest-conference-heres-what-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right-wing AmericaFest</a> conference this month when debates raged around support for Israel, a topic that was a foregone conclusion for conservatives a few years ago.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has been pushing to codify opposition to Zionism as anti-Semitism to punish Palestinian rights supporters, Vice President JD Vance has presented a more nuanced view on the issue.</p><p>“What is actually happening is that there is a real backlash to a consensus view in American foreign policy,” Vance recently told the UnHerd website.</p><p>“I think we ought to have that conversation and not try to shut it down. Most Americans are not anti-Semitic – they’re never going to be anti-Semitic – and I think we should focus on the real debate.”</p><p>Bottom line, the currents are changing, but the US commitment to Israel remains solid – for now.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A committee member told Al Jazeera that both countries agreed to transfer the aircraft’s flight recorder to a neutral country for a full investigation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-dreadful-scene\" class=\"p1\">‘A dreadful scene’</h2><p class=\"p1\">After visiting the site of the crash, sources from the Libyan military committee told Al Jazeera it was a “dreadful scene”, with body parts scattered everywhere.</p><p class=\"p1\">Identification was so difficult that authorities had to perform DNA testing on the body parts to identify which of the aircraft passengers they belonged to.</p><p class=\"p1\">It was only after the long, painstaking process was completed that the bodies were finally repatriated to Libya.</p><p class=\"p1\">A Turkish military ceremony was held in their honour early on Saturday morning, then the bodies were put on an aeroplane for the journey to Libya, but matters became complicated at that point.</p><p class=\"p1\">The seemingly straightforward matter of holding ceremonies for the deceased became an issue as details like where they would be held were debated hotly in the fractured country.</p><h2 id=\"is-general-al-haddad-replaceable\" class=\"p1\">Is General al-Haddad replaceable?</h2><p class=\"p1\">The Tripoli government is overseen by the Presidential Council, a three-member body that serves as the supreme commander of the military, according to the Libyan Political Agreement.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, Libya’s rival authorities in the east, controlled by renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, do not recognise them, despite the eastern-based parliament signing the agreement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195892\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195892\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195892\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/000_88YD8WG-1766685211.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Libyan military delegation members arrive at the wreckage site following the crash of a Libya-bound business jet carrying Libyan Chief of Staff General Muhammad Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, in Ankara on December 24, 2025.

The Presidential Council appointed his deputy, General Salah al-Namroush, temporarily.</p><p class=\"p1\">During his eulogy, al-Namroush “bid farewell to the men of the nation who carried the nation’s burdens and made discipline a way of life and leadership a responsibility”.</p><p class=\"p1\">He said he would follow in the footsteps of al-Haddad, and pledged “to continue unifying the army”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Although it will be difficult, political analyst Mohamed Mahfoudh told Al Jazeera: “Discussions are already under way; given the importance of the position, I expect a decision to be made within the next 10 days.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Libya has seen widespread frustration and recent protests against the government over the economic situation, prompting officials to announce a plan to reshuffle the cabinet earlier this month.</p><p class=\"p1\">The shuffle was scheduled to be announced on December 24, but al-Haddad’s death postponed that.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4193508\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193508\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4193508\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_694ba5a05aca8-1766565280.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Libya's army chief of staff Gen.

That means Haddad’s replacement could be a political decision to appease certain stakeholders, rather than someone who is qualified for the position.</p><p class=\"p1\">“That’s a fear many of us have,” Mahfoudh said.</p><h2 id=\"a-tale-of-two-airports\" class=\"p1\">A tale of two airports</h2><p class=\"p1\">In an illustration of Libya’s split, the government in Tripoli had to receive the bodies of al-Haddad and other military officials at the city’s international airport, which was destroyed in fighting in 2014.</p><p class=\"p1\">It is currently under renovation and now serves only government and emergency medical evacuation planes.</p><p>However, normally the bodies would have been received at Mitiga international airport, which is now Tripoli’s main commercial airport, but since it is under SDF control, PM Dbeibah could not be there.</p><p class=\"p1\">He is not welcome.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, Dbeibah, members of the Presidential Council, and senior government and military officials waited for the bodies at Tripoli international airport.</p><p class=\"p1\">They were taken to an army base in southern Tripoli for a military ceremony in their honour, where Presidential Council head, Mohamed al-Menfi, declared “the promotion of each martyr to the next rank”, making al-Haddad a field marshal posthumously.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">“Field Marshal Mohamed al-Haddad was a cornerstone to protecting the state and maintaining stability,” said Dbeibah at the ceremony.</p><p class=\"p1\">He assured people that investigations into the crash “are continuing with full accuracy and credibility in coordination with Turkiye”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Al-Haddad, al-Essawi, and al-Mahjoub’s bodies were flown to their hometowns in Misrata on Saturday evening.</p><p class=\"p1\">On Sunday morning, people came from all over the country to lay them to rest.</p><p class=\"p1\">Thousands of people gathered in the Misrata football stadium for a farewell prayer for the departed. Misrata city officials announced the day as an official holiday to give people time off to attend the funeral.</p><p class=\"p1\">Abdullah Allafi, a tribal leader from al-Rajban in the Nafusa Mountains of western Libya, left home at 3am to drive hundreds of kilometres to pay his respects.</p><p class=\"p1\">When asked about al-Haddad’s death, he said: “It’s a huge loss. Mohamed al-Haddad’s death is a loss for all of us and for Libya. He was a true patriot. May Allah rest his soul.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Our presence here is a symbol of unity. Enough divisions, it’s time to come together and build a nation and a united military.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
