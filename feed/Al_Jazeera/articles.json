Roughly half of the areas formerly known as Somaliland have declared their affiliation with Somalia over the past two years, he added.</p><p>The minister praised the countries that had condemned Israel and pledged that Somalia would lean on all diplomatic and legal means to reject Israel’s “violation”.</p><p>He also commended United States President Donald Trump’s administration for not recognising Somaliland.</p><p>Although the US was the only member of the 15-member United Nations Security Council that did not condemn Israel for the recognition on December 30, it <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/un-security-council-members-condemn-israels-recognition-of-somaliland\">said</a> its position on Somaliland had not changed.</p><p>For its part, Somaliland’s governing party has defended its newfound relations with Israel after Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/israeli-fm-visits-somaliland-after-world-first-recognition-storm\">travelled to Hargeisa</a>, the region’s largest city and self-declared capital, earlier this week.</p><p>Hersi Ali Haji Hassan, chairman of the governing Waddani party, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/top-somaliland-official-defends-israel-ties-amid-arab-backlash\">told Al Jazeera</a> days later that Somaliland was “not in a position to choose” who provided it with legitimacy after decades of being spurned by the international community.</p><p>“We are in a state of necessity for official international recognition,” Hassan said. “There is no choice before us but to welcome any country that recognises our existential right.”</p><p>Hassan did not deny the prospect of a potential military base.</p><p>“We have started diplomatic relations… This topic [a military base] has not been touched upon now,” he said.</p><p>When pressed on whether Somaliland would accept such a request in the future, Hassan said only to “ask the question when the time comes”, calling the line of inquiry “untimely”.</p><p>Israeli think tanks say Somaliland’s location, at the gateway to the Red Sea and across from Yemen, make it a strategic site for operations against the Yemeni Houthi rebel group, which imposed a naval blockade on Israeli-linked shipping before the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>The Institute for National Security Studies, in a November report, said Somaliland’s territory could “serve as a forward base” for intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and serve “a platform for direct operations” against them.</p><p>The Houthis said that any Israeli presence <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/any-israeli-presence-in-somaliland-will-be-a-target-houthi-leader\">would be a target</a>, a statement Somaliland’s former intelligence chief, Mostafa Hasan, said amounted to a declaration of war.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Syrian president met US President Donald Trump at the White House last year and has formally joined the US-led coalition against ISIL.</p><p>The fighting in Aleppo began on Tuesday in the predominantly Kurdish neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafieh and Bani Zaid, amid tensions over a failure to implement <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/syria-merges-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-into-state-institutions\">a March 2025 agreement</a> to reintegrate the Kurdish forces into state institutions.</p><p>Oghanna, Al Jazeera’s correspondent, said “all this fighting broke out because of a failure to integrate the SDF into government institutions.”</p><p>The deadline for the deal passed at the end of last year, and the SDF refused to leave areas that have been under its control since the early days of the Syrian war, which erupted in 2011.</p><p>Oghanna said that although the fighting in Aleppo has ended, “the fault line, the backdrop for this fighting, remains”.</p><p>“There are many difficult issues in Syria, but the greatest threat to national stability and unity remains this question of whether the SDF join Damascus and be under Damascus’s control,” he said.</p><p>The SDF has a large amount of fighters, estimated at between 50,000 to 90,000. They are mainly in the northeast of the country and control almost a quarter of Syria’s territory.</p><p>Oghanna said the fighting in Aleppo makes the SDF integration “look far less likely”.</p><p>“There are also other sticking points, which might make the SDF refuse to put down their weapons,” he said.</p><p>“The SDF don’t want to cede control of the country’s northeast, and they want to maintain a certain amount of autonomy in order to have the governance in northeastern Syria.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

increasing pressure, especially their new manager, Xabi Alonso.</p><p>Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at a final that carries so much more weight when it holds the tag: El Clasico.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-real-madrid-and-xabi-alonso-under-pressure\">Why are Real Madrid and Xabi Alonso under pressure?</h2><p>Alonso has steadied Real Madrid’s ship in recent weeks after a tumultuous period, but the Spanish Super Cup final seems a make-or-break moment for the beleaguered coach.</p><p>On the brink of the sack after a dire run of form, Alonso responded by leading Madrid to five consecutive victories, the fifth coming on Thursday against Atletico Madrid in the semifinals.</p><p>Beating Super Cup holders Barcelona would bring Alonso the first trophy at the helm.</p><p>A second victory in two matches against Barcelona would buy Alonso time and breathing room.</p><p>But succumbing to Hansi Flick’s side would give Real president Florentino Perez a further excuse to remove a coach he hired in June but has never appeared convinced by.</p><p>Spanish media reported that Perez was set to sack Alonso if the team lost against Manchester City in the Champions League on December 10, which they did, but the team’s improved performance bought the coach another chance.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4229693\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229693\" class=\"wp-caption

final between Real and Barca?</h2><p>Barcelona trounced Real Madrid 5-2 in last year’s final, which was also in Jeddah.</p><p>It was a damaging blow for then-manager Carlo Ancelotti, while proving a springboard for Hansi Flick – fresh in his role as Barca boss.</p><h2 id=\"how-important-is-spanish-super-cup-to-real-madrid-and-barcelona\">How important is Spanish Super Cup to Real Madrid and Barcelona?</h2><p>Lifting the Super Cup worked for Flick’s fledgling tenure at Barcelona last season, galvanising his team to claim La Liga and the Copa del Rey.</p><p>In the three seasons prior to that, the Super Cup winners also went on to win the Spanish top flight.</p><p>“Two things are clear – as it’s the tournament we’re playing for [now], it’s the most important,” said Alonso.</p><p>“If you ask me about it in terms of order of priority in the season, it’s the fourth.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-latest-on-real-madrid-forward-kylian-mbappe\">What’s the latest on Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe?</h2><p>Real are boosted by <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/real-star-mbappe-could-face-barcelona-but-madrid-not-kamikaze-over-health\">the return of Mbappe</a> to the squad after he missed <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/8/real-madrid-to-face-barcelona-in-spanish-super-club-after-beating-atletico\">the 2-1 win</a> over Atletico and Sunday’s 5-1 thrashing of Real Betis in La Liga while recovering from a knee sprain.</p><p>The coach said Mbappe has as much chance of starting against Barcelona as anyone else and is confident the forward has recovered, even though he was expected to miss another week.</p><p>With 29 goals in 24 appearances across all competitions, Mbappe is Real Madrid’s top goal scorer this season and their clear, stand-out performer.</p><p>The striker has netted six goals against Barcelona in five games since joining Real Madrid.</p><p>His return could make life trickier for Alonso because the team does not seem to function at its best when Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham line up together.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4229699\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229699\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

player who has become essential for Alonso in recent weeks is Brazilian winger Rodrygo.</p><p>After a miserable run of 32 games without scoring, the right-winger has burst into life with three goals and three assists in his last five matches.</p><p>On the opposite flank, Vinicius is struggling for form.</p><p>Since finishing second in the 2024 Ballon d’Or rankings, he has dipped far from his top level.</p><p>Vinicius has not scored in his last 16 outings for Real Madrid, and Alonso must decide whether to line up with him against Barca.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-barcelona-played-real-madrid\">What happened the last time Barcelona played Real Madrid?</h2><p>The Catalans beat Madrid four times in four encounters last season, but Alonso’s side beat their rivals 2-1 in October in La Liga.</p><p>“We have to win; we lost two finals against them last year,” urged Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.</p><p>“They have to win, too. After losing the Clasico in La Liga, they’ll want revenge.”</p><h2 id=\"barcelona-ready-for-mbappe-return-for-real-madrid\">Barcelona ready for Mbappe return for Real Madrid</h2><p>Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said Mbappe is the man of the moment, but backed his team to succeed despite his arrival in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“At the moment, Mbappe is the best striker… he’s scored many, many goals, and he’s a world-class player, that’s what I can say,” admitted Flick, whose side <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/8/barcelona-rout-athletic-bilbao-5-0-to-reach-spanish-super-cup-final\">hammered Real Betis 5-0</a> in their semifinal on Wednesday.</p><p>However, the German coach was eager to point out that last season, his side beat Mbappe’s Madrid on all four occasions they met.</p><p>Barca thrashed them 5-2 in last season’s Spanish Super Cup final, as well as winning both La Liga Clasicos and the Copa del Rey final.</p><p>In their one meeting with Alonso’s side this season, Madrid secured a 2-1 league win.</p><p>“How many Clasicos have we played in the last year and a half? And how many did we win? We lost one,” said Flick.</p><p>“I know he’s a fantastic player, and for him, with space behind the [defence], he’s really great…</p><p>“We will adapt something, like we always do, but it’s not especially about Mbappe, it’s about Real Madrid, it’s about how we want to play and how we expect they want to.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3437743\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3437743\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3437743\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-12T213641Z_1579013626_UP1EL1C1O13W3_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-BAR-RMA-REPORT-1736718736.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C554&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - Spanish Super Cup - Final - FC Barcelona v Real Madrid - King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - January 12, 2025 FC Barcelona's Lamine Yamal celebrate with the trophy and teammates after winning the Spanish Super Cup REUTERS/Pedro Nunes\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3437743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal celebrates with the trophy and his teammates after winning the Spanish Super Cup last season [Pedro Nunes/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-spanish-super-cup\">What’s the Spanish Super Cup?</h2><p>The Super Cup pits together the winners and runners-up of both the Spanish domestic league, La Liga, and Spain’s domestic cup competition, Copa del Rey.</p><p>Although first played in 1982, between the league and cup winners alone, it was expanded to four teams in 2020.</p><p>Barcelona are the current league champions, with Real Madrid finishing second.

The Saudi-led coalition accused the UAE of helping him escape on a flight that was ‌tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>On Friday, the STC delegation, which was in Riyadh for talks, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/yemens-separatist-southern-transitional-council-announces-its-dissolution\">announced the dissolution</a> of the group in an apparent admission of defeat.</p><p>Secretary-General Abdulrahman Jalal al-Sebaihi said the group would shut down all of its bodies and offices inside and outside of Yemen, citing internal disagreements and mounting regional pressure.</p><p>But in a statement issued on Saturday, the STC said it had held an “extraordinary meeting” following the announcement in Riyadh, and declared it “null and void”, saying it had been made “under coercion and ‌pressure”.</p><p>It also reiterated calls for mass protests in southern cities on Saturday, warning against any attempts that target the group’s “peaceful activities”.</p><p>The armed forces of the Yemeni government said on Saturday that it would “strike firmly and decisively against anyone who seeks to tamper with security or disrupt public order”, without ​making any reference to the protests.</p><p>Separately, Al Jazeera’s Ahelbarra said that al-Alimi, the head of the PLC, in his Saturday address also issued a warning that extended beyond southern Yemen, telling the Houthis – who control northern Yemen – that they can “negotiate a settlement with us… or you will face repercussions, including the potential for a military action”.</p><p>The <a href=\"/gallery/2014/9/27/in-pictures-houthis-take-over-sanaa\">Houthis took over Yemen’s capital</a>, Sanaa, in 2014, claiming they were the only legitimate authority across Yemen.

As the team to beat, people will try to find all sorts of reasons to say Morocco has an advantage,” Regragui said after his team’s 2-0 win over Cameroon in the quarterfinals.</p><p>“The only advantage that Morocco has at this Africa Cup is playing in front of 65,000 spectators. The rest is on the field, we speak on the field.”</p><p>On the field, however, Cameroon might have had two penalties if experienced referee Dahane Beida hadn’t decided in favour of the home team.</p><p>Morocco defender Adam Masina was involved in both, appearing to catch Bryan Mbuemo’s right boot after missing the ball when Cameroon was trying to level the match, then, in the final minutes, appearing to strike Etta Eyong’s head with his elbow in the penalty area.</p><p>Beida, who refereed the final at the last edition, also decided not to show Bilal El Khannouss a second yellow card for stopping Danny Namaso on a counterattack shortly before Ismael Saibari wrapped up the win.</p><p>“Many people want to believe or make others believe that we have advantages from the referees. Personally, I saw penalties that could have been awarded to us. As for the referees, I never talk about the referee,” Regragui said.</p><p>The Morocco coach then spoke about a penalty his team was not awarded against South Africa in the previous tournament in the Ivory Coast, and wrongly said he was “suspended for no reason” at that tournament.</p><p>Regragui was suspended for two games at the previous edition for his role in a dispute with Congo captain Chancel Mbemba at the end of their game that led to a melee between players and team officials.</p><p>“The statistics always show us as better than the others,” Regragui said, getting back to this edition. “We create far more opportunities than our opponents. Not a single goal was disallowed for Cameroon, or for any other team. When you want to get rid of something, you find a pretext.”</p><p>Mali and Tanzania also had penalty claims against Morocco rejected in previous games, while Morocco also had a penalty awarded after a VAR check in the draw against Mali.</p><p>Thousands of whistling Moroccan fans tried to help referee Abdou Abdel Mefire make up his mind while he consulted replays before he eventually decided to penalise Mali’s Nathan Gassama for handball. He initially ignored Jawad El Yamiq’s penalty-area foul on Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko before awarding it some minutes later after a VAR check.</p><p>There did not appear to be any VAR checks against Cameroon on Friday.</p><p>Morocco has played all its matches at the nearly 70,000-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where the vast majority of supporters are shouting for the home team, creating an intimidating atmosphere for opponents and referees.</p><p>“Today, Cameroon played the match they needed to play. I think they lost against a better team. I don’t think any player, coach, or anyone else is going to talk about the refereeing because there were a lot of physical battles today. This is Africa. But today, I think we deserved our victory,” said Regragui, who added his team also deserved to win all its previous games.</p><p>“That’s it. We’re trying to play on that field. I don’t think it’s fair play from those who want to see us fall. The best team will win this tournament, inshallah,” he said.</p><p>Morocco will play Nigeria at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, which is also the venue for the final on January 18.</p><p>The Atlas Lions are among the heavy favourites to win the tournament, having become the first African nation to reach the semifinals of a FIFA World Cup at the Qatar 2022 edition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In his first public <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/irans-khamenei-says-rioters-must-be-put-in-their-place-amid-protests\">remarks</a> since mass protests broke out in Iran, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sought to draw a sharp line between what he deemed the “legitimate” grievances of the bazaar and outright rebellion across the country. “We talk to protesters; the officials must talk to them, but there is no benefit to talking to rioters. Rioters must be put in their place,” he said.</p><p>The distinction was deliberate. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/cdredxekrylo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Khamenei went on to praise the bazaar</a> and its merchants as “among the most loyal sectors” of the Islamic Republic, insisting that the enemies of the state could not exploit the bazaar as a vehicle to confront the system itself.</p><p>Yet his words failed to mask the reality on the ground. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/live/clym7k4mv30t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protests continue in the Tehran Bazaar</a>, prompting authorities to deploy tear gas against demonstrators chanting antistate slogans, including ones targeting the supreme leader. The state’s attempt to symbolically separate the bazaar from the broader unrest failed in practice, exposing the limits of its narrative control.</p><p>Khamenei’s invocation of the revolutionary legacy of the bazaar is rooted in historical facts. The bazaar played a decisive role in the 1979 revolution that overthrew Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and remained aligned with conservative political networks in the following decades. But this historical loyalty no longer guarantees political quiescence.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the economic standing of the bazaar has been steadily eroded by state favouritism towards the economic machinery of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and large religious-revolutionary foundations (bonyads), sanctions management, and chronic inflation. As a result, what was once a staunch base of the regime has become another casualty of systemic dysfunction.</p><h2 id=\"from-power-to-marginalisation\">From power to marginalisation</h2><p>In the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, powerful bazaar merchants, often operating through the bazaar-affiliated Islamic Coalition Party, were folded directly into the architecture of the new state. They gained influence over key institutions and ministries, including the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, the Ministry of Labour, and the Guardian Council.</p><p>This political access translated into material advantage. Despite the enthusiasm of powerful figures in the new revolutionary state for total nationalisation, including control over foreign trade, the bazaar maintained a dominant role in Iran’s commercial trade throughout the 1980s. Bazaar merchants secured import licences, ran the largest trading firms under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce, and benefitted from preferential access to the official exchange rate, which was far below market value. These imported goods were sold to Iranians at market prices, generating substantial profits.</p><p>When the Islamic Republic turned towards economic liberalisation in the 1990s, political forces tied to the bazaar, often described as the “traditional right”, backed President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in sidelining Islamist leftists from both the cabinet and the Majles. Although some of Rafsanjani’s market reforms later collided with bazaar interests and gave rise to the so-called “new right”, most notably the Servants of Reconstruction Party, the bazaar and its allies retained substantial influence within the state.</p><p>The reformist agenda of Rafsanjani’s successor, President Mohammad Khatami, also did not fundamentally threaten the economic position or political clout of the bazaar. Key institutions—the Guardian Council, the Assembly of Experts, and the judiciary—remained firmly under the control of the “traditional right”, insulating the bazaar from meaningful challenge.</p><p>Although the bazaar overwhelmingly supported the presidential bid of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005, the economic and foreign policies of his administration ultimately accelerated the erosion of its economic power.</p><p>During Ahmadinejad’s presidency, “privatisation” became a vehicle for the transfer of major state assets to firms affiliated with the IRGC and bonyads. Reclassified as “public, nongovernmental entities” under a new interpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution, these bodies absorbed vast swaths of the economy. Backed by the supreme leader and a cabinet dominated by military and security figures, many of them former IRGC officers, this redistribution of wealth encountered little institutional resistance.</p><p>The result was a profound shift in Iran’s political economy. The IRGC emerged as a dominant economic actor, expanding its reach across infrastructure, petrochemicals, banking, and beyond. Major bonyads, including the Mostazafan Foundation, the Imam Reza Shrine Foundation, and Setad, similarly consolidated their power by acquiring state firms and building sprawling corporate empires. Together, these entities formed an extensive web of interlocking conglomerates that fused revolutionary foundations with military institutions, giving rise to a powerful new political bloc within the state: the Principlists.</p><h2 id=\"the-bazaar-s-discontent\">The bazaar’s discontent</h2><p>This consolidation came directly at the expense of the bazaar and the political forces historically aligned with it. Disillusioned by the economic policies of the Ahmadinejad government, bazaar merchants coordinated their first open act of defiance since the revolution, staging strikes in several cities in 2008.</p><p>Their position deteriorated further as international sanctions escalated in response to the hardline nuclear policies of Ahmadinejad’s government. By 2012, US and EU restrictions on Iran’s oil and banking sectors and its exclusion from the SWIFT system placed the country under severe economic constraints.</p><p>The state responded by developing sanction-evasion mechanisms, including smuggling routes through neighbouring countries. The IRGC played a central role, exploiting ports and airports under its control to import goods. Over time, this sanctions economy entrenched the dominance of the IRGC and bonyads while further marginalising the bazaar.</p><p>Politically, the consequences were equally stark: the Principlists consolidated control over the state, sidelining the “traditional right” and dismantling the longstanding arrangement that had traded the bazaar’s loyalty for access and influence within the Islamic Republic.</p><h2 id=\"a-challenge-to-the-regime\">A challenge to the regime</h2><p>The ongoing bazaar protests are not an anomaly but a warning. They reveal a political-economic transformation years in the making—one that is hollowing out even the traditional backbone of the state.</p><p>For decades, the regime relied on the bazaar as a stabilising force: a guarantor of economic compliance in times of crisis and a bedrock of political loyalty. Yet the unrest originated in the bazaar and continues there, even as Khamenei insists on their loyalty. His remarks signal not confidence, but anxiety, and the bazaar’s open defiance demonstrates that the challenge confronting the Islamic Republic is far harder to contain.</p><p>In theory, the Islamic Republic could still seek to win back the bazaar by easing sanctions and curbing the dominance of IRGC-linked conglomerates. In practice, this is increasingly difficult to do. Sanctions relief remains remote amid deepening tensions with the United States and Europe over Iran’s nuclear programme, while rolling back the economic and political power of the IRGC and the bonyads offers the regime little incentive and even less strategic logic. Confronted with these constraints, the state’s room for manoeuvre is narrow, leaving repression as its most readily available option, even at the cost of further alienating a traditional constituency it once relied on for stability and loyalty</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But we didn’t. We should have finished the previous year with a sense of love and togetherness. But we didn’t. Everything bad has reached new levels and may well go even further.</p><p>We finished 2025, a year full of racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, with the right-wing Sweden Democrats still dominating the political discourse, Greta Thunberg being maligned for her political activism, and the government cutting <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-cut-development-aid-five-countries-divert-money-ukraine-2025-12-05/\">10 billion kronor</a> ($1.09bn) in development aid.</p><p>Just in time for the holidays, a Quran with bullet holes was hung on the Central Mosque’s fence in Stockholm, while an Iranian couple – both assistant nurses who had worked for a decade in Swedish hospitals – and their children were slated for deportation to Tehran.</p><p>In the new year, we are facing an election where the toxic political rhetoric about expelling criminals and others who do not “behave” and “adapt” will likely determine the outcome.</p><p>What comes next in Sweden deeply worries me.</p><p>As a Bosnian Swede, I want both my countries to be the best they can be. I want them to be great again, to use this charged phrase, because I do not think they are that great now. Yes, I look at both with some nostalgia because I remember what they were in different periods of my life.</p><p>I want Bosnia to be free from the nationalist poison and be a proper democratic state like Sweden. I want Sweden to regain its spirit of empathy that once upon a time made it accept thousands of us Bosnians during its worst economic crisis. Sweden did very well, and we Bosnians are said to be the best-integrated and most successful minority.</p><p>Today, we no longer have people like the Swedish priest who jumped on a plane and delivered aid at Sarajevo airport during the violent siege of the Bosnian capital.</p><p>Land, unload, escape. A quick in and out amid shelling. I cannot imagine anyone taking such a risk today.</p><p>What is worse, we have developed a resistance to empathy, and we look upon anyone who tries to make a difference as a weird outlier.</p><p>Back then, countries refused to defend the Bosnians and let us defend ourselves. Nowadays, they help perpetrators.</p><p>I remember a different Sweden.</p><p>During the first two years of the war, I met a comic book collector in Banja Luka whose daughter had escaped to Sweden. He showed me a letter she sent him through the Red Cross. It was wintertime, and she was describing this place called Vargarda as a pristine Nordic landscape, so beautiful and innocent.</p><p>It would be my fate to come to the same refugee camp in 1993. I was excited – I was going to a place where I knew there would be a lot of comic books.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival, we were transferred to this military building in Uddevalla, where it felt like the constant wind blew straight through my mind. We were closed off but had some contact with Swedish high-school students. I tried to learn Swedish, but since we didn’t know if we’d stay, we had no Swedish classes yet.</p><p>I didn’t experience much Swedishness in the camp. It was just us Bosnians with PTSD, a mix of people from all parts of Bosnia, and it felt like we were from different cultures entirely. Same people, total strangers.</p><p>I had cousins – also refugees – who were stationed in Trollhattan. One winter day, before a transfer to Mullsjo, I decided to visit them. It snowed a lot, and the only shoes I had were fake Converse sneakers with holes in the soles. I arrived in this cosy little town with an address in hand. It turned out to be a P O Box. Boy, did I feel like a stupid little refugee lost in the beautiful streets of Trollhattan.</p><p>I was cold, so I went into a record store. The place smelled amazing. The most exotic smell I’d ever smelled. I didn’t expect that in Sweden. In Bosnia, we’re not exactly famous for exotic spices. We like things plain and simple. It was in Sweden I’d learn about the world.</p><p>The man who worked in the store saw I was cold and gave me mulled wine with Christmas spices, which I’d later learn was called glogg. It was hot and strong, and it blew my mind. This is the Proustian moment I will probably remember until I die. I couldn’t speak any Swedish, but somehow I communicated that I was looking for the refugee camp. The man showed me where to go.</p><p>I found the buildings and saw some Bosnians who told me how to find my cousins. They had already started integrating, probably because they were fewer and lived closer to the Swedes.</p><p>During my stay, my cousin made tiny cinnamon buns, which she froze. Her daughter and I would steal those and eat them frozen, while watching Married…with Children on Swedish TV. In a few days, I fell in love with glogg and cinnamon buns.</p><p>In the refugee camp in Mullsjo, in the Swedish Bible belt, I trained judo in a local club, the music of Nordman blasting in the background. Small place, nice people, with some standard prejudice about Muslims, but still driven by a sense of decency. I was always taken care of.</p><p>There was one Swedish guy who worked in the camp who was always looking for bad things to say about us. Once, when I complained about an electricity bill being too high, the guy said we immigrants were just using the system and should learn to respect the law. Go figure.</p><p>People like him were few back then. Now there are so many. Companies that did not want to give us jobs because we didn’t speak Swedish well were also few back then. Now there are many.</p><p>In my twenties, I moved to Stockholm, got married, and started working as a carer for an old Swedish man in a wheelchair. I was next to him for 11 years. He taught me how to have compassion and empathy and how to adore the sweet buns called “semlor”.</p><p>I respect the National Semla Day because of him. I developed a good relationship with his sister, whom we would often meet at IKEA for weekend breakfasts.</p><p>Eventually, breakfast at IKEA every Saturday became a tradition for my family, too. It was a place where you could see all kinds of people waiting impatiently outside for it to open so they could run in and grab a cheap breakfast: Two buns, some slices of cucumber, chicken breast, and cheese, and of course, unlimited coffee. That was the best coffee in town.</p><p>After a few months, we got to know the faces of many regulars, like the old Greek couple who were somehow always first in line, and if they were not, they were not happy. Or the old Arab who’d always sit alone by the window facing the motorway. Or all the young Swedish couples who’d explain things to their small children way too loudly.</p><p>With time, breakfast at IKEA started to change. It gradually turned into a brunch – a huge feast – but then they got stingier, and there was less on offer. Prices went up just as our kids grew.</p><p>At some point, breakfast at IKEA lost the sense of what it was supposed to be. It lost its identity in trying to be commercial; it was no longer about the diversity of families it attracted. And somehow, we lost that tradition.</p><p>I love change. And I hate it. Like everyone, I suppose. I love the fact that Sweden has come to offer a much richer culture, and I hate that it has grown increasingly colder towards “the other”. People like Greta now stand out and cause wonder.</p><p>I long for that glogg I tasted as a young refugee just as much as I long for those strong hearts and minds like that priest who delivered goods to Muslims under fire.</p><p>Maybe by the time I have grandchildren, things will change. I will go back to our family tradition of breakfast IKEA, one that will be richer and yet very much the same old, same old.</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
