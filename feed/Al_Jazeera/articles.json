Since then, the conflict has displaced 9.6 million people internally and forced 4.3 million to flee to neighbouring countries, while 30.4 million Sudanese now need humanitarian assistance, according to UN figures.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari told the UNSC this week that fears of intensified fighting during the dry season had been confirmed.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“Each passing day brings staggering levels of violence and destruction,” he said. “Civilians are enduring immense, unimaginable suffering, with no end in sight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The conflict has shifted in recent weeks to Sudan’s central Kordofan region, where the RSF captured the strategic Heglig oilfield on December 8. The seizure prompted South Sudanese forces to cross into Sudan to protect the infrastructure, which Khiari warned reflects “the increasingly complex nature of the conflict and its expanding regional dimensions”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The RSF has also launched a final push to consolidate full control over <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/rsf-says-sudans-army-launches-air-strikes-on-paramilitary-stronghold-nyala\">North Darfur state</a>, attacking towns in the Dar Zaghawa region near the Chad border since December 24. The offensive threatens to close the last escape corridor for civilians fleeing the country to Chad.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The violence spilled across Sudan’s borders on Friday when a drone attack killed two Chadian soldiers at a military camp in the border town of Tine.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">A Chadian military intelligence officer told Reuters news agency the drone came from Sudan, though it remained unclear whether it was launched by the army or the RSF. Chad has placed its air force on high alert and warned it would “exercise our right to retaliate” if the strike is confirmed as deliberate.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Despite the intensifying conflict, the UN achieved a rare breakthrough, saying on Friday that it conducted its first assessment mission to el-Fasher since the city fell to the RSF.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN Humanitarian Coordinator Denise Brown said the mission followed “months of intense fighting, siege, and widespread violations against civilians and humanitarian workers,” adding that “hundreds of thousands of civilians have had to flee el-Fasher and surrounding areas”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Earlier this month, Yale University released a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/yale-report-unveils-rsf-attempt-to-cover-up-sudan-atrocities-mass-burials\">report</a> documenting systematic mass killings by the RSF in el-Fasher, with satellite imagery showing evidence of burning and the burial of human remains on a mass scale.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-pushes-for-ceasefire-in-sudans-civil-war-as-kordofan-violence-escalates\">warned</a> last week that the fighting was “horrifying” and “atrocious”, telling a news conference that “one day the story of what’s actually happened there is going to be known, and everyone involved is going to look bad”.</p><p>Rubio said he wanted the war to end before the New Year, but there is no strong indication that progress has been made.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Prime Minister Idris’s peace plan proposed an immediate UN-monitored ceasefire and complete RSF withdrawal from the roughly 40 percent of Sudan it controls. But an adviser to RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo dismissed the proposal as “closer to fantasy than to politics”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Upon returning to Port Sudan on Friday, Idris laid down a red line, saying the government would reject international peacekeeping forces because Sudan had been “burned” by them in the past.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Average turnout in past years has been about 62 percent, according to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). There are about 6,700 polling units across the country.</p><p>The National Elections Authority initially planned to hold the municipal government elections at the end of August, but moved the polls to December at the last minute, blaming insufficient funds as well as technical and organisational challenges.

He was elected as president in 2016 and again in 2020, although opposition groups contested the vote.</p><p>Touadera, who is the favourite to win in these polls, has campaigned on promises of peace, security and new infrastructural development in the country.</p><p>After 10 years in office, the president’s legacy is mixed. His administration has been dogged by accusations of suppressing the opposition and rigging elections.</p><p>Indeed, Touadera would not be eligible to run had he not forced the 2023 referendum through.

New roads and highways have been built where there were previously none, but the World Bank still ranks CAR’s economy as “stagnant”.</p><p>Touadera has also been praised for achieving relative stability in the conflict-affected country where armed groups hold swaths of territory, especially in the areas bordering Sudan.</p><p>Support from a United Nations peacekeeping force, Rwandan troops and Russian Wagner mercenaries has helped to reduce violence in recent years.</p><p>CAR was the first country to invite the Russian mercenary group to the continent in 2018 in a security-for-minerals deal, before other countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, also secured security contracts.</p><p>CAR was historically closer to former colonial power France, but Paris suspended its military alliances and reduced aid budgets to the country in 2021 following the Russia cooperation.</p><p>At a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023, Touadera praised Russia for saving CAR’s democracy. The two met again in January 2025.</p><p>In advance of the elections, Touadera has also signed a series of peace accords with some armed groups active in the country, although there are fears that the agreements will only hold until after the polls.</p><p>The president launched Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2022, making CAR the second country to do so after El Salvador.

The accusations raised fears that he would be barred from the vote.

Dologuele’s candidacy has prompted what some analysts say are xenophobic statements from Touadera’s supporters.</p><p>The 68-year-old dual citizen French-CAR politician first ran for the top job back in 2015 and was the runner-up in the 2020 presidential race. His third bid has faced challenges over his citizenship status. The 2023 referendum limited candidates to CAR citizenship only, and derisive comments from some in the governing camp have suggested some opposition candidates are not “real Central Africans”.</p><p>In September, Dologuele said he had given up his French citizenship; however, in October, a Central African court stripped him of his CAR citizenship, citing a clause in the old constitution disallowing dual citizenship. Dologuele reported the issue as a violation of his human rights to the UN human rights agency. It’s unclear what, if any, action the agency took, but Dologuele’s name on the final candidates list suggests his citizenship was reinstated.</p><p>Dologuele served as prime minister in the 1990s, under President Ange-Felix Patasse, before joining the Bank of Central African States and later heading the Development Bank of Central African States.</p><p>Although he is seen by some as an experienced hand, others associate him with past government failures. Dologuele is promising stronger democratic institutions and better international alliances.</p><h3>Other notable candidates</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Aristide Briand Reboas</strong> – leader of the Christian Democratic Party, the 46-year-old was a former intelligence official and the sports minister until 2024. He is running on promises of better amenities, including electricity and water. He previously ran in 2020.</li>\n<li><strong>Serge Djorie </strong>– a former government spokesperson until 2024, the 49-year-old is running under his Collective for Political Change for the new Central African Republic party. The medical doctor and published researcher has campaigned on public health reforms, poverty reduction and more pan-Africanism. Djorie ran in the 2020 elections.</li>\n<li><strong>Eddy Symphorien Kparekouti</strong> – The civil engineer helped draft the new constitution that was controversially adopted in 2023. In his campaigns, the independent candidate has emphasised poverty reduction in order to solve political insecurity and other developmental challenges.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues-for-this-election\">What are the key issues for this election?</h2><h3 id=\"persistent-insecurity\">Armed groups</h3><p>Protracted political conflict in CAR has continued for more than a decade, with many Central Africans saying they want a leadership that can bring peace.</p><p>Trouble began following a coup in March 2013 by the mainly Muslim Seleka rebel alliance that overthrew President Francois Bozize. In retaliation, Bozize assembled Christian and animist rebel armed groups, known as the Anti-balaka. Both sides attacked civilians and have been accused of war crimes by rights groups. Bozize, who continues to lead a rebel coalition, is now in exile in Guinea-Bissau. His attempted attacks in 2020 were fended off by Touadera’s Russian mercenaries.</p><p>However, killings, kidnappings and displacement continue in many rural communities in the country’s northwest, northeast and southeast regions, despite recent peace deals signed with some groups. Russian mercenaries have proven pivotal in securing major areas, but are also accused of human rights violations, such as mass killings, while opposition politicians have criticised the reliance on foreign fighters.</p><p>A 17,000-strong UN peacekeeping force, MINUSCA, has been extended until November 2026, although the move faced resistance from the US, which wants CAR to handle its own security going forward. The force has suffered at least three deaths in deadly attacks this year alone. There are also fears about the security of voters in rural areas; about 800 voting units were <a href=\"/news/2020/12/28/violence-forces-800-polling-stations-to-close-in-car-commission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forced to close </a>in the last elections due to rebel violence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"reducing-poverty\">Poverty</h3><p>CAR remains one of the poorest nations in the world, with more than 60 percent of the population living in poverty, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Most people live in rural areas and survive on subsistence farming in the absence of any state-propelled industry.</p><p>Economic growth rate is slow, averaging 1.5 percent yearly. Only 16 percent of citizens have access to electricity, and only 7.5 percent have access to the internet.</p><p>Persistent fuel shortages make economic activity more difficult.</p><p>The country ranked 191st of 193 countries in the 2022 Human Development Index.</p><h3 id=\"divisive-politics\">Divisive politics</h3><p>The country’s turbulent political history and the present landscape of deeply divided political groups have failed to deliver a unified opposition coalition that can challenge Touadera and enshrine a functioning democracy.</p><p>Fears around whether Touadera intends to run for life following the 2023 referendum are high, with opposition and rights groups already calling for reforms to the new constitution. There are also fears around vote rigging in the elections in favour of Touadera’s governing party.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel has never arrested or charged any of its troops for killing journalists.</p><p>While the targeting of the press intensified during the genocidal war in Gaza, Israel has killed dozens of Arab journalists over the past two decades, including Al Jazeera’s veteran correspondent <a href=\"/features/longform/2023/5/11/shireen-abu-akleh-al-jazeera-reporter-and-daughter-of-palestine\">Shireen Abu Akleh</a> in the occupied West Bank in 2022.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Muhammad al-Lahham, head of the Committee for Freedoms at the syndicate, said the scale and consistency of the attacks amount to international crimes.</p><p>The events of the past year, he said, “constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, and represent a systematic targeting of a protected group, journalists, within the framework of an official policy to silence the media by force”.</p><p>Al-Lahham rejected claims that journalists had been caught accidentally in hostilities, describing instead a deliberate operational logic. What Israel was enforcing, he said, was a “field doctrine based on the principle of ‘no witnesses, no narrative, no image'”.</p><p>In December, a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/israel-the-top-killer-of-journalists-worldwide-once-again-says-rsf-report#:~:text=Nearly%20300%20journalists%20and%20media,Israeli%20forces%20in%20the%20occupied\">report</a> by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) found that Israel killed more journalists in 2025 than any other country.</p><h2 id=\"silencing-witnesses\" data-start=\"1633\" data-end=\"1896\">Silencing witnesses</h2><p>The report described 2025 as “a year of repeated mass targeting, particularly in tents, hospitals, and press gatherings”, warning that Palestine had become one of the most dangerous places in the world to practise journalism.</p><p>Several <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-extends-law-that-banned-al-jazeera-for-two-more-years#:~:text=Many%20Al%20Jazeera%20journalists%20%E2%80%93%20and,during%20the%20two%2Dyear%20war.\">Al Jazeera</a> journalists have been among those killed, in some cases alongside members of their families.</p><p>In August, Israeli attacks killed al-Sharif and three other Al Jazeera journalists. They are among nearly 300 journalists and media workers killed in Gaza during the war over 26 months – an average of about 12 journalists a month – according to Shireen.ps, a monitoring website named after Abu Akleh.</p><p>Beyond fatalities, the committee documented a sharp rise in life-altering injuries. Many journalists suffered amputations, paralysis or blindness after strikes to the head, neck, chest and abdomen. The dangers did not come solely from the Israeli army, the report said, but also from settlers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3884255\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3884255\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3884255\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000044491-4-1754998856.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"From left: Al Jazeera journalist killed by Israel earlier this.

On April 7 and 8, Israeli strikes hit a <a href=\"/news/2025/4/7/israel-bombs-media-tent-in-gaza-killing-and-wounding-reporters\">journalists’ tent</a> at Nasser Hospital, wounding nine reporters and destroying equipment. Several died of their injuries later.</p><p>This documented and recurring incident occurred and involved the use of heavy weaponry, “amounting to a complex war crime and a collective targeting of the press”, the committee said.</p><p>By mid-2025, patterns of permanent disability had emerged. Journalist Akram Dalloul lost his sight, Jamal Badah had his leg amputated, and Muhammad Fayeq was left paralysed.</p><p>The committee stressed that most attacks occurred while journalists were clearly identifiable, wearing protective gear and press badges, and working in locations long recognised as media gathering points. Many were targeted repeatedly, it added, underscoring what it described as Israel’s sustained assault on the Palestinian press.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the Center for International Policy think tank, said that while Trump is pushing to deepen economic cooperation and forge diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states, Netanyahu is seeking military

href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">Trump’s assessment</a>, his proclamation has pushed Israel to find another boogeyman, analysts said, to avoid contradicting the US president publicly.</p><p>Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a US think tank that promotes diplomacy, said that since Trump has declared “rightly or wrongly” the nuclear issue resolved, Israel is switching the focus to missiles to keep the pressure on Tehran.</p><p>“Netanyahu is pushing the United States to join Israel in yet another war with Iran, this time with a focus on the missiles, partly because Trump is not receptive to the idea of addressing the nuclear issue – since he has said that he fixed it, he ‘obliterated’ the programme,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The Israelis will constantly shift the goal posts in order to make sure that they can make the confrontation with Iran an endless, forever war.”</p><p>Iran has always maintained that its nuclear programme is peaceful, unlike Israel, which is widely believed to possess an undeclared <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/6/19/what-are-the-risks-from-israel-and-irans-nuclear-capabilities\">nuclear arsenal</a>.</p><p>Tehran has also never launched missiles at Israel unprompted.</p><p>During the June war, Iran fired <a href=\"/gallery/2025/6/19/iran-launches-missile-attacks-as-israel-strikes-nuclear-sites\">hundreds of missiles</a> towards Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s multilayered air defences, but it was Israel that launched the war without apparent provocation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-supporters-focus-on-missiles\">Israel’s supporters focus on missiles</h2><p>Still, Israel and its allies have been sounding the alarm about the Iranian missile programme, warning that Tehran is recovering and increasing its production capacity.</p><p>“While Israel’s Operation Rising Lion succeeded in destroying much of Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities, Israel estimates that some 1,500 missiles remain out of the 3,000 Iran had previously,” the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) said in an email to supporters this month.</p><p>“The ballistic missile threat from Iran will be on the agenda when Prime Minister Netanyahu travels to Florida on Sunday and meets with President Trump Monday at Mar-a-Lago.”</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, an Iran hawk who is close to Trump, visited Israel this month and repeated the talking points about the dangers of Iran’s long-range missiles, warning that Iran is producing them “in very high numbers”.</p><p>“We cannot allow Iran to produce ballistic missiles because they could overwhelm the Iron Dome,” he told The Jerusalem Post, referring to Israel’s air defence system. “It’s a major threat.”</p><p>Israeli Defence Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-will-never-fully-withdraw-from-gaza-defence-minister-says\">Israel Katz</a> has also highlighted Iran’s missile capacity, suggesting that Netanyahu’s government will not tolerate any threats in the region.</p><p>“The defence establishment is closely monitoring developments, and naturally, I cannot elaborate beyond that,” Katz was quoted as saying by The Times of Israel.</p><p>“But on one principle, there is no dispute: What was before October 7 will not be again,” he was quoted as saying in reference to the 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel. “We will not allow threats of annihilation against the state of Israel.”</p><p>But critics said Israel is seeking hegemony in the region, not merely snuffing out existential threats.</p><p>Its ultimate goal is seen as changing Iran’s government or carrying out periodic strikes to keep the country weakened and without meaningful military capabilities.</p><p>“The Israelis will come back every six months with another plan to bomb Iran, and then it will not end until Trump decides to end it,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So if he acquiesces again, as he did in June, he will face the Israelis once again next June with another war plan, and next December and next June again. It will not stop until he stops it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-base\">Trump’s base</h2><p>Foreign policy hawks who advocate for a change in Iran’s government once dominated Trump’s Republican Party.</p><p>But partly thanks to Trump himself, now large segments of the base staunchly oppose military interventions and favour focusing on US problems.</p><p>That America First movement, represented by influential right-wing media figures like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, pleaded with Trump against attacking Iran in June.</p><p>Even the late Charlie Kirk, a close Trump ally and staunch <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Israel supporter</a>, spoke out against US involvement in the war.</p><p>Carlson has already slammed Israel’s renewed push for war.</p><p>“It’s been less than six months since Trump risked a war with Iran on Netanyahu’s behalf, but instead of acting grateful, the prime minister is already demanding more,” he wrote in his newsletter this month. “This is the definition of a parasitic relationship.”</p><p>However, the Republican caucus in Congress remains overwhelmingly aligned with Israel, and Trump’s top foreign policy aide, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is an Iran hawk.</p><p><span>Pro-Israel megadonors who helped bankroll Trump’s campaign, like <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/who-is-miriam-adelson-the-pro-israel-donor-trump-lauded-at-the-knesset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miriam Adelson,</a> will also likely exert counterpressure against the America First voices in the Trump movement.</span></p><p>“Those are hugely important factors, but I think it’s important to understand that they go both ways,” Parsi said of the domestic considerations for war with Iran.</p><p>“The voters don’t want this. The donors – at least a large number of them – want this. And come midterm elections [in November 2026], those are going to be two pressures in opposite directions from two groups, both of whom Trump believes that he needs.”</p><p>Toossi said political calculations for a war with Iran are more relevant now than they were in June because we are closer to the 2026 elections, which will decide who controls Congress.</p><p>“Trump’s popularity is very low now with the affordability crisis and this conservative fissure over foreign policy. So I think all of these factors serve as a limitation on Trump’s ability to get into a big war,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-escalation\">Risk of escalation</h2><p>Trump was able to claim victory after the US strikes in June.</p><p>He backed Israel, damaged the Iranian nuclear programme and kept his base intact without dragging the US into another protracted conflict.</p><p>After an Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/hld-irans-attack-on-al-udeid-air-base-in-qatar-all-you-need-to-know\">missile attack</a> against a US base in Qatar, which did not result in American casualties, Trump announced a ceasefire to end the war after 12 days.</p><p>But analysts warned that a second round of bombardment against Iran may not be as easy to end.</p><p>Parsi said the restraint that Iran showed in June is unlikely to be replicated because Tehran’s unwillingness to escalate was perceived as weakness by the Western world.</p><p>“The Iranian response would be much harsher, much quicker because the Iranians understand that unless they strike back hard and dispel the view that Iran is a country that you can bomb every six months – unless they do that – Iran will become a country that Israel will bomb every six months,” he said.</p><p>Parsi warned that Israel may start attacking Iran unilaterally and count on US air defences in the region to come to its aid, slowly pulling the US into the conflict.</p><p>He said Trump must stop Israel from launching an attack from the start.</p><p>“If they don’t want Israel to start that war, you tell Israel, ‘Don’t start that war. And we are completely out.’ That would be the America First position to take,” he said.</p><p>Parsi invoked Trump’s National Security Strategy (NSS), which stated that Washington’s “historic reason for focusing on the Middle East will recede” as the region moves towards greater cooperation and less conflict.</p><p>“Well, then, recede,” Parsi said.</p><p>“So many administrations in a row have said something along these lines, whether in the NSS or outside of it. Then do it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Five people, including the three intruders, were killed, it said.</p><p>Tajik officials did not name the armed men or specify which group they belonged to.

On November 26, a drone equipped with an explosive device attacked a compound belonging to Shohin SM, a private Chinese gold-mining company, in the remote Khatlon region on the Tajik-Afghan border, killing three Chinese citizens.</p><p>In a second attack on November 30, a group of men armed with guns opened fire on workers employed by the state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation, killing at least two people in Tajikistan’s Darvoz district.</p><p>Tajik officials said those attacks had originated from villages in Afghanistan’s Badakhshan province but did not disclose any affiliation or motive behind the attacks.</p><p>Chinese nationals have also come under attack in Pakistan’s Balochistan province and along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.</p><p>China’s embassy in Dushanbe advised Chinese companies and personnel to evacuate the border area.

We have passed the test of confrontation. We may be weak in resources, but our faith and will are strong,” he said, adding that security had improved to the extent that Taliban officials now travel across the country without weapons.</p><p>The Taliban insists that no “terrorist groups” are operating from Afghanistan. However, in a recent report, the United Nations sanctions-monitoring committee cited the presence of multiple armed groups, including ISKP, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, al-Qaeda, the Turkistan Islamic Party, Jamaat Ansarullah and Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan.</p><p>Jamaat Ansarullah is a Tajik group linked to al-Qaeda-aligned networks and active primarily in northern Afghanistan near the Tajik border.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196763\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196763\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20240517__34PH83M__v1__MidRes__TajikistanAfghanistanDiplomacyTrade-1766749395.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghans travel along a border road as seen from Tajikistan’s Darvoz district [File: Amir Isaev/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-are-relations-between-tajikistan-and-the-taliban\">How are relations between Tajikistan and the Taliban?</h2><p>For decades, the relationship between Tajikistan and the Taliban has been defined by deep ideological hostility and ethnic mistrust with Dushanbe one of the group’s fiercest critics in Central Asia.</p><p>In the 1990s, Tajikistan aligned with the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, led by Afghan military commander and former Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud.</p><p>After the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Tajikistan stood as the lone holdout among its neighbours in refusing to officially recognise the new government.</p><p>However, pragmatic diplomatic engagement quietly began about 2023, driven by economic necessity and shared security fears over the presence of ISKP. Stepping up the restoration of relations, a high-level Tajik delegation visited Kabul in November, the first such visit since the Taliban’s return to power.</p><p>But the two governments continue to trade accusations that the other is harbouring “terrorists”, the major thorn remaining in their bilateral relationship, and that drug smuggling is occurring across their border.</p><p>The Tajik-Afghan border has long been a major trafficking route for Afghan heroin and methamphetamine into Central Asia and onwards to Russia and Europe, exploiting the area’s rugged terrain and weak policing.</p><p>“The rising frequency [of the clashes] is new and interesting and raises a point: whether we might be seeing a new threat emerging,” Bahiss said.</p><p>Badakshan province, from which Tajik authorities said the attacks on Chinese nationals originate, presents a complex security situation for the Taliban as it has struggled to stem the threat from armed opposition groups, Bahiss added.</p><p>This security issue has been further complicated by the Taliban’s crackdown on poppy cultivation in the province, he said. The Taliban has faced resistance to this policy from farmers in the north. This is largely because the terrain of Badakshan means poppies are the only viable cash crop.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196745\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196745\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-13T143010Z_997153299_RC20BHA2RDCP_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AFGHANISTAN-1766748858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called his Tajik counterpart early this month to express regret about the attacks on Chinese nationals and say his government was prepared to boost cooperation between their border forces [Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-taliban-faring-with-other-neighbours\">How is the Taliban faring with other neighbours?</h2><p>Since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, some of its neighbours have maintained a pragmatic transactional relationship while others have not.</p><p>Relations with Pakistan, previously its patron, have <a href=\"/news/2024/12/28/analysis-why-have-pakistans-ties-with-the-afghan-taliban-turned-frigid\">particularly deteriorated</a>.

Cruz has repeatedly urged the US to recognise Somaliland.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In August, Trump signalled that he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference. “Another complex one, but we’re working on that one, Somaliland,” he said.</p><p>The US, as yet, has not changed its position on the issue.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The announcement comes amid dampening US interest in Somalia, with Trump repeatedly carrying out verbal attacks on the country and its president.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Earlier this year, reports emerged linking potential recognition of Somaliland to plans for ethnically cleansing <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/somaliland-recognition-for-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-not-worth-it\">Palestinians in Gaza</a> and forcibly moving them to African region.</p><p>The foreign ministers of Egypt, Turkiye, Somalia and Djibouti warned against such a move during their call earlier.</p><p>“The participants also affirmed their categorical rejection of any plans to displace the Palestinian people from their land, plans that are unequivocally rejected by the vast majority of the world’s nations in both form and substance,” the Egyptian Foriegn Ministry said.</p><p>In 2024, Ethiopia also sought a pact with Somaliland, offering recognition in exchange for sea access for Addis Ababa, but backed down under diplomatic pressure.</p><p data-start=\"92\" data-end=\"367\">Jethro Norman, a Somalia expert at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told Al Jazeera that it was unclear whether this development would prompt other countries to follow suit, but it could “embolden other centrifugal forces” in a politically fragmented nation.</p><p data-start=\"92\" data-end=\"367\">Somalia operates a federal system granting significant autonomy to its states. Two key states, Puntland and Jubaland, have withdrawn from the system amid constitutional and electoral disputes.</p><p data-start=\"92\" data-end=\"367\">In a post on X, Puntland’s interior minister said patience pays off, signaling that he viewed the development favourably. “Puntland needs to calculate strategically,” Juha Farah said.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"561\">“Basically, you already have a series of de facto states, and Israel’s message is that if you provide strategic value, recognition becomes transactional rather than principled,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"
