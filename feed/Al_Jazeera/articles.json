Havana has used its medical missions worldwide as a tool for international diplomacy.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>So why are some countries withdrawing from the programme that helps the host countries?</p><h2 id=\"why-is-guatemala-phasing-out-cuban-doctors\">Why is Guatemala phasing out Cuban doctors?</h2><p>Guatemala’s health ministry said in a statement<strong> </strong>that it would begin a “gradual termination” over this year.</p><p>“The phased withdrawal of the Cuban Medical Brigade stems from an analysis of the mission’s completion of its cycles,” the statement, originally in Spanish, said on February 13.</p><p>The statement added that the Cuban medical mission was meant to support Guatemala through the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, which devastated parts of Central America, overwhelmed local hospitals and left rural communities with almost no access to medical care.</p><p>“The Ministry of Health is developing a phased strategic replacement plan that includes hiring national personnel, strengthening incentives for hard-to-reach positions, strategic redistribution of human resources, and specialized technical support,” the statement said.</p><p>The Cuban mission in Guatemala comprises 412 medical workers, including 333 doctors.</p><p>The Central American country’s decision comes amid growing pressure from the United States, which wants to stop Cuban doctors from serving abroad.</p><p>The move aims to starve Cuba of much-needed revenue as a major share of the incomes earned by doctors goes to government coffers. Cuba has been facing severe power, food and medical shortages amid an oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration since January.</p><p>Guatemala is just one country which benefits from Cuban medical missions.</p><p>Over the past decades, Cuba has sent medical missions around the world, from Latin America to Africa and beyond. It began sending these missions shortly after the 1959 Cuban revolution brought Fidel Castro to power.</p><p>Castro’s communist government reversed many of the pro-business policies of Fulgencio Batista, the dictator backed by the US. The revolution ruptured ties between the two countries, with the US spy agency CIA trying several times unsuccessfully to topple Castro’s government.</p><p>Guatemala has moved closer to the US since the election of <a href=\"/news/2024/1/15/guatemalas-arevalo-becomes-president-on-anticorruption-plank-amid-chaos\">Bernardo Arevalo </a>as the president in January 2024. He has cooperated with US President Donald Trump’s administration. Last year, Guatemala <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/guatemala-agrees-to-increase-number-of-us-deportation-flights-it-accepts\">agreed to ramp up</a> the number of deportation flights it receives from the US. The US has deported thousands of immigrants without following due process to third countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador, which are headed by pro-Trump leaders.</p><p>In November 2018, shortly after Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro as president, Cuba announced its withdrawal from the country’s Cuba “Mais Medicos” (More Doctors) programme. Bolsonaro, who is known as Brazil’s Trump, had criticised the medical mission, deeming it “slave labour”. Bolsonaro is serving a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/brazils-supreme-court-orders-jair-bolsonaro-to-begin-prison-sentence\">27-year prison sentence</a> after he was convicted in September 2025 of plotting to stage a coup in order to retain power after his defeat in the 2022 presidential election.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-targeting-cuba-s-global-medical-missions\">Why is the US targeting Cuba’s global medical missions?</h2><p>The US has deemed Cuba’s foreign medical missions a form of “forced labour” and human trafficking, without any evidence, and has a goal of restricting the Cuban government’s access to its largest source of foreign income.</p><p>US efforts to curb Cuba’s medical missions are not new. Just last year, Washington imposed visa restrictions aimed at discouraging foreign governments from entering into medical cooperation agreements with Cuba.</p><p>In February last year, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would restrict visas targeting “forced labor linked to the Cuban labor export program”.</p><p>“This expanded policy applies to current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program, particularly Cuba’s overseas medical missions,” a statement on the US State Department’s website said.</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban origin, has been a vocal critic of Havana, and has pushed US policies in Latin America, including the military operation to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">abduct</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3. Under Trump, Washington has pushed its focus on Latin America as part of its Western Hemisphere pivot, which seeks to restore Washington’s preeminence in the region.</p><p>Since Maduro’s abduction, the US focus has turned towards Cuba. Senior US officials, particularly Rubio, hinted that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">Havana could be the next target</a> of Washington’s pressure campaign.</p><p>The US, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">in effect, cut off Venezuelan oil</a> shipments to Cuba as part of a new oil blockade. Havana has faced sweeping US sanctions for decades, and Cuba has since 2000 increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>The blockade has caused a fuel shortage and, in turn, <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/8/from-blackouts-to-food-shortages-how-us-blockade-is-crippling-life-in-cuba\">a severe energy crisis in Cuba</a>. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has imposed harsh emergency restrictions as a response.</p><p>This has renewed US pressure on countries to phase out Cuban medical missions.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-cuban-doctors-are-on-missions-abroad\">How many Cuban doctors are on missions abroad?</h2><p>More than 24,000 Cuban doctors are working in 56 countries worldwide. This includes Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Mexico; Africa, including Angola, Mozambique, Algeria; and the Middle East, including Qatar.</p><p>There have been occasional deployments in other countries. For instance, Italy received Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic to help overwhelmed hospitals in some of its hardest-hit regions.</p><p>Cuban doctors are crucial for Caribbean countries. They fill a significant gap in medical care amid a lack of trained medical professionals.</p><h2><span>Have countries resisted US pressure in the past?</span></h2><p>Caribbean countries <a href=\"/news/2025/3/15/why-are-caribbean-leaders-fighting-trump-to-keep-cuban-doctors\">hit back</a> in March 2025 against the US threats to restrict visas. “We could not get through the pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors,” Barbados’s Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a speech to the parliament.</p><p>“Out of the blue now, we have been called human traffickers because we hire technical people who we pay top dollar,” Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley said back then, adding that he was prepared to lose his US visa.</p><p data-start=\"4903\" data-end=\"5051\">“If the Cubans are not there, we may not be able to run the service,” Saint Vincent and the Grenadines then-Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. “I will prefer to lose my visa than to have 60 poor and working people die.”</p><p>In August 2025, the US announced that it was revoking the visas of Brazilian, African and Caribbean officials over their ties to Cuba’s programme that sends doctors abroad.</p><p>It named Brazilian Ministry of Health officials, Mozart Julio Tabosa Sales and Alberto Kleiman, who had their visas revoked for working on Brazil’s Mais Medicos, or “More Doctors” programme, which was created in 2013.</p><p>Some countries are now finding ways around the pressure from Washington. For instance, this month Guyana announced that it would start paying doctors directly, rather than through the Cuban government.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"1028\">A parade of Western leaders to Beijing, including French President Emmanuel Macron in December,  and more recently, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the United Kingdom’s Keir Starmer, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz planning a visit later this month, might suggest a great geopolitical realignment in the making. But to interpret these visits as a strategic defection from the United States is to mistake tactical adaptation for fundamental realignment. What we are witnessing is the pursuit of economic pragmatism alongside enduring security alliances, a balancing act that China’s charm offensive has not fundamentally disrupted.</p><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"1028\">The initial phase of President Donald Trump’s second term saw US allies pursuing a delicate balancing act, engaging in strategic hedging by maintaining economic ties with China while aligning strategically with Washington against perceived threats from Beijing and Moscow. However, Trump’s prolonged trade wars, rough treatment of European and North American partners, and coercive threats shattered illusions of a united Western front. This disorientation soon found its voice in Canadian PM Carney’s Davos speech.</p><p data-start=\"1539\" data-end=\"1890\">He declared the end of the US-led, rules-based international order, framing the situation not as a transition but a “rupture”, where “the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must”. This crystallised the disillusionment, creating political and diplomatic cracks that Beijing was swift to explore and, if possible, exploit.</p><p data-start=\"1892\" data-end=\"2559\">Against this backdrop, the diplomatic pivot to Beijing reveals its true meaning: Western leaders are not embracing China but pursuing what Carney termed a “third path” for middle powers, a quest for “strategic autonomy” in energy, critical minerals, and supply chains to avoid becoming collateral in great power coercion. These visits focus on economic diversification and risk mitigation, not replacing one patron with another. The evidence from these visits reveals the severe limits of Beijing’s courtship. Joint statements emphasise practical cooperation but avoid any fundamental strategic shift, underscoring their transactional, not transformational, nature.</p><p data-start=\"2561\" data-end=\"3716\">This pattern highlights a critical reality: economic pragmatism confronts an immovable priority, foundational security. A stark demonstration of this priority came when Australia moved to reclaim the Port of Darwin from its Chinese lessee, despite the port’s profitability and official reviews finding no security threat. That the formal assessments found no immediate security risk only reinforces the point: in moments of strategic uncertainty, perception and alliance alignment can outweigh technocratic evaluations, signalling where ultimate loyalties lie.</p><p data-start=\"2561\" data-end=\"3716\">In alliance politics, signalling often matters as much as assessment. Even with deep and structurally significant European Union-China trade, European allies safeguard US intelligence sharing and defence commitments. Despite rhetorical tensions with Washington, European states have increased defence spending towards NATO’s 2 percent benchmark and deepened military coordination over Ukraine, reinforcing the institutional bedrock of transatlantic security. Their discontent fuels appeals for restraint, not support for China-led confrontation, revealing a gap rooted in deeper issues than trade.</p><p data-start=\"3718\" data-end=\"4693\">Beneath the transactional politics lies a civilisational schism, a chasm that neither diplomatic niceties nor economic pragmatism can bridge. For Europe, Canada and Australia, a legacy of shared Western identity permeates elite consciousness, fostering assumptions of cultural affinity amplified by visceral fears that China’s state-driven capitalist model poses a systemic threat to the liberal-democratic order. This identity is not merely cultural but institutional, embedded in NATO interoperability, Five Eyes intelligence integration and decades of joint operational planning. This unease transcends protectionism, representing an existential struggle to preserve institutional and ideological hegemony. The double standard is revealing: the US’s predatory behaviour is framed as a regrettable aberration, while China’s trade practices are cast as an inherent systemic challenge. Consequently, trade disputes with Washington fade against this deeper dissonance.</p><p data-start=\"4695\" data-end=\"5270\">For key Asian allies like Japan and South Korea, the US alliance is foundational to their sovereignty. Their post-war identities were forged under US security patronage, with integrated defence systems and political cultures creating deep bonds. To Tokyo and Seoul, China’s rise stirs historical anxieties about falling into a new sphere of influence. Thus, even as South Korea’s chip giants lobbied against decoupling from China, they reinforced joint research with the US, viewing the cost of ties with Washington as trivial against the risk of Chinese regional dominance.</p><p data-start=\"5272\" data-end=\"5768\">This loyalty is most evident in intelligence sharing. For Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the Five Eyes network, rooted in Allied World War II code-breaking, represents a strategic DNA common with Washington. Real-time intelligence sharing builds trust beyond mere profits. Australia knows China could disrupt its iron ore exports, yet it still bans Huawei from 5G networks. This reflects a civilisational kinship, a bond no Chinese trade deal can replace, as defiance would risk strategic suicide.</p><p data-start=\"5770\" data-end=\"6391\">This deep-seated allegiance sets the non-negotiable boundaries within which economic hedging occurs. German automakers may oppose US tech bans, Australian universities may host Confucius Institutes, and Japan may route exports through Chinese factories. They may even lend rhetorical support to China’s WTO appeals against US tariffs. Yet, when asked to side with Beijing against Washington on upholding the rules-based order, these allies hesitate, consistently choosing alliance management over systemic defence. The calculus remains clear: trade with China aids prosperity, but an alliance with the US ensures survival.</p><p data-start=\"6393\" data-end=\"7313\">Thus persists an unbroken chain of allegiance, a case of what might be called “calculated hypocrisy”. By this, I mean a pattern in which allies publicly criticise Washington’s coercive tactics while privately reinforcing the security architecture that depends upon them. Allies openly critique Washington’s coercive tactics while quietly sheltering under its security umbrella, invoking a rules-based order they expect China to obey, yet hesitate to enforce when the US bends the rules. Despite US economic uncertainty and Chinese clean-tech dominance, Washington’s alliance network remains its key advantage. Decades of military drills, academic exchanges, and shared values create resilience that Chinese chequebook diplomacy cannot crack. For all its dominance in rare earth refining and its growing strength across AI supply chains and ecosystems, China still lacks the trust to turn partners into strategic allies.</p><p data-start=\"7315\" data-end=\"7951\">Ultimately, the visits to Beijing signal a broader ailment: the failure of coercive US policy to maintain alliance unity. Yet engagement with China is no cure. The “third path” remains an uncertain experiment, constrained by a hard truth: while allies seek autonomy, they lack a realistic alternative to US security protection. The emerging order will be defined by this tense balance, assertive hedging, not decisive realignment. They may distance themselves from US unilateralism, but they are not entering Beijing’s orbit. Their cautious, pragmatic course reveals the great illusion: this is a story of resilience, not realignment.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8324\">The success of this manoeuvring depends on resolving a core contradiction: pursuing strategic autonomy while relying on a security protectorate that often undermines it. Coercion may undermine cohesion, but structural integration preserves it. Hence, the “third path” is less a stable course than a perpetual, perilous balancing act over the abyss of great-power rivalry.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8324\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But the devastating injury has put a spotlight on the importance of bindings, which hold boots to the skis and remain some of the oldest technology in the sport.</p><p>Officials told The Associated Press news agency that a binding system designed to automatically release skis when a racer like Vonn loses control is still in the drawing-board phase after years of stalled discussions.</p><p>“Unfortunately, sometimes it does take horrific accidents to shine even more of a light on what can be done,” said Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the US Ski and Snowboard Association. “It’s an area we can’t be competitive in; we’ve all got to be in it together with our different country counterparts and FIS [the International Ski and Snowboard Federation].”</p><p>Bindings haven’t significantly changed in their basic design for half a century: Once a skier steps in toes first and then locks in by stepping down with the heel, pressure needs to be applied for the system to release the boot. Less-skilled skiers have bindings that release more easily to avoid leg injuries. The higher the skill level and the more serious the skiing, the more the bindings are cranked down to keep elite racers on their skis.</p><p>Few were surprised that Vonn’s skis did not release. The question is whether they should have.</p><h2 id=\"a-smarter-binding\">A ‘smarter’ binding</h2><p>A “smart binding” system based on an algorithm and designed to automatically release when a skier loses control “would have surely” helped prevent Vonn from breaking her leg, said Peter Gerdol, the FIS women’s race director at the Olympics and on the World Cup circuit.</p><p>“That’s exactly what the system will be designed to do,” Gerdol told AP. “Her skis would have definitely popped off. … We’ve seen a lot of other cases in which the bindings don’t open and it results in knee issues, especially when the still-attached ski acts as a lever, either on the net or on the snow or on a gate or on any other obstacle. The leg becomes blocked, and the knee gives out.”</p><p>Nine days before her Olympic crash in Italy, Vonn tore the ACL in her left knee in a crash in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. She ended up in the safety nets with her skis still attached.</p><p>A smart binding system could borrow technology from the safety air bag system that became mandatory for skiers this season in the speed events.</p><p>“It’s still going to take time to develop, but the idea is that the binding would be triggered by the same algorithm that prompts the airbag to inflate,” Gerdol said. “The heel piece would slide back, and the athlete’s skis would pop off.”</p><h2 id=\"algorithm-needs-to-be-adapted\">Algorithm needs to be adapted</h2><p>Dainese and its sister company, D-Air Lab, spent years developing an algorithm for airbags to inflate under skiers’ racing suits after creating a similar system for motorcycle racing.</p><p>In coordination with the FIS, Dainese is sharing the airbag algorithm with top binding suppliers, such as Look, Tyrolia, Salomon, Atomic and Marker to adapt the formula to release skis.</p><p>Releasing skis is potentially more dangerous than inflating an airbag. Elite skiers are sometimes capable of spectacular recoveries after flying into the air, and they also can often use their skis to brake before slamming into safety fences.</p><p>“It’s a very complicated project,” said Marco Pastore, a Dainese representative on the circuit for the airbag system. “If you release a binding, you’ve got to be absolutely sure you do it at the right moment. For the airbag, you can look at the rotations and the entire body position. But with the bindings, you’ve got to examine how the feet move, what the trajectory of the skis is, plus a series of other variables.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4322089\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4322089\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039600194520-1771410562.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"In this image taken from video provided by Olympic Broadcasting Services, OBS, United States' Lindsey Vonn lays on the course after crashing during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">American Lindsey Vonn lies on the course after crashing during an alpine women’s downhill race at the 2026 Winter Olympics[Screengrab/Olympic Broadcasting Services via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"finances-an-issue-for-complicated-safety-projects\">Finances an issue for complicated safety projects</h2><p>While the FIS wants to coordinate the project, issues remain over who will pay for it.</p><p>“These are very costly projects, and to be honest, Dainese has not made much” from the airbags, Pastore said. “Right now, it’s costing us money. Everyone wants these great things, but at the end of the day, someone has to pay for it.”</p><p>Sasha Rearick, the head coach of the United States men’s ski team from 2008 to 2018, recalls discussions about bindings when he was in charge of the World Cup coaches working group nearly a decade ago.</p><p>“The problem is that Dainese is the one who’s putting in the money and all the investments,” Rearick said. “So if they’re sharing it with the binding companies, the binding companies now need to invest heavily, and it probably costs [a lot].”</p><p>Head racing director Rainer Salzgeber, who is involved in the project via Tyrolia, added: “It’s already a lot.” He suggested a simpler and quicker solution for crashes like Vonn’s: gate panels that give way.</p><p>Markus Waldner, the men’s World Cup and Olympics race director, said earlier this season that FIS is “working with biomechanists and manufacturers to refine boot and binding standards to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic edge catches at high speed.”</p><p>Still, Gerdol suggested the project could be anywhere from two to six years away from being implemented.</p><h2 id=\"will-ski-racers-use-the-technology\">Will ski racers use the technology?</h2><p>To avoid skis popping off, ski technicians crank up racers’ bindings so they are virtually locked in.</p><p>Leo Mussi, the ski technician for American downhillers Bryce Bennett and Sam Morse, said he sets his racers’ bindings at up to 200kg (440lb) of pressure – more than double what a store-bought binding is even capable of.</p><p>Austrian racer Marco Schwarz suffered a serious knee injury in a December 2023 crash during the Bormio Alpine Ski World Cup downhill in Italy. His skis didn’t release as he slid into the safety netting.</p><p>“It’s tough to say,” he said of whether the skis popping off would’ve saved him from injury, and he added that he isn’t sure about changing things.</p><p>“The best way is to keep it simple,” Schwarz said. “I don’t want to push too much into more technology.”</p><p>Nina O’Brien, an American who had to endure four surgeries after a gruesome compound fracture at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, said she didn’t fault any equipment issues for her crash and credited her technician.</p><p>“Regardless if I’ve worn the skis that morning, clicked out and gotten a coffee,” O’Brien said, “when I step back in, he checks them to make sure they’re perfect.”</p><h2 id=\"advances-in-ski-racing-safety-have-been-slow\">Advances in ski racing safety have been slow</h2><p>The airbag system was first tested on the World Cup circuit in 2013 and only this season became mandatory for the speed events of downhill and super-G. In between, some skiers said the bags hindered their aerodynamics, were uncomfortable to wear or could actually cause injuries.</p><p>Safety issues became more of a pressing issue recently when Italian skier Matteo Franzoso died from a head injury caused in a crash during preseason training in Chile.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it always takes something serious to happen for people to say, ‘No. Now we need to do something,’” Pastore said.</p><p>This is also the first season in which a cut-resistant undergarment is required for all World Cup and Olympic events.</p><p>There is plenty of room for safety advancements. While the smart bindings system is being developed, Rearick – now the director of Apex 2100, an international ski academy in Tignes, France – suggested addressing the racing suits.</p><p>“Make one suit of material for everybody that’s a little bit warmer, that’s a little bit slower, that’s cut-proof,” Rearick said. “That will make the sport a lot safer for everybody.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a 2014 email (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01936285.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) regarding civil unrest in Syria, Libya, and Somalia, Epstein wrote to Barak, “isn’t this perfect for you”.</p><p>Barak replied, “You’re right in a way. But not simple to transform it into a cash flow.”</p><h2 id=\"field-proven-on-palestinians\">‘Field-proven’ on Palestinians</h2><p>The files detail how Israeli intelligence firms marketed their technology to Nigeria using euphemisms such as “field-proven”, a reference to systems deployed by the Israeli military against Palestinians under occupation.</p><p>In 2015, Barak and a business partner invested $15m in FST Biometrics, a firm founded by the former head of Israeli military intelligence, Aharon Ze’evi Farkash. The company’s core technology, a biometric system known as Basel, was originally prototyped at the Beit Hanoon (Erez) <a href=\"/features/2022/6/15/the-seven-border-crossings-of-gaza\">crossing</a> between Israel and the besieged Gaza Strip to control the movement of Palestinian workers.</p><p>While the Nigerian military battled Boko Haram, Barak facilitated the sale of similar biometric surveillance equipment to Babcock University, a Christian institution in Nigeria. The project was framed as a counterterrorism measure, with a press release at the time boasting that the technology would “filter away all unwanted persons”.</p><p>The emails suggest this initial foothold allowed Barak to institutionalise Israeli cyber-expertise within the Nigerian state. By 2020, the World Bank had tapped the Israel National Cyber Directorate and a startup cofounded by Barak to shape Nigeria’s national cyber-infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"resources-and-logistics\">Resources and logistics</h2><p>The documents indicate that security cooperation was often a pretext for accessing Nigeria’s vast resource wealth. Epstein facilitated high-level talks for DP World, aiming to secure ownership of ports in Lagos and Badagry.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, Epstein brokered discussions between Jide Zeitlin, then-chair of Nigeria’s sovereign investment fund, and bin Sulayem. The documents show Epstein attempting to navigate US sanctions on figures involved in the mining sector to facilitate these deals.</p><p>“I hope your pal’s sojourn in Tel Aviv … was more effective than his efforts on the African continent,” Zeitlin wrote (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02624197.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) to Epstein in September 2018, referring to the diplomatic normalisation Epstein and bin Sulayem were quietly cultivating between Israel and the United Arab Emirates years before the Abraham Accords.</p><h2 id=\"friends-for-israel\">‘Friends for Israel’</h2><p>The correspondence highlights the immense access Epstein and Barak secured within the Nigerian government. In 2013, Barak attended a cybersecurity conference in Abuja, which organisers privately described as a cover to arrange meetings with then-President Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>“The dinner is one other excellent way … to meet with good Friends of Israel and make new friends for Israel as well,” the event organiser wrote to Barak.</p><p>Following these meetings, Israeli defence contractor <a href=\"/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab\">Elbit Systems</a> proceeded with a controversial internet surveillance project in Nigeria, despite opposition from the country’s legislature.</p><p>The documents further reveal that Epstein coached Barak on how to parlay these security relationships into personal gain. When Barak shared financial details of a potential oil deal, Epstein responded (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02592783.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) with harsh advice: “I told you on the phone before sending or asking anyone about it you should do your own homework.”</p><p>The ties between <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.</p><p>The documents have revealed more details of Epstein’s interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak. But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army, and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services, the Mossad.</p><p>Barak, who led Israel from 1999 to 2001, has expressed remorse over his lengthy relationship with Epstein. However, despite Epstein having been convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008 and spending about a year in prison during the course of their relationship, Barak, maintaining a close personal and business relationship, claimed he was unaware of the scope of Epstein’s crimes until a wider inquiry into him was opened in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also took her sons.</p><p>Within 24 hours, five members of her family were dead, killed in separate “police encounters” across different districts of Pakistan’s Punjab – the province that alone is home to more than half of the country’s population.</p><p>Her sons Imran, 25, Irfan, 23, and Adnan, 18, along with two sons-in-law, were among them.</p><p>“They broke into our house in Bahawalpur and took everything we owned,” Zubaida told a fact-finding mission from Pakistan’s foremost rights group, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).</p><p>“We followed them to Lahore and begged for our sons’ release. The next morning, five of them were dead,” she added.</p><p>When she later filed a legal petition, Zubaida says police threatened to kill whoever remained in her family if she did not withdraw it.</p><p>Her husband, Abdul Jabbar, insists his sons had no criminal records. “They were working men, married with children,” he said.</p><p>The family’s account sits at the centre of an explosive HRCP fact-finding report, published on February 17, which concludes that Punjab’s Crime Control Department (CCD) is pursuing what it calls “a systemic policy of extrajudicial killing in contravention of the law and Constitution”.</p><p>The HRCP documented at least 670 “encounters”, resulting in 924 suspected deaths between April 2025, when the unit was formed, and December 2025.</p><p>The CCD, formally constituted in April last year, was mandated to combat serious and organised crime.</p><p>But the HRCP describes it as a “parallel police force” operating with virtual impunity, linking it to a sharp spike in encounter killings that has ignited debate over the rule of law and the state’s duty to protect the right to life.</p><p>Farah Zia, the HRCP’s director, says Punjab was historically where encounter killings first took root in the 1960s, “partly because of an already existing policing culture where there was impunity for torture”.</p><p>She said the practice later spread to other provinces. HRCP’s annual State of Human Rights reports document hundreds of police encounters each year elsewhere, particularly in Sindh.</p><p>“That the governments choose to apply such short-term, unsustainable and illegal measures to curb crime rather than invest in better forensic investigation techniques, community-based policing and more effective prosecution has not helped matters,” Zia told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-force-a-sharp-rise\">A new force, a sharp rise</h2><p>Under the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the CCD was established with the stated aim of helping bring to fruition the provincial government’s “Safe Punjab” vision.</p><p>It is a specialised force aimed at tackling serious and organised crime, inter-district gangs and hardened offenders whom regular police struggle to combat.</p><p>Maryam, daughter of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and niece of current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, belongs to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.</p><p>Within weeks of the CCD’s formation, a sustained rise in police encounters was recorded across Punjab. More than 900 suspects were killed in eight months. In the same period, two police personnel were killed and 36 were injured.</p><p>By comparison, HRCP’s annual report for 2024 recorded 341 suspects killed in encounters across Punjab and Sindh combined over the entire year. The CCD, operating in a single province, more than doubled that toll in less than eight months.</p><p>The highest concentration of killings occurred in Lahore, with 139 encounters, followed by Faisalabad with 55 and Sheikhupura with 47.</p><p>The largest category of suspects killed was those accused of dacoity, armed gang robbery, accounting for 366 deaths. Narcotics-related suspects accounted for 114 deaths, robbery suspects 138, and those accused in murder cases, 99.</p><h2 id=\"a-familiar-script\">A familiar script</h2><p>Drawing on multiple police reports filed after the killings, the commission describes how a CCD team typically intercepts suspects, almost invariably on motorcycles and described as moving “suspiciously”, typically at night or at a roadblock.</p><p>The suspects allegedly react aggressively and open fire first, forcing police to respond in self-defence. During the exchange, the suspects are hit while their accomplices escape, “taking advantage of the dark”.</p><p>HRCP notes what it calls “strikingly similar” wording in numerous FIRs, including accounts in which a wounded suspect briefly regains consciousness and, just before dying, volunteers his full name, parentage, home address and criminal history to the officers who have shot him.</p><p>The commission found identical phrases appearing across districts, dates and alleged crimes, suggesting “copy-paste structuring rather than incident-specific reporting”.</p><p>Official police media releases issued after each encounter and circulated to crime reporters via WhatsApp groups often also reproduce the same sequence almost verbatim, emphasising the deceased’s alleged criminal record while omitting procedural details.</p><p>Asad Jamal, a Lahore-based human rights lawyer who has long worked on encounter cases, said the chief minister, Maryam Nawaz, has repeatedly claimed that crime in Punjab has been curtailed, suggesting the approach reflects a policy decision at the highest political level. He expressed scepticism about prospects for accountability.</p><p>“They seem to think that if the crime rate is lowered,” Jamal told Al Jazeera, they are justified in resorting to “extrajudicial killings” – instead of improving investigation techniques, better resources for law enforcement and improved intelligence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4322155\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322155\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4322155\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-10T182435Z_1475691388_RC229HATPALG_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PAKISTAN-PROTEST-1771411820.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C525&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police officers stand as they use tear gas to disperse supporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) during a solidarity march for Gaza in Lahore, Pakistan, October 10, 2025.

Whether crime is addressed through investigation, prosecution and a judicial process, or through summary execution, goes to the heart of what kind of state Punjab seeks to be, the commission argues.</p><p>The commission says families reported being told to bury their dead immediately, before independent postmortem examinations could take place.</p><p>The HRCP said it received no data from Punjab Police after requesting material on encounter procedures, and written requests to meet senior police and provincial officials went unanswered.</p><p>Al Jazeera also repeatedly contacted Punjab police officials, including the CCD, as well as Information Minister Azma Bokhari and Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, but received no replies.</p><p>A former senior Punjab police official, who retired in the 2010s, said two main factors drive the rise in encounter killings: an overburdened and often corrupt justice system, and political pressure to demonstrate control over crime.</p><p>Court delays and weak prosecutions create “frustration amongst the people and the police, and they start legitimising short cuts like extrajudicial killings”, he said.</p><p>“The political government wants to be seen as controlling crime, even violating due process. This approach also encourages police to resort to extrajudicial killings, knowing there won’t be any accountability for such actions,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.</p><h2 id=\"a-decade-of-encounters\">A decade of encounters</h2><p>The HRCP’s annual reports show nearly 5,000 encounter cases nationwide over the past decade to 2024, with almost 2,000 in Punjab alone.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2023, encounter figures in Punjab hovered below 400 annually, suggesting a persistent but relatively stable baseline.</p><p>In 2024, however, the number surged to 1,008, more than tripling from the previous year. The latest report records fewer encounters overall but a significantly higher number of fatalities.</p><p>The HRCP and independent observers have repeatedly characterised many such incidents as staged or fake encounters, effectively extrajudicial killings in which suspects are executed rather than arrested.</p><p>Rida Hosain, a Lahore-based lawyer, said encounter killings and extrajudicial violence are a “relic of colonial control structures and military dictatorships” that treated citizens as subjects rather than rights-bearing individuals entitled to a fair trial and due process.</p><p>“The Punjab government frames these measures as a pathway to ‘zero crime’, when in fact it appears to institutionalise another form of criminality: state-sanctioned criminality. Once state-sanctioned violence is normalised, it rarely remains confined to alleged ‘criminals’,” Hosain told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The government may claim that the hundreds killed are ‘criminals’, but guilt must be determined through due process, not summary executions. If this violence goes unquestioned, tomorrow’s targets could be dissidents, even innocent bystanders labelled as ‘criminals’ to justify killing with impunity,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I believe so.</p><p>“It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal,” Mourinho continued. “Unfortunately, [he was] not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.</p><p>“I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back.

Nothing that happened today is new in my life or my family’s life,” Vinicius wrote.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-have-real-madrid-said-about-the-allegations-against-prestianni\">What else have Real Madrid said about the allegations against Prestianni?</h2><p>Real Madrid defender and England international Trent Alexander-Arnold spoke to the media after the game to condemn the incident.</p><p>“What has happened is a disgrace to football and overshadowed the performance, as well as an amazing goal,” said Alexander-Arnold.</p><p>“Vini has been subject to this a few times throughout his career.

It is disgusting.”</p><h2 id=\"has-mbappe-called-for-prestianni-to-be-banned\">Has Mbappe called for Prestianni to be banned?</h2><p>Mbappe said he had been prepared to leave the pitch immediately but was persuaded by Vinicius to continue playing, before the referee intervened, as per protocol.</p><p>“We cannot accept that there is a player in Europe’s top football competition who behaves like this. This guy [Prestianni] doesn’t deserve to play ⁠in the Champions League any more,” Mbappe told reporters.</p><p>“We have to set an example for all the children watching us at home. What happened today is the kind ⁠of thing we cannot accept because the world is watching us.”</p><p>When asked ⁠whether Prestianni had apologised, Mbappe laughed.</p><p>“Of course not,” he said.</p><p>Former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf was among the first to react to Mourinho’s comments.</p><p>“He is still emotional, [but] he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse,” Seedorf told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“He’s saying it’s OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist, and I think that is very wrong.”</p><p>“We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people. I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me, but he expressed himself a bit unfortunately.”</p><p>Former England international Theo Walcott also criticised Mourinho.</p><p>“I am quite calm and composed, and I am not someone who gets angry often,” the former Arsenal forward told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football, but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn’t have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.”</p><h2 id=\"former-barcelona-forward-supports-vinicius\">Former Barcelona forward supports Vinicius</h2><p>Speaking on CBS, former France, Arsenal and Barcelona forward Thierry Henry said he could understand fully how Vinicius was feeling.</p><p>“I can relate to what Vinicius Junior is going through. That happened to me so many times on the field. At times, you feel lonely because it’s going to be your word against his word, because we don’t know what he has said,” Henry said.</p><p>“He put his shirt over his mouth. Clearly, already, he looks suspicious because he didn’t want people to see what he said.”</p><p>“Let’s see how big of a man Prestianni is – tell us what you said.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Addis Ababa also accuses Eritrea of arming rebels in the vast Horn of Africa country.</p><p>Observers say the heightening tensions point to an impending war between the two countries – one that could once again involve Tigray.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320073\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320073\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PHOTO-2026-02-17-17-08-09-1771345518.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4320073\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Saba Gedion, 21, sells coffee on a street in Tigray [Zantana Gebru/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"unhealed-scars-of-war\">Unhealed scars of war</h2><p>In Tigray’s capital, a once-booming city of tourism and business, most streets are quiet.</p><p>The young people who previously frequented cafes are now often seen applying for visas and speaking with smugglers in the hope of leaving Tigray.</p><p>Helen Gessese, 36, lives in a makeshift IDP camp on the outskirts of Mekelle.

The accusation was a first from the prime minister, following repeated denials by his government about reported mass killings, looting and the destruction of factories by Eritrean troops during the Tigray conflict.</p><p>Eritrea’s government rejected Abiy’s claims about atrocities, with Gebremeskel calling them <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-eritrea-tigray-war-108f32cdd0c24ed009bb623b597b7c96\">“cheap and despicable lies”</a>, noting that Abiy’s government had until recently been “showering praises and state medals” on Eritrean army officers.</p><p>As the tensions escalate, many observers say war between the two is now inevitable and have called for dialogue and the de-escalation of the situation.</p><p>“The situation remains highly volatile and we fear that it will deteriorate, worsening the region’s already precarious human rights and humanitarian situation,” the United Nations Human Rights spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said this month.</p><p>Kjetil Tronvoll, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Oslo New University College, told Al Jazeera a new war would have “wide-reaching implications for the region” – regardless of the outcome.</p><p>He believes the looming conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea could take the shape of a new civil war, positioning Addis Ababa against Tigray’s leadership yet again.</p><p>From Ethiopia’s side, he argues the objective would be regime change in both Asmara and Mekelle, noting that “regime change in Eritrea may lead to Ethiopia gaining control of Assab”. For Asmara and Mekelle, the aim would also be regime change in Addis Ababa, he suggests.</p><p>“If it erupts, it will be devastating for Tigray,” Tronvoll said. “The outcome of such a war will likely fundamentally alter the political landscape of Ethiopia and the Horn [of Africa],” he warned, pointing out that regional states could also be pulled into a proxy war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320067\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320067\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4ad31a25-5e0b-432b-a005-913e4d7923ac-1771345507.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C590&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People in Tigray are afraid renewed tensions may bring another war [Zantana Gebru/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fears-for-the-future\">Fears for the future</h2><p>For many in Tigray, memories of massacres committed during the 2020-2022 war are still fresh.</p><p>Axum, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the central zone of the Tigray region, is known for its tall obelisk relics of an ancient kingdom.

Israel’s genocidal war has killed at least 72,061 people and wounded 171,715 since October 2023, according to the Ministry of Health. It has also shattered infrastructure and displaced the majority of the population. Financial hardship dominated conversations in markets this week.</p><p>“There is no cash among the people. There is no work. It is indeed Ramadan, but Ramadan requires money,” said Gaza City resident Waleed Zaqzouq, calling on merchants to recognise people’s economic struggles.</p><p>“Before the war, people lived a dignified life,” he added. “The situation has completely changed in the war, meaning people have been devastated and worn down.”</p><p>Harsh winter conditions have intensified suffering, with extreme cold killing children, and torrential rains flooding displacement camps and collapsing damaged buildings.</p><p>“There is much that has changed from this Ramadan to Ramadan before the war,” reflected Raed Koheel from Gaza City. “In the past, the atmosphere was more delightful. The streets were lit up with decorations. All streets had decorations. Our children were happy.”</p><p>Nevertheless, amid the overwhelming destruction, some Palestinians endeavour to maintain Ramadan traditions. In Khan Younis, calligrapher Hani Dahman painted “Welcome, Ramadan” in Arabic among the ruins as children looked on.</p><p>“We are here in Khan Younis camp, trying to bring happiness to the hearts of children, women, men and entire families,” Dahman said. “We are … sending a message to the world that we are people who seek life.”</p><p>Decorative Ramadan lights now hang among the debris. Mohammed Taniri, witnessing these efforts, observed: “When they provide such beautiful, simple decorations, it brings joy to the children. Despite all the hardships, they are trying to create a beautiful atmosphere.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
