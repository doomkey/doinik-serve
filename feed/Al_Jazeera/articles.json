The island’s Interior Ministry, however, framed the border patrol’s actions as part of its larger defence of Cuba’s national sovereignty.</p><p>“In the face of current challenges, Cuba reaffirms its determination to protect its territorial waters, based on the principle that national defense is a fundamental pillar of the Cuban State in safeguarding its sovereignty and ensuring stability in the region,” the ministry <a href=\"https://x.com/EmbaCubaUS/status/2026732911114760673?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><h2 id=\"tense-relations-with-the-us\">Tense relations with the US</h2><p>The shootout comes at a delicate time for Cuba’s international relations, as it becomes increasingly isolated — and as the US threatens military action in Latin America.</p><p>One of Cuba’s closest regional allies, for instance, has seen upheaval at the hands of US forces. On January 3, US President Donald Trump authorised an early-morning military operation to abduct then-President Nicolas Maduro, transporting him to the US for trial.</p><p>Shortly after the attack, Trump and his officials issued statements suggesting they would welcome the fall of Cuba’s communist government.</p><p>“Look, if I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a longtime anti-Cuba hawk, told reporters.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, was more blunt. “Cuba looks like it’s ready to fall,” he said in the immediate aftermath of the Venezuela attack.</p><p>In the weeks since, the US announced it would cut off supplies of Venezuelan money and oil to Cuba, and on January 29, it imposed an oil blockade on the island, threatening Cuba’s trading partners with sanctions.</p><p>In an executive <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">order</a>, Trump accused Cuba of representing an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US, citing its ties with adversarial governments like those in Iran, China and Russia.</p><p>“The Government of Cuba has taken extraordinary actions that harm and threaten the United States,” Trump wrote in the order. “The regime aligns itself with — and provides support for — numerous hostile countries, transnational terrorist groups, and malign actors adverse to the United States.”</p><p>Cuba is one of several countries that have been subject to a “maximum pressure” campaign under Trump, who has sought to exert increasing influence over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Relations with the US, however, have long been tense. As far back as 1958, Cuba came under a US arms embargo that was later expanded in the 1960s to a full trade embargo, spanning all products and services.</p><p>The embargo cut Cuba off from one of its closest trading partners at the time. Officials and rights experts have also argued that the historically long embargo worsened humanitarian conditions on the island, which has suffered from a weakened economy and supply shortages.</p><h2 id=\"history-of-shootouts\">History of shootouts</h2><p>The US government, however, has cited a history of human rights abuses on the island as a reason for maintaining economic sanctions against Cuba.</p><p>In 2021, during Trump’s first term, Cuba’s Ministry of the Interior and its leader, Minister Lazaro Alvarez Casas, were both <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sanctioned</a> as “perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world”.</p><p>The Cuban government has faced decades of accusations that it restricts free speech and violently represses dissent.</p><p>It also has a history of engaging in violent shootouts with boats it accuses of violating its territorial sovereignty.</p><p>The political repression, combined with economic turmoil, has forced many Cubans to flee the country over the past six decades.</p><p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the early 2020s, for instance, one of Cuba’s main industries, tourism, saw a stark drop in revenue.</p><p>That, in turn, caused dire shortages of basic supplies, prompting nearly two million people — more than 10 percent of the population — to leave the island.</p><p>But the Cuban government has, at times, responded with violence to irregular migration from the island.</p><p>In June 2022, for instance, Cuba reported two shootouts in quick succession involving speedboats accused of smuggling its citizens abroad. One, on June 18 of that year, resulted in an officer wounded. A second, on June 27, resulted in the death of a person on board the speedboat.</p><p>In such cases, the Cuban government has typically framed the violence as spurred by the actions of the speedboats in question. It has also cited the need to protect its territory and stability.</p><p>There are activist networks, particularly in the large Cuban American community in South Florida, that have worked for decades to help refugees escape from the island.</p><p>But they, too, have experienced losses. One of the most famous incidents came in 1996, when a small plane piloted by the activist group Brothers to the Rescue was shot down by the Cuban military.</p><p>Florida politicians were among the first to condemn Wednesday’s shooting. Congressmember Carlos Gimenez, a Republican who represents the Florida Keys and southern Miami, indicated that the incident “raises serious concerns about the use of lethal force”.</p><p>“United States authorities must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents and establish exactly what occurred,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/2026750391145181459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>Gimenez, who was born in Havana and fled the Cuban Revolution, then called for an end to Cuba’s communist government.</p><p>“The regime in Cuba must be relegated to the dustbin of history for its countless crimes against humanity,” he said.</p><p>Senator Rick Scott of Florida reposted Gimenez’s appeal for an investigation and added his own <a href=\"https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/2026762373353165312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">message</a> of condemnation: “The Communist Cuban regime must be held accountable!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Fuel, food and spare parts vanished almost overnight. This character-led documentary shows how common Cubans refused to give up – and instead built a new culture of radical repair. From Havana’s Malecon to small-town back yards, it follows mechanics, street vendors and a teacher-turned-inventor who live by one rule: “invent and resolve”.</p><p>A pristine US Plymouth Fury convertible of the 1950s hides a Soviet engine, Japanese gearbox and handmade parts; washing machines become coconut graters, solar dryers and tools for urban farms. Cuban historians and designer Ernesto Oroza reveal the philosophy behind this “technical disobedience”, treating every object as raw material to hack and extend. Far from nostalgia, the film offers a stark snapshot of a future in which resources are scarce and the power to repair may be our most important tool.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 25 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">25 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div><div class=\"google-preferred-source\"><button class=\"google-preferred-source__button\" aria-label=\"Add Al Jazeera on Google\" data-testid=\"google-preferred-source-button\"><svg class=\"icon icon--plus2 icon--primary icon--12 google-preferred-source__add-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>plus2</title><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M10.571 13.429H3.43c-.405 0-.744-.137-1.018-.411A1.382 1.382 0 0 1 2 12c0-.405.137-.744.41-1.018.275-.274.614-.41 1.019-.41h7.142V3.428c0-.405.137-.744.411-1.018C11.256 2.137 11.595 2 12 2s.744.137 1.018.41c.274.275.41.614.41 1.019v7.142h7.143c.405 0 .744.137 1.018.411.274.274.411.613.411 1.018s-.137.744-.41 1.018c-.274.274-.614.41-1.019.41H13.43v7.143c0 .405-.137.744-.411 1.018-.274.274-.613.411-1.018.411s-.744-.137-1.018-.41a1.382 1.382 0 0 1-.41-1.019V13.43Z\"></path></svg><svg class=\"icon icon--google icon--primary icon--16 google-preferred-source__google-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 17 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>google</title><g fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-path=\"url(#a)\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"><path fill=\"#4285F4\" d=\"M16.18 8.181c0-.567-.051-1.112-.145-1.636H8.5v3.094h4.305a3.68 3.68 0 0 1-1.596 2.415v2.007h2.585c1.513-1.393 2.386-3.443 2.386-5.88Z\"></path><path fill=\"#34A853\" d=\"M8.5 16c2.16 0 3.971-.717 5.295-1.939l-2.586-2.007c-.716.48-1.633.764-2.709.764-2.083 0-3.847-1.407-4.476-3.298H1.35v2.072A7.997 7.997 0 0 0 8.501 16Z\"></path><path fill=\"#FBBC05\" d=\"M4.024 9.519c-.16-.48-.251-.993-.251-1.52s.09-1.04.25-1.52V4.406H1.352A7.997 7.997 0 0 0 .5 8c0 1.29.31 2.513.85 3.593l2.674-2.073Z\"></path><path fill=\"#EA4335\" d=\"M8.5 3.182c1.175 0 2.23.403 3.058 1.196l2.295-2.294C12.467.793 10.656 0 8.5 0a7.997 7.997 0 0 0-7.149 4.407L4.024 6.48C4.653 4.59 6.417 3.182 8.5 3.182Z\"></path></g><defs><clippath id=\"a\"><path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M.5 0h16v16H.5z\"></path></clippath></defs></svg><span class=\"google-preferred-source__text\">Add Al Jazeera on Google</span></button><button tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"See more of Al Jazeera’s trusted journalism by adding us as a preferred source on Google.\" class=\"tooltip-accessible_trigger\"><svg class=\"icon icon--info icon--primary icon--16 google-preferred-source__info-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>info</title><path class=\"icon-main-color\" d=\"M12 0a12 12 0 1 0 0 24 12 12 0 0 0 0-24Zm-.226 3.225a2.039 2.039 0 0 1 2.155 1.924v.193a1.998 1.998 0 0 1-2.155 2.149 2.029 2.029 0 0 1-2.146-2.15 2.039 2.039 0 0 1 1.955-2.122h.193l-.002.006Zm3.227 15.525a.75.75 0 0 1-.752.75H9.75a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75v-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 .752-.75h.748V12h-.75a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75v-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 .752-.751h3a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.752v6.75h.75a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.749L15 18.75Z\"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

language – as two Black actors presented an award.</p><p>The guest, activist John Davidson, was the real-life inspiration behind a BAFTA-nominated film, I Swear, that promoted awareness about people with Tourette syndrome.</p><p>The obscene language was heard in the final broadcast as well as on the BBC’s streaming service until Monday morning.</p><h2 id=\"opposite-of-what-i-believe\">‘Opposite of what I believe’</h2><p>Davidson said he “felt a wave of shame” over what happened and is “mortified” ⁠if anyone mistook his involuntary tics as deliberate.</p><p>“I want people to know and understand that my tics have absolutely nothing to do with what I think, feel or believe,” Davidson said in an interview with Variety.</p><p>“It’s an involuntary neurological misfire. My tics are not an intention, not a choice and not a reflection of my values. What you hear me shouting is literally the last thing in the world I believe; it is the opposite of what I believe,” he added.</p><p>The BBC said it was a “serious mistake” not to edit out the slur. Its Executive Complaints Unit was tasked with carrying out a “fast-tracked investigation and provide a full response to complainants”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>BBC News reported producers monitoring the event, which removed another racial slur from the broadcast, did not hear a second slur.

It holds no real value or credibility,” it said in a statement released by state media.</p><p>The report said Rouhani’s alleged attempt to overthrow 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and rebrand the Islamic Republic failed after Iran’s security chief Ali Larijani refused to support it. Larijani has now been given expanded powers <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/irans-fm-says-deal-with-us-within-reach-if-diplomacy-given-priority\">in case of war with the United States</a>, according to Western media reports this week.</p><p>Rouhani and Zarif were placed under arrest shortly after thousands were killed on the nights of January 8 and 9 during the anti-establishment protests, according to the French report.</p><p>The claim of the arrests was first raised last month by two hardline politicians, including a lawmaker, but was denied by Rouhani and Zarif separately at the time. Appearing next to former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, Rouhani also released photos from a funeral event to show he was not under arrest.</p><p>On Tuesday, Rouhani’s office slammed the reports that he was positioning himself to replace Khamenei – who has been in power for 36 years – and framed it as a “continuation of the psychological operations of American and Israeli sources”.</p><p>The former president said in a statement that the reports were aimed at creating “doubt and concern among public opinion in Iran to complete their [the US and Israel] maximum pressure through economic sanctions and military threats”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reformist-challenges\">Reformist challenges</h2><p>In its statement on Wednesday, the Iranian embassy in France also rejected any connection between the arrests of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/iran-arrests-prominent-reformists-over-deadly-january-unrest\">top reformist leaders</a> earlier this month and the alleged neutralised power grab scheme.</p><p>The arrests “were solely related to public statements and the issuance of declarations made during the unrest” in January, according to the embassy.</p><p>Some of the reformists have since been released after posting considerable bail, but several remained incarcerated as they had previous political prison sentences hanging over their cases with judicial and intelligence authorities.</p><p>The most damning statement by a former official and reformist figure after the protest killings was from former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest since shortly after the 2009 Green Movement protests. Multiple political activists were arrested in connection with helping the release of his statement, which said that the “game is over” and called for a peaceful transition away from the Islamic Republic.</p><p>Former Presidents Khatami and Rouhani also called for major reforms, and Iran’s Reformists Front said it would have to cease to exist if the theocratic establishment does not take steps to change course.</p><p>Iran’s supreme leader, however, called the events during the unrest a “coup” that was carried out to serve the interests of the US and Israel.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/irans-government-stresses-red-lines-as-students-protest-in-universities\">Student protests</a> restarted this week in Tehran and multiple other major cities after universities were reopened for the first time after the January nationwide protests.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The condemnation of the foreign media reports by Iran’s authorities come amid two other stories publicly rejected over recent days.</p><p>The Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), a foreign-based group considered a “terrorist” outfit by Tehran for launching armed attacks on Iranian soil decades ago, claimed a major operation on the headquarters of the supreme leader this week.</p><p>It said in a short statement that more than 100 of its fighters were killed or arrested, and more than 150 more fled, after “inflicting heavy casualties” and engaging in an hours-long firefight early Monday inside a compound located in Tehran’s Pasteur area – where numerous government offices are located.</p><p>While some residents reported hearing loud noises on the day, and unconfirmed reports said a number of schools in the surrounding area were closed abruptly, there was no evidence to suggest a bloody battle in the area.</p><p>Gholamreza Sanaei Rad, a senior IRGC commander and deputy for the political-ideological office of the supreme leader in the force, suggested that such a large operation could not have taken place at a top security compound in the capital without anyone noticing.</p><p>“This is merely a claim, and they are making it to introduce themselves as an alternatives for their masters, who have now turned to the pro-monarchy and Pahlavi camp,” he told the state-linked Iranian Labour News Agency on Sunday, in reference to US support for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the Iranian shah deposed in the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p>The IRGC-affiliated Mehr news agency said that several “mercenaries used PVC tubes to make something like a children’s toy and create some noise in Tehran to keep benefitting from their masters”.</p><p>Iran has blacklisted a number of US politicians for funding the MEK or delivering speeches at their ceremonies. The group has little support in Iran, partly because its forces joined former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during his eight-year invasion of Iran in the 1980s.</p><p>This week, another Western media report suggested that Turkiye might launch a military operation inside Iran to secure its own borders if a war with the US leads to chaos and prompts Iranians to seek refuge in the neighbouring country.</p><p>But a statement by the communications office of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, carried by Turkish news outlets and picked up by Iranian counterparts on Sunday, rejected the allegation as containing “disinformation”.</p><p>“Our state, which has always respected the territorial integrity and sovereignty of neighboring countries, takes the necessary measures to ensure our border security on a 24/7 basis, whether there are crises or not,” it said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Although the 2016 peace agreement formally ended hostilities between the state and the FARC-EP rebels, sustaining peace has proven far more complex than signing it.</p><p>This episode follows former members of the national army accused of carrying out the so-called “falsos positivos” (false positives) — extrajudicial executions in which innocent civilians were executed, then falsely presented as combat casualties by the government as a way to bolster the numbers of enemies killed. Soldiers testified to their involvement in the assassinations to the families of the victims as part of the peace process. We also explore the suffering and anguish of those who have had their families devastated by these killings.</p><p>Their testimonies unfold within the framework of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the justice mechanism established under the peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP).</p><p>The JEP applies a model of transitional and restorative justice centred on victims and with full guarantees of due process. Its mandate is to investigate, prosecute and sanction those most responsible for serious human rights violations. The system provides two pathways: a restorative process for those who acknowledge responsibility, provide full truth, and contribute to reparation and guarantees of non-repetition; and an adversarial process for those who do not.</p><p>Currently, more than 17,000 individuals are appearing before the JEP, including former FARC-EP members, members of the armed forces, and civilian third parties. The jurisdiction has issued indictments for maximum responsibility, delivered restorative and adversarial sentences, and conditionally waived criminal prosecution for non-most-responsible participants.</p><p>A film by Fatima Lianes</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 25 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">25 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div><div class=\"google-preferred-source\"><button class=\"google-preferred-source__button\" aria-label=\"Add Al Jazeera on Google\" data-testid=\"google-preferred-source-button\"><svg class=\"icon icon--plus2 icon--primary icon--12 google-preferred-source__add-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>plus2</title><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M10.571 13.429H3.43c-.405 0-.744-.137-1.018-.411A1.382 1.382 0 0 1 2 12c0-.405.137-.744.41-1.018.275-.274.614-.41 1.019-.41h7.142V3.428c0-.405.137-.744.411-1.018C11.256 2.137 11.595 2 12 2s.744.137 1.018.41c.274.275.41.614.41 1.019v7.142h7.143c.405 0 .744.137 1.018.411.274.274.411.613.411 1.018s-.137.744-.41 1.018c-.274.274-.614.41-1.019.41H13.43v7.143c0 .405-.137.744-.411 1.018-.274.274-.613.411-1.018.411s-.744-.137-1.018-.41a1.382 1.382 0 0 1-.41-1.019V13.43Z\"></path></svg><svg class=\"icon icon--google icon--primary icon--16 google-preferred-source__google-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 17 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>google</title><g fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-path=\"url(#a)\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"><path fill=\"#4285F4\" d=\"M16.18 8.181c0-.567-.051-1.112-.145-1.636H8.5v3.094h4.305a3.68 3.68 0 0 1-1.596 2.415v2.007h2.585c1.513-1.393 2.386-3.443 2.386-5.88Z\"></path><path fill=\"#34A853\" d=\"M8.5 16c2.16 0 3.971-.717 5.295-1.939l-2.586-2.007c-.716.48-1.633.764-2.709.764-2.083 0-3.847-1.407-4.476-3.298H1.35v2.072A7.997 7.997 0 0 0 8.501 16Z\"></path><path fill=\"#FBBC05\" d=\"M4.024 9.519c-.16-.48-.251-.993-.251-1.52s.09-1.04.25-1.52V4.406H1.352A7.997 7.997 0 0 0 .5 8c0 1.29.31 2.513.85 3.593l2.674-2.073Z\"></path><path fill=\"#EA4335\" d=\"M8.5 3.182c1.175 0 2.23.403 3.058 1.196l2.295-2.294C12.467.793 10.656 0 8.5 0a7.997 7.997 0 0 0-7.149 4.407L4.024 6.48C4.653 4.59 6.417 3.182 8.5 3.182Z\"></path></g><defs><clippath id=\"a\"><path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M.5 0h16v16H.5z\"></path></clippath></defs></svg><span class=\"google-preferred-source__text\">Add Al Jazeera on Google</span></button><button tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"See more of Al Jazeera’s trusted journalism by adding us as a preferred source on Google.\" class=\"tooltip-accessible_trigger\"><svg class=\"icon icon--info icon--primary icon--16 google-preferred-source__info-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>info</title><path class=\"icon-main-color\" d=\"M12 0a12 12 0 1 0 0 24 12 12 0 0 0 0-24Zm-.226 3.225a2.039 2.039 0 0 1 2.155 1.924v.193a1.998 1.998 0 0 1-2.155 2.149 2.029 2.029 0 0 1-2.146-2.15 2.039 2.039 0 0 1 1.955-2.122h.193l-.002.006Zm3.227 15.525a.75.75 0 0 1-.752.75H9.75a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75v-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 .752-.75h.748V12h-.75a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75v-1.5a.75.75 0 0 1 .752-.751h3a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.752v6.75h.75a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.749L15 18.75Z\"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

new wave of sanctions against Iran, targeting ships that it said are selling Iranian oil to help fund the country’s ballistic missile programme.</p><p>The penalties on Wednesday come a day before US and Iranian negotiators are set to meet for a third round of nuclear talks this year amid a massive military build-up by Washington in the region.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>As President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/trump-says-preference-is-to-solve-iran-tensions-through-diplomacy\">continues to issue threats</a> against Iran, Washington said it is also ramping up economic pressure against the country.</p><p>“Iran exploits financial systems to sell illicit oil, launder the proceeds, procure components for its nuclear and conventional weapons programs, and support its terrorist proxies,” Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a statement.</p><p>“Under President Trump’s strong leadership, Treasury will continue to put maximum pressure on Iran to target the regime’s weapons capabilities and support for terrorism, which it has prioritised over the lives of the Iranian people.”</p><p>While the US calls the Iranian oil trade “illicit”, Iran, which is selling its own petroleum products, describes the crackdown on its energy sector as piracy.</p><p>The US has been intensifying sanctions against Iran as it amasses <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/iran-says-us-military-build-up-unnecessary-and-unhelpful-deal-achievable\">military assets</a> – including two aircraft carriers and large fleets of fighter jets – in the region in apparent preparation for war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wednesday’s penalties targeted 12 vessels, as well as several companies and individuals that the US said are involved in Iran’s oil sales and weapons acquisition.</p><p>The new sanctions will freeze targeted assets of the designated firms and individuals in the US and make it mostly illegal for American citizens to engage in financial transactions with them.</p><p>Washington has been piling such sanctions on the Iranian economy since Trump nixed the multilateral nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018 during his first term.</p><p>That agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for the release of international sanctions.</p><p>After returning to the White House in 2025, Trump reignited his economic maximum pressure campaign against Tehran with the goal of choking off Iran’s oil exports.</p><p>Still, the two countries have been engaging in diplomacy to avert the looming conflict.</p><p>On Wednesday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the diplomats representing Tehran at the talks in Geneva, said it is possible to “fair and balanced” agreement with Washington.</p><p>He stressed that Iran – which denies seeking a nuclear bomb – is ready to answer any concerns or questions about its uranium <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">enrichment programme</a>.</p><p>“But we are not ready to give up our right to peaceful use of nuclear technology,” Araghchi told India Today in an interview.</p><p>The assertion appears to contradict US calls for zero <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">uranium enrichment</a> by Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The top Iranian diplomat also dismissed Trump’s claim that Iran is developing missiles that could reach the US.</p><p>Araghchi said Trump often complains about fake news, but he has become “the victim of fake news” himself.</p><p>“We are not developing long-range missiles, and we have limited the range of our missiles below 2000km [1,240 miles],” he said, stressing that the Iranian missile programme is designed for self-defence to deter attacks against the country.</p><p>In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump said the US reiterated that Washington is seeking a deal with Tehran.</p><p>“We haven’t heard those secret words: ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon,’” Trump told Congress.</p><p>Coincidentally, Araghchi had said hours earlier that “Iran will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon”.</p><p>The US bombed Iran’s three nuclear facilities in June 2025 as part of Israel’s assault against the country. Trump <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/25/trump-contradicts-witkoff-over-iran-nuclear-bomb-claims\">regularly says</a> that the strikes “obliterated” the Iranian nuclear programme.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021. Then, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the next month.</p><p>M23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The Congolese government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.</p><p>Last year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">DRC and M23</a> mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/rwanda-drc-presidents-sign-washington-accord-peace-deal\">Kinshasa and Kigali</a> mediated by the US.</p><p>Despite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.</p><p>In the latest incident on Tuesday, Willy Ngoma, a military spokesperson for the M23 rebels, was killed in a Congolese army drone strike, according to news agencies citing local officials and a UN source.</p><p>Separately this week, the UN peacekeeping mission in DRC deployed a joint exploratory assessment team to Uvira to evaluate security conditions and support the implementation of the ceasefire monitoring‌ mechanism agreed to in the Qatar deal.</p><p>Tensions near the Kavimvira border have decreased, though, allowing the post to reopen.</p><p>Early on Monday morning on the Burundian side, Inspector General of Migration Maurice Mbonimpa visited the border to inform his officers that services would resume as before, with no exceptional measures announced.</p><p>At the Kavimvira post, the wooden immigration offices – which were padlocked for weeks – opened and hundreds of people rushed to the crossing. Though some had travel documents, many did not.</p><p>On the DRC side, local authorities said people wishing to enter the country without immigration documents were not prohibited from doing so, as many Congolese fled without their identity documents. But from DRC into Burundi, the movement of people was more closely controlled.</p><p>By the afternoon of the first day, nearly 500 Congolese refugees who were stranded in Burundi had returned to Uvira.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4338082\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4338082\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4338082\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-23T155838Z_772101751_RC2PRJACFOYS_RTRMADP_3_CONGO-SECURITY-1772030022.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C486&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Uvira\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4338082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congolese officials from the Direction Generale des Migrations (DGM) prepare to process travellers during the reopening of the Congo-Burundi Kavimvira border post and transit centre on Monday [Victoire Mukenge/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"important-for-both-our-peoples\">‘Important for both our peoples’</h2><p>Although the reopening has brought hope among those who were displaced from Uvira, the border crossing also plays a key role in the local economy of surrounding communities, from traders to students.</p><p>Lucie Binja, 25, a student and resident of Uvira, was delighted by the reopening, saying Uvira and the Burundian towns across the border to the south are “interdependent”.</p><p>“Economically speaking, the opening of the border is important for both our peoples. Many Burundians come here to look for jobs, and vice versa.</p><p>“We Congolese from Uvira generally like to seek medical treatment in Burundi because they have good hospitals and care is relatively cheaper,” she said, hoping that “friendly” and “fraternal” ties between the two peoples will continue to strengthen.</p><p>Ghislain Kabamba, a social activist in Uvira, noted that the closure of the border was a “hard blow” for the city’s inhabitants.</p><p>“We were facing food shortages following the closure of the border between our two countries.

The project is being heavily backed by the government with Lebanon’s transportation minister set to take part in a demonstration flight in the coming weeks.</p><p>Officials and experts also said the airport, located 6km (3.7 miles) from the Syrian border, could serve large parts of Syria and Lebanon and provide an economic reprieve to a region with some of Lebanon’s most economically disadvantaged people.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>[image by Al Jazeera]</p><p><span>A site where history was made</span></p><p>Built in the 1930s, Qlayaat airport was later turned into a military airfield by the French army. In the 1960s, it was used for civilian purposes, mainly transporting engineers and other employees between Lebanon and other Arab countries.</p><p>From 1988 to 1990 during one of the most brutal periods of the Lebanese Civil War, many of the roads from Beirut to other parts of the country were closed by militias. To get around this, Middle East Airlines, Lebanon’s national carrier, began operating flights between Beirut and Qlayaat.</p><p>“It used to cost 25,000 Lebanese lira,” or about $50 at the time, Mazen Sammak, president of the Private Pilot Association of Lebanon, told Al Jazeera from his offices in downtown Beirut. “I remember very well because I took that flight many times.”</p><p>On November 5, 1989, Lebanon’s Parliament met at the Qlayaat airport to hold a historic session. Lawmakers ratified the Taif Agreement, which led to the end of the Lebanese Civil War. It also re-elected Hussein al-Husseini as speaker of parliament and Rene Mouawad as president of the republic.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mouawad, however, was killed 17 days later by a car bomb in Beirut planted by unknown assailants. The airport was then renamed in his memory as the Rene Mouawad International Airport.</p><p>Since then, the airport has been used mostly by the Lebanese Air Force.</p><h2 id=\"no-more-political-opposition\">No more political opposition</h2><p>Discussions about reopening the airport for passenger planes have emerged every so often, particularly during periods of war.</p><p>During Israel’s war on Lebanon in 2024, departing and incoming flights to Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport at times flew past the smoke rising from <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/10/26/once-upon-a-time-in-dahiyeh-israels-destruction-of-lebanons-communities\">Israeli strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs</a>. This led some in Lebanon to demand a second airport away from areas associated with the political and military group Hezbollah.</p><p>Some supporters of opening a second airport accused Hezbollah of controlling Beirut’s international airport and importing arms and money there. Airport employees affiliated with Hezbollah were reportedly removed from that airport in April.</p><p>Protesters have also at times blocked the airport road, including Hezbollah supporters who have <a href=\"/news/2025/8/10/will-lebanon-succeed-in-disarming-hezbollah\">protested against the group’s disarmament</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some discussions around the airport have also turned sectarian. During the civil war, a civilian airport began operating out of Halat near the city of Byblos. The Los Angeles Times ran a story in March 1987 with the headline “Christians Want Own Airport: In Warring Lebanon, No Happy Landings.”</p><p>“What I find quite revealing in this debate is that it is symptomatic that debates of public policy in Lebanon never take into consideration technical pros and cons of the issue at stake but very rapidly take a sectarian turn,” Karim Emile Bitar, a Lebanese political analyst, told Al Jazeera. “This airport has been discussed for the past 30 years. There are many solid arguments in favour of having a second airport in Lebanon.”</p><p>“The problem is some rabid sectarian Lebanese insist on turning this issue into a sectarian debate and saying this would be the Christian airport as opposed to an airport in west Beirut, where Hezbollah has long been the dominant force,” Bitar said.</p><p>He recalled the civil war days when rival militias aimed to carve Lebanon into sectarian cantons. “This is why some people still view the opening of another airport as a potential step in the fragmentation of Lebanon.”</p><p>Hezbollah was among the political factions opposed to the opening of a second airport in Qlayaat or elsewhere in the north. They argued it was a means of dividing Lebanon. But that political opposition seems to have faded in recent months.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The airport has economic and developmental benefits, but there is no political opposition,” Qassem Kassir, a journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera. “It is necessary and beneficial.”</p><p>Other critics have questioned whether the management of the airport is financially sustainable and whether it would divert traffic away from Beirut.</p><p>Experts and officials seemed optimistic that a viable and sustainable solution was available, likely through a public-private partnership to manage the airport sometime in the near future.</p><p>Experts also told Al Jazeera that a second airport would, if anything, boost the importance of Beirut.</p><p>“It might make more traffic for Beirut,” Captain Mohammad Aziz, head of Lebanon’s Regulatory Authority for Civil Aviation, told Al Jazeera. “More airports mean more job attraction.”</p><p>“If we want to think at the national level, at the interest of the nation, having another airport creates resilience,” Sammak said. “Because in any stable country, you should have another airport.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"flying-soon\">Flying soon</h2><p>With the political arguments now largely settled, officials familiar with the effort to reopen Qlayaat’s airport said passengers could be flying in and out as soon as this summer.</p><p>“Nothing is holding it back. We just need to make sure it is ready for civilian operations,” Aziz said. “We need a couple of months to adjust the runway and to build a building to receive civilians.”</p><p>He said the government’s goal is to get the airport operational as soon as possible and then to start receiving tenders on a public-private partnership.</p><p>Aziz estimated that a demonstration flight could land at Rene Mouawad International Airport as early as April. If all goes to plan, the airport could start receiving jet aircraft like Embraer 190s or Airbus A220s, which seat 108 to 133 passengers and have a flight time of about five hours.</p><p>With this flight time, Aziz said, flights could go as far as Madrid. “In five hours, you can fly from Beirut to London,” he said. “Flights from Beirut are mainly short flights. The MEA [Middle East Airlines] average flight is around 2 hours and 30 minutes.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Reports in Lebanese media indicated that Rene Mouawad International might become Lebanon’s hub for regional and international low-cost airlines. Currently, a few low-cost airlines such as Turkiye’s Pegasus and Transavia, based in the Netherlands, fly to Beirut.</p><p>The second airport’s location in Qlayaat, an area in Akkar, one of Lebanon’s poorest and most underserved regions, could also bring an economic boon to the region, officials and experts said.</p><p>“Airports are what we call economic multipliers,” Sammak said. “One job in aviation can create several jobs in other domains like logistics, tourism and hospitality. For such a deprived area for many years like Akkar in the north of Lebanon, this is a very important step because it will create job opportunities for everyone, and it will force the development of the area to make this airport ready.”</p><p>He added that the potential infrastructure development and job possibilities would create “social equilibrium” and reduce migration from Lebanon’s underserved north to Beirut.</p><p>“This balance is very important because it keeps families together,” he said. “It has many positive social impacts as well.”</p><p>The airport also has the potential to serve Syria’s coast. In fact, economists said it would likely have to serve Syria and Lebanon to be economically viable. Asked if contact had begun with Syrian authorities, Aziz said talks with Syria have been initiated and “are on the right track”.</p><p>With the government’s backing and political opposition no longer a hurdle, officials are confident about the airport’s viability and the potential for development in northern Lebanon.</p><p>“When political will and decision-making align, dreams become reality,” Aziz said. “We are going to make sure dreams become reality.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in the Al-Sarraf camp in eastern Sudan, she has faced suffering of a different kind.</p><p>“We fled here with nothing,” Sanaa told Al Jazeera Mubasher. “Now Ramadan has come, and we don’t even have a pot to cook in or a cup to drink from. If you have a bucket or a jug, that’s it.”</p><p>Sanaa is one of thousands of displaced people who have sought refuge in Al-Gedaref state, far from the front lines of the war in the west. But safety has come at a steep price. The camp, intended as a sanctuary, has become a site of deprivation.</p><p>“The water is available, but there is no food,” she said. “They give us a meal, but it’s not a real meal, and it’s not enough.”</p><h2 id=\"a-ramadan-of-hunger\">A Ramadan of hunger</h2><p>For Muslims, Ramadan is traditionally a month of community, prayer and shared meals. For the displaced women of Al-Sarraf, it has become a daily struggle to find enough scraps to feed their children at sunset.</p><p>Majd Abdullah, another survivor from el-Fasher, described the stark contrast between her past life and her current reality.</p><p>“Back home, Ramadan was perfect. You would prepare everything a month or two in advance,” she recalled. “But here, we fasted the first day, not knowing what we would break our fast with. We ended up eating with neighbours because we had nothing.”</p><p>A recent United Nations report said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces’ (RSF) atrocities in el-Fasher bore all the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/un-mission-finds-rsf-destruction-in-el-fasher-bears-hallmarks-of-genocide\">hallmarks of genocide</a>.</p><p>The aid that does arrive is often woefully inadequate. Majd described receiving a single bowl of porridge to feed a family of seven or 10 people.</p><p>“No organisation has entered with a food basket or cash assistance,” she said. “We can’t feed our children unless we go into the city to wash clothes or iron – menial jobs just to survive.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-children-ask-for-biscuits\">‘The children ask for biscuits’</h2><p>The lack of food is compounded by a total absence of basic household necessities. Sumaya Saleh, who fled from Kutum in North Darfur, listed the items they are desperate for: cooking pots, charcoal and sugar.</p><p>“The children are missing so much,” Sumaya said. “They ask for a biscuit, and you don’t have the money to buy it for them.”</p><p>The camp’s elderly residents are also suffering. Sumaya noted that many suffer from diabetes and high blood pressure but cannot access medication or proper care at the local health centres.</p><p>Mawaheb Ibrahim, a diabetic who lost her mother, sister and uncle to shelling in el-Fasher, is now caring for orphans in the camp with no resources.</p><p>“I am a diabetic, and I had retinal surgery,” Mawaheb said. “My blood sugar has risen to 477… I went into a state of acetone [ketoacidosis], and it affected my ear. I’m just taking painkillers to sleep. I have no access to a doctor.”</p><h2 id=\"disease-and-neglect\">Disease and neglect</h2><p>Beyond the hunger, the sanitary conditions in the camp are deteriorating. Sanaa Ahmed described the health situation as “medium” but worsening, citing cases of diarrhoea and eye infections.</p><p>“There are huge amounts of flies,” she said. “The bathrooms are hot and not clean enough. We need spraying campaigns and cleaning tools.”</p><p>While some hygiene kits and soap have been distributed, the primary need – food – remains unmet. One unnamed displaced woman described the communal kitchen as insufficient for the number of people it serves.</p><p>“It doesn’t satisfy a man, a woman, or a child,” she said. “The topic of food baskets is completely finished here; they don’t bring them.”</p><p>For these women, the “safety” of Al-Gedaref has become a slow-motion crisis of neglect. They have survived the war, but they are now fighting to survive where they are not under fire.</p><p>“We need help,” Mawaheb pleaded. “I need something to keep us going, for the children I am raising and for myself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The perpetrators in that killing were suspected to be violent pro-Israel operatives.</p><p>“From <a href=\"/features/2015/10/11/us-the-mystery-murder-of-palestinian-alex-odeh\">Alex Odeh</a> to Abu Siyam, from occupied Palestine all the way here to the United States, the US government has refused to hold Israel accountable for its military and settler killings of Palestinian US citizens,” Abuznaid told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is what history has shown us, and if the US government disagrees, they can gladly prove otherwise. Until then, we see it for exactly what it is.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
