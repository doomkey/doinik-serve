But it seems like they are disregarding all the realities and laws and trying to push through their anti-immigrant agenda by force,” he said.</p><p>Several Yemeni community leaders, particularly in Michigan, were outspoken supporters of Trump in the 2024 election.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week revoked TPS for Yemen, which shielded eligible Yemenis in the US from deportation due to the dangerous conditions in their homeland.</p><p>Trump had listed Yemen in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">a travel ban</a> he imposed last year and tightened immigration restrictions on the country.</p><p>But rescinding TPS was especially jarring for many in the community because beneficiaries of the status are already in the US, and it may not be safe for them to return to Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to DHS, a country may be designated for TPS due to conditions “that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely”.</p><p>Such conditions include political unrest, war, humanitarian crises and natural disasters. The status is granted for people who are not permanent US residents, such as tourists and visitors.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-in-yemen\">Conditions in Yemen</h2><p>Yemen was first designated for TPS in 2015 when the country’s civil war intensified, and the status had been repeatedly renewed.</p><p>“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest. TPS was designed to be temporary, and this administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. We are prioritising our national security interests and putting America first.”</p><p>As of September 2024 – the last time Yemen was redesignated for TPS – there were 2,300 Yemeni beneficiaries.</p><p>Noem’s announcement did not provide details on how allowing Yemenis, many of whom work and pay taxes, to retain their status counters US interests or how the conditions in Yemen were assessed.</p><p>A fragile ceasefire has been in place between Yemen’s Houthis and its internationally recognised government since 2022. But violence has continued to break out across the country.</p><p>Last year, Israel and the US <a href=\"/news/2025/4/28/at-least-8-killed-in-latest-us-air-attacks-on-yemens-capital-saana\">bombed Yemen repeatedly</a> as part of a campaign against the Houthis.</p><p>Clashes also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/five-killed-in-yemen-as-crowd-linked-with-stc-in-south-storm-govt-building\">continue to erupt</a> in the south of the country between the government and separatist forces.</p><p>According to United Nations data from last year, more than 4.5 million people are internally displaced in Yemen, and more than half of the population, 18.2 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><a href=\"/news/2024/9/23/mayor-of-only-muslim-governed-us-city-endorses-trump\">Amer Ghalib</a> – the former mayor of Hamtramck, a Muslim-majority city near Detroit, who campaigned for Trump in 2024 and was later nominated by the US president to serve as ambassador to Kuwait – called the TPS decision “very unfortunate”.</p><p>“I have spoken to multiple highly ranked White House officials and explained the situation to them, but it doesn’t seem that they took anything into consideration,” Ghalib told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“We hope the administration will reevaluate the situation in Yemen and consider the risk those individuals are facing if they are to be sent back at this time. They are just a few thousand compared to hundreds of thousands from some other countries.”</p><p>DHS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><h2 id=\"eople-are-very-devastated\">‘People are very devastated’</h2><p>Ghalib had helped lead the major shift in the Arab community towards Trump, which boosted the Republican leader’s popularity to win Michigan in 2024.</p><p>In the predominantly Yemeni American neighbourhood of the Southend <a href=\"/news/2024/11/1/as-trump-harris-woo-arab-americans-michigan-mayor-readies-to-up-pressure\">in Dearborn</a>, Michigan, Trump grew his share of the votes from less than 11 percent in 2020 to about 55 percent in 2024.</p><p>“People feel betrayed. They feel backstabbed,” Wali Altahif, a Yemeni American activist in Dearborn, said, adding that the decision to revoke TPS for Yemen will likely separate families in the community.</p><p>“There was hope that he was going to bring a different direction, different policy towards Yemen and the Yemeni community, but we’ve seen the opposite – absolutely the opposite.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Altahif expressed concern that, beyond the threat of war, TPS holders may experience harassment and persecution in Yemen due to regional divisions or perceived connection to the US.</p><p>He stressed the policy to revoke TPS for Yemen is unjustifiable. “It’s discriminatory. It’s racist. It’s un-American.”</p><p>The Trump administration has been rolling back TPS protections, including for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/trump-administration-nixes-temporary-immigration-protections-for-haitians\">Haiti</a>, which has been suffering from widespread gang violence.</p><p>However, some of Noem’s moves to nix immigration protections have been successfully challenged by the courts. And Yemeni community advocates said they are exploring legal avenues to reinstate TPS for Yemen.</p><p>Reyadh Nagi, an immigration lawyer <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/palestine-advocates-praise-nycs-mamdani-for-revoking-pro-israel-decrees\">in New York</a>, said a lawsuit would examine how DHS assessed conditions in the country and whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision to revoke TPS for Yemen.</p><p>He noted that the Department of State still has Yemen under a “do not travel” advisory “due to risk of terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping and landmines”.</p><p>Nagi told Al Jazeera that while the number of affected TPS holders may appear small, the effects of the Trump administration’s decision extend to their families, employers and broader community.</p><p>“A lot of people are very devastated,” he said. “I’m hearing from the TPS holders themselves. They’re very scared. They’re very concerned. They don’t know what lies ahead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

JFB builds commercial and residential properties, including multifamily communities and shopping centres.</p><p>Xtend touts its drones as “low cost per kill”, which has appealed to the US Department of Defense. In November, the firm said it had solidified a multimillion-dollar contract with the Pentagon but did not disclose the contract’s value.</p><p>This month, Xtend was among 25 companies selected to participate in the Defense Department’s Drone Dominance Program, an acquisition reform effort designed to rapidly field low-cost, attack drones at scale.</p><p>Xtend also secured contracts with the Pentagon before Trump’s second term, including an $8.8m deal in December 2024.</p><p>“I am incredibly proud to invest in companies I believe in. Drones are clearly the wave of the future. Xtend has unbelievable potential,” Eric Trump said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“By pairing XTEND’s operating system and advanced AI capabilities with JFB’s execution, infrastructure and buildout expertise, we see a clear opportunity to accelerate US manufacturing, scale production responsibly, and support a next-generation defense technology platform built in America and ready for the public markets,” Joseph F Basile III, chief executive officer of JFB, said in the news release.</p><p>JFB did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about the connection between its existing portfolio, which includes primarily commercial properties like a Courtyard by Marriott Hotel in Florida and an escape room in Indiana, and a defence contractor.</p><p>“By combining our platform with JFB, we are acquiring the resources we need to scale our manufacturing capabilities in the US and gaining access to the US public markets,” Xtend CEO Aviv Shapira said in the news release.</p><p>Xtend did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">Renewed conflict-of-interest concerns</h2><p>The deal is the latest in a series of conflict-of-interest concerns surrounding the Trump family’s personal investments and whether its members are using the Trump presidency to advance their own financial interests, according to ethics experts.</p><p>“The first thing that comes to mind is another example of the president’s family appearing to profit from the presidency,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.</p><p>“In the past, a president would avoid even the appearance that the family was benefitting from the office, and if that couldn’t be completely avoided, the president would make statements to reassure the public that there was no special treatment provided to the family that could lead to this benefit. Now, you don’t see anything like that.” Payne told Al Jazeera.</p><p>JFB Construction also appointed Stefan Passantino, a former White House attorney, to its board of directors amid the merger.</p><p>The investment comes even as the Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president’s name on airports but said it doesn’t plan on charging a fee at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he’s ever seen.</p><p>“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”</p><p>During former President Joe Biden’s term, Republicans rallied against his son Hunter Biden for using his connections with the White House to advance his personal business interests.</p><p>“When he [Hunter Biden] got a board position with a company overseas, there were concerns that he was using his name to secure a high-profile job. There were no ties to government contracts, but even the appearance that he had a position based on his name was controversial,” Payne said.</p><p>The Oversight Committee in the US House of Representatives alleged that the Bidens “participated or benefited from the business schemes” in a committee hearing in March 2024 about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</p><p>“We have learned that Joe Biden has taken action after action to further his family’s plans to get rich,” James Comer, the committee’s then-chairman, said at the time.</p><p>Comer did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about whether he shared the same concerns about the Trump family.</p><p>“We’re talking about something far more extreme: a child receiving benefits from government contracts, at least indirectly through a company he owns, including lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. That’s something we haven’t seen since Halliburton and Vice President [Dick] Cheney,” Payne said.</p><p>The White House and Trump Organization representatives did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in October, he took over the country’s presidency after his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, was impeached for “moral incapacity”.</p><p>Boluarte had replaced the last democratically elected president, Pedro Castillo, in December 2022 after he too was impeached.</p><p>Jeri was the seventh president in a decade to lead Peru. Many of his predecessors have been mired in scandal, forcing them to step down or face impeachment.</p><p>In Jeri’s case, the scandals largely concerned allegations that the right-wing leader was involved in influence-peddling. One of the most notable was informally dubbed “Chifagate”, after the Peruvian-Chinese fusion cuisine known as “chifa”.</p><p>“Chifagate” emerged after Peruvian media published video of Jeri attending a late-night meeting with a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, at his restaurant in Lima. The meeting was not included on the official presidential agenda, as required under Peruvian law.</p><p>Jeri appeared to be in disguise in the video, wearing informal clothing including a deep hoodie that partially obscured his face, which spurred further questions about the nature of the meeting.</p><p>Subsequent images showed Jeri visiting another one of Yang’s businesses, a wholesale store, this time in sunglasses.</p><p>Jeri has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has dismissed the meetings as get-togethers to discuss a Peruvian-Chinese friendship day — or as simple shopping trips for candy and food.</p><p>Yang has ties to the Peruvian government. Under Boluarte’s administration, he received a concession to build a hydroelectric plant, which has experienced delays and faced questions about its transparency.</p><p>The meetings between Yang and Jeri also reportedly included a third Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was placed under house arrest for engaging in illegal activities.</p><p>At Tuesday’s congressional debate, Jeri also faced questions about late-night meetings he took with women who later received government contracts and other irregular interactions he had. Jeri has also faced accusations of sexual assault, stretching back to December 2024.</p><p>He faced a total of seven motions of censure against his presidency. Ultimately, 75 members of Peru’s Congress backed the measure to remove Jeri, while three abstained and a further 24 voted against the proposal.</p><p>A new interim president is set to be voted upon during Wednesday evening, around 6pm local time (23:00 GMT).</p><p>Jeri’s removal marks a new chapter in the turmoil facing Peru’s government. The country is less than two months away from an April 12 general election, which will help decide its next president.</p><p>If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in that election, the race will proceed to a run-off in June.</p><p>Currently, the field is packed, with at least 36 candidates vying for the presidency. Election observers fear that whoever wins could face the same quick-fire impeachment proceedings that their predecessors have endured.</p><p>Presidents in Peru have often faced accusations of “moral incapacity”, a pathway to impeachment that critics have denounced as overly vague.</p><p>Jeri’s impeachment comes within months of several high-profile court decisions against former presidents.</p><p>In November, former President Martin Vizcarra, who served from 2018 to 2020, was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of accepting bribes for government contracts.</p><p>Then, in December, Castillo received a sentence of 11 years and five months for his conviction on charges of rebellion and conspiracy against the state.</p><p>Castillo, a left-wing leader, had been facing a third impeachment attempt in December 2022, when he attempted what many describe as a self-coup. Within hours, members of his cabinet had resigned, and Congress had impeached him.</p><p>Prosecutors in Peru have said they plan to continue investigations into Jeri on corruption charges.</p></div></div></body></html>"

You will not be able to do this either,” Khamenei said in an apparent reference to the US president telling reporters this week that a change in government would be “the best thing that could happen” in Iran.</p><p>Khamenei also used religious symbolism to draw parallels with figures who fought against Shia Muslim imams more than 1,350 years ago to cast doubt on any meaningful rapprochement with the US today. He said the Iranian nation “will not pledge allegiance to corrupt leaders like those who are in power in America today” based on religious beliefs.</p><p>“They say let us negotiate over your nuclear energy, and the result of the negotiation should be that you must not have this energy,” Khamenei said before adding that if any real negotiations were to take place, they cannot be predicated on any “foolish” demand that Iran move to zero enrichment of uranium.</p><p>His comments came hours before a statement made by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi after the conclusion of indirect talks with the US in Geneva.</p><p>“I can say, compared to the last round, we’ve had very serious discussions, and there was a constructive atmosphere where we exchanged our point of view,” Araghchi told reporters after the talks. “Those ideas were discussed, and we came to some agreements and some guiding principles. We will eventually draft a document. … We are hopeful we can achieve this.”</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The message from the Iranian negotiating team through state media on Tuesday was that Tehran is “serious” about the indirect talks mediated by Oman and wants to see results – particularly the <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/13/us-says-it-caused-dollar-shortage-to-trigger-iran-protests-what-that-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lifting of harsh US sanctions</a> imposed after Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear deal that Iran had reached with world powers three years earlier.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">For the US, which was also holding parallel talks with Ukraine and Russia in Switzerland, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner acted as lead representatives.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Both teams had separate meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi as well as Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will have to lead any potential future inspection missions of Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/iranians-react-after-us-bombs-three-nuclear-sites-in-support-of-israel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nuclear sites bombed by the US</a> in June during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hard-to-be-optimistic\">‘Hard to be optimistic’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Washington has insisted that no uranium enrichment may take place inside Iran. It has also said Tehran must hand over its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, which are believed to be buried under the rubble of the US air strikes in June, and limit its missile programme. Along with Israel, the US has sought an end to Iran’s support for the “axis of resistance”, the armed groups it backs in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">All these demands have been rejected by Iran, which said they cross “red lines” and undermine the country’s rights and security.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Instead, the Iranian team has proposed to dilute the uranium and to include the US in the potential economic benefits of any agreement.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Addressing a meeting of the leaders of the Iran Chamber of Commerce on Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Hamid Ghanbari said the Trump administration would have to be offered deals in “areas with high economic output that can be achieved quicker”.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He suggested Iran could sell energy to the US, work on joint oil- and gasfields and minerals, or even buy aircraft from the US, but he did not say how Tehran believed such agreements could be achieved given the clashing positions offered by the two sides.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran’s currency, the rial, depreciated slightly after the indirect talks in Geneva ended on Tuesday after just over three hours. One US dollar was worth about 1.63 million rials on Tuesday, near <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/iran-shuts-down-private-businesses-after-protests-as-economy-slumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an all-time low</a> registered last month after a deadly crackdown against nationwide antigovernment protests and threats of war.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“It is hard to be optimistic about these negotiations that wrapped up very quickly. These are extremely complex subjects. Remember that it took two and a half years to negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal,” Ali Vaez, director at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“These talks usually require a lot of patience, a lot of focus, a lot of back and forth, a lot of discussions with experts.

A relatively newer technique has been developed in Ladakh to create an “ice stupa”, which is formed after spraying water in freezing temperatures. The conical shape ice structure remains frozen for a longer period as its surface is not fully exposed to the sun.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_vulnerable_glacier floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-is-glacier-grafting-carried-out\">How is glacier grafting carried out?</h2><p>So-called “male” and “female” ice is sourced from different locations and brought together to create an artificial glacier. Villagers where this technique has been implemented as well as experts told Al Jazeera that volunteers go out to collect around 200kg (441 pounds) of “male” ice from one valley and “female” ice from another. Male ice is typically black in colour, while female ice is usually lighter, providing more fertile water that enhances agricultural productivity, according to locals.</p><p>In ancient times, due to the absence of available transportation as well as steep, narrow and slippery routes through the mountains, volunteers would travel on foot for several days, carrying the ice in traditional wooden cages on their backs.</p><p>The process requires specific materials: coal, grass, salt and water collected from seven different streams. Before setting out to the grafting site, the group would recite Quranic verses, perform spiritual rituals and pray for success.</p><p>The material, including both sets of ice blocks, would be carried to the site while “strictly following environmentally respectful and culturally sacred practices”, the locals said.</p><p>They would avoid the use of plastics, refrain from immoral actions and only consume locally produced foods such as wheat, barley, apricots and homemade bread during the process.</p><p>Humour, music, or harm to living creatures is strictly prohibited, as the procedure was viewed as both a spiritual and ecological responsibility.</p><p>At the grafting site, a small trench would be dug in a safe area, away from avalanche or flood-risk zones. The male and female ice pieces would be carefully layered together, mixed with salt, coal and grass.</p><p>“The male pieces are put on the right, while on the left, female ice pieces,” Zakir said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3972254\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3972254\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/skardu3-1758555264.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"skardu glacier pakistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan is home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers [Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Water collected from the seven streams would slowly be dripped over the ice to help bind the layers.</p><p>Over several months, the pieces fused into a single ice mass. If the site received seasonal snowfall, the mass would gradually develop into a glacier. After surviving for at least three years and enduring seasonal snow cycles, the artificially grafted glacier would expand. Over the next few years, it would become a reliable water source.</p><p>Zakir added that site selection is critical in the process: north-facing slopes, strong winds, less sun exposure and protection from direct flowing water are essential.</p><h2 id=\"rituals-discipline-and-collective-labour\">Rituals, discipline and collective labour</h2><p>Locals and experts told Al Jazeera that the deep spiritual and cultural aspects surrounding this technique are what distinguish glacier grafting from purely technical interventions.</p><p>Ice pieces are never allowed to touch the ground and must remain in continuous motion from collection to planting.</p><p>“Often, vehicles that carry these ice pieces are never switched off,” Zakir recalled, adding that those helping out are forbidden from speaking, using plastic or relieving themselves near the site.</p><p>“If one volunteer feels tired, without lying down, he will pass the basket [carrying the ice] to another volunteer.”</p><p>Historically, glacier grafting has also concluded with local music known as Gang Lho that is sung directly to the ice. One such song, the professor recalled, addresses the glacier as a living being, calling it “my dear baby glacier” having “pastures to grow… mountains to climb”.</p><p>Often, volunteers and villagers would have tears in their eyes, praying for the glacier’s establishment and survival in order to aid their survival and livelihood.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912886\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-01-1756384125.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_glacier floods_August25_2025\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-long-does-glacier-grafting-take-is-it-guaranteed-to-survive\">How long does glacier grafting take?

But it remains a powerful example of how Indigenous knowledge, culture and collective care have long shaped survival in the mountains.</p><p>Locals told Al Jazeera that glacier grafting is now more critical than ever to counter water scarcity and erratic snowfall that cause problems for irrigation, domestic consumption and livestock.</p><p>They also worry that the practice of glacier grafting is rapidly disappearing. Younger generations, drawn to urban centres and alternative livelihoods such as tourism, education and business, no longer engage in traditional irrigation.</p><p>This shift has disrupted the intergenerational transfer of Indigenous knowledge, they lamented.</p><p><em>This story was produced in partnership with the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulitzer Center</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The 34-year-old won his constituency as a BNP-backed candidate of the Gono Odhikar Parishad party.</p><p>He first gained national prominence as a student leader from the University of Dhaka during the antiquota movement in 2018, leading demonstrations against Hasina’s Awami League government.</p><p>Students and youth across Bangladesh protested to call for reform in the conventional job quota system, under which more than half of much sought-after government jobs were reserved. Protesters accused the Awami League government of using the quota system to reward its supporters.</p><p>The Hasina government was forced to abolish the quota in 2018. But in June 2024, a court reinstated the quota system, triggering the protests that soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina’s “autocratic” regime. Hasina’s 15-rule was marked by widespread human rights violations and suppression of dissent.</p><p>Nur backed the student-led uprising and was a key mobiliser in the July 2024 revolution.</p><p>He cofounded Gono Odhikar Parishad, a rights-focused political party, and positioned himself as part of a youth-driven, antiestablishment movement in Bangladeshi politics. However, the party has been mired in frequent internal rifts and breakaways.</p><p>In the post-2024 Hasina period, Nur moved closer to the BNP-led bloc on reform and governance policies.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-zonayed-saki\">Who is Zonayed Saki?</h2><p>Saki became involved in politics as a student activist during the movement against General Hussain Ershad, who ruled Bangladesh from 1982 to 1990.</p><p>The 52-year-old won the presidency of the Bangladesh Student Federation, a progressive student organisation, in 1998.</p><p>Saki is the joint convener of the Ganosanhati Andolan, or People’s Solidarity Movement, a progressive party that emerged in the late 2000s. He is a leading left-leaning voice in Bangladeshi politics.</p><p>He ran for mayor of the Dhaka North City Corporation in 2015 and lost. Saki also participated in the 2018 Bangladeshi general election from a Dhaka constituency but did not win.</p><p>He won the Brahmanbaria-6 constituency this time by a margin of 55,000 votes.</p><p>Addressing his supporters after the election win, Saki said: “All parties in the antiauthoritarian movement must remain united in the national interest and respectful of democratic norms.” He thanked BNP leaders for their support.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4319601\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4319601\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4319601\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260217__97UF96R__v1__MidRes__BangladeshPolitics-1771332774.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4319601\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prime Minister Tarique Rahman and his cabinet face a daunting list of challenges after being sworn in [Munir Uz Zaman/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-were-they-appointed-to-the-cabinet\">Why were they appointed to the cabinet?</h2><p>Much like the new parliament, Rahman’s cabinet does not have much experience governing.

The 25 have been drawn overwhelmingly from the BNP and its close allies.</p><p>Among the state (junior) ministers appointed to Rahman’s government are Nurul Haque and Zonayed Saki, first-time parliamentarians, who were prominent voices during the 2024 protests.</p><p>While members of the cabinet have been announced, the ministries they will be responsible for have not yet been confirmed. Here’s a look at who some of them are.</p><h3>Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2023/10/29/bangladesh-opposition-leader-alamgir-detained-after-antigovernment-rally\">Alamgir</a>, who has served as secretary-general of the BNP since 2016, was elected to his seat in parliament by the constituency of Thakurgaon-1, a district in northwestern Bangladesh.</p><p>Alamgir, 78, served as a member of parliament from 2001 to 2006 under the previous BNP government, led by Rahman’s late mother, Khaleda Zia, during which he was also state minister for agriculture and later for civil aviation and tourism.</p><p>After the end of that government’s term, a caretaker administration took over until elections in 2008, which Alamgir stood in but did not win. He remained a senior member of the BNP outside parliament.</p><p>In October 2023, Alamgir was detained by police the day after mass antigovernment protests swept through Dhaka when Hasina’s Awami League party was in power. The police said he had been detained for questioning in connection with the violence that erupted during those demonstrations.</p><p>When the BNP win was announced last week, Alamgir hailed the victory and called the BNP “a party of the people”.</p><h3 id=\"amir-khasru-mahmud-chowdhury\">Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury</h3><p>Chowdhury was elected from the Chattogram-11 constituency, which covers the Bandar and Patenga areas of Chattogram city in southeastern Bangladesh.</p><p>From 2001 to 2004, Chowdhury served as minister of commerce under the previous BNP administration. He is a member of the BNP’s standing committee.</p><p>Before last week’s vote, Chowdhury said that if elected, the BNP would govern by investing in people, “in health, in education and upskilling” and by supporting “artisans, the weavers” and small industries with credit as well as helping them access international markets, including by helping them with their branding.</p><h3>Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku</h3><p>Tuku, 75, has been elected as a member of parliament for the Sirajganj-2 constituency in North Bengal.</p><p>Tuku is a member of the BNP Standing Committee, the party’s top policymaking body.</p><p>He is a veteran BNP figure who has been elected to parliament multiple times and has held important party roles. From 2001 to 2006, he served as the state minister for power. In 2006, he also briefly served as the state minister for agriculture.</p><p>In 2007, during the military-backed interim government, a special anticorruption court in Dhaka sentenced Tuku to nine years in prison in a case filed against him by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). The ACC accused Tuku of concealing information about assets worth 49.6 million takas (roughly $400,000).</p><p>The High Court upheld his conviction and jail sentence in 2023 after a lengthy appeal process. However, in September 2025, a year after the overthrow of the Awami League government, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court acquitted Tuku.</p><h3>Khalilur Rahman</h3><p>Khalilur Rahman is a technocratic minister, appointed for his expertise rather than as a party politician. He is not a member of parliament.</p><p>He served as national security adviser in the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus, which took over to oversee a transition after Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>He also served as the government’s representative for the Rohingya issue during Yunus’s tenure. The refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in southern Bangladesh are sheltering more than one million <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/no-expectations-bangladesh-election-means-little-to-1m-rohingya-refugees\">Rohingya refugees</a>, most of whom fled Myanmar in 2017 to escape a military crackdown.</p><h3 id=\"afroza-khanam-rita\">Afroza Khanam Rita</h3><p>The only woman cabinet minister, Rita is a first-time member of parliament but comes from a political family: Her late father was a four-times MP. Rita is also the chairwoman of the Monno Group of Industries, a conglomerate whose firms produce ceramic ware, textiles and agricultural machinery – primarily for export.</p><h3>Asaduzzaman</h3><p>Asaduzzaman, was elected from the Jhenaidah-1 (Shailkupa) constituency, which covers Shailkupa upazila in Jhenaidah district in southwestern Bangladesh.</p><h3>Dipen Dewan</h3><p>Dewan, 62, a Chakma Buddhist leader, is expected to be named minister of Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs. Dewan won from the Rangamati constituency.</p><p>Chakma Buddhists are an ethnic group of Tibeto-Burman speaking people. They are indigenous to the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and parts of northeastern India.</p><h3>Nitai Roy Chowdhury</h3><p>Chowdhury, a Hindu leader, is widely expected to become the minister of cultural affairs.</p><p>Chowdhury, 77, has served as a senior adviser and strategist for the BNP’s top leaders.</p><h2 id=\"how-significant-are-these-appointments\">How significant are these appointments?</h2><p>During campaigning, the BNP pledged to meet the people’s demand for an elected government with real legitimacy. Therefore, ministers and cabinet members can expect a significant amount of scrutiny, experts said.</p><p>Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, lecturer in global studies and governance at the Independent University, Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera: “The appointees in their respective fields will also face an invisible yet significant pressure to prove themselves more effective and distinctive than the previous administrations, both the interim government and, of course, the Awami League-led government under Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>He added: “It will be particularly interesting to observe whether, after a youth-led mass uprising, the core of executive power is taken over by the old guard or by new faces that reflect diversity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and religion.”</p><p>While two prominent figures from the 2024 student uprisings have been named as state ministers – Nurul Haque and Zonayed Saki – Rejwan added that leaders of the student-led National Citizen Party, which was founded after the 2024 uprising, had made a “strategic mistake” by allying with Jamaat instead of the BNP.</p><p>“They had the option to form an alliance with the BNP, which they later abandoned in favour of Jamaat. Given these political dynamics, it is unlikely that any student leaders will receive cabinet positions.”</p><h2 id=\"who-attended-the-ceremony-to-swear-in-the-new-cabinet\">Who attended the ceremony to swear in the new cabinet?</h2><p>Several foreign delegations were in Bangladesh to attend the ceremony.</p><p>They included Maldivian President <a href=\"/news/2023/10/1/who-is-mohamed-muizzu-maldivess-pro-china-president-elect\">Mohamed Muizzu</a> and Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.</p><p>India was represented by Om Birla, the speaker of its lower house in Parliament. Pakistani Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal also attended.</p><p>Leaders and representatives from Nepal and the United Kingdom, China, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Brunei were among those who were invited to attend.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands more have been detained since the genocidal war on Gaza began following the October 7, 2023, cross-border raid led by Hamas on Israel that killed some 1,200 people.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 20,000 children.</p><p>Hundreds of those prisoners could be subject to the death penalty if the law is implemented. A revised draft legislation is currently being debated in the national security committee in parliament before being sent for a second and a third reading.</p><p>A vote has yet to be scheduled.</p><h2><strong>Palestinian Prisoner’s Society: Prisoners living in ‘hell’</strong></h2><p>The head of a Palestinian society that campaigns for the prisoners said <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/global-system-of-human-rights-in-peril-warns-hrw-in-its-annual-report\">Palestinian prisoners</a> are already living “in hell”, and the law calling for the execution of prisoners represents a dangerous development.</p><p>“Escalation against prisoners has continued without pause over the past two years, culminating in what Israeli media announced regarding the imminent implementation of the execution law,” Abdullah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society in the occupied West Bank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Talk of additional measures and preparations to hang prisoners from Gaza and the West Bank comes within a broader escalation that coincides with the ongoing war against the Palestinian people, including within prison walls,” al-Zaghari said.</p><h2><strong>Violations of international law</strong></h2><p>He said all measures against prisoners introduced by Israel’s far-right government after it took office three years ago were a violation of international law.</p><p>Ramzi Odeh, professor of international law and head of the International Academic Campaign Against Occupation and Apartheid, said the proposed law constitutes “apartheid legislation” because it differentiates between Palestinians and non-Palestinians.</p><p>“An Israeli settler or soldier who kills a Palestinian is not subject to this law,” he told Al Jazeera. “They are tried under ordinary procedures, and the execution law is not applied to them. This is clear discrimination in punishment against Palestinians.”</p><p>Odeh said Israel has classified Palestinian detainees under what it calls the category of “unlawful combatants” – a designation that rights groups consider controversial because it removes them from prisoner-of-war protections under international law while also not treating them as civilian detainees subject to ordinary judicial safeguards.</p><p>“As a result, in many cases they are not presented with clear indictments, nor are they tried within defined timeframes, but are kept in detention for long and open-ended periods,” he said.</p><p>“The most dangerous aspect of this law is preventing the International Committee of the Red Cross from visiting prisoners, as well as restricting lawyers’ visits until the late stages of proceedings,” Odeh added.</p><p>He said the Fourth Geneva Convention clearly guarantees Red Cross visits, access to medical care, adequate food and family visits.</p><p>“Israel has exploited the events of 7 October 2023 to disregard these obligations, while the world remains silent,” he added.</p><h2><strong>Appeals for international support</strong></h2><p>Al-Zaghari called on Arab and Muslim mediators, including the emir of Qatar, and the Egyptian and Turkish presidents, to intervene and ensure protection for prisoners’ lives and rights.</p><p>Al-Zaghari said Palestinian rights organisations were preparing to launch an international campaign to confront what he described as “massacres” inside prisons. He said meetings have been held with foreign consuls and ambassadors, as well as with the International Committee of the Red Cross, but gave no further details.</p><p>“If there is no urgent and effective action to stop the prisoners’ execution law and the assaults inside prisons, the situation will deteriorate further and reach dangerous levels,” he warned.</p></div></div></body></html>"
