Secondly, if they are taxed only in their country of residence, does that reflect where their wealth was actually created?</p><p>Wealth is not produced solely by investment. It is built on resources and labour. In today’s global economy, much of that comes from the Global South. It follows, then, that tax revenues should also flow back to the places from which that wealth is extracted.</p><p>Take Antwerp. It is a beautiful city whose residents enjoy high living standards. But the foundations of that prosperity lie in diamonds from the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo, where living standards have barely risen. We have to ask why we have these different outcomes. This is not about charity; it is about restructuring global finance to make it fair.</p><p>Inequality has surged over the past 30 to 40 years. Extreme wealth of the kind we see today was taxed at 97–98 percent in the form of high marginal tax rates above a threshold, based on what amounted to a global consensus that such concentrations of wealth were unhealthy — and that the money was better directed to health, welfare and education.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2344150\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2344150\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2344150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AP20017382874205-1693905419.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt='Demonstrators against inequality march to the office of the president in downtown Nairobi, Kenya Friday, Jan. 17, 2020.

In France, serious proposals to tax billionaires and centi-millionaires now command broad political support. Within the G20, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has placed taxing the super-rich firmly on the agenda. The debate is no longer about whether the ultra-wealthy can be taxed, but when.</p><p>Winning that argument will not be easy. But, as with income tax — once denounced as Marxist — it has been won before. And redistributing some of the wealth held by the super-rich would also weaken many right-wing nativist narratives about scarce resources that have spread across the West.</p><p>Those narratives have prospered partly because progressive calls for redistribution have lacked the necessary weight, enabling an alliance of the right and billionaire interests to push xenophobia to the fore.</p><p><em>Lucas Chancel, senior economist at the World Inequality Lab of the Paris School of Economics</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Much of this concern is overstated, as the headline indicators reflect a necessary structural correction rather than an economic collapse.</p><p data-start=\"707\" data-end=\"853\">While elevated inflation and a battered banking sector are real and serious challenges, they do not amount to evidence of an economy in free fall.</p><p data-start=\"855\" data-end=\"1096\">A more careful reading, one that accounts for the disruptive legacy of the previous administration and the corrective measures undertaken after the political transition, reveals a difficult but necessary period of structural rebalancing.</p><p data-start=\"1098\" data-end=\"1347\">The claim that the new government is inheriting a crippled economy overlooks the fact that the previous administration left behind a financial system that resembled a house of cards, propped up by manipulated data and systematic concealment of risk.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1605\">To portray the current economy as stagnant is to ignore Bangladesh’s longer arc of resilience in South Asia. Despite the global shocks that followed COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, the country delivered stronger growth than most of its regional peers.</p><p data-start=\"1607\" data-end=\"1831\">It registered 3.5 percent growth in 2020, followed by 6.9 percent in 2021 and 7.1 percent in 2022. Today’s slower growth reflects deliberate fiscal tightening aimed at restoring macroeconomic balance after years of excess.</p><p data-start=\"1833\" data-end=\"1938\">Rather than a sign of decay, this is the predictable cooling that follows the end of artificial stimulus.</p><p data-start=\"1940\" data-end=\"2110\">The anxiety around nonperforming loans and private sector credit tells an even more revealing story, not of new stress but of long-buried weaknesses finally exposed.</p><p data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2353\">The alarming rise in nonperforming loans, with figures ranging from over 20 percent in ADB assessments to more than 35 percent under the central bank’s revised classification rules, stems from a long-overdue commitment to honest accounting.</p><p data-start=\"2355\" data-end=\"2615\">For years, the previous regime reportedly pressured regulators to gloss over defaults, relax classification standards, and extend loan rescheduling indefinitely. The result was a banking sector that looked superficially healthy while quietly deteriorating.</p><p data-start=\"2617\" data-end=\"2717\">The surge in nonperforming loans is therefore the price of confronting the system’s real condition.</p><p data-start=\"2719\" data-end=\"3048\">The compression in private credit growth, which dipped to about 6.29 percent in late 2025, must also be understood in context. Previous double-digit credit growth was inflated by massive, politically connected borrowing that produced little real economic return and ultimately fed into the ballooning nonperforming loan crisis.</p><p data-start=\"3050\" data-end=\"3284\">Many of these loans were never intended to be repaid and were allegedly funnelled into overseas real estate or offshore accounts. In contrast, banks today are more cautious, with credit flowing into sectors less vulnerable to default.</p><p data-start=\"3286\" data-end=\"3526\">The volume of lending has decreased, but the quality has improved. An economy cannot build sustainable growth on a mountain of bad debt. The current adjustment reflects a shift towards stability rather than a collapse in investment appetite.</p><p data-start=\"3528\" data-end=\"3876\">These corrections in the financial sector are only one part of the broader adjustment. The most decisive rebuttal to claims of stagnation is the transformation under way in the fiscal and external sectors. In an unusual show of discipline, the government has sharply reversed the longstanding habit of borrowing heavily from the banking system.</p><p data-start=\"3878\" data-end=\"4103\">Between July and October of the 2025-26 financial year, it repaid more than 5 billion taka (about $40.9m) to banks, in stark contrast to the more than 150 billion taka ($1.23bn) borrowed during the same period a year earlier.</p><p data-start=\"4105\" data-end=\"4303\">Economists note that this shift eases pressure on interest rates and frees up liquidity for private borrowers, marking a significant break with a past where the state crowded out the private sector.</p><p data-start=\"4305\" data-end=\"4417\">For a country long accustomed to fiscal indiscipline, this move signals a meaningful shift towards stability.</p><p data-start=\"4419\" data-end=\"4637\">Foreign direct investment (FDI) tells a similarly counterintuitive story. Against the assumption that political upheaval deters investors, Bangladesh experienced nearly 20 percent growth in FDI in the 2024-25 financial year.</p><p data-start=\"4639\" data-end=\"4867\">For a post-transition economy emerging from a massive uprising that resulted in more than 1,400 deaths, this is extremely rare. Countries emerging from political uprisings typically endure sharp drops in foreign investment for years.</p><p data-start=\"4869\" data-end=\"5028\">In Bangladesh’s case, global firms not only remained but also reinvested their earnings. This reflects a deeper confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.</p><p data-start=\"5030\" data-end=\"5278\">Perhaps the most striking shift has occurred in the external sector. After months of steady erosion, foreign currency reserves have stabilised and then strengthened, climbing from less than $20bn in mid-2024 to more than $30bn a year later.</p><p data-start=\"5280\" data-end=\"5528\">Remittances surged to a record $30.33bn in the 2024-25 financial year, a 26.8 percent increase attributed to renewed confidence in the formal financial system, the crackdown on money laundering, and the return to a market-based exchange rate.</p><p data-start=\"5530\" data-end=\"5836\">Expatriates who once relied on hundi networks are now sending money legally, responding to a more transparent and predictable currency regime. This combination of rising reserves, strong remittance inflows, and exchange-rate stabilisation forms one of Bangladesh’s strongest macroeconomic buffers in years.</p><p data-start=\"5838\" data-end=\"5998\">Inflation remains the most potent concern, and rightly so. With rates above 8 percent, higher than any country in South Asia, the cost-of-living pressure is severe.</p><p data-start=\"6000\" data-end=\"6164\">But here again, comparisons require nuance. Sri Lanka’s low inflation follows a complete economic meltdown and draconian monetary tightening under an IMF programme.</p><p data-start=\"6166\" data-end=\"6384\">Bangladesh’s inflation is structurally different, driven partly by supply chain constraints, lingering market distortions, and the aftereffects of earlier monetary expansion. It is difficult, but not destabilising.</p><p data-start=\"6386\" data-end=\"6626\">Similarly, the poverty figure of 28 percent often cited by critics originates from a limited-sample private study. World Bank projections indicate that poverty is likely to continue falling modestly this financial year, even amid inflation.</p><p data-start=\"6628\" data-end=\"6841\">The battle ahead is not simply about preserving growth rates, but about dismantling entrenched corruption, extortion networks, and bureaucratic bottlenecks that have acted as invisible taxes on the poor for years.</p><p data-start=\"6843\" data-end=\"7046\">Bangladesh’s economy today is not collapsing; it is undergoing a difficult but necessary reconstruction after more than a decade of governance that preferred cosmetic stability over institutional health.</p><p data-start=\"7048\" data-end=\"7230\">High nonperforming loans, slower credit growth, and persistent inflation are symptoms of structural problems finally being confronted. That confrontation was inevitable and overdue.</p><p data-start=\"7232\" data-end=\"7471\">What stands out instead is a set of achievements rarely seen in a post-transition economy: a rapid rebound in reserves, a record surge in remittances, nearly 20 percent growth in FDI, and an unprecedented demonstration of fiscal restraint.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\">These are not the markers of stagnation, but the early foundations of a more transparent, durable economic future. Whether Bangladesh completes this transition will depend on the political will to sustain reform, especially in the banking sector. The story of the economy today is not one of collapse; it is the story of corrective surgery. Whether the country can finish the operation remains the central question.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In addition, he has deployed the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, thousands of troops, and F-35 military jets to the Caribbean.</p><p>On November 20, Trump said that land strikes inside Venezuela could come imminently. However, while some view the president’s comments and operations as a preparation for military action, Trump told reporters last weekend not to “read anything” into his recent moves.</p><p>Venezuela has been conducting regular military drills over the past few weeks in preparation for any possible attack.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4142886\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4142886\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4142886\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-Military-head-to-head-NOV30-2025-1764583109.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Military head-to-head - NOV30, 2025-1764583109\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4142886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-is-trump-hostile-to-maduro\">Why is Trump hostile to Maduro?</h2><p>Washington’s recent show of force recalls a <a href=\"/features/2013/4/3/timeline-venezuelas-tumultuous-history\">long history</a> of military interventions across Latin America by successive US governments, often motivated by fear of hostile powers close to US borders.</p><p>Since the 1990s, ties between Washington and Caracas have been dominated by tensions linked to Maduro’s left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The bilateral relationship deteriorated further after Maduro came to power following Chavez’s death in 2013.</p><p>In recent months, US military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smugglers in the Caribbean have dominated relations.</p><p>In July, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/11/25/could-trumps-50m-reward-succeed-in-toppling-venezuelas-nicolas-maduro\">Maduro</a> of being “the leader of the designated ‘narcoterrorist’ organisation Cartel de los Soles” and responsible for “trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe”. He did not provide evidence to back his claim.</p><p>Moreover, experts say Cartel de los Soles is not a cartel.</p><p>For his part, Maduro has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/26/venezuelas-maduro-says-the-us-is-fabricating-a-war-against-him\">accused</a> Washington of using the drug offensive as a pretext for orchestrating regime change and seizing Venezuelan oil.</p><h2 id=\"what-actions-has-the-trump-administration-taken\">What actions has the Trump administration taken?</h2><p>The US has amassed 15,000 troops in the region and deployed an aircraft carrier there.</p><p>It has also carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific since September, killing up to 83 people.</p><p>Meanwhile, military experts say assembled US firepower in the Caribbean Sea far outweighs what is necessary for a drug-trafficking operation, while Caracas says the US is <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/11/30/what-is-driving-us-presidents-trumps-actions-against-venezuela\">seeking regime change</a> to take control of Venezuela’s vast natural resources, including oil.</p><p>Last week, a Delaware judge ordered the sale of Venezuelan oil company <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/venezuela-denounces-us-ordered-forced-sale-of-oil-company-citgo\">Citgo</a> – a Houston-based subsidiary of the state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) – to pay off billions of dollars in missed debt repayments.</p><p>Venezuela on Tuesday denounced the US-ordered “forced sale” of the oil company, which would rob Venezuela of vital foreign revenue.</p><p>Elsewhere, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/trump-says-venezuela-airspace-to-be-shut-in-its-entirety-as-tensions-rise\">declared</a> that Venezuelan airspace had been “closed” on November 29. His comments followed a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration about a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace.</p><p>Despite professing to <a href=\"/news/2020/9/11/us-mourns-9-11-dead-trump-tries-to-end-forever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oppose “forever wars”</a>, Trump’s recent moves in Venezuela — including the threat of military strikes — signal a readiness to escalate tensions.</p><h2 id=\"are-the-boat-strikes-legal\">Are the boat strikes legal?</h2><p>Numerous legal scholars have decried the US strikes in international waters as <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/in-boat-strike-trump-repurposes-war-on-terror-for-latin-american-crime\">illegal</a> under both international and domestic law. The US Congress is investigating whether a second attack on an alleged drug boat in September killed survivors of an initial attack. The White House has defended the deadly attack.</p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that the US strikes on alleged boats were “not compatible with international law”. He has expressed his concern about the escalating tensions between the US and Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-venezuela-s-key-allies\">Who are Venezuela’s key allies?</h2><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"413\">Venezuela’s key political allies are unified by a shared resistance to US influence in the region. Russia remains its strongest geopolitical backer, offering military cooperation and diplomatic support. China, which is Venezuela’s number one source of oil exports, also provides economic backing.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"413\">Venezuela and Iran also have a deepening bond – sharing an anti-Western worldview and, in the face of sanctions, both seeking alternative economic and diplomatic channels.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"966\">In Latin America, Venezuela relies on longstanding ideological allies such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Bolivia. These governments consistently defend Caracas in regional bodies and maintain close ties through frameworks like ALBA-TCP and Petrocaribe.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"966\">Though Brazil and neighbouring Colombia are governed by left-wing governments, they have refused to recognise Maduro’s 2024 re-election. However, they have voiced concerns about the military threats against Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"why-isn-t-venezuela-wealthier\">Why isn’t Venezuela wealthier?</h2><p>Venezuela holds the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a>, estimated at 303 billion barrels in 2023. But it only exported $4bn worth of crude oil that same year, far below other oil-producing countries, largely due to <a href=\"/economy/2024/7/26/as-maduro-faces-gonzalez-in-venezuela-sanctions-remain-a-key-hurdle\">US sanctions</a> imposed during Trump’s first term.</p><p>The country’s oil production is dominated by PDVSA, which has faced challenges including ageing infrastructure, underinvestment, mismanagement and the effects of sanctions, all of which have limited Venezuela’s ability to fully exploit its vast reserves.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn), and Russia ($122bn).</p><p>Sanctions have also increased the price of imports. The country suffers from goods shortages and rampant inflation – the IMF forecasts it will reach 600 percent next year. The economic crisis, worsened by the US sanctions, has forced <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/venezuela-explained-in-10-maps-and-charts\">millions of people</a> to flee to neighbouring countries in recent years.</p><p>In 2024, Venezuela’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at <a href=\"https://statbase.org/data/ven-gdp-imf-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">$119.8bn</a>, placing it among the smallest economies in Latin America. Venezuela’s economic instability is rooted in years of harsh sanctions, as well as its reliance on oil.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-international-response-been\">What has the international response been?</h2><p>On November 30, Maduro called on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to help his country <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/is-us-president-donald-trump-preparing-to-strike-venezuela\">counter</a> the “growing and illegal threats” from the Trump administration.</p><p>In a letter to OPEC members, Venezuela’s President Maduro said, “I hope I can count on your best efforts to stop this growing aggression” So far, none of the group’s members have publicly responded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On November 25, Colombian President Gustavo Petro told CNN that Trump is “not thinking about the democratisation of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking”. He added that only a tiny portion of the global drugs trade flows through the Caribbean country.</p><h2 id=\"what-could-happen-next\">What could happen next?</h2><p>On November 17, when asked about the possibility of deploying US troops on Venezuelan soil, Trump told reporters at the White House, “I don’t rule out that. I don’t rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.”</p><p>Then, on Monday, Reuters reported that Trump offered Maduro safe passage out of Venezuela during a call on November 21. Maduro allegedly told Trump that he was willing to leave Venezuela, provided he and his family members had full legal amnesty.</p><p>The Venezuelan president also reportedly requested the removal of sanctions for more than 100 Venezuelan government officials, many accused by the US of human rights abuses, drug trafficking or corruption.</p><p>Trump rejected most of his requests on the call, but told Maduro he had a week to leave Venezuela for the destination of his choice alongside his family members. Al Jazeera, however, could not independently verify the report.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump told reporters without specifying whether he was referring to citizens or irregular migrants.</p><p>“Some people will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care … Their country is no good for a reason … Your country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country,” he said.</p><p>“These are people who do nothing but complain,” Trump continued. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”</p><p>Last week, in an address to the nation following the shooting of two National Guard members, which left one dead and another critically injured, Trump ordered that people from 19 blacklisted countries who held US green or permanent residency cards be “re-examined”.</p><p>He then pivoted to the Somali community in Minnesota in that address, saying, “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state.”</p><p>US media reported on Tuesday that an ICE operation focused on Somali communities in the Minneapolis-St Paul area will take place in the next few days.</p><p>A sweep by ICE officers will round up undocumented people for deportation, AP reported, citing a person familiar with the plans.</p><p>At least 100 ICE agents are expected to flood the area. The New York Times, also citing sources close to the plan, said Somalis in the process of seeking legal status could also be swept up.</p><p>Several states in recent months have experienced ICE raids on undocumented people, including Chicago, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York City and Phoenix. By October, at least 527,000 people had been deported from the US since the Trump administration took office in January, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>In a post on X on Tuesday, Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz slammed the plan for Minneapolis, saying that while the state welcomed support for prosecuting crime, “pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem”.</p><p>City officials also condemned President Trump’s attack on the Somali community at a press conference on Tuesday and promised not to cooperate with ICE agents conducting migrant checks.</p><p>“Obviously, this is a frightening moment for our Somali community,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, describing the possible move as “terrorising”.</p><p>“That’s not American. That’s not what we are about,” he said. “To our Somali community, we love you, and we stand with you.”</p><p>Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, who came to the US from Somalia when he was 14, said at the conference: “I know many families are fearful … the city of Minneapolis stands behind you.”</p><p>“Somali Americans are here to stay,” he added. “We love this state. We love this country. This is home. We’re not going anywhere.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Yes. On November 21, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was “immediately” terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, referring to a programme designed to provide emergency refuge for people whose countries are in crisis. About 705 Somalis are on that programme.</p><p>Without providing evidence, Trump claimed that “Somali gangs are terrorising the people of that great State” and accused Governor Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said. “It’s OVER!</p><p>Trump’s accusations about the Somali community come after a conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, published allegations of welfare fraud against Somalis in Minnesota in a magazine called City Journal on November 19.</p><p>In the report, Rufo, citing unnamed “counterterrorism sources” and a police detective, claimed that Somalis benefiting from US welfare programmes were sending back huge amounts in remittances to their country, and that some of that money had ended up with al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked armed group controlling some rural parts of Somalia.</p><p>One of the programmes Rufo referred to was fraudulent – the privately funded, $300m Feeding Our Future charity programme, which falsely claimed to be feeding millions of children amid the COVID-19 crisis but instead stole state funds.</p><p>Federal prosecutors have secured convictions for the ringleader, Aimee Bock, who is white, and several Somali-Americans.</p><p>In July, Somalia became one of 12 countries whose citizens are subject to a <a href=\"/wp-admin/post.php?post=3753857&amp;action=edit\">US travel ban</a>. It was similarly placed under a travel ban during the first Trump administration.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-targeted-ilhan-omar\">Why has Trump targeted Ilhan Omar?</h2><p>Trump also made disparaging remarks about Democratic congresswoman Omar in his Tuesday attack, calling her “garbage”.</p><p>Omar, 43, who emigrated from Somalia to the US in 1995 as a child, has represented her Minnesota district in the US Congress since 2019 and is an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>“She’s an incompetent person; she’s a real terrible person,” Trump said on Tuesday, adding without evidence that Omar “hates everybody” and is anti-Semitic.</p><p>Trump’s verbal attacks on Omar are not new. The president has repeatedly criticised the representative, routinely picking on her hijab and mode of dressing.</p><p>Omar hit back on the latest of Trump’s latest comments on Tuesday, saying: “His obsession with me is creepy.”</p><p></p><p>Omar also pushed back against claims that Minnesota funds have been diverted to al-Shabab or that Somali gangs are rife in the state. “I challenge you to come forward with evidence … if at all there’s any,” she said at a briefing last week. “You can’t victimise a whole community for the actions of a few.”</p><p>There are currently about 260,000 people of Somali descent residing in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. They are among the largest Somali communities outside Somalia, with other major diaspora communities found in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Sweden and Canada.</p><p>Some Somalis arrived in the US in the 1960s as students, after the then-British Somaliland gained independence. Later, there were larger waves of people fleeing the troubled East African country’s <a href=\"/features/2024/7/20/from-somalia-to-south-oregon-how-basketball-reunites-civil-war-survivors\">protracted civil war</a>, which stemmed from armed resistance to the military government of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. That lasted from 1988 until 2000, although the government continues to battle rebel groups and armed militants.</p><p>Most Somalis in the US live in Minnesota, where a number of social programmes are in existence, particularly in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, home to 63,000 people of Somali descent. States like Ohio (21,000), Washington (15,000), Virginia (3,953), Georgia (3,538), and California also have significant populations, according to the World Population Review.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-somali-diaspora-fared-in-the-us\">How has the Somali diaspora fared in the US?</h2><p>Minneapolis hosts several hundred Somali businesses, mostly in retail and food services and including restaurants, grocery stores and clothing stores.</p><p>Somalis arriving in the state during their native country’s civil war often faced challenges with learning English, but were able to take unskilled jobs, such as at meatpacking plants, according to a 2017 report by local publication MinnPost.</p><p>As the community grew, more Somalis branched into finance, health and education sectors. They also started getting into local politics. In 2019, Omar made history as the first Somali-American representative in the US Congress.</p><p>The average age of Somalis in Minnesota is young at 19, according to a 2023 report by the Minnesota state government. Most (53,000) speak English with professional or limited proficiency, but the group also has one of the lowest levels of educational attainment among foreign populations in the state.</p><p>Somalis are often described as active in the labour force, although more Somali men are employed than women. Contrary to Trump’s claims that Somalis do not work in the US, about 84 percent of male Somali refugees between 25 and 64 years were employed in the state of Kentucky compared to 64 percent of females, according to a 2016 report by the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.</p><p>About 58 percent of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US. Of those born abroad, about 87 percent are naturalised citizens. Nearly half of that group entered the US in 2010 or later.</p><p>US authorities have in the past struggled to prevent the recruitment of young Somali-American men by al-Shabab and other armed groups. In 2007, more than 20 Somali-American men travelled to Somalia to join al-Shabab. However, only a few cases have been reported since then. In September, a 23-year-old man in Minnesota pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to join a designated armed group.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

Prior to its withdrawal, Apple, based in the United States, reportedly said it would not comply with the order due to a host of privacy- and security-related issues.</p><p>Here is what we know.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-the-order-say\">What did the order say?</h2><p>Under the directive issued by India’s Department of Telecommunications, manufacturers were told to ensure that Sanchar Saathi was “pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India” within 90 days.</p><p>The app, manufacturers were told, was to be “readily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup” and its features “not disabled or restricted”.</p><p>For devices already in supply, manufacturers and importers were told to “make an endeavour to push the App through software updates”, the order stated.</p><p>The directive also required companies to submit compliance reports to the telecom ministry within 120 days.</p><p>According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) in May, more than <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/indicators/85-5-indian-households-posses-at-least-one-smartphone-99-5-youth-use-upi-mospi-survey/articleshow/121495764.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">85 percent</a> of households in India own smartphones.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-indian-government-order-this\">Why did the Indian government order this?</h2><p>Justifying the order, the government said the country’s Telecom Cyber Security Rules empower it to set up mechanisms “necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security”, and that Sanchar Saathi will enable “stakeholders to report International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) – related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices”.</p><p>The IMEI is a unique 15-digit number that is used to identify a specific mobile device.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-smartphone-manufacturers-respond\">How did smartphone manufacturers respond?</h2><p>An industry source familiar with Apple’s concern regarding the app told Reuters that the tech giant would explain to the Indian government that it does not follow any such mandates anywhere in the world.</p><p>Another industry insider told Reuters that South Korean-based tech company Samsung was reviewing the order, but had not given any details about how it planned to pursue the matter.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-criticisms-of-the-order\">What were the criticisms of the order?</h2><p>The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) of India called it a “deeply worrying expansion of executive control over personal digital devices”.</p><p>“The stated objective of curbing IMEI fraud and improving telecom security is, on its face, a legitimate state aim. But the means chosen are disproportionate, legally fragile, and structurally hostile to user privacy and autonomy,” it said in a statement.</p><p>Congress leader and Lok Sabha member Priyanka Gandhi called Sanchar Saathi a “snooping” app and “ridiculous”.</p><p>The Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Centre told Al Jazeera the directive was another example of attempts “to take away user autonomy, make a mockery of consent and have 24 hours State in My Home measure”.</p><p>“This is the start of a slippery slope of function creep. Such deep integration of state software on private devices ensures an expansion of surveillance capacities without fresh public debate each time new changes are made,” it said.</p><p>“Government has no business being in our devices that are more intimate to us than our loved ones.”</p><p>A similar controversy arose in 2020, when the Indian government required all public and private sector employees to use its COVID-19 contact tracing app, <a href=\"/news/2020/5/1/privacy-minefield-india-covid-19-app-raises-surveillance-fears\">Aarogya Setu</a>, which critics described as a “privacy minefield”.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-india-revoke-the-order\">When did India revoke the order?</h2><p>Early on Wednesday, the government said it would be willing to amend the order “based on the feedback we receive”. Hours later, the order was revoked.</p><p>“Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” India’s Communications Ministry said in a press statement.</p><p>“The app is secure and purely meant to help citizens from bad actors in the cyber world,” it added.</p><p></p><p>The IFF said that while this was a “welcome development”, it was still awaiting the full legal order accompanying the revocation.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"are-other-countries-making-similar-orders\">Are other countries making similar orders?</h2><p>Earlier this year, Russia launched Max, an app aimed at curbing the use of stolen phones in fraud schemes while also broadening access to state-backed digital services.</p><p>Russian authorities claim Max is more secure than apps provided by foreign competitors.</p><p>Developed by the state-controlled tech firm VK, Max is integrated with government platforms and has been mandatory on all new mobile phones and tablets sold since September 1.</p><p>Moscow said the move would ensure a “safer” digital ecosystem. However, critics argue the app is likely to be used for surveillance purposes, an allegation Moscow has rejected.</p><p>In August, Russia announced restrictions on voice calls on the WhatsApp and Telegram messaging apps, saying they had become the main voice services used to “involve Russian citizens in sabotage and terrorist activities”. It alleged that requests to take countermeasures had been “ignored” by the owners of the social media apps.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Khan and Bibi have denied all of the charges against them.</p><p>Here is what we know about why visits to Khan have been blocked.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-khan-in-jail\">Why is Khan in jail?</h2><p>Khan, who was prime minister of Pakistan from 2018 to 2022, has been in prison since his arrest in August 2023 on corruption charges. He is serving prison sentences following a slew of legal cases, including:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Al-Qadir Trust case:</strong> Khan and his wife were accused of accepting land worth 7 billion rupees ($25.12m) as a bribe from a real estate developer in exchange for illegal favours, via a trust called al-Qadir, which was established in 2018. In January 2025, Khan was sentenced by an Islamabad accountability court to 14 years in prison and Bibi to seven years, after being found guilty.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Toshakhana case:</strong> In August 2023, Khan was arrested and later found guilty of <a href=\"/news/2024/4/1/pakistan-court-suspends-imran-khans-prison-sentence-in-state-gifts-case\">selling state gifts</a> worth more than 140 million Pakistani rupees ($497,000), which he allegedly received during his premiership. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Anti-terrorism charges:</strong> Following Khan’s arrest in May 2023, his supporters staged often-violent protests across Pakistan. Khan now also faces anti-terrorism charges in relation to the protests. He was indicted in December 2024 in an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi and pleaded not guilty. He has not been tried yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Cypher case:</strong> Khan was charged with making public a classified cable – a cypher – sent to Islamabad by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington in 2022. He was indicted alongside senior PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in October 2023. Khan and Qureshi were found guilty by a special court established under the Official Secrets Act and were convicted in January 2024. Qureshi and Khan were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.</li>\n<li><strong>Iddat case:</strong> Khan and his wife were accused of marrying before his wife’s mandatory waiting period following her divorce from her previous husband. They were acquitted in July.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khan argues that all the cases brought against him are politically motivated.</p><h2>What did Uzma Khanum say about her visit to Khan?</h2><p>Following her visit with her brother on Tuesday, Khanum, who is a doctor, told reporters in Rawalpindi that her brother is confined to his cell for most of the day and is allowed outside for only a short period of time.</p><p>“He is physically well. But he is kept inside all the time and only goes out for a short while. There is no contact with anybody. He was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”</p><p>She added that her 30-minute meeting with Khan had been closely supervised, with no mobile devices allowed.</p><p>Later, alongside her sister Aleema Khanum and leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), she told the media: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”</p><h2 id=\"have-visits-to-khan-been-officially-blocked\">Have visits to Khan been officially blocked?</h2><p>Pakistan’s authorities have not confirmed whether there is an official block on visits to Khan or what the reason for that might be.</p><p>Tuesday’s meeting with his sister followed claims from Khan’s family and PTI leaders that visits to him had been blocked despite court orders allowing them.</p><p>In late October this year, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement an order it issued in March permitting Khan to meet with designated visitors on Tuesday and Thursday each week.</p><p>Family members say these visits were never allowed, however. As a result, rumours began to circulate among Khan’s supporters that he was either ill or being transferred to another jail. Some even speculated that Khan had died.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-action-have-his-family-and-supporters-taken\">What action have his family and supporters taken?</h2><p>Khan’s sisters and supporters have long protested against Khan’s imprisonment. They first staged a physical protest outside Adiala jail over the blocked access on November 18.</p><p>They said their protest was also in solidarity with the families of PTI members who were killed during clashes with security forces during earlier popular protests calling for Khan’s release from prison on May 9, 2023; October 4, 2024; and November 26, 2024.</p><p>On November 18, Khan’s sisters alleged that they were “violently detained” and manhandled while camping outside Adiala jail.</p><p>In a second protest outside the jail on November 25, which was livestreamed on the PTI YouTube channel, Aleema said: “Who knows, maybe Imran has been shifted. Why are they not letting us meet him?”</p><p>Then, Sohail Afridi, PTI member and chief minister of Pakistan’s northwestern province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, staged an overnight, livestreamed sit-in outside Adiala jail on November 28, claiming he had been denied access to Khan eight times.</p><p>Protests calling for Khan’s release also broke out in the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has been a PTI stronghold since 2013 when the party first formed a provincial government there.</p><p>Tuesday’s meeting between Khan and his sister finally took place as protests continued outside Adiala jail.</p><p>Then on Tuesday, local authorities enacted Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, allowing district administrations to forbid the assembly of four or more people in public areas for limited periods of time in two places – for two months in Islamabad and until Wednesday this week in Rawalpindi.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-government-said\">What has the government said?</h2><p>The government has not explicitly confirmed that visits to Khan have been barred or cited any reason for blocking access.</p><p>Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, a politician from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) told the National Assembly on November 28 that Khan was in good health and that rumours about his health had been spread by Indian and Afghan media.</p><p>“His health is perfectly fine and there is no danger to his life,” Chaudhry said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4147810\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4147810\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4147810\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-02T182023Z_1959443505_RC2B8IAGNJCW_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-POLITICS-KHAN-1764761871.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Imran Khan protest\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4147810\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of the jailed former prime minister of Pakistan and leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, Imran Khan, gather during a protest over concerns about his health, near Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on December 2, 2025 [Salahuddin/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-have-khan-s-jail-visits-caused-a-political-storm-in-pakistan\">Why have Khan’s jail visits caused a political storm in Pakistan?</h2><p>Some experts say that barring visits to Khan in jail is a political strategy that may backfire on Pakistan’s governing party, PML-N.</p><p>“The primary objective of blocking access and keeping Khan in solitary confinement is apparently meant to break him into [agreeing to] a compromise and neutralise the groundswell of antigovernment sentiment,” political analyst Imtiaz Gul, who is executive director of Islamabad-based think tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Usama Khilji, a columnist based in Pakistan and director of digital rights advocacy organisation Bolo Bhi, told Al Jazeera: “In Pakistan, politicians are either in government or in jail, with the security establishment having the main say behind the scenes in who gets to govern. Imran Khan is currently a victim of politically motivated cases where due process is undermined through an increasingly managed judiciary.”</p><p>Khan’s PTI was barred from contesting in the 2024 national elections, and several party leaders have been arrested. Party members contested the elections as independent candidates and won more seats than any other party.</p><p>But the PTI alleged that the government and military rigged the election to deny them even more seats – and independent observers also pointed to several irregularities in vote counting. The government and military have repeatedly rejected accusations that the elections were manipulated.</p><p>“As the most popular politician in Pakistan at the moment, his political party has faced systematic persecution, and their protests have been met with violent pushback and a virtual outlawing of any kind of demonstrations,” Khilji said.</p><p>“Restricting access to him in jail is being done in violation of court orders and prisoners’ rights in order to send a message to his party and other politicians: if you don’t toe the line, there will be severe consequences.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
