The deleted files included a photograph showing President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law after it passed through Congress in November, required the government to release all remaining unclassified material in its possession relating to Epstein’s and his girlfriend <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-justice-department-to-discuss-epstein-with-ghislaine-maxwell\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>’s sex trafficking cases.

The youngest interviewee was 14, according to local media.</p><p>One woman, then aged 21, told a grand jury that Epstein had hired her when she was 16 to perform a sexual massage and that she had gone on to recruit other girls to do the same.</p><p>“For every girl that I brought to the table, he would give me $200,” she said.</p><p>They were mostly people she knew from high school, she said, adding that she told them that if they were under age, “just lie about it and tell him that you are 18.”</p><p>Much of the material published had already been circulating in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.</p><p>However, many of the new photos – some of them heavily blacked out – feature well-known public figures.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4187476\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4187476\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4187476\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-20T005045Z_472376227_RC2VJIAVIR80_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-FILES-1766303368.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C575&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"clinton\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4187476\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left from second from left, Ghislaine Maxwell, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and former US President Bill Clinton are seen in this image, part of the latest trove of documents from US government investigations into Epstein [Handout/US Justice Department via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-features-in-the-newly-released-photos\">Who features in the newly released photos?</h2><p>Among the documents released on Friday are photographs in a folder labelled “DOJ Disclosures”.

However, that would likely be a lengthy process.</p><p>Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files, which could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee. But that would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169671\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169671\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_083516_Redacted2-Copy-1765560353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C612&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump with women whose face has been censored\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This undated photo released by the US House Oversight Committee from Epstein’s estate shows Trump surrounded by six women whose identities have been concealed [Handout/US House Oversight Committee]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

It claimed that Abdel Qader had been shot after hurling a block towards its soldiers, who responded with fire, while Zayoud had thrown an explosive.</p><p>No Israeli troops were injured in the incidents, it said.</p><p>The latest deaths bring the death toll from Israeli attacks in the occupied West Bank to 1,101, including 229 children, since October 7, 2023 – the day of the Hamas-led attack that led to a brutal Israeli response against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Nearly 21,000 Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli authorities during that period. As of December 1, some 9,300 Palestinian prisoners were in Israeli jails, more than a third of them detained without charges.</p><p>Palestinian prisoners have routinely been tortured, sexually abused and even killed in custody, while attacks by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have surged amid the mainstreaming of the far-right in the country. Israel has confirmed the identities of 86 Palestinian prisoners who died in its custody. On Sunday, the Israeli government approved the construction of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/israel-approves-19-new-west-bank-settlements-in-major-annexation-push\">19 new settlements</a> in the occupied West Bank in violation of international laws.</p><p>Numerous rights organisations have dubbed Israeli action in Gaza as an act of genocide, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes.</p><p>The violence has played out in tandem with ongoing deadly Israeli attacks in Gaza, in violation of the ceasefire signed in October, prompting warnings that they could jeopardise diplomatic efforts to advance to the second phase of the United States-brokered agreement. Israel has killed at least 400 Palestinians since the ceasefire pushed by US President Donald Trump came into effect on October 10.</p><h2 id=\"two-killed-in-gaza-city\">Two killed in Gaza City</h2><p>Meanwhile, a medical source at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital said two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sunday in the Shujayea neighbourhood in the east of the city.</p><p>The source said the killings took place near the so-called yellow line, demarcating territory under Israeli military control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>An Al Jazeera team on the ground reported that Israeli artillery shelling and helicopter gunfire were also targeting areas near Israeli positions east of Khan Younis, in the south of the Strip.</p><p>The latest killings in Gaza came a day after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-qatar-egypt-turkey-urge-gaza-restraint-as-israeli-strikes-continue\">told Turkish state news</a> agency Anadolu that Israel’s repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement are “creating major risks for transitioning to the second phase”.</p><p>Fidan’s comments came as he joined diplomats from the US, Egypt and Qatar in the US city of Miami to review the first phase of the agreement reached in October.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gaza’s Ministry of Interior and National Security said four people were killed when a three-storey house collapsed in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood on Saturday night.</p><p>The latest deaths brought the total number of people killed in such circumstances to 18 since the ceasefire came into effect in October.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza said on Sunday it had successfully rescued five people, including a child and two women, from the building.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The way the story is often told is that Western countries gifted human rights to the world and are the sole guardians of it. It may come as a surprise for some, then, that the international legal framework for prohibiting racial discrimination largely owes its existence to the efforts of states from the Global South.</p><p>In 1963, in the midst of the decolonisation wave, a group of nine newly independent African states presented a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) calling for the drafting of an international treaty on the elimination of racial discrimination. As the representative from Senegal observed: “Racial discrimination was still the rule in African colonial territories and in South Africa, and was not unknown in other parts of the world … The time had come to bring all States into that struggle.”</p><p>The groundbreaking International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) was unanimously adopted by the UNGA two years later. The convention rejected any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation as “scientifically false, morally condemnable and socially unjust”.</p><p>Today, as we mark 60 years since its adoption, millions of people around the world continue to face racial discrimination – whether in policing, migration policies or exploitative labour conditions.</p><p>In Brazil, Amnesty International documented how a deadly police operation in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas this October resulted in the massacre by security forces of more than 100 people, most of them Afro-Brazilians and living in poverty.</p><p>In Tunisia, we have seen how authorities have for the past three years used migration policies to carry out racially targeted arrests and detentions and mass expulsions of Black refugees and asylum seekers.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, Kenyan female domestic workers face racism and exploitation from their employers, enduring gruelling and abusive working conditions.</p><p>In the United States, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives aimed at tackling systemic racism have been eliminated across federal agencies. Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeting migrants and refugees are a horrifying feature of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation and detention agenda, rooted in white supremacist narratives.</p><p>Migrants held in detention centres have been subjected to torture and a pattern of deliberate neglect designed to dehumanise and punish.</p><p>Elsewhere, Amnesty International has documented how new digital technologies are automating and entrenching racism, while social media offers inadequately moderated forums for racist and xenophobic content. For example, our investigation into the United Kingdom’s Southport racist riots found that X’s design and policy choices created fertile ground for the inflammatory, racist narratives that resulted in the violent targeting of Muslims and migrants.</p><p>Even human rights defenders from the Global South face racial discrimination when they have to apply for visas to Global North countries in order to attend meetings where key decisions are made on human rights.</p><p>All these instances of systemic racism have their roots in the legacies of European colonial domination and the racist ideologies on which they were built. This era, which spanned nearly four centuries and extended across six continents, saw atrocities that had historical consequences – from the erasure of Indigenous populations to the transatlantic slave trade.</p><p>The revival of anti-right movements globally has led to a resurgence of racist and xenophobic rhetoric, a scapegoating of migrants and refugees, and a retrenchment in anti-discrimination measures and protections.</p><p>At the same time, Western states have been all too willing to dismantle international law and institutions to legitimise Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and shield Israeli authorities from justice and accountability.</p><p>Just as the creation of the ICERD was driven by African states 60 years ago, Global South countries continue to be at the forefront of the fight against racial oppression, injustice and inequality. South Africa notably brought the case against Israel at the International Court of Justice and cofounded The Hague Group – a coalition of eight Global South states organising to hold Israel accountable for genocide.</p><p>On the reparations front, it is Caribbean and African states, alongside Indigenous peoples, Africans and people of African descent, that are leading the pursuit of justice. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has been intensifying pressure on European governments to reckon with their colonial past, including during a recent visit to the United Kingdom by the CARICOM Reparations Commission.</p><p>As the African Union announced 2026-36 the Decade of Reparations last month, African leaders gathered in Algiers for the International Conference on the Crimes of Colonialism, at which they consolidated demands for the codification of colonialism as a crime under international law.</p><p>But this is not enough. States still need to confront racism as a structural and systemic issue, and stop pretending slavery and colonialism are a thing of the past with no impact on our present.</p><p>Across the world, people are resisting. In Brazil, last month, hundreds of thousands of Afro-Brazilian women led the March of Black Women for Reparations and Wellbeing against racist and gendered historic violence. In the US, people fought back against the wave of federal immigration raids this year, with thousands taking to the streets in Los Angeles to protest and residents of Chicago mobilising to protect migrant communities and businesses against ICE raids.</p><p>Governments need to listen to their people and fulfil their obligations under ICERD and national law to protect the marginalised and oppressed against discrimination.</p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7201\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

His lawyer and family members say he has been beaten, tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment in Israeli custody, including prolonged periods of solitary confinement.</p><p>“We are clear about this vocabulary – they are hostages, not like any prisoners, and our symbol today is Dr Hussam Abu Safia,” said Adnan Hmidan, chair of the Palestinian Forum in the United Kingdom and the event organiser.</p><p>“They collected him from the hospital while he was wearing his white coat and took him in the tank, in front of everyone in that hospital,” Hmidan said, adding that some Palestinian detainees are unable to see their lawyers and do not have court dates.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Addameer, a Palestinian human rights organisation tracking political prisoners, said there are 9,300 Palestinian political prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons, with the majority of them held without trial or charge.</p><p>The group said the figure does not include detainees held in Israeli military camps. Addameer said there are at least 3,350 Palestinians arrested from the occupied West Bank who are classified as ”administrative detainees”.</p><p>Israeli human rights organisation, B’Tselem, said, according to official figures from the Israel Prison Service, about 10,900 Palestinians were being held in Israeli prisons or detention facilities on “security” grounds as of late 2025. This includes 2,931 people from the Gaza Strip, according to the same source.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Activists and human rights advocates at the London vigil said they hoped their campaign would eventually have a tangible effect.</p><p>“It’s also to remind people what’s going on, and that we haven’t forgotten them, and I know from other sources that people in Gaza, in Palestine, appreciate that we here are doing all that we can,” Eva Nazem told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“People who could do something are staying quiet, not doing enough, the government, and we just need to keep putting the pressure on,” Nazem said.</p><p>“Our presence here is twofold. It’s to remind people that it isn’t over, the ceasefire is in name only. It’s not effective. People like Dr Safia, who have been absolute heroes, are imprisoned and tortured, and it’s not acceptable,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As people stood in silence holding placards, Palestinian Forum’s Hmidan was keen not to frame the London event as a demonstration or a protest march, instead describing it as “a silent, peaceful act of solidarity”.</p><p>“There are many ways of lobbying and campaigning. We respect different kinds of protest, but here we have something about humanitarian issues,” he said.</p><p>“They [Palestinian prisoners] are human, they have their own stories, they have their own families,” Hmidan told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"
