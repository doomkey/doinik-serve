A local intranet that offers some limited services is operational.</p><p>The protests on the streets have now largely died down, with thousands of heavily armed security forces setting up patrols and checkpoints across the country, especially at <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/irans-commercial-hubs-became-flashpoints-for-frustration\">flashpoints like the Grand Bazaar in Tehran</a>.</p><p>The distribution of videos of the protests outside of Iran has been rare amid the digital blackout, with only a minority of Iranians able to leave the country or connect to Starlink satellite internet that bypasses the government’s internet restrictions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-state-say\">What does the state say?</h2><p>Iranian officials, from political to military and judicial leaders, have emphasised on a daily basis that the US and Israel have been behind the protests, accusing the foreign powers of arming and funding the opposition.</p><p>Khamenei, Iran’s 86-year-old supreme leader, said that Trump was a “criminal” for directly involving himself in the unrest numerous times.</p><p>According to Iranian government, armed and trained “terrorists”, not state forces, were directly responsible for the killings of thousands during the protests. They claim that people acting on behalf of the US and <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/network-linked-to-israel-pushes-to-shape-external-iran-protest-narrative\">Israel</a> shot and stabbed people to derail peaceful demonstrations.</p><p>Judiciary officials have stressed that those who took part in “riots” will face swift punishments without any mercy shown. The Supreme Court and the general prosecutor’s office announced on Sunday that they had formed a joint workgroup to expedite protest-related cases.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-foreign-based-monitors-saying\">What are foreign-based monitors saying?</h2><p>Foreign-based monitors and Iranians abroad who are opposed to the Iranian establishment maintain that state forces killed protesters in huge numbers.</p><p>The latest figures by the widely-cited <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA)</a>, which is based in the US, say more than 3,300 deaths have been confirmed, and over 4,300 others are being investigated.</p><p>The organisation also says 2,107 people have been severely wounded, and more than 24,000 arrested.</p><p>The Reuters news agency on Sunday cited an unnamed Iranian official in the region as saying at least 5,000 people have been killed, including about 500 security personnel. Most deaths were reportedly recorded in the Kurdish-majority areas of Iran in the northwest.</p><p>Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify these figures.</p><p>Foreign-based outlets have also reported that Iranian authorities demand so-called “bullet money” from the families of protesters killed by security forces in order to allow their burial, or demand that families sign documents saying they were members of the Basij paramilitary force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and not protesters. Iranian officials have rejected both claims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-us-and-israel-saying\">What are the US and Israel saying?</h2><p>US and Israeli officials have been openly touting the potential for toppling the theocratic leadership in Tehran over recent months, including during the 12-day war in June.</p><p>At the height of the protests, Trump urged Iranians to remain in the streets, alleging “help is on the way”, before expressing “great respect” for the Iranian leadership based on a claim that planned executions for more than 800 political prisoners were halted.</p><p>The US president “speaks a lot of nonsense”, Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said on Saturday in reaction to the claim, adding that “our response will be deterring and quick”.</p><p>But Trump has not stopped his comments, and on Saturday called for the end of Khamenei’s 37-year rule and branded the Iranian leader a “sick man”.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refrained from directly commenting on the protests. Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Netanyahu ordered his officials to stop giving interviews on the subject after Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said last week that Israeli operatives are active in Iran “right now” as they were during the 12-day war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Although he faced his biggest challenger in the form of popular opposition candidate and musician Robert “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/protect-the-vote-bobi-wine-opposition-brace-for-tense-uganda-election\">Bobi Wine</a>” Kyagulanyi, the country’s electoral commission declared that Museveni had won with 72 percent of the vote.</p><p>At 81, Museveni is the third-longest serving president in the world.</p><p>His control over Uganda, analysts say, is absolute, and the appointment of his son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as army chief back in 2024 has prompted worries among activists of a dynastic succession plan in the near future.</p><p>In a young country where about 70 percent of the 46 million population is under 35, Museveni is the only president most Ugandans have ever known. By the time he completes his latest term in 2031, he will have served for 45 years.</p><p>However, he is not alone. Across Africa, from hilly Kampala to riverside Brazzaville, several “life-long” leaders like him have held onto power for decades, despite organising routine elections that give their administrations the semblance of democratic rule.</p><p>Political experts studying these figures say at least three of them: Museveni of Uganda, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/cameroons-biya-worlds-oldest-ruler-at-92-sworn-in-for-eighth-term\">Paul Biya</a> of Cameroon, and Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo, have perfected unique formulas that help them consolidate power, using tools like compromised elections, divide and rule tactics, and powerful foreign alliances.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the three governments for comments, but did not get a response.</p><p class=\"mceTemp\"></p><figure id=\"attachment_1340797\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1340797\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1340797\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/000_1JU8NT.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"National Resistance Army (NRA) leader Yoweri Museveni during his first cabinet meeting after being sworn in as president of Uganda\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1340797\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In a picture taken on January 29, 1986, in Kampala, then National Resistance Army (NRA) leader Yoweri Museveni, right, holds his first cabinet meeting after being sworn in as president of Uganda [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"in-uganda-fighting-corruption-with-corruption\">In Uganda, fighting corruption ‘with corruption’</h2><p>For Museveni, violence is used as a means to suppress dissent and keep allies in check, Kampala-based political analyst Job Kiija told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The regional strongman was first sworn in as president back in 1986, after he led the rebel National Resistance Army to overturn an unpopular civilian administration in a violent six-year conflict now known as the Ugandan Bush War. He has remained president under the rebranded National Resistance Movement.</p><p>Museveni’s ideas of leadership were likely shaped early on, as a political science student in neighbouring Tanzania, researchers note. At the time, he studied philosopher and anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon’s theory of violence.</p><p>Violence, Fanon wrote in his book, The Wretched of the Earth, was the highest form of political struggle, one necessary for decolonisation. In his final year thesis (<a href=\"https://ekitibwakyabuganda.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/origins-of-museveni-politics-of-violence.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>), Museveni focused on that theory and wholly supported the philosopher’s position.</p><p>Rather than apply that thinking to a colonial force, however, Museveni has unleashed it on opposition leaders, journalists, and activists in Uganda, Kiija said.</p><p>In 2020, when Bobi Wine first emerged on the political scene under the umbrella of the National Unity Party, the opposition candidate immediately garnered widespread support, particularly from young people. Ugandan forces, however, responded forcefully to his rallies, killing many Bobi Wine supporters.</p><p>The same scenarios played out in the lead-up to this month’s election. Security forces targeted opposition rallies with excessive force and subjected opposition supporters to arbitrary arrests and torture, according to a report from rights group Amnesty International.</p><p>Opposition figures are also routinely jailed in Uganda. <a href=\"/news/2025/8/9/uganda-court-denies-bail-to-opposition-leader-kizza-besigye-in-treason-case\">Kizza Besigye</a>, a Museveni ally turned four-time presidential candidate, has been imprisoned since November 2024 on accusations of plotting to remove Museveni. He faces a treason charge, which is punishable by death in the country.</p><p>Within his own camp, Kiija said, Museveni deliberately allows his allies to overstep their boundaries, and then holds their actions over their heads to deter dissent.</p><p>“He allows people around him to dip their hands in state coffers, so that they are soiled, and then he uses that against them,” the analyst said.</p><p>“Everyone around him – he has a portfolio on them, he knows how much you have stolen, what you have amassed, and that’s one of the reasons we can’t fight corruption because he uses that as a tool to keep people in check.”</p><p>Uganda has suffered political instability since its independence from Britain in 1962. The British colonialists employed indirect rule and appointed members of the majority Buganda tribe to important positions, while excluding others. Post-colonial Uganda’s instability and weak institutions are partly attributed to that history, experts say.</p><p>In 2005, the Ugandan parliament removed term limits from the constitution, paving the way for Museveni to run indefinitely.</p><p>Although rich in gold, oil, and cash crops like coffee, the country is reliant on Western aid. Museveni positions the country as a stabilising force in the Great Lakes region, contributing troops to regional missions, such as in the fight against the al-Shabab armed group in Somalia, thus gaining Western support.</p><p>Uganda also hosts two million refugees from South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Sudan – more than any other African nation.</p><p>Among its biggest donors is the United States. Washington contributed about $970m in yearly development aid, mainly for health and humanitarian needs, although US concerns over democratic backsliding and Uganda’s criminalisation of same-sex relations strained ties. The current Trump administration has, however, severely cut aid globally, affecting the country.</p><p>While Museveni was the clear favourite to win Thursday’s vote, Bobi Wine has dismissed the results as “fake”. Meanwhile, eyes are now on how Museveni’s eldest child, Kainerugaaba, will be positioned in the near future. The 51-year-old, Kiija said, is clearly being groomed for the top job.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4089362\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4089362\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4089362\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25310428881930-1762433868.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President Paul Biya casts his ballot in Yaounde, Cameroon\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4089362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cameroon’s President Paul Biya casts his ballot in Yaounde, Cameroon, on October 12, 2025, in a presidential election that extended his rule for an eighth term [File: Angel Ngwe/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"cameroon-s-absentee-president\">Cameroon’s ‘absentee president’</h2><p>Just months before Museveni soared to an easy victory, on the opposite side of the continent, Biya, the 92-year-old president of Cameroon, won an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/cameroons-biya-worlds-oldest-ruler-at-92-sworn-in-for-eighth-term\">eighth term</a> in office in October’s presidential polls.</p><p>Biya, who heads the governing Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC), has been in power since 1982 and is the world’s oldest sitting president. The country’s parliament removed term limits in 2008, and last year’s win gives him another seven years at the helm.</p><p>The president is known for spending extensive periods away from the spotlight and even abroad, earning him the nickname “absentee president”. There have been frequent speculations about his health, with <a href=\"/news/2024/10/16/where-is-cameroons-paul-biya-and-why-is-his-health-a-banned\">rumours of his death</a> circulating on social media now and again, only for the president to pop up briefly on national television.</p><p>Still, few Cameroonians, least of all politician Kah Walla, were surprised when Biya won another term.</p><p>Walla, 60, who competed in three past presidential races, told Al Jazeera that the president uses the very tool essential to democracies: elections.</p><p>“We live in an electoral autocracy where the dictator has figured out how to use elections as one of the instruments to keep himself in power,” she said, adding that the electoral body is essentially an extension of the government.</p><p>Manu Lekunze, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, told Al Jazeera that Biya uses well-funded information campaigns to “divide-and-rule” between Cameroon’s multiple ethnic groups.</p><p>Biya’s campaign machine often harps on how opposition politicians will represent only their ethnic groups, he said. Biya himself enjoys support from his Beti tribe, the adjacent majority Bamileke-Bamus, and the Fulanis by staying close to traditional leaders.</p><p>“He believes he is going to live for a long time,” Lekunze said. “[He] has an ethnic coalition that will support him regardless, and he uses that to get the simple majority he needs, which makes him really comfortable in power.”</p><p>Like Museveni, Biya is also accused of using violence – but “selectively”, Walla noted. Some Cameroonians, she said, refuse to call their country a “dictatorship” because there’s a semblance of freedom.</p><p>“Biya realised that you need to give people a channel to vent so the resistance won’t build,” Walla said.</p><p>“You can go on TV and say anything about the president, and nothing might happen, but someone else might say the same thing, or even less, and be punished [arrested] for it. So that has led people to self-censor because nobody knows where the line is.”</p><p>At least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroon-security-forces-killed-48-election-protests-un-sources-say-2025-11-04/\">48 people</a> were killed by security forces during protests in support of opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma, who claimed Biya’s win in October as fraudulent, and declared himself the winner. The now-exiled Tchiroma abandoned Biya’s government to run in the elections and gained support from his Fulani group, as well as several others.</p><p>In 2016, security forces also notably cracked down on the country’s minority Anglophone regions – the Southwest and Northwest regions – after teachers and lawyers there took to the streets to decry the lack of opportunities for English-speakers. British and French <a href=\"/features/2025/2/25/the-colonial-partition-that-keeps-cameroon-split-along-artificial-lines\">colonial rule</a> saw two distinct entities merged after independence, but the imbalance tilts in favour of the majority Francophone population.</p><p>The violent government response escalated into an ongoing rebellion, with armed groups fighting for the secession of an independent state, Ambazonia.</p><p>Surrounding Biya is a tight elite that Lekunze says benefits from the status quo, including Ferdinand Ngoh-Ngoh, the country’s secretary-general and de facto president. However, Biya has never identified or visibly groomed a successor.</p><p>There are fears that the lack of a single, known face to rally around in the case of Biya’s death could cause political turmoil within his party, and likely, the country. Walla, though, believes that would be helpful.</p><p>“Should he pass away, we will be in an extremely uncertain position, but it is still in our best interests to take to the streets at that point because if we don’t, the system will perpetuate itself,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3370607\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3370607\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3370607\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241207__36PN2VK__v1__HighRes__FranceReligionHeritageMonumentNotreDameCeremony-1733599622.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3370607\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left, Republic of the Congo’s First Lady Antoinette Sassou Nguesso and President Denis Sassou Nguesso stand beside US former First Daughter Ashley Biden, former First Lady Jill Biden, France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron, US President Donald Trump, and French President Emmanuel Macron during a ceremony at Notre-Dame Cathedral, in Paris, on December 7, 2024 [File: Ludovic Marin/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"power-petroleum-foreign-backers-in-congo-brazzaville\">Power, petroleum, foreign backers in Congo-Brazzaville</h2><p>Despite protests in the streets and unrest among opposition figures in Cameroon and Uganda, the two pivotal presidential elections ended with no real change in leaderships that have been cemented over decades.</p><p>Meanwhile, another octogenarian is seek yet another term under similar conditions. In the Republic of the Congo, 81-year-old President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has held office for 40 years, is set to run again in the March 2026 vote under his Congo Labour Party.</p><p>Nguesso was first elected to office in 1979 and led the country for 12 years before losing elections. On his second attempt in 1997, he seized power in a bloody civil war, and has remained in office since. In 2015, Nguesso also pushed through a controversial referendum that removed presidential term limits.</p><p>Under him, Congo has remained grossly underdeveloped despite its oil wealth, with basic infrastructure lacking due to corruption, said Andrea Ngombert, the exiled founder of Sassoufit, a group advocating for Nguesso’s exit.</p><p>Powerful foreign alliances, Ngombert noted, have helped Nguesso consolidate power for decades as he keeps a secure hold on powerful entities, including through marriage.</p><p>His daughter, the late Edith Bongo, married into the <a href=\"/features/2023/9/1/has-gabons-all-powerful-bongo-dynasty-really-lost-its-55-year-grip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dynastic Bongo</a> family, which ruled Gabon for decades until a military coup in 2023.</p><p>Nguesso was also a strong ally of the late Angolan president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. When he returned to seize power, a thousand Angolan forces supported his “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(militia)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ninja</a>” militia and helped secure his victory.</p><p>The president similarly had backing from France, which provided him with arms during the war to protect oil investments in Congo, Ngombert said.</p><p>“He is not just operating on a continental level, but on an international one,” the activist said.</p><p>“He has his nose in everyone’s business, and he knows when to pull your secrets out to control you. Everyone knows if you need things to work, you must have Nguesso on your side.”</p><p>Ngueso’s influence in Paris has, however, plummeted since 2013, after pressure from civil society finally forced France to launch investigations into his family’s numerous assets in Europe and the US. In 2022, French authorities seized property belonging to his son, Denis-Christel Sassou Nguesso.</p><p>In place of France, observers say Nguesso has turned to China.</p><p>Beijing offers the government loans and foreign direct investment, and can use its veto power to shield Nguesso from possible scrutiny at the United Nations in return for lucrative oil deals, Ngombert said. Nguesso has also defended China in the face of reported rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and is against the recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state.</p><p>“In this arrangement, China is the shark and Congo-Brazzaville the remora – an asymmetrical but symbiotic relationship in which one feeds off the other and removes harmful parasites, while the other provides protection from other predators,” Ngombert added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"are-free-elections-at-stake-in-africa\">Are free elections at stake in Africa?</h2><p>Across Africa, observers argue, the three leaders and several others have used force, divisive tactics, and foreign backing to secure and maintain power.</p><p>Ironically, analysts say, they have also perfected using elections – meant to be an essential democratic tool – to disenfranchise citizens.</p><p>“Elections have become a ritual, a way of just ticking the box for these leaders, but they are not held meaningfully for citizens who want to be able to express their feelings with votes,” Tendai Mbanje, an elections expert at South Africa’s University of Pretoria, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Electoral institutions have been captured and have deviated from their mandate, and the people leading them have no integrity, as most are political appointees,” he added.</p><p>Yet, despite this bleak outlook, African countries don’t have the luxury to discard elections: citizens cannot afford to stop voting or requesting fair electoral conditions, he warned.</p><p>“We should not abandon elections because they remain the only legitimate way for citizens to state their choice,” Mbanje said.</p><p>“What people need to do is to resist – through protests, through legal mobilisation. Opposition leaders, citizen movements, and religious leaders must all rise in resistance.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

And if there comes a time when we need to, we will, but it’s not now,” Blanche added.</p><p>Increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers have erupted in Minneapolis since Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot behind the wheel of her car while protesting by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.</p><p>Blanche also said that footage of Good’s death has already “been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones when it happened”.</p><p>However, analysis conducted by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and APM Reports found that there still remain questions about the shooting, including why it allegedly took more than 10 minutes after Good was shot before she was given CPR.</p><p>According to the MPR and APM reports, ICE agents left Good “bleeding and alone in the car for almost three minutes” and “turned away a man identifying himself as a physician who offered to help”.</p><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good up to four times, was acting in self-defence.</p><p>Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and White House adviser Stephen Miller, have also said that ICE officers have <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/fact-check-do-ice-officers-really-have-federal-immunity-in-the-us\">“absolute immunity”</a> for their immigration enforcement actions.</p><p>Meanwhile, lawyers representing Good’s family said last week that they have launched their own “civil investigation” into her death.</p><p>“People in Minneapolis and across this country truly, truly care about what happened to Renee Good on January 7, 2026, and are committed to understanding how she could have been killed on the street after dropping her child off at school,” lawyer Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"top-minnesota-democrats-under-investigation\">Top Minnesota Democrats under investigation</h2><p>Blanche also separately <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/minneapolis-mayor-says-reported-doj-probe-intimidation-amid-ice-raids\">confirmed reports</a> that the DOJ has launched an investigation into Minnesota Governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, alleging the two Democratic leaders were “encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE”.</p><p>Blanche’s comments are the first time a member of the Trump administration has confirmed media reports that Walz and Frey are under investigation.</p><p>“No matter who you are, whether you’re a governor, a mayor or somebody out there on the streets assaulting ice, you cannot, under federal law, you cannot impede a federal officer doing their job, and that’s what we’re looking at,” said Blanche.</p><p>Responding to earlier media reports that the DOJ had launched its probe, Frey said he would “not be intimidated”.</p><p>“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey said in a post on X.</p><p>Walz, meanwhile, responded to the reports indirectly, saying in a statement: “Weaponising the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”</p><p>Walz also drew comparison to US Democratic Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, who are <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/five-us-lawmakers-investigated-over-warning-troops-about-illegal-orders\">under investigation</a> by the Trump administration after appearing with other Democratic lawmakers in a video urging members of the military to resist “illegal orders” given by their superiors.</p></div></div></body></html>"

China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it.”</p><p>Trump added, “The National Security of the United States, and the World at large, is at stake.”</p><p>He wrote that starting on February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would be charged a 10 percent tariff on their exports to the US.</p><p>On June 1, the tariff would be increased to 25 percent, he said. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years. Many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused.”</p><h2 id=\"is-trump-the-first-us-president-to-seek-control-of-greenland\">Is Trump the first US president to seek control of Greenland?</h2><p>Leaders in Denmark and Greenland have consistently insisted that Greenland is not for sale. In the past few days, Greenlanders have been protesting against Trump’s wishes to acquire Greenland. Yet Trump has pushed for acquiring the Arctic territory since his first term, and he is not the first US president to pursue such a purchase.</p><p>After buying Alaska from Russia in 1867, then-Secretary of State William H Seward unsuccessfully sought to buy Greenland. During World War II, the US occupied Greenland after Germany invaded Denmark and built military and radio facilities there. It maintains a permanent presence today at the Pituffik Space Base in the northwest.</p><p>In 1946, while Greenland was still a Danish colony, President Harry S Truman secretly offered Denmark $100m for the island, but Copenhagen refused. The proposal became public only in 1991.</p><p>American citizens do not support Washington acquiring Greenland, polls have indicated. This week, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of US residents showed less than one in five respondents support the idea of acquiring Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2><p>The location and natural resources of the island make it strategically important for Washington.</p><p>Greenland is geographically part of North America, located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It is home to 56,000 residents, mostly <a href=\"/program/witness/2021/6/17/the-fight-for-greenland-a-new-generation-speaks\">Indigenous Inuit people</a>.</p><p>Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, is closer to New York – about 2,900km (1,800 miles) – than the Danish capital, Copenhagen, located 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>It is a NATO territory through Denmark and an EU-associated overseas territory with residents holding EU citizenship.</p><p>Its location offers the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it strategically vital for US military operations and missile early-warning systems. Washington has also sought more radar coverage around the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap to monitor Russian and Chinese movements.</p><p>Greenland is rich in minerals, including most of the EU’s listed “critical raw materials”, but there is no oil and gas extraction, and many Indigenous residents oppose large-scale mining. The economy mainly depends on fishing.</p><p>As climate change opens up more of the Arctic, leading powers such as the US, Canada, China and Russia are increasingly interested in its untapped resources.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-europe-responded-to-trump-s-tariff-threats\">How has Europe responded to Trump’s tariff threats?</h2><p>All 27 members of the EU convened for an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss their response to Trump’s threat.</p><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded in a post on X on Saturday, saying: “Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes.”</p><p>“Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration,” Starmer wrote.</p><p></p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also responded in an X post, saying: “The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US.</p><p>“Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.”</p><p></p><p>European Council President Antonio Costa shared a post identical to von der Leyen’s on his own X account.</p><p></p><p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X: “China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among Allies.”</p><p>“Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity,” Kallas added.</p><p>David van Weel, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, said during an interview on Dutch television on Sunday: “It’s blackmail what he’s doing … and it’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance [NATO], and it also doesn’t help Greenland.”</p><h2 id=\"trade-bazooka-what-countermeasures-could-europe-take\">Trade Bazooka: What countermeasures could Europe take?</h2><p>During the emergency EU meeting on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron requested the bloc to activate the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), also called the trade bazooka, according to news reports.</p><p>The trade bazooka is a legal mechanism that the EU adopted in 2023 to protect European countries from economic pressure by non-EU countries.</p><p>It was adopted, keeping countries like China in mind, rather than allies like the US, CNN reported, citing Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.</p><p>The trade bazooka involves a series of measures, including steep retaliatory tariffs. The EU could limit or block access for certain US goods, services or companies to its single market.</p><p>It could impose measures that restrict the US use of EU‑based financial infrastructure, increasing funding costs for US banks and firms that depend on Europe.</p></div></div></body></html>"
