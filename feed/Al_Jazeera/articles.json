Less than 24 hours later, US special forces attacked Caracas, abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his home and took him to New York to face trial on “narcoterrorism” charges.</p><p>In showing that his administration can follow through on threats in Venezuela, Trump has escalated the psychological pressure on the Islamic Republic. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called his statement “reckless and dangerous”. Clearly, the Iranian government got the warning.</p><p>However, Iran is no Venezuela. What happened in Caracas on Saturday cannot really take place in Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"a-solid-military-infrastructure\">A solid military infrastructure</h2><p>The realities of operability, which allowed an invasion to occur in Venezuela, highlight why a similar intervention in Iran is simply out of the question for the US.</p><p>The CIA had operated in Caracas for half a year, preparing for the operation. The intelligence agency had an asset close to Maduro who helped track him down. In the early hours of Saturday, US fighter jets launched air strikes on military targets in and around Caracas. A US special forces team was dispatched afterwards to abduct Maduro from his residence.</p><p>What helped secure the success of the operation was that the Venezuelan military was in disarray and Maduro had been largely abandoned by his allies Russia and China.</p><p>Six months earlier, Iran made clear that it is not an easy regime change target. During the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, Tehran’s weaknesses were revealed but so was its resilience.</p><p>Despite Israel’s surprise attacks that eliminated some of the most important leaders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iranian nuclear scientists as well as the Israeli psyop efforts threatening various officials and high-ranking military officers with death unless they defected, the Islamic Republic did not budge.</p><p>The US strikes on Iran’s underground nuclear sites using bunker buster bombs did not shake the regime either. In response, the Iranian military was able to fire hundreds of missiles in retaliation, piercing Israel’s Iron Dome and striking military targets.</p><p>This resilience stems from the regime’s self-imposed isolation from external shocks. The vast business empire of the IRGC in construction, telecommunications and exports, valued in the billions of dollars, provides its top commanders with a tangible personal interest in regime survival, irrespective of its ideological underpinnings.</p><p>Iran has the largest military in the region with one million active and reserve soldiers. The IRGC alone commands at least 150,000 soldiers, many of whom have been battle-hardened in the Middle East already. Then there is the Basij militia, which itself has hundreds of thousands of regular and reserve members.</p><p>An invasion of Iran would not be as easy as Venezuela; it would not even be comparable to Iraq, given the mountainous Iranian landscape and vast urban areas.</p><p>Furthermore, the Chinese and Russians are unlikely to abandon Iran, a much more important partner than Venezuela. They are likely to provide it with highly advanced intelligence and weaponry as well as political support and cover.</p><h2 id=\"social-upheaval\">Social upheaval</h2><p>In recent days, Iran has been experiencing mass protests fuelled by economic woes. But this may not turn out to be the opportunity that the US and Israel may think it is.</p><p>The upheaval is yet to come near the level of the rallies in 2022. Killings have been excessive – 20 protesters have been killed in the past few days – but we are yet to see any visible cracks in the regime. The IRGC, for example, has not had defections that could destabilise the corps and eventually lead to the fall of the regime.</p><p>Furthermore, history shows that external aggression tends to unite rather than fragment societies. This was made clear in the summer when Iranians did not fall for Israeli incitement against their government.</p><p>Despite their repressive tactics, the authorities in Tehran have also acknowledged protesters’ concerns. On Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, said that the “bazaaris’ protest…is a valid one” and that the government is “seeking to remedy the problem”.</p><p>Undoubtedly Iran’s crises are real: The severe economic downturn and inflation, the disputes over Iran’s nuclear plans, and the supreme leader’s poor health and the question of succession could create fissures in the regime.</p><p>But these are slow-burning crises and not the kind of vulnerabilities on which the Venezuela operation was based. The Iranian government has managed to endure four decades of sanctions, conflicts and internal upheavals because of its solid institutional frameworks, which can weather painful moments.</p><p>The Venezuela intervention, then, is more illustrative of the limit of US power rather than a model for what can be done in another country, such as Iran. Trump can isolate and remove individual leaders whose states are already empty shells, as in Venezuela. He and his generals cannot, however, control and transform a complex country like Iran. Any such project would undoubtedly lead to chaos and bloodshed in the region far more intense and lasting than in Iraq.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

One police officer was ordered to pay a fine for stealing an electric shaver.

The 26-year-old philosophy student was filmed bleeding on the pavement in Tehran after being shot in the chest while protesting, with blood pouring out of her mouth and nose.</p><p>State television and authorities rejected eyewitness accounts that Agha-Soltan was shot by security forces, claimed the video was fabricated with “propaganda” at work to turn opinions, and tried to make her parents corroborate their version of events.</p><p>The protests eventually stopped in early 2010 after several thousand people were arrested, partial media blackouts imposed, and internet and mobile networks throttled. The movement’s figureheads were later put under house arrest, with Mousavi still confined to this day. The authorities have said they consider the Green Movement not as legitimate dissent, but as a “sedition”.</p><p>Iran’s internet crackdown significantly intensified amid the Green Movement, with many top international services such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube blocked in the aftermath along with thousands of websites.</p><p>In early 2011, several Iranian cities saw solidarity protests with Arab Spring demonstrators in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries.

In both cases, we see a naive confidence that the United States can simply achieve its goals through regime change. US intervention into Venezuela reeks of the same <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hubris-Inside-Story-Scandal-Selling/dp/0307346811\">hubris</a> that surrounded the Iraq invasion two decades ago.</p><p>Yet there are also important differences to consider. The most important distinguishing feature of the operation in Venezuela is its lack of an overarching vision. On Saturday after Trump finished an hour-long news conference alongside his secretaries of defence and state, it was not clear what the plan was for Venezuela going forward, or if there was a plan at all. His statements threatening more attacks in the following days brought no clarity either.</p><p>Past instances of US-led regime change fit into the larger ideological visions of the incumbent US commander-in-chief. In 1823, President James Monroe declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to European colonialism. As the United States spent the 20th century consolidating its sphere of influence across the Americas, the Monroe Doctrine would justify various interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Cold War added new justifications for the United States to overthrow leftist regimes and install friendly governments in the Americas.</p><p>As the Cold War ended, President George HW Bush sought to serve as a caretaker for a “new world order” in which the US had emerged as the world’s lone superpower. When Bush sent troops to Somalia in 1992 and his successor Bill Clinton reversed a military coup in Haiti in 1994, they did so under the paradigm of “humanitarian intervention”. When George W Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, it was done under the umbrella of the post-9/11 “war on terror”. When President Barack Obama intervened against the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, he was guided by the “<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/19/remarks-president-libya\">responsibility to protect</a>” doctrine concerning civilians in danger.</p><p>But in the case of the US attack on Venezuela, there has been no ideological justification. Trump and his team have haphazardly thrown around references to humanitarianism, counterterrorism and more to justify the attack. The president even brought up the Monroe Doctrine. But just as it seemed that he was grounding his foreign policy in a larger ideology, albeit one borrowed from two centuries ago, he made a joke of the concept.</p><p>“The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal,” Trump explained on Saturday. “But we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine.” Trump did not make up this pun; it was used by the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/january-8-2025/\">New York Post</a> a year ago to describe Trump’s aggressive foreign policy as he threatened to annex Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal.</p><p>The president’s decision to embrace the tongue-in-cheek term illustrates a disturbing reality of his foreign policy: Any notion that he is promoting an ideological vision is a joke.</p><p>The truth is Trump is pursuing an increasingly aggressive and militaristic foreign policy in his second term, not because he wants to impose a grand vision, but because he has discovered he can get away with it.</p><p>Striking a variety of foreign “bad guys” who have little capacity to fight back – ISIL (ISIS) affiliates in Nigeria who are “persecuting” Christians and “narcoterrorists” in Latin America – appeals to members of Trump’s base.</p><p>After he mentioned the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua during Saturday’s news conference, he went on a minutes-long tangent to brag about his military interventions into US cities. While the president’s inability to stay on topic may be concerning for those questioning his health and mental fitness, this digression into domestic affairs had some relevance for his Venezuelan intervention, at least as far as he was concerned: His increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime abroad justifies an increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime at home.</p><p>Past presidents have used US power to pursue a wide variety of ideologies and principles. Trump appears to be paying lip service to past ideologies to justify the use of US power. Many times, the “good” intentions of previous  presidents paved the way to hellish outcomes for the peoples who found themselves on the receiving end of US intervention. But those intentions at least created a level of predictability and consistency for the foreign policies of various US administrations.</p><p>Trump, by contrast, seems driven solely by immediate political concerns and short-term prospects for glory and profit. If there is a saving grace of such an unprincipled foreign policy, it may be the ephemeral nature of interventions conducted without an overarching vision. An unprincipled approach to military intervention does not foster the kind of ideological commitment that has led other presidents to engage in long-term interventions like the Iraq occupation.</p><p>But it also means that Trump could conceivably use military intervention to settle any international dispute or to pursue any ostensibly profitable goal – say assuming control of Greenland from Denmark.</p><p>Last year, he decided <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/how-are-countries-and-markets-reacting-to-trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were a potent tool for asserting his interests and started applying them almost indiscriminately on allies and adversaries alike. Now that Trump has grown comfortable using the US military to achieve a range of goals – profit, gunboat diplomacy, distraction from domestic scandals, etc – the danger is that he will grow similarly haphazard in his use of force.</p><p>That does not bode well for the US nor for the rest of the world. At a time when multiple global crises are overlapping – climate, conflict and impoverishment – the last thing the world needs is a trigger-happy superpower without a clear strategy or a day-after plan.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 50 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in the worst violence in Delhi since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.</p><p>In response, the police filed 758 criminal cases for investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. The Delhi Police, accused of bias against Muslims, blamed peaceful protest leaders, many of them young Muslim activists, of hatching a conspiracy to create religious tensions and to topple the elected government – a claim rubbished by legal and rights experts. At least 18 student leaders and activists were arrested in a case that came to be known as the “main conspiracy case”.</p><p>The students and activists were charged under an “anti-terror” law called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which makes it virtually impossible to secure bail. This law allows authorities to declare individuals “terrorists” and detain them without trial for months, sometimes years.</p><p>India’s police have been accused of increasingly using “anti-terror” laws against marginalised people, including Muslims.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4216158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4216158\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2020-01-19T164355Z_2015526395_RC24JE9NIWKT_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-CITIZENSHIP-PROTESTS-1767610405.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C487&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"delhi riots\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrators attend a protest against a new citizenship law in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, India, on January 19, 2020 [Danish Siddiqui/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-accused\">Who are the accused?</h2><p>Of the 18 students and activists arrested in the conspiracy case, six were released on bail over the years.</p><p>Today, the Supreme Court is deciding on the bail of seven of the defendants.

Residents report that settlers have fenced off the area and installed pumps that siphon water directly from the aquifer, leaving Palestinian pipes dry.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">“The settlers banned us,” Salama Kaabneh, the mukhtar (chief) of the Kaabneh clan, told Al Jazeera Arabic’s Givara Budeiri. “There is a motor pulling water from the same basin … 800 metres [2,625 feet] deeper than the spring’s opening.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"exclusive-a-systemic-imbalance\">A systemic imbalance</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"11\">In an interview with Al Jazeera, Jad Isaac, director of the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), revealed the staggering scale of inequality created by Israeli military control over water resources.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"12\">“The Israeli settler consumes approximately seven times the amount of water a Palestinian citizen gets,” Isaac said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">“The Palestinian individual’s share does not exceed 80 litres [21 gallons] per day,” he explained, noting that in some marginalised communities, that drops to below 15 litres [4 gallons] –  “far below the global minimum recommendation of 100 litres per day”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"14\">This inequality is visible from the sky. Drone footage obtained by the Reuters news agency reveals withered, brown Palestinian greenhouses sitting adjacent to lush, green settlement agriculture that thrives on the seized water.</p><h2 id=\"oslo-trap\">The ‘Oslo trap’</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"16\">With their natural springs seized or blocked, Palestinians have fallen into what Isaac describes as a “trap” set by the <a href=\"https://aje.io/4n1uba\">Oslo Accords</a>.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"17\">“Israel refused to negotiate on Palestinian water rights … replacing the issue by demanding Palestinians submit their needs to the Israeli side, which then sells it to them,” Isaac said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"18\">He noted that the Palestinian Authority is now forced to purchase more than 100 million cubic metres (26 billion gallons) of water annually at market price from Israeli companies—effectively buying back their own natural resources.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"19\">Isaac said that under military orders, Israel has taken “full control” of water sources, citing recent moves to establish a “crimson wall” in the northern Jordan Valley to further separate Palestinian communities from their agricultural lands.</p><h2 id=\"slow-displacement\">‘Slow displacement’</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"21\">Rights groups warn that this engineered thirst is a strategic method to force Palestinians to abandon their homes.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"22\">According to data provided by ARIJ to Al Jazeera, more than 56 water springs in the West Bank have been subjected to repeated settler attacks or takeovers.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"23\">“The seizure of springs … indicates a clear shift from merely controlling resources to using water as a direct pressure tool on the population,” Isaac warned.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">“Many families are pushed into internal or external migration due to the loss of livelihoods, which constitutes a slow displacement of rural Palestinian communities.”</p><h2 id=\"we-have-returned-to-the-wells\">‘We have returned to the wells’</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"26\">The seizure of water resources appears to have explicit backing from the Israeli government.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"27\">In a <a href=\"https://x.com/IhabHassane/status/2001026989486977101\">video</a> circulating widely online, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has praised settlers for taking physical control of the springs.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"28\">“I see the results of your wonderful work. We have returned to the water wells and regained control over all these areas,” Smotrich is heard saying in the viral clip. “It is a pleasure to tour here. You are heroes; keep up your work.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"29\">While the minister cheers, Palestinian infrastructure is being dismantled.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"30\">“Israel prevents Palestinians from building dams to collect rainwater and imposes restrictions on work in Area C,” Isaac noted, adding that the separation wall alone has isolated 31 Palestinian artesian wells.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He’s bypassing Venezuelan law, … and he doesn’t seem to give a damn about what the people of Venezuela really think or want,” Barakat said.</p><p>Trump-era policies and rhetoric have “mutated” US politics as nationalism has intensified and Christianity has become more entwined with governance – trends that will distort the existing international order, he added.</p><p>The US bombed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuela-decries-cowardly-kidnapping-as-officials-back-maduro\">Venezuela</a> on Saturday, abducting Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and taking them to New York to face <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/what-is-the-us-charging-nicolas-maduro-with\">drug-trafficking charges</a>.</p><p>Trump said the US will “run” Venezuela and tap its oil wealth, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">clear reason</a> behind the attack, couched in flimsy law enforcement rhetoric, according to Barakat.</p><h2 id=\"the-illegality-of-trump-s-action\">The illegality of Trump’s action</h2><p>International law is clear on what the US did, Barakat said: It’s illegal.</p><p>A state cannot seize or remove the leader of another sovereign state unless the United Nations Security Council authorises the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</p><p><span>The 2011 intervention in Libya when the country’s former leader </span><a href=\"/news/2011/8/22/profile-muammar-gaddafi\">Muammar Gaddafi</a><span> was deposed had Security Council authorisation.</span></p><p>“But even then, it should not [have been] at all about regime change. It [can only be] in defence of a prosecuted people … to prevent genocide, to prevent crimes against humanity,” Barakat said.</p><p>In Iraq, a US-led coalition invoked what turned out to be unfounded allegations of weapons of mass destruction as justification to <a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">invade the country</a> and topple President Saddam Hussein without initial UN authorisation.</p><p>Yet “when they captured [Hussein], they did not attempt to extract him from Iraq. They tried him inside Iraq,” he said.</p><p>Post‑9/11, Barakat said, international law has allowed cross‑border actions against “terrorist groups” when such actions are used to prevent “terrorist operations” in the acting state’s territory.</p><p>When Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/29/this-is-what-happened-after-recent-netanyahu-meetings-with-us-presidents\">Benjamin Netanyahu visited Trump</a> for New Year’s Eve, there were discussions between the pair attempting to link Maduro to Iran, Hezbollah and Palestinian groups in the hopes he could be labelled under the US Terrorism Act, which Barakat called tenuous attempts to “borrow” legitimacy from existing counterterrorism mechanisms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"jurisdictional-hook\">Jurisdictional hook?</h2><p>International law regards military action on the territory of another state without its consent as a violation of that state’s sovereignty, Barakat said.</p><p>In some conflicts, intervening states justified their actions by asserting consent from a sovereign state, such as in Syria, where operations against ISIL (ISIS) were presented as occurring with the Syrian government’s blessing, he said.</p><p>In Venezuela, the US is instead leaning on a US domestic court indictment from 2020, accusing Maduro of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">drug trafficking as a jurisdictional hook</a>.</p><p>But using a US indictment to justify abducting a foreign head of state from his country is problematic, Barakat said. N<span>ormally, a suspect is detained in the state asserting jurisdiction or extradited through Interpol and international agreements.</span></p><p>While Trump has shown “total disregard” for international law and backs Netanyahu, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC), the US president is now citing ICC processes against Maduro, Barakat added.</p><p>The legality of the US abduction of Maduro will be under the spotlight at the UN Security Council on Monday, but Washington is unlikely to face strong criticism from its allies, who oppose Maduro.</p><p>Russia, China and other Venezuela allies have accused the US of violating international law. European states have called for respect of international law without calling out Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"testing-the-limits-of-international-norms\">Testing the limits of international norms</h2><p>The Venezuela operation carries particular weight in the Middle East, where <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">Israel has conducted</a> abductions for decades, kidnapping individuals abroad (such as Nazi war criminals in Argentina) and trying them in Israel, Barakat said.</p><p>The analyst argued that Israel and the US learn from each other, with one’s impunity reinforcing the other’s confidence in justifying similar actions.</p><p>During Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Netanyahu invoked US and British actions in Iraq and Afghanistan as precedents for using force against people he dubbed “terrorists”, Barakat explained.</p><p>“Now in the US, I think they will probably use the Israeli precedent as a justification for what they’ve done [in Venezuela],” he said.</p><p>By this logic, other states could also try to detain Israeli leaders for violations of international law. However, while several ICC member states said they would arrest Netanyahu in their countries, they lack the “guts” to conduct a US-style cross‑border extraction, Barakat said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US operation in Venezuela could give Russia and China justification for similar extraterritorial seizures, the analyst said.</p><p>“If I were [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, I would be now thinking, how can I get Zelensky?” said Barakat, adding that China could attempt something similar regarding Taiwan.</p><p>The precedent set in Venezuela fundamentally weakens the current international order, Barakat emphasised.</p><p>If China, as an emerging global power, responds to global crises militarily rather than through economic influence as it has been or if more states pursue nuclear weapons, a genuinely new world order – possibly bipolar and more confrontational – could emerge, the professor said.</p><p>“I think that it seems the only way to independent politics is to have a nuclear weapon. Then things will change dramatically.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Maduro is to appear before US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.</p><p>A court spokesperson told NBC News that Flores, who is also listed as a defendant in a US indictment unsealed on Saturday, will appear in court on Monday as well.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-charges\">What are the charges?</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1422326/dl\">indictment</a>, the US accuses Maduro of being at the forefront of corruption to “use his illegally obtained authority” to “transport thousands of tons of cocaine” to the US with his coconspirators.</p><p>Additionally, the indictment alleges that Maduro has “tarnished” every public office he has held. It adds that Maduro “allows cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members”.</p><p>Maduro faces four counts:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy:</strong> US prosecutors say Maduro and his coconspirators knowingly provided something of financial value to US-designated “foreign terrorist organizations” and their members. The indictment lists these <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/why-has-mexico-handed-over-drug-cartel-leaders-to-us-who-are-they\">organisations</a> as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a leftist rebel group that signed a peace deal in 2016 but has dissidents who refused to lay down their arms and are still involved in the drug trade; Segunda Marquetalia, the largest dissident FARC group; National Liberation Army, another leftist Colombian rebel group; Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel; Los Zetas/Cartel del Noreste, another Mexican drug cartel; and Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy: </strong>It accuses Maduro and his codefendants of conspiring to manufacture, distribute and import cocaine into the US.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 3, possession of machineguns and destructive devices: </strong>The indictment accuses the defendants of possessing, carrying and using machineguns in relation to the above drug‑trafficking counts.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 4, conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices: </strong>It further accuses the defendants of conspiring to use, carry and possess those weapons in furtherance of drug trafficking.</li>\n</ul><p>The indictment also says Maduro and his codefendants should forfeit to the US government any proceeds and assets obtained from the alleged crimes.</p><h2 id=\"is-there-evidence-for-these-charges\">Is there evidence for these charges?</h2><p>There is <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">little evidence</a> that drugs are trafficked from Venezuela on a large scale. The 2023 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime World Drug Report said global cocaine production hit a record of 3,708 tonnes, up nearly one‑third from 2022, with most coca cultivation taking place in Colombia, followed by Peru and Bolivia.</p><p>Trafficking routes into the US in 2023-2024 primarily passed through Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, not Venezuela, although it does serve as a minor transit corridor for Colombian cocaine moving into the eastern Caribbean.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-named-in-the-indictment\">Who is named in the indictment?</h2><h3>Maduro</h3><p>Maduro, 63, who became Venezuela’s president in 2013, was declared the winner of 2024’s election. His re-election was rejected as fraudulent by the US and independent observers, such as the Carter Center. A UN expert panel said the 2024 vote failed to meet international standards.</p><p>Nine Latin American countries called for a review of the results with independent oversight.</p><p>Maduro defended the election results and accused his opponents of undermining the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>Since returning to the White House nearly a year ago, US President Donald Trump has expanded sanctions and punitive measures against Maduro and senior officials in his government.</p><p>The Trump administration ramped up military pressure starting in August when it deployed warships and thousands of its service members in the Caribbean near Venezuela. It has since carried out dozens of air strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats, killing more than 100 people.</p><p>Maduro has pushed back by mobilising Venezuelan military personnel.</p><p>During this time, the Caracas-based news network <a href=\"https://www.globovision.com/nacional/43343/maduro-denuncio-que-eeuu-se-dedica-a-fabricar-mentiras-extravagantes-estrafalarias-y-estramboticas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Globovision</a> quoted Maduro as saying: “From the north, the empire has gone mad and, like a rotten rehash, has renewed its threats to the peace and stability of Venezuela.”</p><p>But a day before Saturday’s US attack on the country, Maduro had offered to hold talks to combat drug trafficking.</p><h3>Flores</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/who-is-cilia-flores-venezuelas-first-combatant\">Flores</a>, 69, has been married to Maduro since 2013.</p><p>Known as the “first combatant” rather than first lady, Flores is a veteran lawyer and politician who rose to prominence by defending future President Hugo Chavez after his failed 1992 coup. She helped secure his release and later became a key Chavismo figure and the first woman to preside over Venezuela’s National Assembly. Chavismo, which promotes socialism and anti-imperialist politics, is the political movement started by Chavez, Maduro’s mentor.</p><p>The indictment accuses Flores of joining Maduro’s cocaine importation conspiracy.</p><h3>Other defendants</h3><p>The indictment names four other people as Maduro’s coconspirators, namely Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela’s interior minister; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, former Venezuelan interior minister; Nicolas Maduro Guerra, Maduro’s son and a Venezuelan politician; and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the leader of Tren de Aragua, which was designated as a “foreign terrorist organization” by the US in February. But most experts do not define Tren de Aragua as a “terrorist organisation”.</p><p>It is not clear yet who will represent Maduro, Flores and the other defendants.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-the-judge\">Who is the judge?</h2><p>Hellerstein was born in 1933 in New York. He was appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by former President Bill Clinton.</p><p>He is likely on Monday to advise Maduro and Flores about their rights and ask them if they want to enter a plea.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake\">What’s at stake?</h2><p>Maduro’s freedom is primarily at stake. If convicted, he could face 30 years to life in prison.</p><p>“This is less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits,” Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera. “This is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources.”</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a region in the eastern part of the country stretching across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>While the country is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels as of 2023 – it earns <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">only a fraction</a> of the revenue it once did from exporting crude due to mismanagement and US sanctions.</p><p>Last month, Trump accused Venezuela in a post on his Truth Social platform of “stealing” US oil, land and other assets and using that oil to fund crime, “terrorism” and human trafficking.</p><p>Trump repeated his false claims after Maduro’s arrest. During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>“Given the opposition of all South American states, save for Argentina, to US dominance in the region, Trump’s plan requires a vast military deployment. We need to see how countries like Brazil and Colombia react to this, including also BRICS,” said Bantekas from Hamad Bin Khalifa University.</p><p>In a joint statement released on Sunday, the governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay said the US actions in Venezuela “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”.</p><h2 id=\"was-maduro-s-abduction-legal\">Was Maduro’s abduction legal?</h2><p id=\"this-case-is-unusual-because-there-are-key-questions-about-how-maduro-was-captured-and-whether-that-was-legal-maduro-was-captured-during-a-us-military-operation-in-venezuelan-capital-caracas\">This case is unusual because there are questions about how Maduro was captured and whether it was legal. Russia, China and other Venezuelan allies have accused the US of violating international law.</p><p>“If there was an armed conflict between Venezuela and the USA and, given that Maduro is the head of his country’s armed forces, then he would be a legitimate target,” Bantekas said.</p><p>“However, under the circumstances, there is no armed conflict between the two countries, and in the absence of an armed attack by Venezuela against the US, the latter’s invasion in Venezuela violates article 2(4) of the UN Charter, as does the abduction of the country’s president. It is a blatant act of aggression.”</p><p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter bars UN members from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</p><p>A UN Security Council meeting on Monday will discuss the legality of the US abduction of Maduro.</p><p>“Given that Maduro is already in US custody and in the USA, it is in the interests of all parties that he appear before a court. At the very least, Maduro can challenge the legality of his arrest and the jurisdiction of the court,” Bantekas said.</p><p>“The court itself has an obligation to decide if it has jurisdiction and as a preliminary issue decide whether Maduro enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution. If these issues are dispensed, the court nonetheless finds that it has jurisdiction and that Maduro does not enjoy immunity, then the prosecution must prove its case.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>The Trump administration has not explicitly stated a clear plan for Venezuela, and analysts said it has sent out confusing signals.</p><p>In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that Washington will not govern Venezuela on a day-to-day basis. He also told ABC News the US would “set the conditions” to ensure that Venezuela is no longer a “narcotrafficking paradise”.</p><p>On the same day, Trump told reporters that the US is ready to carry out a second military strike on Venezuela if its government refuses to cooperate with his plan to “resolve” the situation there.</p><p>Interim President Delcy Rodriguez could “pay a very big price” if she “does not do what’s right”, Trump said.</p><p>A day earlier, Trump said Rodriguez had told Rubio that she would do what the US needs her to do. “She really doesn’t have a choice,” Trump said.</p><p>On Monday, Rodriguez offered to cooperate with Trump. In a statement posted on social media, she invited Trump to “collaborate” and sought “respectful relations”.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,” she wrote.</p><p>Her conciliatory tone came a day after she appeared on state TV declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.</p></div></div></body></html>"
