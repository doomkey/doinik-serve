We’re going to put you in jail where you belong. It’s all going to happen very fast.”</p><p>The announcement comes after Trump earlier this week threatened to deploy the National Guard as part of a crackdown on what he falsely says is rising crime in Washington, DC.</p><p>Trump’s Truth Social post on Sunday included pictures of tents and streets in Washington, DC with rubbish on them. “I’m going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.”</p><p>The White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from the city. The Republican president controls only federal land and buildings in Washington.</p><p>Washington, DC, is ranked 15th on a list of major US cities by homeless population, according to government statistics from last year.</p><p>According to the Community Partnership, an organisation working to reduce homelessness in Washington, DC, on any given night, there are 3,782 single people experiencing homelessness in the city of about 700,000 people. These figures are down from pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Most of the homeless people are in emergency shelters or transitional housing. About 800 are considered unsheltered or “on the street”, the organisation says.</p><p>A White House official said on Friday that more federal law enforcement officers were being deployed in the city following a violent attack on a young Trump administration staffer, which angered the president.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"crime-in-dc-at-a-30-year-low\">Crime in DC at ‘a 30-year low’</h2><p>Alleged crimes investigated by federal agents on Friday night included “multiple persons carrying a pistol without license”, motorists driving on suspended licences, and dirt bike riding, according to a White House official on Sunday. The official said 450 federal law enforcement officers were deployed across the city on Saturday.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The Democratic mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser, said on Sunday that the capital was “not experiencing a crime spike”.</p><p>“We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low,” Bowser said on US media MSNBC’s news segment The Weekend.</p><p>The city’s police department reports that violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 was down by 26 percent in Washington, DC, compared with last year, while overall crime was down about 7 percent.</p><p>The city’s crime rates in 2024 were already their lowest in three decades, according to figures produced by the Department of Justice before Trump took office.</p><p>While Bowser did not directly criticise Trump in her remarks, she said that “any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false”.</p><p>Trump’s threat to send in the National Guard comes weeks after he deployed California’s military reserve force into Los Angeles to quell protests over immigration raids, despite objections from local leaders and law enforcement.</p><p>The president has frequently mused about using the military to control US cities, many of which are under Democratic governance and hostile to his policies.</p><p>Bowser said that Trump is “very aware” of the city’s work with federal law enforcement after meeting with Trump several weeks ago in the Oval Office.</p><p>The US Congress has control of Washington, DC’s budget after the district was established in 1790 with land from neighbouring Virginia and Maryland, but resident voters elect a mayor and the City Council. Trump has long publicly chafed at this arrangement, threatening to federalise the city and give the White House the final say in how it is run.</p><p>For Trump to take over the city, Congress likely would have to pass a law revoking the legislation that established local elected leadership, which Trump would have to sign.</p><p>Trump is planning to hold a news conference on Monday to “stop violent crime in Washington, DC”. It is not clear whether he will announce more details about his eviction plan then.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They include Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa.</p><p>Shortly before being killed, al-Sharif, a well-known 28-year-old Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent who had reportedly extensively from northern Gaza, wrote on X that Israel had launched intense, concentrated bombardment – also known as “fire belts” – on the eastern and southern parts of Gaza City.</p><p>In his last video, the loud booms of Israel’s intensive missile bombing can be heard in the background as the dark sky is lit in a flash of orange light.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: Nonstop bombing… For the past two hours, the Israeli aggression on Gaza City has intensified.</em></p><p>In a final message, written on April 6, to be published in the event of his death, al-Sharif said he “lived the pain in all its details” and “tasted grief and loss repeatedly”.</p><p>“Despite that, I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent, those who accepted our killing, and those who suffocated our very breaths,” he said.</p><p>“Not even the mangled bodies of our children and women moved their hearts or stopped the massacre that our people have been subjected to for over a year and a half.”</p><p>The reporter also expressed sorrow for having had to leave his wife, Bayan, behind, and for not seeing his son, Salah, and daughter, Sham, grow up.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Hani Mahmoud, who was just one block away when the strike hit, said reporting on al-Sharif’s death was the hardest thing he has had to do in the past 22 months of war.</p><p>Mahmoud, who works for the network’s English channel, said the reporters were killed “because of their relentless reporting on the starvation and the famine and the malnutrition” suffered by Palestinians in Gaza, “because they’re bringing the truth of this crime to everyone”.</p><h2 id=\"no-proof-of-hamas-affiliation\">No proof of Hamas affiliation</h2><p>In a statement confirming the deliberate killing of al-Sharif, Israel’s military accused the journalist of heading a Hamas cell and “advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and [Israeli] troops”. It also alleged that it had documents providing “unequivocal proof” of his involvement with the Palestinian group.</p><p>Muhammed Shehada, an analyst at the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, said there was “zero evidence” that al-Sharif took part in any hostilities. “His entire daily routine was standing in front of a camera from morning to evening,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Last month, after Israeli army spokesperson Avichai Adraee <a href=\"https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1948273569202364747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reshared a video</a> on social media accusing al-Sharif of being a member of Hamas’s military wing, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, said she was “deeply alarmed by repeated threats and accusations of the Israeli army” against al-Sharif.</p><p>“Fears for al-Sharif’s safety are well-founded as there is growing evidence that journalists in Gaza have been targeted and killed by the Israeli army on the basis of unsubstantiated claims that they were Hamas terrorists,” Khan said.</p><p>The Al Jazeera Media Network had recently denounced the Israeli military for what it called a “<a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/al-jazeera-condemns-israeli-incitement-against-gaza-reporter-anas-al-sharif\">campaign of incitement</a>” against its reporters in the Gaza Strip, including, most notably, al-Sharif.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for the journalist’s safety as he was being “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign”.</p><p>Since Israel launched its war on the enclave in October 2023, it has routinely <a href=\"/news/2024/8/1/al-jazeera-refutes-baseless-israeli-allegations-against-ismail-al-ghoul\">accused Palestinian journalists</a> in Gaza of being Hamas members as part of what rights groups say is an effort to discredit their reporting of Israeli abuses.</p><p>The Israeli military has killed <a href=\"/news/2025/4/2/gaza-war-deadliest-ever-for-journalists-says-report\">more than 200 reporters</a> and media workers since its bombardment began, including several Al Jazeera journalists and their relatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The United Kingdom, a close ally of Israel which nonetheless pushed for an emergency meeting on the crisis, warned the Israeli plan risked prolonging the conflict.</p><p>“It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This is not a path to resolution. It is a path to more bloodshed,” the British Deputy Ambassador to the UN James Kariuki said.</p><p>Another staunch Israel ally, Germany, said it could not actively support Israel’s plan to expand military operations in Gaza and displace of Palestinians.</p><p>“Where are these people supposed to go?” Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked in an interview with public broadcaster ARD. “We can’t do that, we won’t do that, and I will not do that.”</p><p>France’s Deputy Permanent UN Representative Jay Dharmadhikari condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the plan, which he said would have “dramatic humanitarian consequences” for civilians already “living in horrifying conditions”.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The images of children dying of hunger or civilians being targeted as they tried to find food are unbearable,” Dharmadhikari said, urging Israel to comply with international humanitarian law.</p><p>The UK, Denmark, France, Greece and Slovenia issued a joint statement asking Israel “to urgently reverse this decision and not to implement” the plan, saying it violates international law.</p><p>In a separate statement, the foreign ministers of Spain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Portugal and Slovenia warned that Israel seizing Gaza City would be “a major obstacle to implementing the two-state solution, the only path towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-to-finish-the-job-in-gaza\">Israel to ‘finish the job’ in Gaza</h2><p>Despite the international backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained defiant over the plan to seize Gaza’s largest urban centre, which was approved by Israel’s security cabinet on Friday.</p><p>“The timeline that we set for the action is fairly quickly,” Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem on Sunday. “I don’t want to talk about exact timetables, but we’re talking in terms of a fairly short timetable because we want to bring the war to an end.”</p><p>He said Israel had “no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas”, given the group’s refusal to lay down its arms. Hamas said it would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state was established.</p><p>Netanyahu said the military had been given the green light to “dismantle” what he described as two remaining Hamas strongholds: Gaza City in the north and al-Mawasi further to the south.</p><p>“This is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily,” he said. “We will do so by first enabling the civilian population to safely leave the combat areas to designated safe zones.”</p><p>While the prime minister stressed that these “safe zones” would be given “ample food, water, and medical care”, guards at the controversial Israel- and United States-backed <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/what-is-the-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-and-why-has-it-been-criticised\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)</a>, purportedly established to deliver aid to the starving Palestinian population, have <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/inside-israels-role-in-the-killings-at-gazas-food-aid-sites\">routinely opened fire</a> on the aid seekers, killing dozens at a time.</p><p>Asked about the growing criticism targeting his cabinet’s decision, Netanyahu said the country was prepared to fight alone. “We will win the war, with or without the support of others,” he said.</p><p>Hamas released a statement responding to Netanyahu’s claim that Israel did not intend to occupy Gaza but “liberate” it from the Palestinian group.</p><p>The group said the use of the term “liberation” was an attempt to distort the reality of occupation “that will not cover up the crime of extermination, killing, and systematic destruction for more than 22 months”.</p><p>Hamas added that it constituted a “desperate attempt to exonerate” Israel after it killed more than 61,400 Palestinians, including more than 18,000 children.</p><p>Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Miller fired back at Hamas at the UNSC session, saying the group was “exploiting” the captives and Gaza’s population to “maintain its position, benefiting from attempts to pressure Israel and from the willingness of some countries to recognise a Palestinian state”.</p><p>The United States, a veto-wielding permanent member of the UNSC, has so far shielded its staunch ally from any practical measures of UN censure. Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister spoke with US President Donald Trump about its plan, without elaborating on the outcome of the conversation.</p><p>Speaking to Fox News, the US vice president said Washington neither endorsed nor rejected Israel’s decision to seize Gaza City and the entire Gaza Strip at large. “Obviously, there are a lot of downsides and upsides”, JD Vance said.</p><p>Netanyahu’s plan also received domestic criticism, with opposition leader Yair Lapid saying its implementation would mean that “the hostages will die, soldiers will die, the economy will collapse and our international standing will crash.”</p><p>Israel’s Channel 12 reported it will cost billions of dollars within several months, increasing the country’s deficit by 2 percent and leading to widespread budget cuts in areas such as healthcare, education, and welfare.</p><h2 id=\"unacceptable-catastrophe\">‘Unacceptable catastrophe’</h2><p>The director of the coordination division at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that the “unacceptable catastrophe” unfolding in Gaza must be brought to an end as he addressed the UN Security Council via videolink on Sunday.</p><p>Ramesh Rajasingham expressed concern over “the prolonged conflict, the reports of atrocities and further human toll that is likely to unfold following the government of Israel’s decision to expand military operations in Gaza”.</p><p>Israel has blocked all but a trickle of aid from entering Gaza for months and has prevented UN workers from accessing and distributing lifesaving assistance. “The UN has a plan and the systems in place to respond. We’ve said this before, and we will say it again and again: Let us work,” Rajasingham said.</p><p>The Government Media Office in Gaza said only 1,210 aid trucks have entered Gaza over the past 14 days. Officials said this represents just 14 percent of the territory’s minimum actual needs of 8,400 trucks.</p><p>Netanyahu acknowledged there have been issues of “deprivation” in Gaza, but denied that Israel has a “starvation policy”. Human Rights Watch, among other international organisations, has repeatedly called Israel’s use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/trump-envoy-to-visit-gaza-aid-sites-as-israel-accused-of-starvation-policy\">“war crime”</a>.</p><p>Ahmad Alhendawi, Save the Children International’s director for the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, told Al Jazeera that his team on the ground was seeing an “exponential increase” in the number of malnutrition cases, with effects that can “span generations”.</p><p>“This is not one event. This is not the absence of two or three meals. This is an accumulation of months [of deprivation],” he said. “We can help alleviate the suffering of children in Gaza, but we cannot do that if the government of Israel continues to impose all its limitations.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

against Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed at least 61,430 people and wounded 153, 213.</p><p>The Met made 10 further arrests on Saturday, including six for assaults on officers, though none were seriously injured, it added on Sunday.</p><p>The protests were the latest in a series of rallies denouncing the British government’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/uks-palestine-action-loses-bid-to-pause-ban-as-terrorist-group\">ban of Palestine Action</a> under the Terrorism Act 2000 on July 5, days after the group took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.4m) of damage to two aircraft.</p><p>The group said its activists were responding to the UK’s indirect military support for Israel amid the war in Gaza.</p><p>Huda Ammori, cofounder of Palestine Action, said ahead of Saturday’s protests that they would “go down in our country’s history as a momentous act of collective defiance of an unprecedented attack on our fundamental freedoms”.</p><p>The force said the average age of those arrested on Saturday was 54, with six teenagers, 97 aged in their 70s, and 15 octogenarians.</p><p>A roughly equal number of men and women were detained.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In a statement following the latest mass arrests, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the government’s decision, insisting: “UK national security and public safety must always be our top priority”.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The assessments are very clear – this is not a non-violent organisation,” she added.</p><p>But critics, including the United Nations and groups such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace, have condemned the government’s proscription as legal overreach and a threat to free speech.</p><p>“If this was happening in another country, the UK government would be voicing grave concerns about freedom of speech and human rights,” Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director Areeba Hamid said on Saturday.</p><p>She added the government had “now sunk low enough to turn the Met into thought police, direct action into terrorism”.</p><p>Police across the UK have made scores of similar arrests since July 5, when being a member of Palestine Action or supporting the group became a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>Police announced this week that the first three people had been charged in the English and Welsh criminal justice system with such backing following their arrests at a July 5 demonstration.</p><p>In its update on Sunday, the Met revealed a further 26 case files following other arrests on that day are due to be submitted to prosecutors “imminently” and that more would follow related to later protests.</p><p>It believes that 30 of those held on Saturday had been arrested at previous recent Palestine Action protests.</p><p>Eighteen people remained in custody by Sunday lunchtime, but were set to be released on bail within hours, the Met added.</p><p>It noted officers from its counterterrorism command will now “work to put together the case files required to secure charges against those arrested as part of this operation”.</p><h2 id=\"protesters-call-for-release-of-israeli-captives\">Protesters call for release of Israeli captives</h2><p>Meanwhile, demonstrators calling for the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza marched in central London on Sunday.</p><p>The protesters, who planned to march to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s residence in Downing Street for a rally, include Noga Guttman, a cousin of 24-year-old captive Evyatar David, who featured in a video that enraged Israelis when it was released by Hamas last week. The video showed an emaciated David saying he was digging his own grave inside a tunnel in Gaza.</p><p>In the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel, which triggered Israel’s war on Gaza, more than 200 people were taken captive. Some 50 of the captives still have not been released. Twenty are thought to be alive.</p><p>Israel last week announced its intention to seize Gaza City as part of a plan to end the war and bring the captives home. Family members and many international leaders have condemned the plan, saying it would lead to more bloodshed and endanger the captives.</p><p>“We are united in one clear and urgent demand: the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,” Stop the Hate, a coalition of groups organising the march, said in a statement.</p><p>“Regardless of our diverse political views, this is not a political issue – it is a human one.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In May, wildfires were burning throughout Russia’s Far East. Last month, wildfires broke out throughout Turkiye, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria. Fires continue in Portugal, France and Spain. In <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/canadian-wildfire-smoke-triggers-air-quality-alerts-in-us\">Canada</a>, the blazes have not stopped since April.</p><p>Satellite data show that fires burn on average about 4 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of the planet’s surface each year, including forests. And the number of wildfires is expected to increase by 50 percent by the end of the century.</p><p>There are two main reasons for the rise in wildfires.</p><p>First, the changing climate is driving protracted and frequent heatwaves and droughts that dry out forests, providing an immediate source of tinder and fuel. In a self-perpetuating cycle, wildfires themselves then billow carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing further to the climate crisis. Fires emitted an estimated 6,199 megatonnes of carbon dioxide globally in 2024.</p><p>Second, the way we live and use land today means we are increasingly encroaching on forests and elevating the risk of wildfires. Many of these fires are started by humans for different reasons – such as carelessness and clearing land for agriculture and settlements. And urban infrastructure is edging closer to nature, increasing the danger that fire poses to human lives.</p><p>There is no doubt that the costs of wildfires for people and the planet are immense. Wildfires destroy property, crops, businesses and livelihoods and can be especially devastating for developing countries.</p><p>But not all fires are bad.</p><p>Fires have been part of the Earth’s ecosystem for hundreds of millions of years, occurring naturally on every continent except Antarctica. They can help generate and stimulate the replenishment of ecosystems. They can clear away the layers of litter on the forest floor and add nutrients to the soil, allowing new shoots to grow that provide food for birds and animals. For some plant species, seeds even depend on fires to germinate.</p><p>Conducting controlled fires – often during cooler months – is a vital way for people to prevent destructive wildfires before they begin.</p><p>For many Indigenous peoples, prescribed burning has been an integral part of land management for millennia, helping to curb dangerous wildfires, encouraging ecological diversity and procuring food by promoting new growth and attracting grazing game animals.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A <a href=\"https://wwf.org.au/news/2024/worlds-largest-fire-study-proves-success-of-indigenous-fire-management/\">recent study</a> into the return of Indigenous fire burning in Australia’s Kimberley region showed that the annual massive wildfires in the region had reduced to once-in-a-decade events since the practice was reintroduced by the traditional owners of the land.</p><p>The use of fire for sustainable resource management is also one of the recommendations that the organisation I work for, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, is recommending as part of its <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/forestry/firemanagement/en\">integrated fire management</a> approach.</p><p>Other preventive measures against wildfires are also needed, and community engagement is a key strategy. The practical experience and knowledge held in communities must shape integrated fire management strategies and policies from the ground up. This is essential. Actively engaging communities in decision-making, leveraging local knowledge and practices, and building capacity for fire prevention, preparedness and control can reduce wildfire risks and build long-term resilience.</p><p>Another layer of defence is fire early-warning systems. By incorporating drought indices, local traditional knowledge of weather and climatic influences, such systems predict fire-danger conditions and help with planning well before the wildfire season.</p><p>Some fires are simply inevitable, however, and having better monitoring mechanisms to detect fires and an appropriate fire extinguishing capacity at the ready is necessary if we are to contain wildfires before they become dangerous. In this way, suppression action can happen before fires grow beyond the possibility of containment. Certain countries already do an excellent job of fire monitoring, but the practice is yet to become standard in others.</p><p>Maintaining biodiversity and diverse landscapes – rather than monotonous, fire-prone, human-created landscapes – can also reduce the risk of fire spreading and causing damage and loss.</p><p>People must learn to live harmoniously with nature, not simply bend it to their will. That means inappropriate development in fire-prone ecosystems must be discouraged, given that the building of new infrastructure adjacent to wild spaces may play a central role in causing wildfires.</p><p>These strategies may sound onerous, but they take up far fewer resources, not to mention fewer lives, than battling uncontrollable wildfires.</p><p>With the right measures, humans can coexist with fire.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
