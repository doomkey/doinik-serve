The other two were involved in the decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.</p><p>Then, in August, the US <a href=\"/news/2025/8/20/us-expands-sanctions-targeting-international-criminal-court\">expanded</a> the sanctions, taking actions against two more judges and two ICC prosecutors.</p><p>Even entities outside the ICC have been hit with economic penalties as a result of their participation in its investigations.</p><p>Last <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/09/sanctioning-foreign-ngos-directly-engaged-in-iccs-illegitimate-targeting-of-israel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">September</a>, Rubio announced that three non-governmental organisations — Al Haq, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights — would also face sanctions for helping the ICC “investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals”.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, the court decried the latest US actions as a “flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution”. It nevertheless pledged to carry out its mandate, despite US pressure.</p><p>“When judicial actors are threatened for applying the law, it is the international legal order itself that is placed at risk,” it said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The sanctions come in part as a protest against the ICC’s decision in November 2024 to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>The court also issued arrest warrants for several Hamas leaders, who were subsequently killed in Israeli operations.</p><p>The Trump administration has also pressured the court to officially end an investigation into US forces’ conduct during its two decade deployment in Afghanistan.</p><p>The US and Israel are not members of the ICC, and the Trump administration argues the court has exceeded its jurisdiction by investigating US and Israeli citizens.</p><p>“We will not tolerate ICC abuses of power that violate the sovereignty of the United States and Israel and wrongly subject US and Israeli persons to the ICC’s jurisdiction,” Rubio said on Thursday.</p><p>But the court has maintained it can investigate abuses committed by the two countries within the borders of its signatories, including the occupied Palestinian territories.</p><p>In a post on the social media platform X, Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director for the human rights nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), said Rubio is “coddling Israeli war criminals”.</p><p>She added that the court should “not wait to prosecute him for interfering with justice”.</p><p>Israeli officials have repeatedly cheered the Trump administration’s sanctions. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 171,152 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed 1,139 people.</p><p>The US also announced sanctions on Thursday against 29 vessels and management companies it said were linked to Iran.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The meetings are ostensibly to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah last year, despite the fact that Israel has violated the agreement on a regular basis.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Since October 8, 2023, Israel has killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon after its war with the Lebanese group began. A ceasefire was agreed on November 27, 2024, but since then, Israel has killed more than 300 people, including at least 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. The talks come as Israel continues to attack Lebanon on a <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">near-daily basis</a> and threatens to <a href=\"/features/2025/11/27/beirut-attacks-leaves-lebanon-worried-and-waiting-for-another-israeli-war\">expand</a> its war on the country.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-is-meeting\">Who is meeting?</h2><p>A special committee of representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon, and the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is based in Naqoura.</p><p>The committee is chaired by a US general and was originally composed of military officials. But due to Israeli pressure, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun appointed Simon Karam, a Lebanese diplomat, to participate earlier this month.</p><p>Israel reportedly wants the inclusion of civilians to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as plans for potential economic cooperation.</p><p>Israel also appointed a civilian representative from its National Security Council, Uri Resnick, and the meeting was also attended by US Special Representative for Lebanon Morgan Ortagus.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-goal\">What is the goal?</h2><p>The committee’s plan of action is to monitor the ceasefire agreed last year.</p><p>The terms of the ceasefire were left relatively undefined, but it was widely assumed that attacks from both sides would cease, the Lebanese army would disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and that Israel would withdraw its troops from its northern neighbour.</p><p>Officials say Lebanon has largely met its side of the bargain. Speaking at a conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri said the army’s task of disarming Hezbollah below the Litani River, which runs across southern Lebanon, was nearly completed, apart from the places where Israel still occupies Lebanese land.</p><p>However, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">violated</a> the ceasefire repeatedly and continues to occupy five locations in southern Lebanon.</p><p>“The main task of the mechanism is to oversee and verify and do everything possible to respect the agreement,” Mitri said.</p><p>Lebanon has been “strictly observing” the ceasefire agreement since day one, but that is not the case for Israel, he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-outcome-of-the-last-meeting\">What was the outcome of the last meeting?</h2><p>The members of the so-called mechanism met in Naqoura, south Lebanon, on December 3. The meeting was reportedly positive.</p><p>The inclusion of civilians “reflects the Mechanism’s commitment to facilitating political and military discussions with the aim of achieving security, stability, and a durable peace for all communities affected by the conflict”, the US embassy said in a statement about the meeting</p><p>The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement that emphasised potential future economic agreement between his country and Lebanon. However, analysts believe that is a far-fetched proposition considering Israel is still occupying territory in southern Lebanon, and more than 88,000 Lebanese are still displaced from their homes in the region.</p><p>Despite the alleged positivity of the meeting, Israel <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/another-devastating-israeli-strike-on-lebanon-captured-on-video\">attacked</a> Lebanon the very next day.</p><h2 id=\"is-normalisation-on-the-agenda\">Is normalisation on the agenda?</h2><p>From the Lebanese side, no. Normalising relations with Israel after a war that killed thousands, including many civilians, would anger a large segment of the population.</p><p>But there has been US and Israeli pressure to find a peace agreement and to move towards normalisation.</p><p>The mechanism meeting is also a place for other bilateral discussions between Israel and Lebanon, which do not have direct relations.</p><p>On the Lebanese side, border delineation is a priority. On the Israeli side, a <a href=\"/features/2025/9/1/will-us-backed-economic-zone-incentivise-lebanon-to-disarm-hezbollah\">US-backed economic zone</a> is high on the agenda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-if-israel-is-unhappy-with-the-talks-will-it-launch-a-war\">So if Israel is unhappy with the talks, will it launch a war?</h2><p>That is still unclear.</p><p>Israel has claimed Hezbollah is rearming, though analysts say the group is not an <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">existential threat</a> to Israel. The group, long the political and military hegemon in Lebanon, was badly weakened during last year’s war with Israel. Much of its senior military leadership was assassinated, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>With Hezbollah weakened, some analysts believe Israel’s decision will be based on internal Israeli politics and dependent on international pressure on Israel.</p><p>Officials from the US, Saudi Arabia, and France met the head of the Lebanese army in Paris on Thursday in an effort to coordinate positions and possibly avoid an Israeli intensification in Lebanon. They also agreed to document the Lebanese military’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-hezbollah-in-all-of-this\">Where is Hezbollah in all of this?</h2><p>Publicly, it has refused the Lebanese government’s plans for full disarmament.</p><p>The group says Israel’s behaviour – continuing to attack and occupy Lebanese territory – justifies its position.</p><p>But how it will respond should the ceasefire move forward is yet to be seen. In the proposed second phase, the Lebanese army would start to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure between the Litani and Awali Rivers – the area between Sidon in the south, and Beirut, roughly in the middle of Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has been militarily and politically weakened since last year’s war. But while analysts and diplomats have told Al Jazeera that they do not believe the group is strong enough to pose a threat to Israel, it could still cause problems domestically if it feels that it is being cornered.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This included the personal details of people from Somalia, Portugal, Sweden, the United States and Switzerland.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent questions to the Somali government and alerted them about the system flaw, but did not receive a response.</p><p>“The government’s push to deploy the e-visa system despite being clearly unprepared for potential risks, then redeploying it after a serious data breach, is a clear example of how disregard for people’s concerns and rights when introducing digital infrastructures can erode public trust and create avoidable vulnerabilities,” Andere said.</p><p>“It’s also alarming that the Somalian authorities have not issued any formal notice about this [November] serious data breach.”</p><p>“In such situations, Somalia’s data protection law mandates data controllers to notify the data protection authority, and in high-risk contexts such as in this incident, to also notify the individuals affected,” Andere added.</p><p>“Extra protections should apply in this case because it involves people of different nationalities and therefore multiple legal jurisdictions.”</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot reveal technical details about the breach because the vulnerability has not yet been fixed, so publishing it could provide hackers with enough information to replicate the leak.</p><p>Any sensitive information Al Jazeera obtained as part of this investigation has been destroyed to ensure the privacy of those affected.</p><h2 id=\"previous-breach\">Previous breach</h2><p>Last month, the US and United Kingdom governments sent out a warning about a data breach that leaked the information of more than 35,000 people who had applied for an e-visa to Somalia.</p><p>“Leaked data from the breach included visa applicants’ names, photos, dates and places of birth, email addresses, marital status, and home addresses,” the US Embassy in Somalia said at the time.</p><p>In response to that data breach, Somalia’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency (ICA) changed its e-visa website to a new domain in an attempt to increase security.</p><p>The immigration agency said on November 16 that it was treating the issue with “special importance” and announced it had launched an investigation into the issue.</p><p>Earlier that week, Somalia’s Defence Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi had praised the e-visa system, claiming it had successfully prevented ISIL (ISIS) fighters from entering the country, as a months-long battle continued in the northern regions against a local affiliate of the group.</p><p>Access Now’s Andere highlighted that governments often rush to implement e-visa systems, which frequently leads to insecure situations.</p><p>She added that it is hard for people to protect themselves against these types of data breaches.</p><p>“Data protection and cybersecurity considerations are often the first to be disregarded,” she said. “It is difficult to shift the burden to people because the data they gave is required for a particular process.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Senators approved the bill 77–20 on Wednesday, as lawmakers prepared to leave Washington for a holiday recess. It will now go to Trump for signature.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But the more than 3,000-page-long bill also imposed some constraints on the Trump administration’s deployment of the military. In addition to demanding more information about maritime strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, the bill locks in current US troop numbers in Europe and sets out new allocations for specific forms of military assistance to Ukraine, as demanded by Democrats who want greater oversight of military affairs and assurance of support for Ukraine.</p><p>The bill reflects a negotiated middle ground, therefore, shaped by rare areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats on defence priorities. It enacts many of Trump’s executive actions, including proposals to <a href=\"/news/2025/1/23/what-do-trumps-executive-orders-on-workplace-diversity-programmes-say/%5d\">dismantle diversity and inclusion initiatives</a> within the armed forces, but also strengthens congressional scrutiny of the Department of Defense.</p><h2 id=\"were-there-to-the-bill\">What objections were there to the bill?</h2><p>Despite its passage, the expansive bill drew criticism from representatives of both parties. Two Republicans – Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee – and 18 Democrats voted against it.</p><p>They raised specific concerns over a provision that allows military aircraft to fly without transmitting precise location data – a practice that was used by an Army helicopter during a January <a href=\"/news/2025/1/30/plane-collides-with-helicopter-mid-air-in-washington-dc\">midair collision</a> with a commercial plane over Washington, DC, which killed 67 people.</p><p>“The special carve-out was exactly what caused the January 29 crash that claimed 67 lives,” Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said during a news conference this week.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cruz said he plans to push for a bipartisan vote next month on legislation that would require military aircraft to use exact location-sharing technology and enhance coordination with commercial aviation in congested airspace.</p><p>Elsewhere, the NDAA does not include funding to pay for a name change from the Department of Defense to the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/trump-symbolically-changes-department-of-defense-to-department-of-war\">Department of War</a>, something Trump has said he wants but cannot formally do without congressional approval.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-the-democrats-demand\">What did the Democrats demand?</h2><p>Many of the Democrats’ concerns relate to Ukraine.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers have been repeatedly blindsided by the Trump administration over the past year, including on decisions to <a href=\"/news/2025/3/5/us-suspends-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine\">suspend intelligence sharing with Ukraine</a> and to scale back US troop deployments in eastern NATO countries.</p><p>However, Democrats managed to ensure that the bill included a requirement for advance notice to Congress of such actions, as well as of the removal of senior military leaders – an area in which Democrats have also sought greater oversight.</p><p>Under the new legislation, the Pentagon must keep at least 76,000 troops and major military assets stationed in Europe, despite the release of Trump’s latest <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">national security strategy</a>, which is viewed by many as overly friendly to Russia and too critical of Europe.</p><p>Typically, between 80,000 and 100,000 US troops are deployed across Europe.</p><p>Congress also approved $400m annually over the next two years to produce weapons for Ukraine. Most of these funds have been earmarked for US weapons manufacturers.</p><h2 id=\"what-demands-did-democrats-make-regarding-venezuela-operations\">What demands did Democrats make regarding Venezuela operations?</h2><p>Since early September, the US has engaged in a series of aerial strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug trafficking operations in the Caribbean Sea. About 90 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes.</p><p>But lawmakers have grown increasingly sceptical about the boat strikes and their legality – many have expressed concern that the operation’s end game is, in fact, to oust Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2013/4/3/profile-nicolas-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>Many legal experts say targeting vessels in international waters <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">likely violates</a> US and international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.</p><p>On Tuesday, Hegseth visited Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers about the US military operation in international waters near Venezuela. Reactions to the briefing were mixed, with most Republicans supporting the campaign and Democrats voicing unease, arguing they lacked sufficient information.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><span>Representatives from both parties, therefore, agreed to freeze 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel funds until he submits unedited footage </span>of attacks off the coast of Venezuela – along with strike authorisation orders – to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.</p><p>Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the Navy officer who ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">“double-tap” strike</a> – a second hit on a boat which had already been destroyed and which killed two survivors in the water in September – testified in a classified session before the committees on Wednesday, which did include video footage of the incident.</p><p>Democrats, however, are demanding that portions of the footage be released publicly and that all members of Congress be granted access to the full video.</p><p>“The American people absolutely need to see this video,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.</p><p>“I think they would be shocked.”</p><h2 id=\"does-this-bill-assuage-democrat-fears-about-a-potential-war\">Does this bill assuage Democrat fears about a potential war?</h2><p>Not really. While the NDAA has strengthened legislative oversight over recent military operations in Venezuela, many lawmakers continue to worry about <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-orders-total-blockade-of-sanctioned-venezuelan-oil-tankers\">growing tensions</a> between Washington and Caracas.</p><p>“The Constitution vests this body with authority over matters of war and peace. That power has too often been ceded to the executive branch,” Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks said on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</p><p>“Congress must make clear to all of us that no president can unilaterally draw the United States into a conflict,” he added.</p><p>“It’s easy to get into a war. It’s hard as hell to get out of war,” Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern warned. “I’ve been around long enough to hear representatives of both parties talk about war as something simple, ‘You can get into it. We get out of it easy. No big deal.’ That’s never happened.</p><p>“Even the Pentagon says it will be very, very complicated to topple Maduro,” he said.</p><p>Furthermore, the bill was passed on the same night that a Democrat-led resolution requiring explicit congressional approval for US military action in Venezuela was voted down. Introduced by lawmakers including McGovern and Meeks, the measure reflected concern that Trump’s strikes risk sliding into an undeclared war.</p><p>While the Constitution does give Congress sole authority to declare war, presidents have been known to act under broader authorities. The Democrat bill aimed to close that gap. Its defeat leaves the administration wide latitude to continue operations without new congressional consent, Democrats fear.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Last month, their alliance won the Bihar legislative <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/bihar-2025-election-result-who-won-who-lost-why-it-matters\">assembly election</a>, in which the BJP emerged as the single largest party for the first time.</p><p>The video was first posted on X by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), a political party opposed to the Modi-Kumar coalition.</p><p>“What has happened to Nitish ji [“ji” is an honorific in Hindi]? Has his mental condition completely deteriorated, or has Nitish ‘Babu’ [another Hindi honorific] now become 100 percent Sanghi?” the RJD asked in its post.</p><p>Sanghi refers to a person affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a 100-year-old secretive far-right organisation that aims to turn a constitutionally secular India into an ethnic Hindu state. Modi and most other BJP leaders are lifetime members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of what is referred to as the Sangh Parivar (or Sangh Family), with hundreds of Hindu organisations working under its umbrella.</p><p>The BJP and its allies have long <a href=\"/news/2022/2/15/what-lies-beneath-the-indias-hijab-ban-row\">campaigned against</a> the use of hijab by Muslim women. In 2022, the then-BJP government in the southern state of Karnataka banned hijab in classrooms, triggering a huge protest by the Muslim community. Later that year, a two-judge Supreme Court bench delivered a <a href=\"/news/2022/10/13/indias-supreme-court-panel-split-on-allowing-hijab-in-classrooms\">split verdict</a> in the case, which meant the debate and politics over hijab continued in the country of 200 million Muslims. Several Hindu groups have demanded a <a href=\"/news/2022/3/16/india-hindu-groups-muslims-wider-ban-hijab-karnataka-court-verdict\">nationwide ban</a> on hijab.</p><p>Nearly 18 percent of Bihar’s 127 million residents are Muslim.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Opposition parties and Muslim groups have condemned Kumar’s action and demanded his resignation.</p><p>“This is Bihar’s Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. A female doctor had come to collect her appointment letter, and Nitish Kumar pulled off her hijab. A man occupying the highest position in Bihar is openly indulging in such a vile act. Think about it – how safe will women be in the state? Nitish Kumar should immediately resign for this disgusting behaviour,” the main opposition Congress party posted on X.</p><p>On Wednesday, members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), a political party representing Muslims and other minorities, held a protest in Mumbai and demanded that criminal charges be filed against Kumar.</p><p>“A Muslim woman has been dishonoured,” shouted a protesting woman as she was dragged away by a group of police officers, according to a report by the Press Trust of India news agency. “Nitish Kumar should resign,” said another member there, wearing a hijab.</p><p></p><p>Zaira Wasim, a former actor from Indian-administered Kashmir, demanded an “unconditional apology” from Kumar. “A woman’s dignity and modesty are not props to toy with,” she posted on X. “Power does not grant permission to violate boundaries.”</p><p>Even the foreign minister of neighbouring Pakistan spoke out, calling the incident “shameful” and “extremely disturbing”.</p><p>“Such acts underscore the imperative to safeguard minority rights and to address the troubling rise of Islamophobia. Respect for women and religious beliefs must remain fundamental and non-negotiable principles in every society,” Ishaq Dar posted on X on Wednesday.</p><p>Kumar has not yet responded to the criticism. On Thursday, his party, the Janata Dal-United (JD-U), posted on X that the chief minister has always “supported the minorities” during his multiple tenures.</p><p>“The minorities are safe and secure in the Nitish government,” the party wrote, without referring to Monday’s incident.</p><p>In a statement emailed to Al Jazeera, Aakar Patel, India head of rights group Amnesty International, said Kumar’s act was “an assault on this woman’s dignity, autonomy, and identity”.</p><p>“When a public official forcibly pulls down a woman’s hijab, it sends a message to the general public that this behaviour is acceptable. No one has the right to police a woman’s faith or clothing,” he said.</p><p>“Such actions deepen fear, normalise discrimination, and erode the very foundations of equality and freedom of religion. This violation demands unequivocal condemnation and accountability. Urgent steps must be taken to ensure that no woman is subjected to such degrading treatment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Companies such as Standard Oil led development under concession agreements, propelling Venezuela to a position as a key global supplier, especially for the US.</p><p>Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC, joining at its creation on September 14, 1960. OPEC is a group of major oil-exporting countries that work together to manage supply and influence global oil prices.</p><p>That began to wind up when Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 under then-President Carlos Andres Perez amid the oil boom. He established the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to control all oil resources.</p><p>Venezuela continued to be a major oil exporter to the US for some years, supplying 1.5 – 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But after Hugo Chavez took office in 1998, he nationalised all oil assets, seized foreign-owned assets, restructured PDVSA and prioritised political goals over exports, leading to declining production alongside mismanagement and underinvestment.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-the-us-impose-sanctions-on-venezuela\">When did the US impose sanctions on Venezuela?</h2><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in retaliation for nationalising oil assets in 2005.</p><p>Under US sanctions, named individuals and companies are barred from accessing any property or financial assets held in the US. They cannot access US bank accounts, sell their property, or access their money if it passes through the US financial system.</p><p>Any US companies or citizens doing business with any sanctioned individual or company will be penalised and risk becoming subject to enforcement actions.</p><p>The sanctions extend beyond the individuals on the list. Any entity that is owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more of the blocked people is also sanctioned as well, even if that company isn’t explicitly named.</p><p>Under President Nicolas Maduro, the US imposed more sanctions in 2017 and tightened them again in 2019. This further restricted sales to the US and access for Venezuelan companies to global finance. As a result, oil exports to the US nearly stopped, and Venezuela shifted its trade mainly to China, with some sales to India and Cuba.</p><p>Last week, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-family-venezuelan-tankers-what-we-know\">imposed yet more sanctions</a> – this time on Maduro family members and on Venezuelan tankers carrying sanctioned oil.</p><p>Today, PDVSA controls the petroleum industry in Venezuela, and US involvement in Venezuelan oil drilling is limited. Houston-based Chevron is the only US company that still operates in Venezuela.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire for the US to regain control of Venezuela’s oil.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4182041\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4182041\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4182041\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2251601503-1766053562.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Lake Maracaibo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4182041\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A commercial container ship sails on Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, where oil was discovered in 1922 [Jose Bula Urrutia/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-any-legal-basis-to-us-claims-on-venezuelan-oil\">Is there any legal basis to US claims on Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>No. International law is clear that sovereign states own the natural resources within their territories under the principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources (PSNR).</p><p>This means that sovereign states have the inherent right to control, use and dispose of their resources for their own development.</p><p>The concept of PSNR emerged after 1945 during the decolonisation of former European colonies. It was solidified by the United Nations General Assembly in a resolution adopted in December 1962.</p><p>Under this law, therefore, Venezuela owns its oil. It would be illegal under international law for the US to lay claim to it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-does-chevron-continue-to-operate-there\">Why does Chevron continue to operate there?</h2><p>Foreign oil companies are not permitted to own oil fields outright in Venezuela, so US oil group Chevron pays PDVSA a percentage of its output under a joint operation, which accounts for about one-fifth of Venezuela’s official oil production.</p><p>This setup allows PDVSA to earn revenues from oil without directly selling to US buyers, which sanctions restrict, giving Venezuela an incentive to continue allowing Chevron to operate.</p><p>To get around US restrictions, Chevron was granted a special licence by US President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate outside US sanctions. The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year.</p><p>Chevron increased shipments of Venezuelan oil from 128,000bpd in October this year to 150,000bpd last month.</p><p>Chevron has been operating in Venezuela for decades and has billions of dollars in assets there in the form of oil fields, facilities and infrastructure. If it were to withdraw from Venezuela, it would run a high risk of losing those assets forever, as Venezuela could seize them.</p><p>In the past, the Chavez and Maduro administrations have seized private assets when hundreds of companies were nationalised, including parts of foreign companies such as Exxon, Cargill and Hilton.</p></div></div></body></html>"
