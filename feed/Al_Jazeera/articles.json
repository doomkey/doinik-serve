It added that the attacks sparked fires at the sites.</li>\n<li>A source in Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence also confirmed to the Reuters news agency that it had hit the Druzhba oil pipeline, also in Russia’s central Tambov region, which supplies Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peace-talks\">Peace talks</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>United States President Donald Trump has said the path ahead for peace in Ukraine is unclear after what he called <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ukraines-nato-membership-key-question-in-us-talks-says-russia\">“reasonably good” talks</a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner spent hours at the Kremlin but departed with no breakthrough on ending the war.</li>\n<li>Trump said Witkoff and Kushner briefed him about the talks and told him their impression of Putin was “he would like to make a deal”. But Trump added that he “can’t tell” what will come out of the meeting “because it does take two to tango”. He added that Washington already has “something pretty well worked out [with Ukraine]”.</li>\n<li>Asked if it would be correct to say that Putin had rejected Washington’s proposals, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disagreed. “A direct exchange of views took place yesterday for the first time,” Peskov said. “Some things were accepted, some things were marked as unacceptable. This is a normal working process of finding a compromise.”</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed his team is preparing for meetings in the US and that dialogue with Trump’s envoys will continue. “Only by taking Ukraine’s interests into account is a dignified peace possible,” he said.</li>\n<li>An unnamed White House official confirmed to Reuters that Witkoff and Kushner would meet with Ukrainian officials in Miami on Thursday.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"united-nations\">United Nations</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ninety-one countries at the United Nations General Assembly, including the US, have backed a resolution demanding Russia “ensure the immediate, safe and unconditional return of all Ukrainian children who have been <a href=\"/news/2025/6/10/russia-ukraine-children-war\">forcibly transferred or deported</a>” from Ukraine since Moscow launched its war in 2022.</li>\n<li>Russia and 11 other countries voted against the resolution – which was drafted by Ukraine, Canada and the European Union – while 57 countries abstained.</li>\n<li>Ahead of the vote, Russia had urged countries to oppose the resolution. “Each vote for the resolution is support for lies, war and confrontation. Every vote against is a vote for peace,” Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Maria Zabolotskaya, said.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"ukrainian-affairs\">Ukrainian affairs</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s parliament has approved the 2026 budget allocating nearly a third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) to defence. The vote, which comes as Ukraine is dogged by a political crisis following a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/what-will-the-sacking-of-zelenskyys-no-2-change-for-ukraine\">recent corruption scandal</a>, was seen as a litmus test for parliament to pass key decisions during a critical stage of the war.</li>\n<li>“This is an important signal of Ukraine’s resilience and securing a stable financial provision for the next year’s needs,” President Zelenskyy said. “The priorities are clear: ensuring our defence, social programmes and the ability to rebuild our lives after Russia’s attacks.”</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"sanctions-and-military-aid\">Sanctions and military aid</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, has proposed an unprecedented use of frozen Russian assets or international borrowing to raise 90 billion euros ($105bn) for Ukraine. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the body is “proposing to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next two years. That’s 90 billion euros”. She added that the “remainder would be for international partners to cover”.</li>\n<li>But Belgium, whose Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear is the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now\">main holder of the Russian assets,</a> has voiced a range of legal concerns. While Von der Leyen said the proposal had taken into account Belgium’s concerns, Brussels does not “share that assessment”, a senior official told Reuters, adding that it “cannot accept being asked to bear the risks of such an operation alone”.</li>\n<li>The EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy. Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move towards a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.</li>\n<li>Hungary and Slovakia are both weighing up legal options to challenge the order, as both EU members are still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.</li>\n<li>More than two-thirds of NATO member states have so far committed $4bn worth of weapons for Ukraine through the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/germany-pledges-2bn-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-as-kyiv-seeks-more-funds\">Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL)</a> – an initiative to supply Kyiv with weapons bought from the US – according to the alliance’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte.</li>\n<li>Outside NATO, Australia and New Zealand have also agreed to contribute to the PURL initiative, Rutte said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"european-defence\">European defence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Germany has become the first European nation to deploy the Arrow air defence system, built to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles such as Russia’s Oreshnik.</li>\n<li>The system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the US Missile Defense Agency, is used as the upper layer of Israel’s missile defences. “Who could have imagined that only 80 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the Jewish state, through the technologies it develops, would help defend not only Germany but all of Europe,” said Ron Prosor, Israel’s ambassador to Germany.</li>\n<li>The Romanian military has blown up a maritime drone it said was endangering navigation in the Black Sea, identifying it as a Ukrainian-developed Sea Baby. Ukraine’s SBU security service, however, said that all of its Sea Baby maritime drones engaged in operational tasks in the Black Sea region were accounted for, with none entering Romanian waters.</li>\n<li>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has described attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea in recent days as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russian-tanker-struck-off-turkiye-as-ukraine-targets-shadow-fleet\">“very scary”</a>. Ukraine has claimed some of these attacks. Fidan said that the attacks threaten regional safety and show that the reach of the war is expanding. The strikes within Turkiye’s exclusive economic zone violate navigational safety and are impacting commerce, he added, saying that Turkiye, Romania and Bulgaria were looking at measures to boost security.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

for the next chair of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>While Trump has yet to confirm his nominee, one name stands out as the overwhelming favourite: Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Prediction market Kalshi on Wednesday put the odds of Hassett being nominated at 86 percent, compared with 6 percent for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and 4 percent for sitting Fed governor Michelle Bowman.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-matter-who-leads-the-federal-reserve\">Why does it matter who leads the Federal Reserve?</h2><p>As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, the Fed is arguably the most important financial institution on the planet.</p><p>The Fed performs several key roles in the US economy, including setting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and promoting the stability of the financial system by serving as a lender of last resort.</p><p>The most closely watched of these functions is monetary policy, which the Fed primarily manages by setting interest rates.</p><p>The Fed’s policymaking committee meets eight times each year to set the federal funds rate, the target interest rate at which commercial banks lend to each other on a short-term basis.</p><p>The committee is holding its final meeting of 2025 on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, when it is widely expected to agree on a 0.25 percent cut to the benchmark rate, currently set in the range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.</p><p>The benchmark rate has far-reaching implications for the entire economy, since banks’ borrowing costs influence the interest rates they charge customers for mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit.</p><p>Typically, the Fed, which has the dual mandate of encouraging employment and keeping prices stable, lowers interest rates when the economy is struggling and raises them when prices are rising too fast.</p><p>Cheaper borrowing encourages businesses to invest and consumers to spend more, stimulating economic growth.</p><p>On the other hand, higher borrowing costs act as a brake on economic activity, helping to bring down inflation.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-hassett-and-what-is-his-background\">Who is Hassett and what is his background?</h2><p>Though Hassett is among several names that have been mooted for the top job at the Fed, he stands alone for the amount of time he has spent in Trump’s proximity.</p><p>A career economist, Hassett was appointed as Trump’s top coordinator on economic policy after serving in his first administration as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, an older, more research-oriented body than the National Economic Council.</p><p>After leaving the first Trump administration in 2019, Hassett briefly returned to the White House to serve as an adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Crucially, Hasset has signalled his support for cutting interest rates faster – something Trump has been angrily demanding from the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for months to little avail.</p><p>Trump has insisted that concerns that his tariffs could spell a return to high inflation are overblown and suggested that the benchmark rate should be set as low as 1 percent.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last month, Hassett said he would be “cutting rates right now” if he were in Powell’s shoes.</p><p>Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Hassett would likely push for faster rate cuts in the role, albeit probably not at the pace Trump would prefer.</p><p>“I think it is likely that Hassett would try to lower the Fed’s policy interest rates, but probably not all the way to the 1 percent level that President Trump has demanded,” Gagnon told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He would probably argue that the administration’s deregulation agenda and the AI boom give the economy more room to grow without causing inflation.”</p><p>Before and in between his stints at the Trump White House, Hasset was an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, where he published extensively on tax and trade policy.</p><p>Hassett also served as an economic adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain, George W Bush and Mitt Romney.</p><p>Prior to getting involved in the world of politics, the economist did stints at Columbia Business School and the Fed’s research and statistics division.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-hassett-s-potential-nomination-attracting-controversy\">Why is Hassett’s potential nomination attracting controversy?</h2><p>Hassett’s reputation as a Trump loyalist has raised concerns in some quarters about the independence of the Fed.</p><p>The ability of the central bank to make its decisions free from political influence or considerations is widely seen as being crucial to confidence in the US economy.</p><p>But that longstanding expectation is already under scrutiny due to Trump’s repeated verbal attacks on Powell, whose term expires in May, and his <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/26/trump-orders-removal-o-fed-governor-cook-over-mortgage-fraud-claims\">push to remove Lisa Cook</a>, one of the Fed’s six other governors, over unproven claims of mortgage fraud.</p><p>“I think that concerns regarding the Fed’s independence are very real and valid,” Anastassia Fedyk, an assistant professor of finance at the Haas School of Business of the University of California Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s not just about Kevin Hassett being closer to President Trump than prior Fed chairs were to their nominating presidents. There is also the contextual background: the firing of Lisa Cook, the attempts to end Jerome Powell’s term early, and Kevin Hassett’s own stated approval for those attempts.”</p><p>Still, Hassett would not have free rein to steer the Fed if nominated and subsequently confirmed by the US Senate.</p><p>The central bank’s policy committee has 12 members – including four nominees of former Democratic President Joe Biden – and makes its decisions by majority vote.</p><p>David Wilcox, an economist with Bloomberg Economics and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that whoever leads the Fed next will face the same difficult task of supporting jobs without stoking higher inflation.</p><p>“On one hand, the jobs market appears to be weakening, albeit only slowly. On the other hand, inflation remains too high – noticeably above the Fed’s 2 percent objective,” Wilcox told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There’s plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree about how these competing considerations should best be balanced against each other, but no one should pretend that the choice is obvious,” Wilcox added.</p><p>“Any move toward a dramatically easier stance of policy risks pushing inflation higher for longer. We’ve just been through the worst bout of inflation in 40 years, and the American people have spoken loud and clear about how strongly they dislike inflation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two days later, he said, he found himself in the middle of a conversation that appeared to feature some of the most senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration.</p><p>Among the participants were Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><h2 id=\"trump-defends-signal-chat\">Trump defends Signal chat</h2><p>In the Signal chat, Hegseth reportedly <a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/the-atlantic-publishes-us-attack-plans-shared-on-signal\">divulged details</a> in advance about a March 15 attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Those details included the precise timing when the F-18 planes would launch, when the drones would arrive, and when both parties would conduct their air strikes.</p><p>Goldberg’s reporting on the chat prompted outrage towards the Trump administration and Waltz and Hegseth in particular.</p><p>Critics decried the risks that the messages posed to US military operations overseas, with some worrying that, if the Signal chat had fallen into the wrong hands, it could have endangered service members’ lives.</p><p>This week’s inspector general report recommends greater training to ensure compliance with operational security standards.</p><p>But it declines to weigh whether the material Hegseth transmitted over Signal was, in fact, classified at the time.</p><p>Instead, the inspector general points out that, as secretary of defence, Hegseth has the right to determine the classification level of military intelligence and could have declassified the information if he decided to do so.</p><p>Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for Hegseth’s office, described that finding as a victory for the embattled defence secretary, who has long denied that <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/pete-hegseth-says-signal-chat-had-no-war-plans-hes-wrong-say-experts\">“war plans” were shared</a> over the messaging app.</p><p>“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared,” Parnell wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/1996367776089571829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”</p><p>Parnell also took the media to task for highlighting the risks the information posed to US military members.</p><p>“There is zero evidence that supports this conclusion. None,” Parnell <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellUSA/status/1996358373978304864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response to a New York Times post that raised the potential dangers.</p><p>On the contrary, Parnell argued, the “flawless execution &amp; success of Operation Rough Rider” – the name of the Yemen bombing campaign – was evidence that no troops were put in harm’s way.</p><p>President Trump himself has previously called the fallout from the scandal <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/trump-calls-signal-chat-fallout-a-witch-hunt-amid-calls-for-probe\">a “witch-hunt”</a> and questioned whether Signal itself was not “defective”.</p><p>Administration officials <a href=\"/news/2025/3/31/white-house-dismisses-investigation-calls-says-case-closed-on-signalgate\">have repeatedly called</a> for the scandal, dubbed Signalgate, to be “case closed”. Hegseth, meanwhile, has received no public reprimand from the administration for his participation in the chat.</p><h2 id=\"a-breach-in-protocol\">A ‘breach in protocol’</h2><p>But critics like Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have called the conversation one of the “most stunning breaches of military intelligence” in recent years.</p><p>Some pointed out that foreign intelligence operatives could have intercepted the Signal messages. Others argued that Signal’s auto-delete function violated government transparency requirements that require documentation to be kept, albeit securely.</p><p>Democrats and some Republicans demanded an investigation into Hegseth’s actions. In a March 26 <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-27-gec-to-igs-and-whc-re-security-assessment-signal-chat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a>, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee at the time, the late Gerald Connolly, echoed that call.</p><p>“I request that you immediately open an investigation into this severe breach in protocol and national trust,” he wrote.</p><p>“The use of Signal to communicate this information jeopardized the lives of men and women of the military and embarrassingly advertised to our adversaries the careless attitude of our nation’s senior leaders.”</p><p>On April 3, Steven Stebbins, the acting inspector general for the Pentagon, responded to the outcry. He launched a probe and explained he was prompted to do so by the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>“The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD [Department of Defense] personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” Stebbins wrote in a short, one-page <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/03/2003681607/-1/-1/1/EVALUATION%20OF%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE'S%20REPORTED%20USE%20OF%20A%20COMMERCIALLY%20AVAILABLE%20MESSAGE%20APPLICATION%20FOR%20OFFICER%20BUSINESS%20(PROJECT%20NO.%20D2025-DEV0PC-0095.000).PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a>.</p><p>“Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.”</p><p>Stebbins took up the post of acting inspector general in January, after Trump led a purge of government watchdogs.</p><p>On January 24, just days into his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general – the nonpartisan officials charged with the oversight of various executive agencies.</p><p>That included Stebbins’s predecessor Robert Storch, who served as inspector general for the Department of Defense from 2022 to 2025.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If finalised next year, it would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon (3.8 litres) of petrol, through the 2031 model year.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of petrol vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles (65.5km) per gallon in the 2031 model year. That frees up car makers to produce larger vehicles like sports utility vehicles, which are more profitable than smaller cars.</p><p>The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse policies from the era of former Democratic President Joe Biden that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles (EVs). Burning petrol for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and in the US, it is the largest contributor.</p><p>Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest US automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.</p><p>Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.</p><h2 id=\"split-response\">Split response</h2><p>Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense”.</p><p>“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.</p><p>Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real-world market conditions”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Environmentalists decried the decision.</p><p>“In one stroke, Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p>“Gutting the [petrol-mileage] programme will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’’ said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All programme.</p><p>“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Major carmakers will save more than $35bn in technology costs through 2031 under a broad rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards, the Trump administration said.</p><p>General Motors would save $8.7bn from 2027 through 2031, while Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis would each save more than $5bn, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said. Hyundai would save $4.6bn, Subaru $3.8bn, and Toyota $2.3bn, it said.</p><p>But at the same time, fuel costs for drivers are expected to soar, and US drivers are expected to pay up to $185bn more through 2050, the NHTSA reported.</p><h2 id=\"false-ev-claims\">False EV claims</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate”, referring incorrectly to  Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8 percent of new vehicle sales in the US in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.</p><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included the use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on petrol. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.</p><p>Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81km) per gallon of petrol for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63km) per gallon today.</p><p>The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2 percent each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2 percent per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.</p><p>The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of petrol from being burned by 2050, according to the NHTSA’s 2024 calculations.</p><p>Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tonnes of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tonnes a year of deadly soot particles and more than 4,870 tonnes a year of smog components – nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons – going into the air in the coming years.</p><p>Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.</p><p>The proposal must undergo public comments over a 45-day period before it can be finalised.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I think it’s why he’s such an effective leader, to be perfectly honest, and I think it’s why he actually is the consummate host for this incredible World Cup that is going to be the largest in human history,” Giuliani said.</p><p>He went on to suggest that Trump’s <a href=\"/#flips-6385900455112:0\">bigoted approach</a> was a form of honesty.</p><p>“In terms of the president’s rhetoric, he’s unique in that regard. He’s a New Yorker like me. Sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians,” Giuliani said.</p><p>“But I think that’s also why he’s been able to actually really get to the hearts of so many Americans – because he is completely honest with them.”</p><p>Norona, however, said Trump’s comments send a “discriminatory” and “racist” message.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s style; it’s a deliberate choice of words,” he added. “It’s something that should be reprehensible for everyone.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857165\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857165\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-14T061845Z_853158429_RC2SLFAY2NQQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1753462505.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C586&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump looks at the golden glove trophy next to FIFA president Gianni Infantino after Chelsea won against Paris St Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump looks at the golden glove trophy next to FIFA president Gianni Infantino after Chelsea won against Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 13 [Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fifa-pace-prize\">FIFA Pace Prize</h2><p>Trump has been showing ample interest in the World Cup and football generally.

US President Donald Trump has sharply criticised the Fed for not lowering its short-term interest rate more quickly. When the Fed reduces its rate, it can over time lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.</p><p>The prospect of the administration “vetoing” regional bank presidents would represent another effort by the administration to exert more control over the Fed, an institution that has traditionally been independent from day-to-day politics.</p><p>The Federal Reserve seeks to keep prices in check and support hiring by setting a short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs across the economy.</p><h2 id=\"complicated-structure\">Complicated structure</h2><p>The Fed has a complicated structure that includes a seven-member board of governors based in Washington as well as 12 regional banks that cover specific districts across the US.

Much of the power grid is considered outdated, with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels from sources like Venezuela.</p><p>Most of the infrastructure also dates to the Cold War era. It saw a leap in construction in the 1980s, and by 1989, the grid was expanded to reach 95 percent of all households.</p><p>In recent years, Cuba has invested in renewable energy as an alternative to its current energy production model.</p><p>In April 2024, for instance, the Caribbean nation inked a deal with China to open 92 solar farms by 2028. The first of those solar plants opened in February of this year.</p><p>But natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, have posed continued hurdles to electricity distribution on the island.</p><p>In late September, for instance, Hurricane Imelda churned through the Caribbean Sea, bringing floods and landslides to Cuba, where at least two people died.</p><p>Then, in October, Cuba was struck again, this time by Hurricane Melissa, one of the most intense Atlantic storms on record.</p><p>The hurricane had slowed to a Category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba, but it nevertheless pounded the island with more flash floods, leaving homes destroyed and thousands displaced.</p><p>Cuban officials have also blamed the United States for contributing to the island’s limping infrastructure.</p><p>Since 1962, the US has placed Cuba under a wide-reaching embargo, which critics say has undermined the island’s economy.</p><p>Despite efforts to loosen the sanctions in recent decades, the administration of US President Donald Trump has kept the embargo in place, citing reports of human rights abuses under the Cuban government.</p><p>Nevertheless, in October, a majority vote at the United Nations General Assembly once again passed a non-binding resolution calling on the US to end its embargo, as part of an annual appeal.</p><p>The economic sanctions, the resolution argues, are disproportionately punitive.</p><h2 id=\"president-blames-us-blockade\">President blames US ‘blockade’</h2><p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday cited that rationale, along with the toll of the recent storms, as challenges impeding the proper functioning of the electrical grid.</p><p>“The workers at [the Ministry of Energy and Mines], who never rest amidst the daily challenges imposed by the blockade and the recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa, are already working to resolve the issue,” Diaz-Canel <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/1996212184552980747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “Once again, we have faith in them.”</p><p>Since taking office in 2019, Diaz-Canel has faced significant pressure from the blackouts and the public unrest they cause.</p><p>In 2021, amid the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of basic supplies like fuel, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest deteriorating conditions on the island. Among their complaints were the regular blackouts the island faces.</p><p>Those protests coincided with a record-setting mass exodus from Cuba. Estimates vary as to the island’s population, but government statistics indicate that, in 2021, the total number of residents was around 11,113,215.</p><p><span>As of 2024, that number has plummeted to 9,748,532. That suggests a steep population drop of more than 12 percent, much of which is attributed to migration off the island.</span></p><p>That decline corresponds to a spike in Cuban arrivals documented by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.</p><p>For fiscal year 2023, the agency reported 200,287 “encounters” with Cuban migrants attempting to enter the United States. For fiscal year 2024, that number rose to 217,615.</p><p>Under Trump, however, the US has this month suspended all immigration applications from Cuba and 18 other countries the Republican president <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">has described</a> as “third world”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The wealth they have is theoretical – they do not sit on a bank pile of 1 billion $1 notes, nor do they have a swimming pool of gold bullion.</p><p>Many of the billionaires we know may be worth a billion today or a million tomorrow, depending on how these shares or IP perform. This may sound elementary, but it is important.</p><p>Billionaires have an inherent interest in growing their wealth and therefore to grow productive, profitable, problem-solving companies.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3524596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3524596\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3524596\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/doc-36uw2rr-1740051893.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TRUMP INAUGURATION\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3524596\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend US President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony [File: Chip Somodevilla/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>See Nvidia, which issues shares to its staff and is at the forefront of the AI revolution, or SpaceX, which has opened up satellite communication for the masses and benefits us all.</p><p>Now, let us invert this issue – if we abolish billionaires, these exceptional individuals do not have the incentive to fix these problems, we all lose utility, and problems remain.</p><p>That would be a terrible thing for society.</p><p><em>Maxwell Marlow, director of public affairs, Adam Smith Institute</em></p><h2 id=\"what-if-wealth-was-fairly-distributed\">What if wealth was fairly distributed?</h2><p>Billionaires need to be taxed — but from the perspective of the Global South, the real question is where.</p><p>Firstly, it should not be looked at as the Robin Hood type of distribution. Secondly, if they are taxed only in their country of residence, does that reflect where their wealth was actually created?</p><p>Wealth is not produced solely by investment. It is built on resources and labour. In today’s global economy, much of that comes from the Global South. It follows, then, that tax revenues should also flow back to the places from which that wealth is extracted.</p><p>Take Antwerp. It is a beautiful city whose residents enjoy high living standards. But the foundations of that prosperity lie in diamonds from the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo, where living standards have barely risen. We have to ask why we have these different outcomes. This is not about charity; it is about restructuring global finance to make it fair.</p><p>Inequality has surged over the past 30 to 40 years. Extreme wealth of the kind we see today was taxed at 97–98 percent in the form of high marginal tax rates above a threshold, based on what amounted to a global consensus that such concentrations of wealth were unhealthy — and that the money was better directed to health, welfare and education.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2344150\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2344150\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2344150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AP20017382874205-1693905419.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt='Demonstrators against inequality march to the office of the president in downtown Nairobi, Kenya Friday, Jan. 17, 2020.

In effect, we end up asking billionaires for permission to fund the public good.</p><p>If we are serious about eliminating billionaires, we need to regulate them out of existence. It is no coincidence that much of the West’s antitrust legislation is centuries out of date.

It has long existed … but today we have individuals who can buy entire media platforms outright, simply because they have the cash. Think of Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk.</p><p>Naturally, this changes the information we receive and who determines what that is.</p><p>Second, billionaires sometimes claim they are rescuing news organisations and supporting journalism, but that commitment lasts only as long as their own interests go unchallenged and as long as they find it personally profitable or useful.</p><p>Musk, for example, has taken one of the world’s most important platforms [the social media platform X, formerly Twitter] — at least for journalism — and arguably corrupted it in pursuit of his political preferences.</p><p>It is essential to remember that controlling the media is ultimately about controlling access to information.

In the 1910s, the US broke the conglomerate of John D Rockefeller — then the world’s richest man and effectively the tech giant of his era.

Disclosures such as the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks have stripped away much of the opacity surrounding it. In France, serious proposals to tax billionaires and centi-millionaires now command broad political support. Within the G20, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has placed taxing the super-rich firmly on the agenda. The debate is no longer about whether the ultra-wealthy can be taxed, but when.</p><p>Winning that argument will not be easy. But, as with income tax — once denounced as Marxist — it has been won before. And redistributing some of the wealth held by the super-rich would also weaken many right-wing nativist narratives about scarce resources that have spread across the West.</p><p>Those narratives have prospered partly because progressive calls for redistribution have lacked the necessary weight, enabling an alliance of the right and billionaire interests to push xenophobia to the fore.</p><p><em>Lucas Chancel, senior economist at the World Inequality Lab of the Paris School of Economics</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"306\" data-end=\"705\">The recent wave of pessimism surrounding Bangladesh’s economy under its interim administration, much of it amplified by selectively framed local commentary, offers an incomplete and often misleading portrait of the country’s actual economic trajectory. Much of this concern is overstated, as the headline indicators reflect a necessary structural correction rather than an economic collapse.</p><p data-start=\"707\" data-end=\"853\">While elevated inflation and a battered banking sector are real and serious challenges, they do not amount to evidence of an economy in free fall.</p><p data-start=\"855\" data-end=\"1096\">A more careful reading, one that accounts for the disruptive legacy of the previous administration and the corrective measures undertaken after the political transition, reveals a difficult but necessary period of structural rebalancing.</p><p data-start=\"1098\" data-end=\"1347\">The claim that the new government is inheriting a crippled economy overlooks the fact that the previous administration left behind a financial system that resembled a house of cards, propped up by manipulated data and systematic concealment of risk.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1605\">To portray the current economy as stagnant is to ignore Bangladesh’s longer arc of resilience in South Asia. Despite the global shocks that followed COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, the country delivered stronger growth than most of its regional peers.</p><p data-start=\"1607\" data-end=\"1831\">It registered 3.5 percent growth in 2020, followed by 6.9 percent in 2021 and 7.1 percent in 2022. Today’s slower growth reflects deliberate fiscal tightening aimed at restoring macroeconomic balance after years of excess.</p><p data-start=\"1833\" data-end=\"1938\">Rather than a sign of decay, this is the predictable cooling that follows the end of artificial stimulus.</p><p data-start=\"1940\" data-end=\"2110\">The anxiety around nonperforming loans and private sector credit tells an even more revealing story, not of new stress but of long-buried weaknesses finally exposed.</p><p data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2353\">The alarming rise in nonperforming loans, with figures ranging from over 20 percent in ADB assessments to more than 35 percent under the central bank’s revised classification rules, stems from a long-overdue commitment to honest accounting.</p><p data-start=\"2355\" data-end=\"2615\">For years, the previous regime reportedly pressured regulators to gloss over defaults, relax classification standards, and extend loan rescheduling indefinitely. The result was a banking sector that looked superficially healthy while quietly deteriorating.</p><p data-start=\"2617\" data-end=\"2717\">The surge in nonperforming loans is therefore the price of confronting the system’s real condition.</p><p data-start=\"2719\" data-end=\"3048\">The compression in private credit growth, which dipped to about 6.29 percent in late 2025, must also be understood in context. Previous double-digit credit growth was inflated by massive, politically connected borrowing that produced little real economic return and ultimately fed into the ballooning nonperforming loan crisis.</p><p data-start=\"3050\" data-end=\"3284\">Many of these loans were never intended to be repaid and were allegedly funnelled into overseas real estate or offshore accounts. In contrast, banks today are more cautious, with credit flowing into sectors less vulnerable to default.</p><p data-start=\"3286\" data-end=\"3526\">The volume of lending has decreased, but the quality has improved. An economy cannot build sustainable growth on a mountain of bad debt. The current adjustment reflects a shift towards stability rather than a collapse in investment appetite.</p><p data-start=\"3528\" data-end=\"3876\">These corrections in the financial sector are only one part of the broader adjustment. The most decisive rebuttal to claims of stagnation is the transformation under way in the fiscal and external sectors. In an unusual show of discipline, the government has sharply reversed the longstanding habit of borrowing heavily from the banking system.</p><p data-start=\"3878\" data-end=\"4103\">Between July and October of the 2025-26 financial year, it repaid more than 5 billion taka (about $40.9m) to banks, in stark contrast to the more than 150 billion taka ($1.23bn) borrowed during the same period a year earlier.</p><p data-start=\"4105\" data-end=\"4303\">Economists note that this shift eases pressure on interest rates and frees up liquidity for private borrowers, marking a significant break with a past where the state crowded out the private sector.</p><p data-start=\"4305\" data-end=\"4417\">For a country long accustomed to fiscal indiscipline, this move signals a meaningful shift towards stability.</p><p data-start=\"4419\" data-end=\"4637\">Foreign direct investment (FDI) tells a similarly counterintuitive story. Against the assumption that political upheaval deters investors, Bangladesh experienced nearly 20 percent growth in FDI in the 2024-25 financial year.</p><p data-start=\"4639\" data-end=\"4867\">For a post-transition economy emerging from a massive uprising that resulted in more than 1,400 deaths, this is extremely rare. Countries emerging from political uprisings typically endure sharp drops in foreign investment for years.</p><p data-start=\"4869\" data-end=\"5028\">In Bangladesh’s case, global firms not only remained but also reinvested their earnings. This reflects a deeper confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.</p><p data-start=\"5030\" data-end=\"5278\">Perhaps the most striking shift has occurred in the external sector. After months of steady erosion, foreign currency reserves have stabilised and then strengthened, climbing from less than $20bn in mid-2024 to more than $30bn a year later.</p><p data-start=\"5280\" data-end=\"5528\">Remittances surged to a record $30.33bn in the 2024-25 financial year, a 26.8 percent increase attributed to renewed confidence in the formal financial system, the crackdown on money laundering, and the return to a market-based exchange rate.</p><p data-start=\"5530\" data-end=\"5836\">Expatriates who once relied on hundi networks are now sending money legally, responding to a more transparent and predictable currency regime. This combination of rising reserves, strong remittance inflows, and exchange-rate stabilisation forms one of Bangladesh’s strongest macroeconomic buffers in years.</p><p data-start=\"5838\" data-end=\"5998\">Inflation remains the most potent concern, and rightly so. With rates above 8 percent, higher than any country in South Asia, the cost-of-living pressure is severe.</p><p data-start=\"6000\" data-end=\"6164\">But here again, comparisons require nuance. Sri Lanka’s low inflation follows a complete economic meltdown and draconian monetary tightening under an IMF programme.</p><p data-start=\"6166\" data-end=\"6384\">Bangladesh’s inflation is structurally different, driven partly by supply chain constraints, lingering market distortions, and the aftereffects of earlier monetary expansion. It is difficult, but not destabilising.</p><p data-start=\"6386\" data-end=\"6626\">Similarly, the poverty figure of 28 percent often cited by critics originates from a limited-sample private study. World Bank projections indicate that poverty is likely to continue falling modestly this financial year, even amid inflation.</p><p data-start=\"6628\" data-end=\"6841\">The battle ahead is not simply about preserving growth rates, but about dismantling entrenched corruption, extortion networks, and bureaucratic bottlenecks that have acted as invisible taxes on the poor for years.</p><p data-start=\"6843\" data-end=\"7046\">Bangladesh’s economy today is not collapsing; it is undergoing a difficult but necessary reconstruction after more than a decade of governance that preferred cosmetic stability over institutional health.</p><p data-start=\"7048\" data-end=\"7230\">High nonperforming loans, slower credit growth, and persistent inflation are symptoms of structural problems finally being confronted. That confrontation was inevitable and overdue.</p><p data-start=\"7232\" data-end=\"7471\">What stands out instead is a set of achievements rarely seen in a post-transition economy: a rapid rebound in reserves, a record surge in remittances, nearly 20 percent growth in FDI, and an unprecedented demonstration of fiscal restraint.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\">These are not the markers of stagnation, but the early foundations of a more transparent, durable economic future. Whether Bangladesh completes this transition will depend on the political will to sustain reform, especially in the banking sector. The story of the economy today is not one of collapse; it is the story of corrective surgery. Whether the country can finish the operation remains the central question.</p><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7892\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
