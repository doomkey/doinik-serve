But Belgium is pushing back following the announcement on Wednesday, arguing that the plan carries legal and financial risks that it fears it could end up shouldering alone.</p><p data-start=\"483\" data-end=\"1171\">European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Brussels would supply 90 billion euros ($105bn) of Ukraine’s budget requirements for 2026-27, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be 137 billion euros ($159bn). She said that other “international partners” would cover the rest.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Today, we are sending a very strong message to the Ukrainian people. We are with them for the long haul,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>Frozen Russian funds held in Europe would be used as collateral for a “reparations loan” designed to sustain Ukraine’s war effort, and which Ukraine would ultimately pay back after it obtains compensation for the war from Russia.</p><p>Aid could also be funded through common EU borrowing, but, despite Belgian objections, most European officials have expressed a preference for using frozen Russian assets. The EU’s controversial plan comes as the latest round of United States-led peace talks between Russia and Ukraine shows <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/no-compromise-territory-ukraine-talks-us-kremlin\">little sign of progress</a>.</p><p>Moscow has denounced the reparations loan plan as “theft”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-is-the-eu-proposing-to-finance-ukraine\" data-start=\"1209\" data-end=\"1679\">How is the EU proposing to finance Ukraine?</h2><p data-start=\"1209\" data-end=\"1679\">Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in <a href=\"/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets\">February 2022</a>, the European bloc has committed more than 170 billion euros ($197bn) to Ukraine, mainly in the form of military and humanitarian support. The European Commission is now pledging to provide more money for another two years in the form of loans.</p><p>On Wednesday, long-awaited details of the EU plan for a “reparations loan” were published. Under it, some 90 billion euros ($104bn) of frozen Russian assets will be used as collateral for a loan to Ukraine.</p><p>Under a loan arrangement, repayment to creditors – both government and private lenders – will be guaranteed by the present and future earnings of the frozen assets. Ukraine would then repay the loan once Moscow compensates Kyiv for the destruction caused by its invasion.</p><p>“It’s quite a clever tactic,” Gregoire Roos, director of the Europe and Russia and Eurasia Programmes at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera. “They’re not seizing the assets. Rather, they are keeping them frozen and monetising them.”</p><p>Roos added that “while assets have been frozen in previous conflicts … this is significant in Europe owing to the scale”.</p><p>“There is no precedent for this,” he said.</p><p>Von der Leyen said the funds would provide Ukraine with more leverage in peace talks and demonstrate to Moscow that “the prolongation of the war on their side comes with a high cost for them”. She added that Washington had been briefed on the plan.</p><p>If von der Leyen’s reparations-loan plan fails to win unanimous EU member-state support, she hinted that the EU could fall back on market borrowing. However, this would require unanimous agreement from the bloc, giving Hungary <a href=\"/news/2023/12/15/hungary-blocks-54bn-eu-financial-aid-for-ukraine\">another opportunity to veto Ukraine aid</a>.</p><p>Hungary has repeatedly vetoed EU assistance to Ukraine because Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government argues that arming Kyiv will prolong the war and increase the EU’s collective debt. Orban has also maintained unusually warm ties with Vladimir Putin compared to other EU leaders.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-belgium-object-to-this-plan\">Why does Belgium object to this plan?</h2><p data-start=\"3308\" data-end=\"3884\">Belgium worries that Euroclear – the Brussels-based financial clearing house that holds the bulk of the frozen Russian assets – could end up entangled in damaging litigation if Russia challenges the EU decision, or if the action harms Euroclear’s reputation and business model.</p><p data-start=\"3308\" data-end=\"3884\">In theory, Russia could challenge the asset-freeze decision in a court in Belgium, where Euroclear is incorporated.</p><p>Addressing an audience at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said: “We are not seeking to antagonise our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return.”</p><p>Prevot said Belgium views “the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky” and “has never been done before”. Instead, he wants the EU to pursue ordinary market borrowing to fund a loan to Ukraine. “It is a well-known, a robust and a well-established option with predictable parameters,” he said.</p><p>He is strongly supported by Belgian officials who have doubled down on their opposition to the reparations loan in recent weeks, especially after a 28-point plan<a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\"> for a peace deal</a> by the administration of US President Donald Trump was made public, and included plans to use the frozen assets.</p><p>To address Belgium’s concerns, the European Commission’s blueprint does include measures to shield EU governments from “possible retaliation from Russia”, and to establish an EU-level borrowing mechanism to “underpin a loan to Ukraine”. However, Prevot emphasised that “the reparation loans scheme entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks”, and argued that the commission’s safeguards do not go far enough, leaving Belgium exposed.</p><p>“It is not acceptable to use the money and leave us alone facing the risks,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-is-at-stake\">How much money is at stake?</h2><p>Some 290 billion euros ($337bn) of Russia’s sovereign wealth – principally in the form of foreign-exchange reserves held as cash and bonds – was frozen by Western powers following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.</p><p>A large portion of those assets is held in Belgium, where roughly 194 billion euros ($225bn) was held as of June this year. Euroclear alone holds about 183 billion euros ($212bn) of these assets. Smaller amounts of assets are also held in the US, United Kingdom, and Japan.</p><p>Under a plan agreed by <a href=\"/news/2024/6/14/g7-to-use-russian-assets-for-50bn-ukraine-loan-how-will-it-work\">Group of Seven (G7)</a> countries in 2024, Ukraine would be provided with loans to be repaid using the interest earned on Russia’s foreign frozen assets, effectively leaving the assets untouched but allowing Kyiv to benefit from the income they generate.</p><p>Yesterday’s announcement goes one step further by collateralising the frozen funds.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-belgium-s-eu-partners-say\">What do Belgium’s EU partners say?</h2><p data-start=\"3963\" data-end=\"4212\">On Wednesday, von der Leyen said she was considering Belgium’s objections. “We have listened very carefully to Belgium’s concerns, and we have taken almost all of them into account in our proposal. We will share the burden in a fair way, as it is the European way,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"4491\" data-end=\"5203\">Other European officials echoed this. Johann Wadephul, Germany’s minister of foreign affairs, said: “We take Belgium’s concerns seriously. They are justified, but the issue can be resolved. It can be resolved if we are prepared to take responsibility together.”</p><p>Elsewhere, David van Weel, the Netherlands’ minister of foreign affairs, highlighted the stakes of Belgium’s recalcitrance. “These funds are really, really important. We need to support the Ukrainian economy; otherwise, they will have a very tough time next year.”</p><p>Van Weel emphasised that EU member states have listened to Belgium. “We understand the Belgian concerns, and we are willing to at least make sure that they are not alone in this,” he said.</p><p>Other EU countries have already signalled readiness to backstop potential losses for Belgium.</p><p data-start=\"5205\" data-end=\"5393\">Belgium, meanwhile, has been collecting tax revenue from the immobilised Russian funds, and interest from the assets is already being directed into a G7-organised loan package for Ukraine.</p><p data-start=\"5395\" data-end=\"5513\">Looking ahead, European leaders are set to revisit the issue as well as Ukraine’s broader financing requirements at their Brussels summit on December 18.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The inspector general, who was appointed by Trump in January, revealed in a memo at the time that he had been prompted by the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee to begin a probe.</p><p>“The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD [Department of Defense] personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business,” Stebbins wrote in a short <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/03/2003681607/-1/-1/1/EVALUATION%20OF%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE'S%20REPORTED%20USE%20OF%20A%20COMMERCIALLY%20AVAILABLE%20MESSAGE%20APPLICATION%20FOR%20OFFICER%20BUSINESS%20(PROJECT%20NO.%20D2025-DEV0PC-0095.000).PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a> published on April 3, adding that compliance with classification and records retention would also be reviewed.</p><h2 id=\"did-hegseth-declassify-the-information-before-he-divulged-it-on-signal\">Did Hegseth declassify the information before he divulged it on Signal?</h2><p>Stebbins’s report detailed how Hegseth’s staff set up Signal so that the defence secretary could use it from his office at the Pentagon, where personal devices are not allowed and where he could not have physically accessed his phone.</p><p>While the inspector general’s report states that Hegseth has the authority to determine the classification level of military intelligence – and could have declassified the information if he wanted to – it does not conclusively determine whether the material he transmitted over Signal had been declassified.</p><p>According to a report by CNN, the information shared by Hegseth on the Signal chat was taken from a classified US Central Command document marked “Secret/NOFORN”, meaning no foreign nationals were permitted to view it.</p><p>Stebbins’s report referenced a broader review of how federal officials use Signal and recommended more training for Pentagon officials to ensure compliance.</p><p>Hegseth refused to be interviewed by the inspector general and instead submitted his arguments in writing, The Associated Press reported. Investigators relied on screenshots shared by the journalist who broke the story in March because Hegseth failed to provide all of his Signal messages.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-hegseth-responded-to-the-report\">How has Hegseth responded to the report?</h2><p>In a post on X on Tuesday, Hegseth claimed the inspector general report revealed “no classified information” was shared and that it represented “total exoneration” for him.</p><p></p><p>That post followed one by his office’s spokesperson Sean Parnell, who wrote: “This Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared.”</p><p>“This matter is resolved and the case is closed,” he continued.</p><p>Parnell also responded to A New York Times post which raised the potential dangers of Hegseth’s actions as highlighted in the report, saying: “There is zero evidence that supports this conclusion. None.”</p><p>He added that the “flawless execution &amp; success of Operation Rough Rider” – the name of the Yemen bombing campaign discussed on Signal – was evidence that no troops had been placed at risk.</p><p>Parnell and Hegseth’s stances align with those of the Trump administration since the scandal first broke in March. President Trump’s office did not publicly admonish Hegseth, and Trump himself called the scandal <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/trump-calls-signal-chat-fallout-a-witch-hunt-amid-calls-for-probe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a “witch-hunt”</a>. Trump also attempted to blame the messaging app by questioning whether Signal itself was “defective”.</p><p>Some Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees, however, said that Hegseth’s actions would be a fireable offence for any other official.</p><p>“This was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head,” Senator Mark Warner said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-said-in-the-signal-chat\">What was said in the Signal chat?</h2><p>The “<a href=\"/news/2025/3/25/yemen-war-plans-what-did-trump-aides-leak-to-the-atlantic-in-signal-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signalgate”</a> scandal, as it has been referred to in US media, dates back to March.</p><p>Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran journalist and editor-in-chief of the Washington, DC-based The Atlantic magazine, revealed in an article on March 24 that Trump administration officials accidentally added him to a Signal chat in which they disclosed specific details about a March 15 air strike on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, hours before the attack happened.</p><p>Goldberg said he had earlier received a connection request on March 11 from someone named Michael Waltz on the encrypted messaging service, likely to be then-US national security adviser Mike Waltz. Thinking it was probably a scam, Goldberg nevertheless accepted the invitation to join the group, which had been named “Houthi PC small group”, only to find that top officials were also on it, including Hegseth, Vance, Rubio, and Gabbard. There were 18 participants in the group.</p><p>The chat revealed precise timings of when US F-18 planes and drones would be launched. One update on the timing of the strikes read: “This is DEFINITELY when the first bombs will drop.”</p><p>The strikes killed at least 53 people, including children.</p><p>Goldberg said he left the group after discovering that the messages matched the timing of the air strikes.</p><p>His article about the affair soon after drew immediate uproar from both Democrats and Republicans, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer calling it one of the “most stunning breaches of military intelligence” in recent US history. Democrats and a small group of Republicans demanded an investigation, and the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee at the time, the late Gerald Connolly, asked Stebbins to launch a probe.</p><p>Critics pointed out that foreign intelligence operatives could have intercepted the Signal messages and that Signal’s auto-delete function violated government transparency requirements that require documentation to be kept, albeit securely.</p><p>In a follow-up article on March 26, The Atlantic revealed more screenshots of the chat.</p><p>But Hegseth denied that he had shared “war plans” on the messaging app and said he was permitted to declassify information and that he only communicated details he believed would not endanger the mission. He told Fox News in April that the messages were “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4073829\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4073829\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4073829\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20251028__82AU2VE__v1__HighRes__UsMilitaryStrikesPacificDrugs-1761910899.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C435&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"boast strikes\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4073829\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This screen grab from a video posted by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on his X account on October 28, 2025, shows what he says is one of four alleged drug-smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean that was destroyed in strikes, bringing the death toll from Washington’s anti-narcotics campaign to at least 57 [Handout/US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s X Account/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-other-scandals-has-hegseth-been-involved-in\">What other scandals has Hegseth been involved in?</h2><p>Hegseth is <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/hegseth-or-admiral-bradley-who-approved-the-second-venezuela-boat-strike\">separately being investigated</a> over a verbal order he is alleged to have given regarding a September 2 strike on a boat presumed to be carrying drugs in Caribbean waters.</p><p>Sources involved said Hegseth gave the order to “kill everybody” in the mission, according to details first published on November 28 by The Washington Post, quoting two people who had direct knowledge of the operation.</p><p>A commander in charge of the operation then ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">second strike</a>, which killed two people struggling in the water who had survived a first attack on the 11 people in the boat.</p><p>The boat was the first to be hit in Trump’s deadly campaign against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which Democrat lawmakers have criticised for its human rights implications. The Trump administration has justified the strikes as a necessary step to curb drug inflows to the country, which it says threatens national security.</p><p>At least 80 people have been killed in the strikes on Venezuelan boats that the US says – without evidence – are trafficking drugs. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called the strikes “unacceptable” in October and said they represented “extrajudicial killing”,  which is in violation of international human rights law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The family of a Colombian man, Alejandro Carranza, killed in a strike on September 15, also filed a legal case on Tuesday, arguing that he was a fisherman and that the hit was an extrajudicial killing. That case has been filed at the regional Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is based in Washington, DC. However, the US does not recognise its jurisdiction.</p><p>In a post on his Truth Social media platform, Trump stated at the time that the September 2 strike had killed 11 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, designated by the US as a terrorist group, and claimed that the boat was headed to the US.</p><p>However, Rubio, on the same day, said in a<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-remarks-to-press\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> news briefing</a>, it was “probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean” before changing his stance the following day and saying it was “headed towards, eventually” the US.</p><p>US media reported that four missiles had been used and that Hegseth watched the strikes in real time. The Associated Press reported that the Pentagon knew there were survivors in the water, quoting people familiar with the operation who said the argument was that the boat needed to be sunk.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-republicans-responded-to-these-allegations\">How have Republicans responded to these allegations?</h2><p>Hegseth condemned The Washington Post’s reporting last week, saying it was “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”. At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday at the White House, he said the second strike happened in the “fog of war” and that he did not see any survivors. He added that he “didn’t stick around” for the rest of the mission.</p><p>Both Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee have opened investigations into the legality of the attack. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” Democrat Senator Tim Kaine told reporters last week.</p><p>Responding to reporters’ questions on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump appeared to distance himself from the affair. “I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike,” he said, adding that his administration would look into the reports. He also stated that Hegseth had told him he “did not order the death of those two men”.</p><p>Questions regarding what role Hegseth in fact played in the attack will be asked during a classified congressional briefing on Thursday with the commander the Trump administration says headed the operation, Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley.</p><p>Before Hegseth’s appointment in January, the military veteran and former Fox News host faced allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use and financial mismanagement.</p><p>In 2017, he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who said he took her cellphone and blocked the door of a hotel room to prevent her from leaving, according to a police report. Hegseth denied the accusation, although his lawyer acknowledged that the woman was paid a settlement.</p><p>A December 2024 report by The New Yorker revealed claims that Hegseth, as leader of the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America between 2013 and 2016, frequently became so intoxicated at work events that he relied on colleagues to get home. He was also accused of using official funds for the nonprofit as a “personal expense account”. Hegseth has denied these claims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The group included US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p><p>Putin aide Yuri Ushakov called the meeting “very useful and constructive,” but admitted “a lot of work lies ahead”.</p><p>Ukraine’s desire to join NATO is a “key question”, he said, adding that “no compromise” had been reached on issues of territory.</p><p>Ukrainian officials find Russia’s position absurd, since Moscow launched a full-scale onslaught against Ukraine in 2022. They believe Putin has no real interest in peace, given the continuous bombing of Ukrainian cities.</p><p>“These negotiations did not end in success, as was expected, because they’re based on fundamentally different ideas about what is happening between the Americans and the Kremlin,” Ilya Budraitskis, a Russian political scientist and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The offer of peace resting on the exchange of territories, which the Americans tried to sell as the key idea of this plan, does not really interest Putin. He is interested in changing the entire security structure in Eastern Europe.”</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-an-unreliable-counterpart-russian-analyst\">Ukraine an ‘unreliable counterpart’: Russian analyst</h2><p>But some in Russia back the Kremlin’s viewpoint, and use similar words while doing so.</p><p>“The Kyiv regime’s sabotage of progress toward a peaceful settlement, distortion of facts, and attempts to delay the inevitable have significantly complicated the negotiation process,” said Spartak Baranovsky, a political scientist and member of the Moscow-based Digoria Expert Club, a think tank whose views broadly align with those of the Russian government.</p><p>“The Ukrainian side refused to implement the Minsk agreements and then rejected the initial parameters of the peace agreement negotiated in Istanbul. It is truly difficult to establish a constructive dialogue with such an unreliable counterpart,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The Minsk agreements were a series of treaties signed in 2014 and 2015 to end the war in Donbas, where Russian-backed separatists were fighting the Kyiv government. After the full-scale invasion of 2022, several meetings between Russian and Ukrainian delegates have taken place in Belarus and Turkiye, all of which failed to secure peace.</p><p>While the full details of this week’s meeting have not been revealed, there is a little optimism in Russia that the end of the war is in sight.</p><p>Tatyana, a Saint Petersburg businesswoman in her 60s who declined to give her full name to avoid backlash, blames Russia for the war but believes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s European allies have pushed him into prolonging the fighting.</p><p>“My God, what has the world come to when the only person who seems to be acting rationally in this situation is Trump, who is absolutely insane by his very nature?” she asked.</p><p>“Now the situation is much worse for everyone. A decision still needs to be made, but on the battlefield, the advantage is clearly on Russia’s side, which the crude American generals understand as well as anyone else.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Russian troops had finally taken the strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, ending a two-year siege. While Ukraine denied the city had fallen, its forces have struggled in recent months to halt Russia’s advance in several regions.</p><p>Among the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">proposed terms</a> of an agreement being floated are that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the parts of the Donbas region as yet unoccupied by Russia, which will become a neutral demilitarised zone but internationally recognised as Russian territory. Meanwhile, the Crimean Peninsula as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, which have been under Russian or pro-Russian control since 2014, will be recognised as Russia as well. Ukraine’s armed forces are to be capped at 600,000 personnel, and Ukraine must abandon any aspirations of joining NATO, but its bid for EU membership will be considered.</p><p>In return, Russia must promise not to invade any more European countries, which must be enshrined in its law. There is also a proposed amnesty for war crimes.</p><p>Last week, Putin <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/putin-says-us-backed-peace-plan-as-framework-is-ok-in\">acknowledged</a> the plan “can be the basis for future agreements”, but added, “If Ukrainian troops leave the territories they occupy, then we will stop fighting. If they don’t, we will achieve our aims militarily.”</p><p>Over the weekend, Ukrainian negotiators reiterated to their US counterparts that giving up any territory was not on the table, sources told RBC-Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"can-russia-fight-on-for-years\">Can Russia fight on for years?</h2><p>“Putin perfectly understands that Ukraine is running out of time,” Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, based in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Therefore, Putin is very confident in everything. He has time. He can fight for a year or two. The problem is rather with the West [and its will to fight]. Therefore, yes, he is ready to delay, not until Ukraine is tired and gives up, [but] until his conditions are met.”</p><p>Before Tuesday’s meeting, Putin upped the ante with a threat to Europe.</p><p>He warned that while Russia is not planning a war with Europe, “if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now”.</p><p>Budraitskis at the University of California, Berkeley said, “[Putin] will be preparing for this, just like before 2022, when he said that Russia was not going to attack Ukraine, implying the opposite”.</p><p>Despite their different outlooks, Inozemtsev and Baranovsky agree that Russia is capable of sustaining its war effort indefinitely.</p><p>“To keep fighting for years, at such an intensity, is not a problem at all,” said Inozemtsev.</p><p>“There were more problems at the beginning of the war than now, because we saw at the beginning of the war they needed mobilisation; now they pay them a fairly high salary and [new volunteers] are constantly enlisting. Additionally, they had problems with weapons, and especially active commentators wrote they will run out of shells in three months. In fact, munitions are being produced now more actively than before the war.”</p><p>Inozemtsev believes that now, “the Americans are very determined to either end this war or completely withdraw from any support for Ukraine.”</p><p>“I think that this has now been clearly conveyed to Kyiv,” he said. “And therefore, the Ukrainians will be in some way persuaded … the Ukrainians understand that the Europeans will not save them. In the sense that if now the Americans completely get out of this process, then, of course, Europe will have neither money, nor the determination to constantly support this cause for years.”</p><p>A deal could still be in Ukraine’s interest, Inozemtsev noted.</p><p>“If they are able to guarantee themselves 600,000 for the army and a break for at least a few years, then, in fact, this is the solution to the problem,” he said.</p><p>“Putin will always be a threat [and so] the main task of the West is to outlive [73-year-old] Putin. If there’s a break in the fighting for three to five years, then this is already nearing the end of his life, which naturally makes him less decisive.”</p><p>Any potential peace deal and the lifting of sanctions will be beneficial to the Russian economy, but Inozemtsev and Budraitskis doubt that life will return to how it was before 2022. Society will remain heavily militarised and tightly-controlled, they predicted.</p><p>“There can be no peace, no return to a normal situation in which all these measures that correspond to a full-fledged repressive totalitarian dictatorship will be abolished, because we no longer have any direct external threat,” Budraitskis said.</p><p>“This is the design of Putin’s regime in Russia, how his power is arranged, that there is an endless war, where Russian elites are consolidated under the flag, there is repression against any dissenters inside the country… These are not some kind of extraordinary measures temporarily introduced only in wartime, but this is how he will continue to rule.”</p><p>He added that “war in any form” against Ukraine, Europe, the Baltic states or “anyone” is an integral motif of the “normality that Putin established” in Russia after 2022.</p><p>“Therefore, there will be a continuation of the war on different fronts in order for this regime to remain,” he predicted.</p><p>Some Russians have settled for the long haul already.</p><p>“Until America withdraws its occupation troops from the EU, the war will not end,” said Sergey Kalenik, a media consultant from Moscow.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Soon, American traders had also turned to opium to boost their own exports to China.</p><p>In 1839, Chinese forces attempted to crack down on the inflow of opium, confiscating and destroying it and marking the beginning of the First Opium War. The British and Chinese engaged in naval conflict and the British emerged victorious in 1842. While the US did not militarily engage in the war, American traders were active in China and brought limited amounts of opium from Turkiye and India.</p><p>In 1844, the US and China signed the Treaty of Wanghia, their first treaty together. While this treaty ostensibly outlawed the opium trade, in practice, it opened up five ports for Western-Chinese trade in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai, enabling US traders to expand their sales of opium.</p><p>The Second Opium War took place 20 years later, from 1856 to 1860. French and British forces fought with diplomatic assistance from Russia and protection from American forces. Under pressure, China was forced to sign a treaty legalising opium, one of Britain’s main demands.</p><h3 id=\"1960s-1970s-in-laos-during-the-vietnam-war\">1960s-1970s: In Laos during the Vietnam War</h3><p>Between 1955 and 1975, the US was engaged in armed conflict in Vietnam and parts of neighbouring Laos and Cambodia in a war between the communist North Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South Vietnam, backed by the US.</p><p>During this time, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ran covert operations in Laos, which is northwest of Vietnam, to counter communist forces in Southeast Asia.</p><p>In Laos, CIA officers trained militias from Indigenous tribes such as the Hmong people in the mountainous north, according to a 2003 <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Recollections-Case-Officer-Laos.pdf\">document</a> published by the CIA, to fight against North Vietnamese forces in Laos, as well as against Laotian communists, the Pathet Lao.</p><p>At the time, the Hmong were heavily economically reliant on the cultivation of opium poppies as a cash crop.</p><p>According to historian Alfred W McCoy, who wrote the 1972 book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, the CIA covertly operated an airline called Air America to transport opium from remote mountain areas to be sold in Southeast Asia and international markets, including the US. The proceeds were used to support the militias.</p><p>McCoy presented the findings of his book during a 1972 congressional testimony before a Senate subcommittee. The CIA has never formally admitted direct involvement in the drug operation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149731\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149731\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1354471168-1764839397.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Laotian Civil War (1953Ð75) was fought between the Communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government in which both the political rightists and leftists received heavy external support for a proxy war from the global Cold War superpowers. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Hmong militia during the US’s ‘Secret War’ in Laos, in 1961 [File: History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1980s-during-the-soviet-afghan-war\">1980s: During the Soviet-Afghan War</h2><p>The Soviet army invaded <a href=\"/topics/country/afghanistan.html\">Afghanistan</a> in 1979 to support a communist government that was facing internal threats. Between 1979 and 1989, the Soviet Union fought Afghan rebel fighters, the mujahideen.</p><p>Poppy cultivation thrived in mujahideen‑held provinces such as Helmand in southern Afghanistan and Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan. Historians, including McCoy, allege that CIA-backed mujahideen fighters financed much of their war efforts through opium cultivation and trafficking. Trafficking routes went through Pakistan and Iran, feeding both European and Middle Eastern markets.</p><p>The Soviet-Afghan War resulted in one of the sharpest spikes in global heroin supply in the late 1980s. A UNODC report in 2001 found that in 1999, Afghanistan was producing 79 percent of global illegal opium.</p><p>A CIA report from 1986 also alleges that there was widespread use of drugs among Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and that those soldiers smuggled drugs back to the Soviet Union.</p><p>The CIA has never publicly admitted to backing opium cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149766\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149766\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149766\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-612550268-1764839982.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Afghan Mujahideen fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s.

Pakistan’s tribal belt, especially provinces Balochistan and modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, became transit corridors for heroin exports to the West.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-the-iran-contra-affair\">1980s: The Iran-Contra Affair</h2><p>From the 1950s until the 1980s, the CIA <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/a-timeline-of-cia-operations-in-latin-america\">backed local efforts</a> to clamp down on communist forces in Latin America.</p><p>In Nicaragua, the CIA backed a right-wing group called the Contras, who were fighting the left-wing Cuba-backed Sandinista government during the 1980s. In 1985, then-US President Ronald Reagan heaped praise on the Contras, calling them “the moral equivalent of our founding fathers”.</p><p>However, this all took place against the backdrop of another war overseas that the US took an interest in.</p><p>From 1980 to 1988, Iran and Iraq fought a war, which began with Iraq’s invasion of Iran. In 1985, Iran secretly requested to buy weapons from the US. At this time, an arms embargo prevented the US from openly selling weapons to Iran.</p><p>The Reagan administration nevertheless sold Iran the weapons so that the US could strengthen its position in the Middle East and secure the release of American hostages, mostly diplomats and missionaries, who were being held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>While Reagan had initially publicly denied selling weapons to Iran, he later admitted that the weapons had been sold to secure the hostages’ release.</p><p>Around the same time, the US Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted US involvement in foreign countries and banned US funding for the Contras. To get around this, members of the National Security Council diverted profits from the Iran arms sales to fund the Contras without congressional approval.</p><p>In his 1998 book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion, US investigative journalist Gary Webb traced links between Contra supporters and the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles.</p><p>Webb wrote that a group affiliated with the Contras smuggled cocaine into the US, which was then sold as crack cocaine in Los Angeles – ultimately triggering the epidemic. The funds generated were then used to support the Contras. Webb claimed that the CIA knew about these transactions and backed them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149777\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149777\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-882017752-1764840815.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of Boston Feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4149777\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boston feminists march outside the office of the Central Intelligence Agency on Winter Street in Boston to protest against the war in Nicaragua on March 2, 1986 [Tom Landers/The Boston Globe via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-1980s-during-the-manuel-noriega-era\">1970s-1980s: During the Manuel Noriega era</h2><p>Manuel Noriega was a military dictator who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989.</p><p>Noriega had been a CIA informant and asset since the 1960s.

Putin’s aide Yury Ushakov had earlier said several documents were being discussed.</p><p>Paraphrasing Putin’s comments to India Today, Tass said the 28-point plan was “still valid and being discussed” and based on agreements reached during the Russia-US summit in <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/no-deal-at-trump-putin-meeting-key-takeaways-from-alaska-summit\">Alaska</a> in August.</p><p>“They just broke these 28 or 27 points into four packages. And they proposed discussing these four packages with us. But, in effect, they are the same [points],” Putin said, according to Tass.</p><p>Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said Moscow was unlikely to move on its “red lines”. “According to Putin, until Russia’s interests are respected, the country won’t sign any agreements, and will reach its goals on the battlefield,” she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Kyiv, senior correspondent Jonah Hull said there had been “a breakdown based on a clash of red lines that are, at this point, insurmountable”. He described the recent rounds of talks, which have seen the US moving between parties, as a sort of “round Robin of ‘It’s not us, it’s them'”.</p><p>“Here in Ukraine, the government does view this process as a valuable one,” he said. “They think it can lead to results if it’s allowed to run its course now that Ukraine’s interests have been heard and included, and as long as pressure is kept on Russia.”</p><p> </p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"attacks-continue\">Russian attacks continue</h2><p>Russian attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine continued overnight into Thursday.</p><p>A ballistic missile struck Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday night, injuring six people, including a three-year-old girl, according to city administration head Oleksandr Vilkul.</p><p>Vilkul said the attack damaged more than 40 residential buildings, a school and domestic gas pipes in the city, Zelenskyy’s hometown.</p><p>A six-year-old girl died in Kherson, a southern port city, after Russian artillery shelling injured her the previous day.</p><p>Russia also struck Odesa with drones, injuring eight people, while civilian and energy infrastructure was damaged, said the head of the regional military administration, Oleh Kiper.</p><p>On Thursday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of disrupting peace talks with attacks on oil tankers in the Black Sea and on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal in Novorossiysk.</p><p>Russia currently controls 19.2 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, all of Luhansk, more than 80 percent of Donetsk, about 75 percent of Kherson and Zaporizhia, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Ukraine’s army chief said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops continued to hold the northern part of the key city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.</p><p>About 5,000sq km (1,900sq miles) of Donetsk remains under Ukrainian control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"376\" data-end=\"814\">In Gaza, the world has seen the cost of a diplomacy that claims to uphold a rules-based order but applies it selectively. The United States intervened late, and only to defend an occupation the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled illegal. Alongside other Western nations that built multilateral institutions, the US increasingly pursues nationalist agendas that undermine them. The hypocrisy is stark: one set of rules for Ukraine, another for Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"816\" data-end=\"986\">This erosion of credibility marks the structural collapse of unipolar authority, symbolised by the US’s absence from the Group of 20 (G20) in South Africa this past week.</p><p data-start=\"988\" data-end=\"1379\">As thousands gather in Qatar over the coming days for this year’s Doha Forum under the theme “Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress”, the failure to prevent genocide demands a reckoning. The imposed ceasefire in Gaza has delivered neither political resolution nor safety for Palestinians. Meanwhile, the future of Gaza continues to be discussed without Palestinians in the room.</p><p data-start=\"1381\" data-end=\"1843\">This is not an unusual scene. Since the Cold War, international diplomacy has operated on what might be called the master-key model, where one powerful actor unlocks a conflict through political leverage, economic pressure, or conditional aid. Around it grew an entire ecosystem: humanitarian organisations, think tanks, mediators, and consulting firms, often funded by Western states, reinforcing the belief that a call to Washington could solve any crisis.</p><p data-start=\"1845\" data-end=\"2166\">The ceasefire in Gaza shows that the master key can still turn the lock. The US exerted its influence, and the humanitarian community fell in line to deliver dividends on the deal. A Civil-Military Coordination Center has been set up by the US military to coordinate the delivery of aid and reconstruction.</p><p data-start=\"2168\" data-end=\"2602\">States have hailed this flawed agreement as a breakthrough. Yet the fact that this master key was used only after two years of total destruction – despite extensive humanitarian diplomacy, and in a way that entrenches an illegal occupation – exposes the moral bankruptcy of real estate diplomacy, most clearly embodied by the transactional approach taken by the current US administration, which ultimately advances a settler-colonial logic.</p><p data-start=\"2604\" data-end=\"2883\">We are living through what Antonio Gramsci, writing from his imprisonment by fascists in the 1930s, called an interregnum, when “the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born”. In that void, the “morbid symptoms” of resurgent fascism and ethno-nationalism emerge.</p><p data-start=\"2885\" data-end=\"3101\">So what remains when a superpower refuses to turn the lock? A world that is no longer unipolar but multipolar is messy and contested, requiring a new approach for those seeking to influence the outcomes of conflicts.</p><p data-start=\"3103\" data-end=\"3323\">The age of singular leverage is fading, and institutions built for the 20th century cling to outdated maps. As Western power turns inward, those who built their credibility on proximity to it face a crisis of legitimacy.</p><p data-start=\"3325\" data-end=\"3814\">The United Nations has struggled to assert influence in this shifting landscape, constrained by the politics of its funders and the erosion of trust among affected populations. Yet this transition offers the UN a rare opportunity to renew its legitimacy by aligning with emerging powers, embracing regional partnerships, and championing the equitable application of international law. If it adapts, it could serve as a bridge between the old order and the new. If it does not, it dies.</p><p data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"4409\">Amid this transformation, new centres of gravity are emerging in the pursuit of meaningful peace and security. In Doha, a mediation hub has taken shape. Qatar has leveraged its unique political position and diplomatic agility to broker dialogue where traditional power has faltered. Its open channels with actors across divides have made Doha an indispensable node in the global architecture of conflict resolution — even for its critics. South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice and the Hague Group show how legitimacy is shifting — a shift forged in the ruins of a genocide.</p><p>Out of this could emerge a new form of political leverage, created through broader alliances and an insistence on accountability rather than dominance and co-option. As the Doha Forum theme suggests, it is a call to move “Beyond Promises to Progress” by putting “Justice in Action.”</p><p data-start=\"4578\" data-end=\"5047\">However, when nations overwhelmingly voted this month for the UN Security Council resolution endorsing the US plan for Gaza, it demonstrated the fragility of this emerging order. States bowed to American pressure, according to diplomats familiar with the negotiations, proving that economic interests still supersede a resurgent decolonial movement. It was a reminder that multipolarity is not a guarantee of justice; it is only a redistribution of influence.</p><p data-start=\"5049\" data-end=\"5567\">It does not have to be this way. The Global South can be a geopolitical bloc that builds its own negotiating tables and sets its own terms. The growing assertiveness of the BRICS coalition of economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), and the diplomatic independence of some Latin American governments, already demonstrated this possibility. Ignoring this is ignoring the future. At the recent BRICS summit in August 2025, member states reiterated their push for a multipolar order, challenging the longstanding dominance of Western capitals in international diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"5569\" data-end=\"6155\">Diplomacy, whether conducted by states, multilateral institutions, or those who support them, must evolve beyond the logic of the master key. It needs a craft built on ideological honesty and pragmatic engagement. This means confronting asymmetries of modern conflict, rejecting the blanket labelling of entire movements as “terrorist”, and recognising the legitimacy of diverse power structures. Pragmatic engagement requires readiness for multi-door dialogue and engagement with the actors who actually hold power — including regional alliances, armed groups, and civic movements.</p><p data-start=\"6157\" data-end=\"6457\">Those clinging to a single, crude key will be left behind. Palestinians — and others who have suffered under a unipolar order — will not miss them. The future of peacemaking belongs to those who carry many keys and know which door to open, and when. The age of the master key is coming to an end.</p><p data-start=\"6157\" data-end=\"6457\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Palestinian Mohammed Dahman, from Gaza, served nearly 20 years in Israeli jails when he was younger. This powerful observational film follows Mohammed and his daughter, Mai, as they confront the emotional scars left by his years of absence, both in jail and as a political activist. Now living in Norway, Mohammed fears growing old far from Gaza and sets out to retrieve the prison letters he once sent home, hoping they might help repair his strained relationship with Mai. His visit back to Gaza stirs memories of political struggle, friendship and sacrifice, while Mai in Norway grapples with the resentment of a childhood without him. When he finally returns, father and daughter face the painful truths of the past as they read the letters together – moments of love, regret and longing preserved on paper. Their story culminates in a quiet but hopeful attempt at reconciliation, captured in the small, tender moments of family life.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 4 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">4 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"
