Such reforms, it notes, could significantly lift the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $340bn in 2024.</p><p>“Based on cross-country analysis of the reform experience of emerging markets, IMF analysis projects that Pakistan could generate between a 5 to 6.5 percent increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years,” the report said.</p><p>Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised the Pakistani government on economic reforms, said that he agreed that the absence of accountability in corruption cases was eating away at the country’s economic potential.</p><p>“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Here is what we know about the IMF report, the areas of weakness it highlights, the policy recommendations it makes, and what the experts say.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-imf-report-say\">What does the IMF report say?</h2><p>Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958, making it one of the fund’s most frequent borrowers. Nearly every administration, whether military or civilian, has sought IMF assistance, reflecting chronic balance of payments crises.</p><p>The current programme was started under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120677\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120677\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120677\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2023-06-22T080320Z_82335222_RC28O1A3QFP9_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-ECONOMY-IMF-1763683375.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C618&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif meets with managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, in Paris, France June 22, 2023.

Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.</p><p>At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.</p><p>The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.</p><p>These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.</p><p>Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.</p><p>He pointed to the <a href=\"/news/2021/4/13/elite-privilege-consumes-17-4bn-of-pakistans-economy-undp\">2021 UNDP report</a> and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”</p><p>“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p><p>It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).</p><p>The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.</p><p>The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.</p><p>Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.</p><p>“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"judiciary-and-rule-of-law\">Judiciary and rule of law</h2><p>The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.</p><p>The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.</p><p>Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.</p><p>The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.</p><p>While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.</p><p>The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.</p><h2 id=\"was-the-report-necessary\">Was the report necessary?</h2><p>The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.</p><p>Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.</p><p>Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.</p><p>He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.</p><p>“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.</p><p>Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.</p><p>“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120683\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120683\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP22154336836269-1763683560.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani rickshaw drivers chant slogans during a protest against the recent increasing in petrol prices, Friday, June 3, 2022.

The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.</p><p>Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.</p><p>“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.</p><p>Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.</p><p>“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.</p><p>For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.</p><p>He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.</p><p>“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.</p><p>For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.</p><p>“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”</p><p>“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” he wrote on Truth Social.</li>\n<li>A senior official told the AFP news agency that the US pressed Ukraine to accept the deal in Geneva, despite Kyiv’s protests that the plan conceded too much to Moscow. The official said Washington did not directly threaten to cut off aid if Kyiv rejected its deal, but that Ukraine understood this was a distinct possibility.</li>\n<li>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that there is no meeting scheduled between Trump and Zelenskyy this week amid reports of a possible trip by the Ukrainian leader to the US capital.</li>\n<li>Leavitt told US broadcaster Fox News that “a couple of points of disagreement” remain between the US and Ukraine on a potential deal to end Russia’s invasion.</li>\n<li>Leavitt also pushed back against criticism, including from within Trump’s Republican Party, that the president is favouring Russia in efforts to end the war in Ukraine, describing those statements as “complete and total fallacy”. She said the US president was “hopeful and optimistic” that a plan could be worked out.</li>\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would wait to see how talks between the US and Ukraine on a potential peace plan pan out, and would not be commenting on media reports about such a serious and complex issue.</li>\n<li>But Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said that a European counter-proposal to a US 28-point peace plan for Ukraine was “not constructive” and that it simply did not work for Moscow.</li>\n<li>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">more work to do</a> to establish a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine, but added that progress was being made.</li>\n<li>Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, too, welcomed progress made at the meetings in Geneva, but added that major issues remain to be resolved.</li>\n<li>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said no deal regarding Ukraine can be allowed to undermine the security of Poland and Europe; on the contrary, it should strengthen it.</li>\n<li>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that the talks in Geneva on amending Trump’s 28-point plan to end the war with Russia had produced a “decisive success” for Europeans. Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said that to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine, its borders can’t be changed by force and there can’t be limitations on Ukraine’s military that would invite further Russian aggression.</li>\n<li>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Russia’s Vladimir Putin in a phone call that Ankara will contribute to any diplomatic effort to facilitate direct contact between Russia and Ukraine and to reach a “just and lasting” peace, his office said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Fighting</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces launched drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, targeting energy infrastructure, and killing at least one person and wounding seven others.</li>\n<li>The Russian TASS news agency, citing local officials, reported on Tuesday that the death toll from a Ukrainian attack on the Rostov region has risen to three. The overnight attack targeted the Taganrog and Neklinovsky districts, it said.</li>\n<li>Officials in Russia’s Krasnodar border region said on Tuesday that they were assessing the damage after a “massive” Ukrainian attack that wounded at least six people and damaged some 20 homes.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said the country’s air defences shot down 10 drones en route to Moscow, a day after a Ukrainian strike on a power plant cut off heating in a town near the capital. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said emergency services were clearing up sites where debris from drones had fallen.</li>\n<li>The Defence Ministry added that a total of 50 Ukrainian drones were downed across the Moscow, Bryansk, Kaluga and Kursk regions, as well as Crimea and over the waters of the Black Sea.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Polish prosecutors have arrested and charged a third Ukrainian man suspected of collaborating with Russia to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/poland-blames-two-ukrainians-allegedly-working-for-russia-for-railway-blast\">sabotage a rail track</a>, authorities said. Two other Ukrainians, who fled to Belarus, had already been charged in absentia over the blast on the Warsaw-Lublin line connecting Warsaw to the Ukrainian border.</li>\n<li>Two young street musicians who were jailed for more than a month in Russia for singing anti-Kremlin songs have left the country after being released from detention, according to Russian media reports. Vocalist Diana Loginova, 18, and guitarist Alexander Orlov, 22, were detained on October 15 in central St Petersburg after an impromptu street performance deemed critical of Putin and the government.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Oil prices climbed about 1 percent on mounting doubts about whether Russia will get a peace deal with Ukraine that will boost Moscow’s oil exports. Brent futures rose 81 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $63.37 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 78 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $58.84.</li>\n<li>Four opposition Democratic US senators, including Elizabeth Warren, said that the lax enforcement by the Trump administration of sanctions on Russia’s Arctic LNG 2 export terminal has allowed China to buy discounted liquefied natural gas and has helped Moscow fund the war in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>A heating and power plant in Russia’s Moscow region has resumed operations after shutting down due to a fire caused by a Ukrainian drone strike on Sunday, regional governor Andrei Vorobyov said.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Black Sea port of Tuapse resumed oil product exports last week after a two-week suspension following Ukrainian drone attacks, while the local oil refinery has restarted processing crude, the Reuters news agency reported, citing industry sources and data.</li>\n<li>Russian state oil and gas revenue may fall in November by about 35 percent from the corresponding month in 2024 to 520 billion roubles ($6.59bn) due to cheaper oil and a stronger local currency, according to calculations and analysis by Reuters.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.</p><p>“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.</p><p>Trump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.</p><p>A formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner.

The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”</p><p>But he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.</p><p>Recently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.</p><p>CAIR has sued <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation\">the governor’s office</a> in response.</p><p>Analysts say Trump’s order was aimed at pandering to domestic audiences, and the threat of a terrorism designation means very little to the Middle East.</p><p>“It’s very amateurish foreign policy, but it appeals to the right-wing zealots in the US and Israel,” said Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut.</p><p>He noted that the order comes as the US tries “desperately to make progress” on the ceasefire in Gaza, which “the Israelis largely ignore, and Hamas largely adheres to”.</p><p>The White House wants to “keep showing that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to fight terrorism and bring peace and a happy, good life for all. This is, of course, fantasy,” Khouri said from the US city of Boston.</p><p>“I don’t think many people take it seriously. It’s not aimed at the Middle East. It’s aimed at domestic television audiences in the US and donors who provide the Republican Party with support, and the Republican Party is haemorrhaging support now because of its various and ineffective policies,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For instance, the United Nations recently calculated that more than 40 percent of African governments spend more on servicing debt than they do on healthcare.</p><p>Africa also faces high borrowing costs. In 2023, bond yields – the interest on government debt – averaged 6.8 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 9.8 percent in Africa.</p><p>Meanwhile, Africa collectively needs $143bn every year in climate finance to meet its Paris Agreement goals. In 2022, it received approximately $44bn.</p><p>At the same time, countries on the continent spent almost $90bn servicing external debt in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-progress\">No progress</h2><p>Shortly before the release of the G20’s final communique, 165 charities condemned the group’s slow progress on debt sustainability and urged President Ramaphosa to implement reforms before transferring the G20 presidency over to the US in December.</p><p>“While this year’s G20 has been put forward as an ‘African G20’, there is no evidence that any progress has been made on the debt crisis facing Africa and many other countries worldwide during the South African presidency,” the group said in a letter.</p><p>The missive called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell its gold reserves and set up a debt relief fund for distressed governments. It also backed the creation of a ‘<a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/8/why-the-global-south-needs-a-borrowers-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">borrowers club</a>’ to facilitate cooperation among low-income countries.</p><p>The call for a unified debtor body reflects growing frustration with existing frameworks, notably the Paris Club, in which mostly Western governments, but not China, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies of debtor nations.</p><p>In May 2020, the G20 launched a multibillion-dollar repayment pause to help poor countries cope with the COVID‑19 crisis. Known as the <a href=\"/news/2020/10/12/world-bank-g20-may-agree-to-only-6-month-debt-relief-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debt Service Suspension Initiative</a>, the programme is continuing to provide relief to some participating countries.</p><p>The launch of the Common Framework, soon afterwards, was designed to coordinate debt relief among all creditors. At the time, the initiative was hailed as a breakthrough, bringing together the Paris Club, China and private creditors to help prevent a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries.</p><p>But coordinating equal treatment, including government lenders, commercial banks, and bondholders, has made the process slow and prone to setbacks.</p><p>To date, none of the countries that joined the Common Framework – Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, and Chad – have completed their debt restructuring deals.</p><p>And even then, the programme has relieved just 7 percent of the debt costs for the four participating nations, according to ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.</p><h2 id=\"outmanoeuvred\">‘Outmanoeuvred’</h2><p>In March, South Africa convened an expert panel – headed by a former finance minister and a former Kenyan central banker – to explore how to assist heavily indebted low-income countries, particularly in Africa.</p><p>In a report released earlier this month, the panel echoed many of the ideas put forward by the 165 charities that wrote to Ramaphosa in October, calling for measures like an IMF-backed special debt fund and the formation of a debtors’ club.</p><p>But the experts’ proposals “weren’t even acknowledged at the leaders’ summit”, Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, told Al Jazeera. He said that the G20 presidency “failed to address the scale of the global debt problem”.</p><p>“Ultimately,” Gallagher added, “South Africa was outmanoeuvred by larger, more economically important members of the G20 who saw little benefit to themselves in reforming the international financial architecture on debt.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"double-whammy-of-debt\">‘Double whammy’ of debt</h2><p>In the early 2000s, the IMF, World Bank and some Paris Club creditors cancelled more than $75bn of debt – roughly 40 percent of external obligations – under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.</p><p>Since then, however, many developing countries have slipped back into the red. After the 2008 financial crisis, private creditors poured money into low-income economies, steadily replacing the cheaper loans once offered by institutions like the World Bank.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, almost 40 percent of external public debt repayments from lower-income countries went to commercial lenders. Just one-third went to multilateral institutions, according to <a href=\"https://debtjustice.org.uk/press-release/debt-payments-to-private-lenders-three-times-higher-than-to-china?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Debt Justice</a>, a United Kingdom-based charity.</p><p>China has also emerged as the world’s largest single creditor, especially in the Global South, committing more than $472bn through its policy banks – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank – between 2008 and 2024.</p><p>“On top of debt becoming more expensive over the past 10 or 15 years, there is now a wider universe of lenders that developing countries have turned to,” says Iolanda Fresnillo, a policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad, a civil society organisation.</p><p>“It’s been a double whammy. Debt is now costlier and harder to resolve,” she said, noting the difficulty of coordinating creditors in a restructuring. Protracted debt crises slow growth by squeezing public investment.</p><p>Overcoming these hurdles is made harder when creditors pursue competing commercial interests. Fresnillo says an independent debt-restructuring body, designed to shorten negotiation times and limit economic costs, could help.</p><p>In September, the head of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan, said, “There is no permanent institution or system that is there all the time dealing with debt restructuring … maybe we can create new momentum.”</p><p>However, talk of an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism isn’t new. The IMF spearheaded a push for a neutral body – which would be akin to a US bankruptcy court – in the late 1990s.</p><p>The Fund’s proposed restructuring mechanism faced swift pushback. Major creditor countries, particularly the US, opposed ceding power to an international body that could override its legal system and weaken protections for US investors.</p><p>Still, “the need for this type of international solution is obvious”, says Fresnillo. “Having a basic set of rules, as opposed to an ad hoc negotiation for every new debt crisis, should be a bare minimum.”</p><p>She added that “adopting a global standard on <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taxing transnational corporations</a> could also guarantee a baseline of revenues for low-income countries. But with multilateral cooperation so weak right now, I wouldn’t hold my breath.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

You can refuse illegal orders,” they said in the video.</p><p>The Pentagon stressed that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) — which spells out military laws and guidelines — service members have a legal obligation to “obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful”.</p><p>“A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it wrote in Monday’s statement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/us-sells-700m-nasams-missile-system-to-taiwan\">The Pentagon</a> added that Kelly could face recall “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures”.</p><p>Retired military personnel who continue to receive benefits after their service remain subject to military law, according to the UCMJ.</p><p>But it is rare for military courts to prosecute former service members, especially for alleged offences committed after their tenure.</p><p>In recent days, Democrats have expressed outrage over Trump’s response to the lawmakers’ videos, which they say amounts to a death threat.</p><p>Democrats have also argued that the video simply reaffirms a fact of military law: Service members are required to refuse orders they know to be in violation of the US law, as part of their oath to the Constitution.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Charlie Kirk</a> in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.</p><p>Trump first invoked the death penalty on Thursday, sparking a firestorm of criticism. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>Despite the outrage, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/trump-again-slams-democrats-who-urged-us-troops-to-refuse-illegal-orders\">Trump doubled down</a> on his stance late on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the legislators who released the video “SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW”.</p><p>The Pentagon’s move on Monday signals that federal agencies, led by Trump appointees, are willing to respond to the president’s political grievances.</p><p>The Department of Justice pursued criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey in now-dismissed cases that critics say were political.</p><p>Comey was charged with lying to Congress, while James was facing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally\">mortgage fraud accusations</a>.</p><p>Later on Monday, the White House expressed support for the Pentagon’s investigation of Kelly. “You can’t have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks.

And it is our position that Lindsey Halligan is extremely qualified for this position – but more importantly, was legally appointed to it.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, also said that an appeal by the Justice Department was “almost certain”.</p><p>“But for the moment, this is a victory for James Comey and also a victory for Letitia James, and a defeat for Donald Trump and his Department of Justice”.</p><h2 id=\"a-controversial-choice-as-prosecutor\">A controversial choice as prosecutor</h2><p>Halligan had been appointed in September to serve as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>Trump had a public falling-out with Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to file charges against James due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>That triggered outrage in the White House. Siebert announced his resignation on September 19, and the following day, Trump took to social media to declare that he had fired the prosecutor himself.</p><p>“He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”</p><p>The president also addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi in the message, saying that the Department of Justice needed to move forward with charges against James, Comey and a US senator, Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote.</p><p>He urged Bondi to act immediately to secure indictments, signalling that Halligan would help.</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p><p>Before her appointment, Halligan had no prosecutorial experience, and her background was largely in insurance law. Previously, she served as a personal lawyer to Trump.</p><p>Within days of taking up her role as US attorney, Halligan had secured <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/ex-fbi-director-comey-says-he-is-innocent-after-us-court-indictment\">an indictment against Comey</a> for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a Senate proceeding.</p><p>Then, on October 6, Halligan unveiled a second indictment against James, accusing her of mortgage fraud.</p><p>A third indictment arrived on October 16, this time against Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.</p><p>All three have denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges were acts of political retribution. Comey, James and Bolton have all criticised Trump publicly, and James even successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump in New York state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"comey-james-seek-dismissal\">Comey, James seek dismissal</h2><p>Lawyers for the defendants have explored multiple channels to have the cases dismissed before trial.</p><p>On November 13, Judge Currie heard opening arguments in one petition brought by James and Comey.</p><p>They asserted that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid, since she did not have judicial approval.</p><p>Normally, interim US attorneys may only stay in the position for a span of 120 days. After that period, federal judges in the district may decide who fills the role.</p><p>Siebert had served for a 120-day period and had gotten judicial permission to continue as acting US attorney until the Senate could confirm a permanent occupant for the role.</p><p>But Halligan did not have the judges’ approval. That made her appointment as US attorney illegal, according to lawyers for Comey and James.</p><p>Lawyers for the Justice Department, however, argued that the issue amounted to a mere “paperwork error” – and that Attorney General Bondi had signed off on the indictments.</p><p>Still, the hearings in Currie’s courtroom raised serious questions about the validity of the indictments.</p><p>Currie raised concerns that the grand jury transcript in Comey’s case was incomplete, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment\">an issue later echoed</a> by Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in a separate ruling on November 17.</p><p>He said the records indicate “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”, including misleading statements from the prosecutor and the use of an unrelated search warrant. He also pointed out that it seemed the final indictment against Comey had never been fully presented to the grand jury, as required.</p><p>In another courtroom last week, overseen by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/justice-department-admits-grand-jury-did-not-review-final-comey-indictment\">Justice Department acknowledged</a> that it had indeed failed to give the grand jury a chance to review the final Comey indictment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Another 236 applications from Myanmar were pending as of November 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce immigration into the US.</p><p>It has therefore attempted to rescind Temporary Protected Status for several groups, including citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela and other countries facing instability.</p><p>Just last Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115590786862216464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on his platform Truth Social that he was “hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota”, accusing gangs of Somali nationals of “terrorizing” the state.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Legal experts, however, question whether a president can revoke Temporary Protected Status from a specific group in a specific state. Some have accused Trump of attempting to intimidate immigrants, in order to force them to leave the country.</p><p>Under Trump, the federal government has also restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">its cap on refugee admissions to 7,500</a>, a historic low.</p><p>In addition, the Trump administration has sought to strip hundreds of thousands of immigrants of another temporary protection called “humanitarian parole”. That programme allows immigrants to come into the country on a short-term basis due to emergency situations or humanitarian concerns.</p><p>Several of those efforts face ongoing legal challenges. So far, however, the Supreme Court has largely sided with the Trump administration.</p><p>In an unsigned May 30 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1079_p86b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a>, for instance, a majority on the high court lifted a lower court’s ruling that had barred the Department of Homeland Security from ending humanitarian parole for nearly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.</p><p>Two left-leaning justices — Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor — issued a dissent, warning that removing the pause would cause great harm to US immigrants while the legal challenge proceeds.</p><p>The decision, Brown Jackson wrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unrest-in-myanmar\">Unrest in Myanmar</h2><p>In the case of Myanmar, the Department of State has issued a level-four travel advisory — the highest tier — warning against transit through the country.</p><p>It cited the risk of “armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions”.</p><p>In February 2021, the military toppled the government of President Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country has grappled with civil war ever since, marking the latest chapter in a nearly eight decades of internal unrest.</p><p>The military leadership is locked in a fight with members of the exiled government as well as armed ethnic groups and civilian opposition groups.</p><p>It has led a campaign of heavy air strikes, some of which reportedly targeted schools and hospitals. Both rebels and soldiers have been accused of human rights abuses, including torture.</p><p>The United Nations estimates the long-running conflict has created nearly 1,585,298 asylum seekers and refugees as of October, with many seeking protection in nearby countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.</p><p>Members of the persecuted Rohingya ethnic group have been rendered stateless amid the fighting.</p><p>Citizens from Myanmar were initially given Temporary Protected Status in the US under former President Joe Biden in May 2021.</p><p>The administration then extended the protection designation twice: once in September 2022 and again in May 2024. The latest 18-month extension was slated to expire on Tuesday, November 25.</p><p>The termination of the Temporary Protected Status will take effect 60 days after the Federal Register notice is officially published.</p><p>In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Noem had deemed conditions in the country sufficiently safe for its citizens to return.</p><p>“Burma [Myanmar] continues to face humanitarian challenges due in part to continued military operations against armed resistance and the need for humanitarian assistance,” the notice said.</p><p>“There have, however, been improvements in Burma’s governance and stability at the national and local levels.”</p><p>The notice added that allowing Myanmar citizens to stay ran “contrary to the U.S. national interest”.</p><p>In March, the Department of Homeland Security told Congress that 9,590 Myanmar citizens were eligible for the protection, but had yet to apply.</p><p>Just this month, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/21-dead-search-continues-after-refugee-boat-sinks-near-malaysia-thailand\">another boat sank off</a> the Myanmar shore, as Rohingya refugees attempted to flee to safety.

And he can reward or punish reporters with access in these cases in the same way he does in granting interviews, Trump’s team argued.</p><p>The AP says that if journalists are invited to cover an event on a pool basis – such as last week when the president had meetings in the Oval Office with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani – the Trump administration cannot discriminate on the basis of a news organisation’s freedom of speech.</p><p>“The First Amendment does not stop at the Oval Office door,” said Charles Tobin, the lawyer representing the AP.</p><p>Since the dispute began, the White House has given Associated Press writers sporadic access to limited-space events at the White House. AP photographers have received much more frequent access. Tobin argued the White House has hurt the AP’s business with its new policy; for years, AP journalists had been virtually always included in these pool events.</p><p>But in its brief supporting its own position, the administration said that “to the extent that the AP built a business model that depended on the assumption that it would maintain this favored-nation status in perpetuity, that is hardly the government’s fault.”</p><p>The AP reports and produces for thousands of news outlets and other organisations around the world.</p><p>Tobin made his argument before three judges who illustrated that the AP faces an uphill battle in this fight, despite the lower court ruling. Two of them, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, are Trump appointees who voted against the AP as part of a separate appellate panel this past spring. And they expressed scepticism Monday about how a rule could be put in place that satisfies the outlet’s concerns.</p><p>“You would eventually need an injunction against the president for this to work, don’t you?” Rao asked him. It’s extremely rare for a judge to issue an injunction against a president; they generally act against people who work for the chief executive.</p><p>“How would we decide what’s a ‘pool’ event and an individual journalist’s event?” Rao asked.</p><p>Yaakov Roth, the principal deputy assistant attorney general arguing for the Trump administration, also wondered about rules put in place limiting a president’s ability to invite people to see him at the White House. “Nobody is going to come up here and say that the president has to invite equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats to the White House Christmas party,” he said.</p><p>Roth was questioned by the third judge on the panel, Robert Wilkins, who asked if the administration could bar a group of citizens from Kansas who had bought tickets to tour the White House if a Trump appointee discovered one of them had posted something on social media critical of the president.</p><p>“Woe to the public,” said Wilkins, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.</p><p>Julie Pace, AP’s executive editor, wrote in an op-ed piece published Monday morning that the question of access is not just about AP; it’s about people’s access to the government that works for them.</p><p>“When we talk about press freedom, we are really talking about your freedom. Reporters ask questions, photographers take pictures, and video journalists record history on your behalf to ensure that you are informed about the things you don’t have the time to unearth, watch or learn about for yourself,” Pace wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Letting the government control which journalists can cover the highest office in the land and setting rules about what those journalists can say or write is a direct attempt to undercut the First Amendment,” Pace wrote. “It should worry all of us.”</p><p>The Trump administration says it is up to the White House, not the press, to make decisions about access to areas where space is limited. The White House Correspondents’ Association had been deciding who is in the press pools since the 1953-61 administration of President Dwight Eisenhower. The White House reset that tradition in February, saying it wanted to broaden access to include other news outlets.</p><p>“If the AP means to suggest that the White House lacks authority to limit who may engage in news gathering activities from sensitive areas of the White House, it is legally mistaken,” the administration said in its supporting brief.</p><p>A lower court ruled this spring that the government couldn’t retaliate against a news organisation for its speech, but the appeals court halted any response to the ruling until an appeal takes place.</p><p>AP style also recommends acknowledging Trump’s renaming of the Gulf. The president said that AP’s access would remain restricted until it changed its style.</p><p>Nearly four dozen press organisations, and news outlets from ProPublica to Fox News Channel, along with The New York Times and The Washington Post, filed a brief in support of the AP.</p><p>“When any news outlet is chilled … the press and the public as a whole lose out, no matter how many reporters or cameras remain in the room,” the outlets said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
