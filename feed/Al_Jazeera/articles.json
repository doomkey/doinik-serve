I will speak to everyone so long as it could stand to benefit an economic agenda for New Yorkers. And that’s where I will always make the case.”</p><p>Trump, a Republican, has been a vocal critic of Mamdani, often falsely calling him a “communist”.

However, following the fall of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel violated a 1974 agreement and again invaded its neighbour’s territory, occupying more land along the border as part of a “buffer zone”, including the strategically vital summit of Mount Hermon.</p><p>Israel was already bombing Syria before the fall of al-Assad, an ally of its regional enemy Iran. But instead of seeking to start on a new path with Syria, Israel has doubled down on its bombing campaign and increased the number of strikes this year, including in the capital Damascus, leading to the deaths of several Syrian soldiers and hitting the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>After the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">visit earlier this month</a> of Syria’s new President Ahmed al-Sharaa to Israel’s key ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, hopes were high that an agreement could be reached. Al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/talks-with-israel-could-lead-to-result-in-days-says-syrias-al-sharaa\">has previously confirmed</a> that direct talks with Israel were under way to secure a permanent settlement.</p><p>But earlier this week, Israel’s Kan broadcaster quoted an unnamed Israeli government official as saying the talks were at a dead end. So what went wrong and why? And does Netanyahu’s trip to the occupied Syrian territory signal that he has no intention to make a deal?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-israel-doing-in-syria\">What is Israel doing in Syria?</h2><p>When Israel’s tanks first entered Syria in December 2024, it <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/not-just-about-the-druze-israels-rationale-for-its-attacks-on-syria\">expanded</a> its territorial footprint within Syria by around 400 square kilometres (155 sq miles), including Mount Hermon, which offers a vantage point over southern Syria and northern Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu described the incursion as a “temporary defensive position”. However, as time has worn on, both Israel’s position on the Golan Heights and its rhetoric have grown more entrenched, with Defence Minister Israel Katz saying in March that Israel would continue its occupation of parts of Syria for an “unlimited amount of time”.</p><p>Israel has also chosen to position itself as the defender of the Druze and Kurdish ethnic minorities against a government it has attempted to paint as “extremist”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-did-talks-break-down\">Why did talks break down?</h2><p>Neither government has issued a statement on why the talks have stalled.</p><p>However, citing anonymous government sources, Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, has claimed that talks broke down after Israel refused to withdraw its troops from Syrian territory without what it called a “comprehensive peace agreement”.</p><p>Details of what Israel might mean by a “comprehensive peace agreement” aren’t clear.</p><p>In September, leaked reports suggested that, as part of any peace agreement, Israel was demanding that Syria establish a demilitarised zone southwest of Damascus all the way up to the border with Israel. This would encompass a vast territory, including the governorates of Suwayda, Deraa, and Quneitra.</p><p>In return, Israel would gradually withdraw its forces from Syrian territory, apart from those on the summit of Mount Hermon.</p><p>But since then, it appears that Israel has hardened its stance, and reports in Israeli media indicate that the government’s position is that it will not withdraw from territory seized since December without a full peace deal with Syria – which is not on the table.</p><p>The news agency Reuters also reported that, at the last minute, Israel requested what negotiators termed a “humanitarian corridor”, allowing access between Israel and the heavily Druze populated southern governorate of Syria’s Suwayda.</p><p>According to one source, a central principle of the Israeli proposal was maintaining an aerial corridor to Iran via Syria, which would allow for future Israeli strikes on Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-why-did-netanyahu-and-others-visit-the-buffer-zone\">So, why did Netanyahu and others visit the buffer zone?</h2><p>Netanyahu told Israeli troops that their presence within Syrian territory was of “immense importance”, adding that their purpose there was vital in “safeguarding our Druze allies”, he said.</p><p>Syria’s Druze minority provided a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/not-just-about-the-druze-israels-rationale-for-its-attacks-on-syria\">pretext</a> for Israel’s last deployment to Syria in July, when Israel was accused of using the conflict between the group and local Bedouins to empower minority factions within the country as rival power centres to the recognised government in Damascus.</p><p>Expanding buffer zones with neighbouring states ahead of opening diplomatic channels or contributing towards reconstruction following the often devastating attacks by its military forces appears to have become a central tenet of Israel’s regional strategy.</p><p>In Gaza, where Israel has killed almost <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/20/live-israel-bombs-house-in-southern-gaza-kills-at-least-3-palestinians\">70,000</a> Palestinians, Israel is seeking to establish an extensive <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/map-of-gaza-shows-where-israeli-forces-are-positioned-under-ceasefire-deal\">buffer zone</a> as part of the US-imposed stabilisation deal that would reduce the already drastically limited space available to the enclave’s post-war population even further.</p><p>In Lebanon, where it killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/un-peacekeepers-say-israel-built-walls-inside-lebanese-territory\">4,000</a> people during its invasion of October 2024, Israel has been accused of laying the groundwork to create a buffer zone within Lebanese territory, similar to that it is trying to establish in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-did-syria-and-others-say-about-the-visit\">What did Syria and others say about the visit?</h2><p>The Syrian Foreign Ministry branded the visit “illegitimate” and “a grave violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p><p>“This visit represents a new attempt to impose a fait accompli that contradicts relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and falls within the occupation’s policies aimed at entrenching its aggression and continuing its violations of Syrian territory,” a ministry statement read.</p><p>Other nations, including Jordan, France and Qatar, have also condemned the Israeli prime minister’s visit, branding it a threat to regional stability.</p><p>In the UN, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/syria-condemns-israeli-pm-netanyahus-illegal-visit-to-seized-territory\">critical</a> of what he called Netanyahu’s “very public visit”, adding that it was “concerning, to say the least”.</p><p>Dujarric noted that UN Resolution 2799, recently passed by the UN Security Council, “called for the full sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-might-this-affect-negotiations\">How might this affect negotiations?</h2><p>It looks to have set them back and, to a degree, left Israel isolated.</p><p>On Wednesday, a senior UN official urged Israel to halt its activity in the occupied Golan Heights, cautioning that its actions were stoking regional tensions.</p><p>Najat Rochdi, the UN deputy special envoy for Syria, told the UN Security Council that Israel’s operations were weakening the 1974 agreement establishing the buffer zone.</p><p>“I received a strong appeal from [Syria’s] Foreign Minister [Asaad] al-Shaibani for the UN to act to put an end to these violations,” she said, urging the UN Security Council to assume its responsibilities under the 1974 agreement.</p><p>Israel’s principal ally, the US, along with many of the region’s powers, appears to have rejected Israeli characterisation of Syrian extremism.</p><p>Receiving al-Sharaa at the White House earlier this month, US President Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">praised</a> the Syrian leader, saying, “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf countries have also been providing economic <a href=\"/news/2025/9/7/saudi-arabia-announces-damascus-area-reconstruction-project-to-clear-rubble\">support</a> to Syria since al-Assad’s ousting, with Saudi Arabia, a key focus of Israel and the US’s normalisation efforts, announcing a reconstruction programme as recently as September.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-might-israel-s-ultimate-goals-in-syria-be\">What might Israel’s ultimate goals in Syria be?</h2><p>Israel appears to be following its standard playbook when dealing with its neighbours – use force, ask questions later, and refuse to compromise.</p><p>It knows it is the strongest military power in the region, but also believes it faces existential threats, and therefore largely does not want to make agreements that it believes will benefit rivals. In essence, Israel prefers to conduct business through force of arms rather than deal-making.</p><p>As well as maintaining its illegal occupation of Syrian territory, Israel has continued to occupy Lebanese territory and launch attacks against its neighbour despite entering into a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/despite-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-the-war-isnt-over-for-netanyahu\">ceasefire</a> in November 2024.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera earlier this year, writer, researcher, and founder of The Fire These Times podcast, Elia Ayoub, <a href=\"/features/2025/4/9/israel-pushes-on-with-strategy-to-keep-neighbours-weak-in-lebanon-and-syria\">said</a> that “The Israelis believe that having weaker neighbours, as in states that aren’t really able to function, is beneficial for them because, in that context, they’re the strongest actor.”</p><p>Whether that means dividing Syria, or simply retaining a large buffer zone, is unclear – and will perhaps be determined by how things pan out.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

An order that is “beyond the authority of the official issuing it” is also considered unlawful.</p><p>As a result, it is widely understood under US law that soldiers and service members have an obligation to reject orders they understand to be illegal.</p><p>In a landmark 1969 case known as United States v Keenan, a military court ruled, “Obedience to a lawful order is justified, but one in execution of a patently illegal order is not.”</p><p>The video Democrats released this week suggests that service members are facing such a situation today.</p><p>In a stitched-together statement featuring the voices of several Congress members, including Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, the Democrats appeal to military and intelligence workers to stand up to illegal demands.</p><p>“You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,” the Democrats said in their collective statement.</p><p>“We know this is hard, and that it’s is a difficult time to be a public servant. But whether you’re serving in the CIA, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, your vigilance is critical. And know that we have your back.”</p><p>Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also took part in the video.</p><p>They end their video with a popular slogan in the military: “Don’t give up the ship.” The phrase refers to the dying cry of a 19th-century US Navy captain, rallying his fellow sailors to fight until the end.</p><h2 id=\"online-debate-over-video\">Online debate over video</h2><p>But some Republicans have interpreted the video as a call to defy orders on political grounds.</p><p>Trump’s homeland security adviser Stephen Miller, for instance, <a href=\"https://x.com/StephenM/status/1990872986967326840\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media that “Democrat lawmakers are now openly calling for insurrection.”</p><p>Democrats quickly fired back, arguing they were simply pointing to existing military law and court precedent.</p><p>“This is the law. Passed down from our Founding Fathers, to ensure our military upholds its oath to the Constitution — not a king,” Slotkin <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1990961370431463785\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in response to Miller’s post. “Given you’re directing much of a military policy, you should buff up on the Uniformed Code of Military Justice.”</p><p>Crow, meanwhile, called out policies he considers to be in violation of US law, including Trump’s decision to deploy <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/us-federal-court-to-weigh-trumps-deployment-of-national-guard-to-chicago\">military troops</a> to police civilians and the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">recent bombing campaign</a> against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.</p><p>“The President is trampling on the Constitution,” Crow <a href=\"https://x.com/RepJasonCrow/status/1990907700285252007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “Stop politicizing our troops. Stop illegal military strikes. Stop pitting our servicemembers against the American people.”</p><p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and legal experts, including <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/un-human-rights-chief-says-us-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats-unacceptable\">at the United Nations</a>, have warned that the boat-bombing campaign runs afoul of the UN Charter, as well as international and domestic human rights laws.</p><p>“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” Volker Turk, the UN’s human rights chief, said last month.</p><p>He added that the “extrajudicial killings” of alleged drug smugglers on the boats “find no justification in international law”. At least 83 people have been killed in the attacks.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-threats-against-rivals\">A history of threats against rivals</h2><p>Thursday’s threats against the Democratic lawmakers is not the first time Trump has dangled the prospect of imprisonment — or even death — in front of political rivals.</p><p>During his successful 2016 presidential campaign, Trump turned the possibility of jailing his political rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, into a popular rallying cry.</p><p>Crowds at his events would applaud him and chant, “Lock her up! Lock her up!”</p><p>Trump had claimed that Clinton’s use of a private email server merited her incarceration, framing her actions as corrupt. “For what she’s done, they should lock her up. They should. It’s disgraceful,” he told a 2016 campaign event in North Carolina.</p><p>Even after taking office, Trump continued to threaten his critics and perceived opponents with arrest. In 2020, for instance, he took to social media <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313842083606802435\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to push</a> for the jailing of those involved in a 2016 investigation into alleged Russian election interference, which he considers a “hoax”.</p><p>“Where are all of the arrests?” he <a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313842083606802435\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asked</a>. “Long term sentences would have started two years ago. Shameful.”</p><p>During his most recent presidential bid, in 2024, he returned to the theme of incarceration, calling for the prosecution of then-President Joe Biden and his successor as Democratic nominee, Vice President <a href=\"/news/2024/9/30/trump-escalates-personal-attacks-on-rival-calls-harris-mentally-impaired\">Kamala Harris</a>.</p><p>“She should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions,” Trump said of Harris at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, blaming her for crimes committed by immigrants.</p><p>Trump’s threats have also targeted members of his own party that he perceives as disloyal.</p><p>Republican Liz Cheney, for instance, investigated Trump’s actions during the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. She was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives <a href=\"/news/2022/12/23/5-key-takeaways-from-january-6-panels-report-on-us-capitol-riot\">who recommended</a> criminal charges for his actions.</p><p>In the 2024 presidential race, Cheney ultimately backed Harris over Trump, her fellow party member. In response to her public criticisms, Trump openly mused about her <a href=\"/news/2024/11/1/cheney-slams-tyrant-trump-after-he-suggests-she-should-face-firing-squad\">facing a firing squad</a>.</p><p>“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said. His campaign later clarified he only meant to highlight Cheney’s hypocrisy.</p><p>Since Trump returned to office for a second term in January, critics say he has attempted to follow through with some of his threats.</p><p>In September, for instance, Trump used social media <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to demand</a> that Attorney General Pam Bondi prosecute three of his critics: Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/trump-adversary-letitia-james-pleads-not-guilty-in-mortgage-fraud-case\">Letitia James</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment\">James Comey</a>, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation,” he wrote. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p><p>Since that time, both James and Comey have faced criminal indictments. A third critic, former Trump adviser <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/john-bolton-pleads-not-guilty-to-mishandling-classified-information-in-us\">John Bolton</a>, was also charged last month.</p><p>All three have argued their cases are a form of political retribution and are currently seeking <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally\">to have the charges dismissed</a>.</p><p>Trump has long maintained that the greatest threat to the US is the “enemy from within”, an ambiguous phrase he has sometimes applied to Democratic rivals like Schiff.</p><p>Last month, he <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/key-takeaways-from-trumps-speech-to-us-military-generals\">told a gathering</a> of top military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, that the “big thing” they would be handling from here forward is “the enemy from within”.</p><p>“We have to handle it before it gets out of control,” he told the packed room of nearly 800 generals and admirals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Food and beverage services sectors followed, adding 37,000 jobs, and social assistance employment grew by 14,000.</p><p>Other sectors saw little change, including construction, wholesale trade, retail services, as well as professional and business services.</p><p>The federal workforce saw a decline of 3,000, marking 97,000 jobs cut from the nation’s largest employer since the beginning of the year. Transportation and warehousing, an industry hit hard by tariffs, also saw declines and shed 25,000 jobs in September.</p><p>Average wages grew by 0.2 percent, or 9 cents, to $36.67.</p><h2 id=\"government-shutdown-hurdles\">Government shutdown hurdles</h2><p>The September jobs report was initially slated for release on October 3, but was pushed out because of the US government shutdown. The jobs report typically comes out on the first Friday of each month. Because of the 43-day-long shutdown, the US Labor Department was unable to collect the data needed to calculate the unemployment rate for the month of October.</p><p>Nonfarm payrolls for the month of October will be released as part of the November employment report, which is slated to be released on December 16.</p><p>Heading into the economic data blackout, the BLS had estimated that about 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the 12 months through March than previously reported. A drop in the number of migrant workers coming into the US in search of work – a trend which started during the final year of former US President Joe Biden’s term and accelerated under President Donald Trump’s administration – has depleted labour supply.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Today’s delayed report shows troubling signs below the topline number: the underlying labour market remains weak, leaving working Americans with shrinking opportunities and rising insecurity. Month after month, the Trump economy is producing fewer jobs, more instability, and fewer pathways for families trying to get ahead,” Alex Jacquez, chief of policy for the economic think tank the Groundwork Collaborative, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Economists estimate the economy now only needs to create between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population, down from about 150,000 in 2024.</p><h2 id=\"behind-the-stalling-growth\">Behind the stalling growth</h2><p>The rising popularity of artificial intelligence is also eroding demand for labour, with most of the hits landing on entry-level positions in white collar jobs, and locking recent college graduates out of work. Economists said AI was fueling jobless economic growth.</p><p>Others blamed the Trump administration’s trade policy for creating an uncertain economic environment that had hamstrung the ability of businesses, especially small enterprises, to hire.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/what-has-us-supreme-court-said-about-trumps-trade-tariffs-does-it-matter\">US Supreme Court</a> earlier this month heard arguments about the legality of Trump’s import duties, with justices raising doubts about his authority to impose tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite payrolls remaining positive, some sectors and industries are shedding jobs. Some economists believed the September employment report could still influence the Federal Reserve’s December 9-10 policy meeting on interest rate decisions.</p><p>US central bank officials will not have November’s report in hand at that meeting, as the release date has been pushed to December 16 from December 5. Minutes of the Fed’s October 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed many policymakers cautioned that lowering borrowing costs further could risk undermining the fight to quell inflation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

When are you back in NYC?</p><p>Epstein: all next week</p><p>Kates: Ok dylan will want to see you I always want to see you.

PolitiFact, however, did not find any <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">proof</a> that he met Epstein that day.</p><p>There are different accounts of when Trump and Epstein had their falling out, with <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">periods</a> ranging from 2004 to 2007. The Miami Herald reported that Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in October 2007, a decade before the Thanksgiving Day in question.</p><p>In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor.</p><p>Two of the three people Epstein mentioned in his 2017 email as being “down there” are people who had property in South Florida at the time. It is unclear who he was referring to when he mentioned “Hanson”. It is possible Epstein was not foretelling a specific Thanksgiving Day plan but answering another New Yorker’s question about who among the people in their social circle would also be in the Florida area during that period.</p><p>Trump arrived in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 21, 2017, and stayed there for several days, according to the president’s public schedules documented in Roll Call’s FactBase.</p><p>On Thanksgiving morning, he spoke to members of the military via video conference and visited coastguard members at the Lake Worth Inlet Station in Riviera Beach, Florida. The White House published transcripts of Trump’s remarks to both groups. Trump also issued a Thanksgiving message to the country and went to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.</p><p>Photographers for The Associated Press news agency, The Palm Beach Post and Getty Images, among others, captured photos of Trump’s activities.</p><p>A CNN report said Trump held an “opulent” dinner at the Mar-a-Lago members-only club. PolitiFact did not find reports listing who was in attendance, but the White House told CNN the first family would be having “a nice Thanksgiving dinner with all the family”.</p><p>Trump was also active on social media. In a November 22, 2017, post on X, then known as Twitter, he said he “will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida [Mar-a-Lago]”. He did not specify whom he would be meeting. On Thanksgiving morning, he said in part: “HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well.”</p><p></p><p>Trump left Mar-a-Lago and returned to the White House on November 26, 2017, the Sunday after Thanksgiving.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

US digital news outlet Axios and the United Kingdom’s Financial Times newspaper were the first to report details of the plan on Wednesday.</p><p>Reuters later quoted two unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reporting that the US has “signalled” to Zelenskyy that Ukraine must accept the US plan, which involves Ukraine ceding territory and weapons.

It does not say where the official is from. The Financial Times also reported claims that only US and Russian officials had participated in drafting the plan.</p><p>The newspaper added that the US had informed Ukraine of the plan via Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, this week.</p><p>Citing an unnamed US official with “direct knowledge”, Axios reported that the plan would give Russia parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow does not currently control, in exchange for a US security guarantee for Ukraine and Europe against future Russian aggression.</p><p>However, Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at London think tank Chatham House, said the proposal may not originate from the US at all. He described the way news of the plan had emerged as a “Russian information operation rather than the basis of reality, which Western media has willingly bought into yet again” in an interview with Al Jazeera.</p><p>In a response to a post on X with the link to the Axios story, Witkoff said on Wednesday: “He must have got this from K.” He did not explicitly confirm or deny the existence of the 28-point plan.</p><p>The post, which Witkoff may have “thought was a direct message” to someone else, Giles said, has since been deleted.</p><p>Giles said that “K” could refer either to Putin ally and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev; or Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>The Financial Times report names Dmitriev as one of the “architects” of the new proposal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4119668\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4119668\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4119668\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-20T094123Z_251138549_RC280IAG6SYG_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-TERNOPIL-1763641994.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ternopil\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4119668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students preparing to be firefighters gather in front of an apartment building that was hit on Wednesday by a Russian missile in Ternopil, Ukraine, November 20, 2025 [Thomas Peter/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"us-and-ukrainian-officials-said\">What have US and Ukrainian officials said?</h2><p>The White House has declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that the US “will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict”.</p><p>Rubio added: “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.”</p><p>Zelenskyy, who was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/ukraines-zelenskyy-headed-to-turkiye-in-bid-to-resuscitate-peace-talks\">holding talks in Turkiye</a> with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, has also not commented on the alleged proposal.</p><p>“The main thing for stopping the bloodshed and achieving lasting peace is that we work in coordination with all our partners and that American leadership remains effective, strong,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after his meeting with Erdogan in Ankara.</p><p>Zelenskyy said that only the US and Trump “have sufficient strength for the war to finally come to an end”.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-been-reported-about-the-terms-of-the-plan\">What has been reported about the terms of the plan?</h2><p>According to Axios, the plan spans 28 specific but unknown points. Overall, it would give Russia full control over both Crimea in the south – which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 but which remains in dispute – and the Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>In Donbas, Russia currently controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas region including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Ukraine would be required to withdraw its troops from the Donbas altogether, and it would become a demilitarised zone, with Russia also unable to place its troops there.</p><p>Axios quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official saying the plan also imposes longer-term limits on the size of Ukraine’s military and its possession of long‑range missiles.</p><p>In addition to Crimea and the majority of the Donbas region, Russia also now controls 75 percent of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/russia-gains-ground-in-zaporizhzhia-in-southeastern-ukraine\">Zaporizhia</a> and <a href=\"/features/2025/9/15/russian-occupiers-brought-death-and-intimidation-to-kherson-ukrainian-teen\">Kherson</a> in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. According to the plan, the existing battle lines in these two areas would be frozen in place.

He described the plan as “catastrophic to European security”.</p><p>“It seems that Ukrainian armed forces will have to be reduced by 2.5 times [reduced by 60 percent] of its size – that means Ukraine cannot have more than 400,000 personnel,” Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the defence studies department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera, based on what she has read about the plan. “It also says Ukraine shouldn’t have any long-range capabilities that would be able to strike Russia. Then the territories under Russian control would be officially recognised as well as Crimea.”</p><p>“This plan seems to obviously favour Russia, and it is interesting to see whether the United States can exert enough leverage on Ukraine and on Zelenskyy to accept this plan,” Miron said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1763294067.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1763294067\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_4109937\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109937\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109937\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-EASTERN-UKRAINE-copy-1763294058.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN EASTERN UKRAINE copy-1763294058\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-s-position-changed-over-time\">How has Trump’s position changed over time?</h2><p>Trump has flip-flopped on the issue of Ukraine ceding land to Russia several times this year.</p><p>Late last month, Trump suggested <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/trump-calls-on-russia-and-ukraine-to-freeze-war-at-current-battle-lines\">freezing the war</a> in Ukraine at its current battle lines.</p><p>“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One in October. This plan was rejected by Russia, which has made clear it is determined to achieve its war goal of the withdrawal of Ukraine’s military from the eastern regions that Moscow lays claim to.</p><p>Ukraine and its European allies <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/trump-wants-to-freeze-russia-ukraine-war-who-gets-what-if-that-happens\">supported this plan</a> at the time. “The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” they said in a joint statement. This marked a shift for Ukraine, which had previously insisted on reclaiming all of its land.</p><p>It was also a change in stance by Trump, who on September 23, said Ukraine could <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/in-major-shift-trump-says-ukraine-can-win-back-all-territory-from-russia\">win back all its territory</a> captured by Russia since the beginning of the <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">war</a> with help from the European Union and NATO.</p><p>“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform back then.</p><p>Before that, on August 11, Trump said both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war. He told reporters that Russia had taken some of Ukraine’s “very prime territory” and “we’re going to try to get some of that territory back”. At this point, Zelenskyy rejected the idea of conceding any land.</p><p>In February this year, Trump met with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy during this meeting for not being “grateful” enough for American support in the war so far.</p><p>Trump indicated that ending the war would require Ukraine to give up some territory, telling Zelenskyy: “You should be grateful. You’re not in a strong position – you’re trapped there, your people are dying, and you’re running out of soldiers.”</p><p>On the campaign trail ahead of the US election last year, Trump promised to end the Ukraine war in the first 24 hours of his presidency. Trump was inaugurated in late January this year, and about 11 months later, all his attempts at peace talks have been unsuccessful.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has been dragging on since February 2022. On Wednesday, a Russian <a href=\"/gallery/2025/11/20/russian-air-strikes-kill-26-in-devastating-attack-on-ukraines-ternopil\">aerial attack on Ternopil</a> in western Ukraine killed at least 26 people and injured several others, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Miron said she believes that if this plan is presented, Ukraine and Europe will reject it due to its heavy favouring of Russia.</p><p>“We will get into another cycle of rewriting the plan, and Ukraine and Europe will have their own demands. Allegedly, Zelenskyy had a plan of his own in Turkiye which was put together with his European allies,” Miron said.</p><p>If the reports about the plan are true, the plan will likely set off a “diplomatic game”, she added.</p><p>“If Ukrainians and Europeans reject the plan, then Trump can always say, ‘Well, we came with a plan to you and you rejected it. And so you are in the way to achieve a lasting peace’.”</p><p>Miron added: “The Europeans plus Ukraine and the Russians have been playing this game, each of them kind of presenting something that they know the other side will reject. So then the ball will be in Europe’s and Ukraine’s court.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
