            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The new year is less than two months in, but already more than 560 people have gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea while trying to reach Europe, making it on course to be one of the deadliest years on record. At least 500 of those were lost crossing from Libya, Tunisia and Algeria to a Europe that continues to attempt to force them back.</p><p>The stories of those lost at sea, many of them travelling on boats that offer little protection from the waves, reveal the extent of their suffering.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Earlier in February, 53 people, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/at-least-53-people-dead-or-missing-after-boat-capsizes-off-libya\">two of them babies</a>, were reported to be dead or missing after their boat capsized off the coast of the Libyan town of Zuwara. Only two women, both Nigerian, were rescued.</p><p>A few weeks earlier, as a freak cyclone tore across the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds, possibly up to a thousand people, desperately trying to reach Europe, were believed to have lost their lives.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"qualified-risk\">Qualified risk</h2><p>The risks of travelling to and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/journey-of-hell-migrants-in-libya-endure-torture-rape-forced-labour\">through Libya</a> are well known among migrants and refugees. Nevertheless, they come.</p><p>According to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), between August and October 2025, at least 928,000 migrants were identified in Libya, hoping to either stay in the North African country or, in the case of many, attempt to cross to Europe and the promise of a better life.</p><p>But, as they wait for the funds to pay for their passage, or the right opportunity to travel, they find themselves prey to the militias that have controlled much of Libya since a civil war robbed the country of a stable and unified government.</p><p>A report, issued by the UN Human Rights Office in February, painted a bleak picture of life for refugees and irregular migrants in Libya. In it, researchers described an environment where traffickers and armed groups could conduct widespread and systematic abuse against migrants with impunity. These “grave violations and abuses have evolved into deliberate, profit-driven practices that together form a ruthless and violent business model”.</p><p>Ola, a 25-year-old from Freetown in Sierra Leone, is one of the thousands to have fallen victim to Libya’s militias. Speaking from Libya’s capital Tripoli, Ola described being beaten and held prisoner by one of the militias in Zuwara, which is in western Libya.</p><p>Ola said that his hand had still not recovered after he was hit with an iron bar before he was detained in the summer of 2024. Ola remained in detention, enduring forced labour and regular beatings, for three months: the time it took his parents to borrow the $700 his captors demanded to free him.</p><p>“Conditions were very bad,” he said of his time in detention, as he rubbed his injured hand. “There was a lot of suffering. We would have bread to eat, and sometimes we had to drink the water they gave us to wash in. It was very bad; it had salt in it.”</p><p>“I did not have a [reputation for taking risks] in my country,” Ola said.</p><p>“I did not associate with bad people. I never did anything illegal,” he continued. “I know this is dangerous, but it’s better than where I come from”.</p><p>Mubarak, a 31-year-old from Sudan, is no different. He fled fighting around his village near Nyala in Darfur in 2023, crossing into Libya overland through Chad. Like Ola, Mubarak described being held prisoner, being beaten and forced to work by one of Libya’s militias, before being released.</p><p>Mubarak also knows the risks of continuing to Europe and is ready to accept them. He laughed bitterly, “I know the crossing [to Europe] is dangerous. [But] It’s just the money that’s stopping me. I know in my soul that Libya is just as dangerous as Sudan, but where will I go?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-deterrence-for-the-desperate\">No deterrence for the desperate</h2><p>For those willing to stake their lives on surviving what the IOM says is the world’s most dangerous migration route, European deterrence means little.</p><p>Nevertheless, the European states most exposed to departures from Tunisia and Libya, principally Italy, have adopted increasingly punitive measures. Under a new Italian bill <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/italy-advances-migration-bill-including-naval-blockades\">approved earlier this month</a>, the country can indefinitely prohibit boats from entering its waters “in cases of grave threats to public order or national security”.</p><p>Moreover, the bill allows Italy to stop boats and send passengers to third-party countries it has outsourcing deals with, such as Albania, with no indication that authorities would check for protection needs, vulnerabilities, or physical or mental health concerns. The European Parliament has also signed off on changes to EU asylum rules that let member states transfer asylum seekers to “safe third countries”.</p><p>How effective all of that is at reducing migrant numbers remains to be seen. Despite an Italian government elected partly on the back of its anti-migrant platform in 2022, arrival numbers remain stubbornly high, with more than 63,000 people braving the odds in 2025, almost the identical number as those from the previous year.</p><p>“Why people take these extreme risks is one of the big questions,” said Ahlam Chemlali, a migration expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, who has conducted extensive field research among irregular migrants along Tunisia’s border with Libya,</p><p>Chemlali described speaking to the women in the border region, who knew and, in many cases, had experienced the danger inherent to migration firsthand.</p><p>“They told me they were already dead there [on the border], and they’re right. It’s a social death, where people have no future,” she said, “Everything is denied to them, so taking these risks is one way they can regain some control over their lives. They understand what they’re doing. The EU has poured millions into information campaigns, but the prospect of being stuck in limbo with no future feels worse. This is especially true for women with children. The presence of children can be a huge motivator, but of course, it also increases the risks.”</p><p>In Ola’s case, the drive to reach Europe is unwavering. He craves the rule of law – anything that would lead to consequences for those committing acts of violence against him.</p><p>“Life in Europe would be amazing,” he said, the tone of his voice lightening, “I would be safe. There is no violence there. If there is violence, it is punished by the law.</p><p>“I will educate myself and then get a job.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Support for Israel among United States citizens has dramatically decreased, according to a new Gallup poll, marking an unprecedented shift in decades of overwhelming, unconditional backing for Israel, regardless of which party was in the White House or had control of Congress.</p><p>In a report published on Friday, the polling agency said 41 percent of Americans now say they sympathise more with Palestinians, while 36 percent remain more favourable to the Israelis. By contrast, before the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in October 2023 and the ensuing <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/israeli-attacks-on-police-sites-kill-five-in-southern-central-gaza\">genocidal war waged by Israel in Gaza</a>, 54 percent of Americans sympathised more with Israel and 31 percent with Palestine.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Here’s a breakdown of the report’s main findings:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Democrats</strong>’ sympathies haven’t changed significantly over the past year, having already flipped strongly towards the Palestinians in 2025 after first tilting that way in 2023. Currently, 65 percent of Democrats say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians, while 17 percent say they sympathise more with the Israelis.</li>\n<li>Driving the shift this year, the report says, is the substantial movement among <strong>independents</strong> who have now joined Democrats in supporting Palestinians. <span>By 41 percent to 30 </span><span>percent, independents say they sympathise more with the Palestinians than the Israelis, whereas in all prior years, they were more sympathetic towards the Israelis, including by 42 </span><span>percent to 34 </span><span>percent last year.</span></li>\n<li>Seven in 10 <strong>Republicans</strong> say they sympathise more with the Israelis, while 13 percent go with the Palestinians. Still, the Republican support for Israel has declined by a 10-point record since 2024, to its lowest level since 2004. Support for Israel has become deeply contentious in the conservative party, including driving a wedge within the far-right conservative MAGA movement. Some of its representatives, such as former Fox news host-turned popular podcaster Tucker Carlson, have become critical of what they say is Israel’s excessive influence over US politics.</li>\n<li><strong>Age gap</strong>: For the first time in Gallup’s surveys since 2001, a majority of US citizens aged between 18 and 34 are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, 23 percent of young adults say they sympathise more with the Israelis, a record low for the age group. Sympathy for Israel has dropped from 45 percent last year to 28 percent. Among adults older than 55, 49 percent sympathise more with the Israelis and 31% with the Palestinians, the first time since 2005 that less than half of older Americans have said they sympathise more with the Israelis.</li>\n<li>Gallup also measured US sentiment over the establishment of a <strong>Palestinian state</strong>. There are no significant changes compared to recent years, as 6 in 10 adults favour the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – an almost consistent figure since 2020.</li>\n</ul><p>Perceptions’ shifts followed what has been widely regarded as Israel’s disproportionate response to the October 7 attack, where about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and more than 250 were taken captive.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 72,000 people in Gaza, the majority of them women and children, and reduced almost the entire enclave into rubble.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza\">International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants</a> for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes against humanity and war crimes; and prompted <a href=\"/news/2024/6/6/which-countries-have-joined-south-africas-case-against-israel-at-the-icj\"> South Africa to file a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a>, which has been joined by several other nations.</p><p>Still, while support fell at a faster rate following the war, the trend had started going downwards since 2019 due to the “cumulative effect of gradual changes in US attitudes since then”, read the report.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ouattara met Barak, who was then the Israeli defence minister, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Five days before the trip, on June 12, 2012, exiled military officials linked to the Ivory Coast’s former president had attempted to overthrow Ouattara’s government.</p><p>Ouattara’s predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, had refused to hand over power to Ouattara, and a civil war that killed at least 3,000 people ensued. The fighting had only ended about a year before when UN and French forces intervened and arrested Gbagbo.</p><p>Ouattara’s son, Dramane, and niece, Nina Keita, also met Epstein in New York on the same day, according to the Epstein files. It’s unclear what the parties discussed.</p><p>Keita, a former model, was friends with Epstein and travelled regularly on his private jet, according to the documents. She appeared to have connected Epstein with her uncle, as well as other highly placed Ivorian politicians, according to the documents.</p><p>The files showed that on September 12, three months after Epstein met Ouattara’s son, he again met Keita in New York.</p><p>He met Barak immediately after in a private meeting at the Regency Hotel in New York, according to a schedule published in the files. It’s not known what was discussed.</p><p>In November, Drop Site News reported that Epstein referred to a trip to the Ivory Coast, Angola and Senegal in a note to his assistant, but that there are no flight records to confirm the travels.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-did-israel-propose-to-ouattara\">What did Israel propose to Ouattara?</h2><p>A month after Ouattara’s travel to Jerusalem, an Israeli delegation visited Abidjan.</p><p>At the meetings, Ouattara reportedly asked about Israeli defence systems to overhaul security in his country, according to reporting by Calcalist, an Israeli publication that covered the exchanges at the time.</p><p>In late 2012, Ivorian Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko travelled to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Barak, where they discussed a cybersecurity deal, Drop Site News found.</p><p>Then, in spring 2013, Barak, who had now left office as defence minister, travelled to Abidjan himself to converse with Ouattara in what would be their second meeting.</p><p>Barak presented an expensive security defence plan to the president, Calcalist reported. The $150m proposal encompassed border security, army training, and strategic military consulting, the publication said.</p><p>Drop Site News, in an investigation in November, added that the proposal included a mobile and internet surveillance centre, as well as a video monitoring centre.</p><p>The publication cited two sets of documents: an archive of leaked emails released by the Handala hacking group and hosted by nonprofit whistleblower site, Distributed Denial of Secrets, as well as earlier Epstein-linked documents released by the US House Oversight Committee in October 2025.</p><p>Barak’s surveillance centre was to be developed by the French-Israeli private security company, MF-Group, which specialises in surveillance systems, and was to be located in Abidjan, Drop Site News reported.</p><p>Email logs showed Epstein introduced Barak to Ouattara’s chief of staff later in September 2013, and planned a meeting in New York where the two men met.</p><p>Although Ouattara was pleased with the plan, he ultimately did not sign the deal because of the price tag, Calcalist reported.</p><p>Barak, in a response to Calcalist at the time, denied that he offered to build the Ivory Coast an intelligence apparatus. “The claims about establishing an intelligence apparatus and price offers are incorrect. These are private conversations, and the public has no interest in them,” he was quoted as saying.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4338255\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4338255\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4338255\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-12-08T123236Z_1910176095_RC2ACIAVYLHX_RTRMADP_3_IVORYCOAST-ELECTION-1772033923.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ouattara\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4338255\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ivory Coast’s President Ouattara being sworn in for another term at the Presidential Palace in Abidjan on December 8, 2025 [File: Sia Kambou/ Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-was-the-final-agreement\">What was the final agreement?</h2><p>Although the plan appeared to be rejected, both countries continued to forge friendly ties.</p><p>In June 2014, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was welcomed in Abidjan on a state visit.</p><p>Liberman had travelled to the country along with 50 Israeli businesspeople who were interested in investing in the Ivory Coast.</p><p>In a news release at the time, the Ivorian government said two agreements were signed: “One concerning regular consultations between the two countries and the other on defence and internal security.”</p><p>No details were provided.

Public outrage caused Jonathan to consider cancelling the project, but the government never announced that it was withdrawn.</p><p>Barak continued leveraging his access in Nigeria to promote Israeli products and services. In 2015, he facilitated the sale of Israeli biometric surveillance equipment to a private Christian university in Nigeria, Drop Site News found.

The model was told her presence would “add some real glamour to the occasion”, according to emails sent by Epstein’s planner, whose name was redacted in the files.</p><p>In a different email, Epstein appeared to share that information with British politician <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/how-epstein-mandelson-files-rocked-the-uk-government\">Peter Mandelson</a>, who is now under investigation for his links to Epstein. A host, whose name was redacted “is having dinner for zuma tomorrow night at the ritz„ i have invited a beautiful russina named (redacted) to attend,” he wrote.</p><p>It’s unclear if Mandelson responded.</p><p>After the dinner appeared to have taken place, one email sender whose name was redacted wrote to Epstein: “(Redacted name) was a delight last night and enchanted all those she met…By the way, Jacob Zuma was much more impressive and engaging than I thought he would be!”</p><p><strong>Karim Wade</strong></p><p>Politician and son of Senegal’s ex-President Abdoulaye Wade, Karim Wade’s name appeared 504 times in the released files.</p><p>Wade, under his father, was a minister with an open-ended portfolio, and was so powerful that he was nicknamed “minister of heaven and earth”.</p><p>His relationship with Epstein began in 2010, according to an investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which cited the newly released files.</p><p>In an email to an unnamed contact in November of that year, Epstein wrote: “the President of Senegal is sending his son to see me in paris,” the publication noted. Over the years, they planned trips in Africa along with Emirati businessman, bin Sulayem. They also discussed business ideas, the files showed.</p><p>In 2015, after Wade was convicted on corruption charges by a new administration, records show Epstein approaching Norwegian leader of the Council of Europe, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/epstein-files-set-off-norwegian-political-storm-what-we-know\">Thorborn Jagland</a>, to ask about possibly filing an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. Wade’s lawyers regularly updated Epstein on efforts to free him, according to OCCRP.</p><p>Senegal pardoned Wade in 2016, after which he went into exile in Qatar. Keita, niece to Ivory Coast’s President Ouattara, who appeared to play some role in the efforts to free Wade, texted Epstein: “Thank you for everything you have done for him!!!!”</p><p><strong>Robert Mugabe</strong></p><p>The Epstein documents revealed that the sex trafficker planned to meet then-President Mugabe to propose a new currency for Zimbabwe amid that country’s hyperinflation crisis.</p><p>In email exchanges back in 2015, Japanese financier Joi Ito recommended to Epstein that they both approach Mugabe to discuss the currency after the Zimbabwean dollar lost its value. It’s unclear if the meeting ever took place.</p><p>Released along with the emails were FBI documents from 2017, which appeared to show unverified testimony from a “confidential source” who said Epstein was a wealth manager for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Mugabe.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>A United Nations investigative body has warned that South Sudan risks “a return to full-scale war” unless it can urgently put an end to entrenched impunity and widespread abuses amid escalating violence in the world’s youngest country.</p><p>The report by the UN’s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS), released on Friday at the Human Rights Council session in Geneva, found that civilians were enduring severe abuses including killings and “systematic” sexual violence, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and deprivation amid a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/humanitarian-crisis-deepens-as-south-sudan-violence-surges\">deepening humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s most impoverished countries</a>.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>It said “escalating atrocity risks” and the collapse of political safeguards in the country made “urgent preventive action imperative”, calling on regional and international actors to engage with diplomatic pressure, sanctions and enforcing the UN arms embargo until concrete improvements in human rights and accountability are achieved.</p><p>“Preventing further mass atrocity crimes, institutional collapse, and the destruction of South Sudan’s fragile transition requires urgent coordinated national, regional and international re-engagement,” the report said.</p><p>The report, drawing on a year of investigations and testimony, blamed the actions of political and military elites – in detaining opposition leaders, eroding power sharing and attempting to change the terms of a <a href=\"/news/2025/3/7/fighting-flares-in-south-sudan-is-the-2018-peace-deal-in-danger\">2018 peace agreement</a> – for placing a peace framework in the country under major strain and increasing instability.</p><p>It noted that the arrest and removal from office of First Vice President <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/why-riek-machars-trial-brings-existentially-high-stakes-for-south-sudan\">Riek Machar</a> last year, and his prosecution for murder, treason and crimes against humanity, had undermined “the core power-sharing guarantees” of the peace agreement, and <a href=\"/news/2025/3/7/fighting-flares-in-south-sudan-is-the-2018-peace-deal-in-danger\">triggered</a> “political uncertainty and armed clashes on a scale not witnessed” for a decade.</p><p>Machar, an ethnic Nuer, was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after opposition Nuer White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir.</p><p>Civil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, when President Salva Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, the country’s largest, first dismissed Machar as vice president, accusing him of plotting a coup.</p><p>The report also noted that intensifying military operations had been marked by a “dangerous shift in tactics”, including air strikes on civilian-populated areas.</p><p>It said that the deployment of forces from neighbouring Uganda, a guarantor of the 2018 peace agreement, had “materially strengthened” government forces militarily and “raised credible concerns” of violations of a UN arms embargo.</p><p>The CHRSS report noted that joint aerial bombardments by the Ugandan and South Sudan armies had targeted civilian areas, “predominantly affecting [ethnic] Nuer communities in opposition-affiliated areas”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sexual-violence-widespread-systematic\">Sexual violence ‘widespread, systematic’</h2><p>Conflict-related sexual violence remained a “defining and persistent feature” of the crisis, the report found, with survivor testimonies over the past decade showing “widespread and systematic patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated by all armed forces and groups”.</p><p>Most women and girls lived “at constant risk of sexual violence,” it said, adding that last year, the threat of such abuse had again “functioned as a strategic instrument of conflict deployed to terrorise civilian populations, drive displacement, and fracture social cohesion”.</p><p>The report said that impunity was entrenched, with senior commanders and political actors rarely held accountable for serious abuses perpetrated on their behalf.</p><p>The report also noted a sharp deterioration in civic space, with journalists, activists and opposition figures facing harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detention, undermining prospects for inclusive political participation and long-term stability.</p><p>The commission urged the government to immediately halt violations by its forces, release those arbitrarily detained and guarantee freedoms of expression, assembly and association.</p><p>It also called for the urgent establishment of long-delayed transitional justice mechanisms to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed since 2013.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-conflict\">Renewed conflict</h2><p>An estimated 400,000 people were killed in the five years of a war waged largely along ethnic lines, before calm was restored with a peace deal in 2018.</p><p>But escalating fighting in recent months has brought renewed fears of a return to civil war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Beginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces – some loyal to Machar, leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM/IO) – seized a string of government outposts in Jonglei state, an opposition stronghold northeast of the capital, Juba that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group.</p><p>Following the territorial losses, South Sudan’s army <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/south-sudan-launches-offensive-against-opposition-forces-what-to-know\">announced a major military operation</a> against opposition forces in late January, ordering civilians and aid groups to leave areas of Jonglei state, a move that the International Crisis Group said showed the country had “returned to war”.</p><h2 id=\"millions-affected\">Millions affected</h2><p>The United Nations said earlier this month that an estimated 280,000 people have been displaced by the fighting and air attacks since late December, including more than 235,000 across Jonglei alone, while UNICEF warned last week that more than 450,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition due to mass displacement and the halting of critical medical services in Jonglei.</p><p>Nearly 10 million people need life-saving humanitarian assistance across South Sudan, while humanitarian operations have been crippled by attacks and looting, with observers saying both sides in the conflict have prevented assistance from reaching areas where they believe civilians support their opponents.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The CHRSS report said that civilians had borne the “overwhelming human brunt” of the crisis as conflict, violence, displacement and sexual violence had intensified “an already-dire humanitarian situation”.</p><p>Last year, it said, displacement had risen by nearly 40 percent to 3.2 million people, while declining international assistance was disproportionately affecting women and children.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 80 “tanks, artillery pieces, and armed personnel carriers have been destroyed”, he wrote.</p><p data-start=\"433\" data-end=\"606\">Pakistani news outlet Dawn reported that two Pakistani military personnel had died in the ongoing clashes.</p><p data-start=\"433\" data-end=\"606\">Al Jazeera could not independently verify the casualty figures released by Pakistan.</p><p>The Taliban government, however, said only eight Taliban fighters were killed and 11 were wounded.</p><p>Afghanistan said its military had launched its attack on Pakistani military bases and outposts along the border early on Friday in retaliation against Pakistani strikes across the Afghan border on Sunday. It claimed its forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers, and captured two military bases and 19 military posts. Pakistan has dismissed this claim.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">For its part, Pakistan said its air strikes last Sunday killed at least 70 “militants”, a claim dismissed by Mujahid, according to news outlets. Mujahid, instead, wrote on X that the attacks “killed and wounded dozens, including women and children”.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">The provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in Nangarhar province, Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, said 18 people had been killed and several others were wounded on Sunday.</p><p>Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who does not hold an official position but remains an influential political figure, said the country “will defend their beloved homeland with complete unity in all circumstances and will respond to aggression with courage”.</p><p>“Pakistan cannot free itself from the violence and bombings – those problems it has created itself – but must change its own policy and choose the path of good neighbourliness, respect, and civilised relations with Afghanistan,” he wrote in an X post on Friday.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-pakistan-and-afghanistan-fighting\" data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">Why are Pakistan and Afghanistan fighting?</h2><p>The current flare-up of violence between the two countries is the culmination of months of tension.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">In October 2025, Afghanistan and Pakistan <a href=\"/news/2025/10/19/afghanistan-pakistan-agree-to-immediate-ceasefire-after-talks-in-doha\">agreed to an immediate ceasefire</a> during talks mediated by Qatar and Turkiye following a week of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/tensions-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan-spike-as-truce-about-to-expire\">fierce and deadly clashes</a> along their border.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is called the Durand Line and spans 2,611km (1,622 miles). Afghanistan does not formally recognise this border, which it argues was an imposed colonial demarcation that illegitimately divided ethnic Pashtun areas between the two countries.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">The neighbours have been embroiled in frequent clashes since the Taliban took over in 2021. Sami Omari, an expert in South and Central Asian security and strategic affairs, told Al Jazeera there have been 75 clashes between Afghan and Pakistani forces since 2021 – the same year that US and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan.</p><p>In particular, Pakistan wants the Taliban to rein in armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, which it says Afghanistan is harbouring. The TTP emerged in Pakistan in 2007 and is separate from the Taliban in Afghanistan, but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group.</p><p>Armed attacks in Pakistan by the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which operates in the resource-rich Balochistan province, have surged in recent years. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have borne the brunt of the violence.</p><p>On Friday, Pakistan’s former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the country has “nothing against the proud and poor citizens of Afghanistan”.</p><p>“But it is the Taliban (Afghanistan &amp; Pakistan) who have forced Pakistan into this conflict,” he wrote on X.</p><p>“For the sake of innocent civilians on both sides of the border, I hope the Taliban stop with incursions into and terrorism in Pakistan.”</p><p>Afghanistan is unlikely to take action against armed groups, however, analysts say. “The Afghan Taliban appear unwilling to seriously crack down on the TTP, partly due to prior affinities between the two groups but also out of fear of TTP militants defecting to its main rival, the Islamic State Khorasan Province,” Pearl Pandya, South Asia senior analyst at the US-based Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data (ACLED), an independent, impartial conflict monitor, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"371\" data-end=\"557\">Pandya added that a serious escalation is “inevitable” if the Taliban in Afghanistan do not crack down on the TTP.</p><p>Elizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the latest clashes are not surprising, as they stem from months of “frayed” tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p>“It is significant to the extent that it represents perhaps a shift in strategy,” Threlkeld said, noting the “more aggressive, kinetic attacks” from Pakistan.</p><p>“But since then, we’ve seen a couple of terrorist attacks within Pakistan that were quite significant. So, no, I’m not surprised that after those cumulative attacks, that tensions have frayed and things have again gone in this direction, unfortunately.”</p><p>Armed warfare between the two nations would not favour Afghanistan, which is ill-equipped to meet Pakistan head on.</p><p>The Afghan Taliban does not have a military that is comparable to Pakistan’s, which is why it is using unconventional methods of attack, Abdul Basit, a scholar at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They have suicide bombers and kamikaze drones, which I think they will use those in large numbers,” Basit said.</p><p>Furthermore, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder reported, “the Afghans do not have an air force, so the Pakistanis have the upper hand in striking across the border. They’ve attacked Kabul, Kandahar and other places. They say their main targets are ammunition depots and military infrastructure.”</p><p>“Does it mean that Pakistani troops are going to cross the border?” he said. “It is very unlikely. However, we cannot rule out continuous exchange of fire across the border, with both sides using heavy artillery.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4342957\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Military-head-to-head-pakistan-afghanistan-feb-27-2026-1772186796.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-world-reacted\">How has the world reacted?</h2><p>“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal <a href=\"https://x.com/MEAIndia/status/2025602055684108325?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>.</p><p>“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/world-reacts-to-eruption-of-fighting-between-pakistan-afghanistan\">said</a>.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both sides to adhere to international law, according to a statement delivered by his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has urged Afghanistan and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles.</p><p>“In the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of self-restraint and strengthening solidarity in the world of Islam, it is fitting that Afghanistan and Pakistan manage and resolve their existing differences within the framework of good neighborliness and through the path of dialogue,” Araghchi wrote in an X post.</p><p>Russia has urged the warring parties to ⁠halt cross-border attacks ‌immediately and resolve their differences through diplomatic ⁠means, the ⁠RIA news ⁠agency reported on ⁠Friday, ⁠citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

region escalates despite a United States-mediated peace deal.</p><p>The governor of South Kivu province, Jean-Jacques Purusi, told The Associated Press news agency on Thursday that authorities found two mass graves with at least 171 bodies in the Kiromoni and Kavimvira neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

identified two sites: one mass grave containing approximately 30 bodies in Kiromoni, not far from the Burundian border on the Congolese side, and another in Kavimvira where 141 bodies were found,” Purusi told AP over the phone.</p><p>The Executive Secretariat of the Local Network for the Protection of Civilians, a civil society group in the region, said on Thursday it wanted to visit the mass graves but was prevented from doing so by the Congolese military.</p><p>Information gathered so far indicates that the victims were killed by M23 rebels, said Yves Ramadhani, the group’s vice president.</p><p>The governor and the civil society group alleged that the rebels killed the individuals because they suspected them of belonging to the DRC army or a pro-government militia.</p><p>Both the DRC military and M23 have been accused of extrajudicial killings and abuses by rights groups. Al Jazeera could not independently verify Purusi’s or the group’s claims.</p><p>The M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups that are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>M23 has been in a tense and violent conflict with the DRC government for more than a decade. The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021.</p><p>Then, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the following month. And in December, the group <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/18/m23-fighters-withdraw-from-key-drc-town-of-uvira\">seized control of Uvira</a> in an offensive that killed more than 1,500 people and forced about 300,000 to flee, according to regional authorities.</p><p>The rebel group later announced it would withdraw from the city, in what it said was a “unilateral trust-building measure” requested by the US to facilitate the peace process.</p><p>M23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The DRC government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.</p><p>Last year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">DRC and M23</a> mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/rwanda-drc-presidents-sign-washington-accord-peace-deal\">Kinshasa and Kigali</a> mediated by the US.</p><p>Despite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.</p><p>The conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees, and thousands killed.</p><p>More than 200 people were also killed in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DRC last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in Tafelsig, which will likely be part of the new military operation, most people seem unbothered by the news.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Mitchells Plain is on the Cape Flats – a series of densely populated, impoverished townships about 30km (19 miles) southeast of the wealthy city centre where the president made his speech. While the city boasts hordes of tourists and some of the most expensive real estate on the continent, the Cape Flats accounts for the highest rate of gang-related killings in the country.</p><p>“When it was at its worst, [there was a shooting] almost every day,” said Michael Jacobs, the chairperson of a local community police forum.</p><p>“Whether it’s day or whether it’s night, they’re shooting somewhere on the Cape Flats,” he added on a drive through the settlement of run-down houses and corrugated iron shacks.</p><p>Around him, residents made their way to a home-grown tuck shop, known as a spaza, or sat on street corners while toddlers ran about.</p><p>“How is this conducive to raising children?” he asked, recounting the horrors of life in Mitchells Plain.</p><p>In the past week, four people, including a nine-month-old, had been shot and killed in a drug den in Athlone, about 17km (10 miles) away.</p><p>A beloved Muslim cleric who is rumoured to have angered a gang leader over a personal dispute was also shot dead on the first day of Ramadan as he was leaving the Salaamudien Mosque on a nearby street.</p><p>As Jacobs spoke, reports of other shootings filtered through on the many crime groups he is part of on WhatsApp. A few days later, he shared with Al Jazeera a video of two schoolgirls and a taxi driver shot outside a school in Atlantis, about 40km (25 miles) north of Cape Town.

On February 17, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia announced that the Eastern Cape would be added to the list and a deployment would take place in 10 days – although no soldiers have so far been deployed.</p><p>The president’s decision followed pressure from civil society groups and the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which runs the Western Cape, to take drastic action to curb widespread gang-related violence in the three provinces.</p><p>A day before its province was added to the deployment schedule, the DA joined residents in Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape, for a “Do Our Lives Not Matter?” protest to demand that Ramaphosa take urgent action.</p><p>In Gauteng, neighbourhoods surrounding the province’s once-lucrative abandoned mines have often been turned into battlegrounds, resulting in shootouts between police and illegal artisanal miners, known as zama zamas.</p><p>Gauteng and the Western Cape frequently appear at the top of the country’s organised crime lists while the Eastern Cape made headlines last year for a series of killings linked to extortion syndicates.</p><p>In the latest crime statistics, police announced the arrests of 15,846 suspects nationwide and the seizure of 173 firearms and 2,628 rounds of ammunition from February 16 to Sunday alone.</p><p>Gauteng took up the most space in the police’s crime highlights, which included a 16-year-old arrested in Roodepoort for possession and distribution of explosives and the seizure of counterfeit clothing and shoes worth 98 million rand ($6.1m).</p><p>Overall, South Africa has some of the world’s most violent crime with an average of <a href=\"https://issafrica.org/iss-today/is-south-africa-s-crime-problem-turning-around\">64 people killed every day</a>, according to official statistics.</p><p>The three provinces selected for military deployments have a turbulent history with the armed forces, not least during the apartheid era when the regime used soldiers to unleash deadly crackdowns on antiapartheid activists.</p><p>“They were the enemy,” Jacobs said, recalling his own arrest in September 1987 during a student protest on the Cape Flats opposing the racist government, which was replaced in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340618\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340618\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340618\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Michael-Jacobs-5164-1772112650.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Jacobs at his office in Cape Town [Otha Fadana/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Today after three decades of democracy, poverty, unemployment and violent crime remain a major challenge in the area.</p><p>But Jacobs, like other critics of the military police, believes the new move will do little to cure the ills that he said gangs exploit to increase their influence. Children as young as eight years old are recruited into their ranks.</p><p>The Town Centre, a shopping mall that was once a hub of economic activity, has been reduced to a ghost town where the drug trade thrives despite the fact that it is right next to a police station, according to Jacobs.</p><p>For him, there is a direct link between the country’s economic decline and the flourishing of gang activity over the past decade on the Cape Flats, where working-class people have seen their livelihoods stripped away as the manufacturing sector shrank.</p><p>On an average weekday when children should be at school, he said, you see children and even women in their 60s in Mitchells Plain digging through rubbish bins to find glass, plastic or other things they can recycle and turn into income. “At least it will put something on the table.”</p><h2 id=\"plugging-a-haemorrhage\">Plugging a ‘haemorrhage’</h2><p>Social issues and not simply military intervention should be put at the heart of government anticrime efforts, analysts say.</p><p>“There’s no other way to describe it other than plugging a hole that is haemorrhaging at the moment with regards to these forms of organised crime,” said Ryan Cummings, director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm.</p><p>Irvin Kinnes, an associate professor with the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Criminology, pointed out that constitutionally the army is limited in the duties its members may perform among the civilian population. Their role will be largely to support police, who will retain control of all operations.</p><p>He fears the government has not learned lessons from previous army deployments in South Africa’s democratic era.</p><p>The army was dispatched to the Western Cape in 2019 during a previous spike in gang violence and was again sent in to help with the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions the following year.</p><p>“It’s a very dangerous thing to bring the army because there’s an impatience with the fact that the police are not doing their job. And so they come in with that mentality and want to beat up everybody and break people’s bones,” Kinnes said.</p><p>“We saw what happened in COVID. They killed people as the army. It’s not as if the police don’t kill people, but the point is, you don’t need the army to do that.”</p><p>To the government’s detractors, summoning the army is nothing more than an attempt at political heroics before local elections due to be held this year or in early 2027.</p><p>Kinnes pointed out that, according to police statistics, crime has been decreasing without the help of the army.</p><p>“It’s very much political. It’s to show that the political leaders have kind of heard the public. But the call for the army hasn’t come from the community. It’s come from politicians,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4310477\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4310477\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4310477\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-11-02T124816Z_358423518_RC1AE0FC5000_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-GANGS-1770950826.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Residents look on as police stand guard while South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visits crime ridden Hanover Park to launch a new Anti-Gang Unit, in Cape Town, South Africa November 2, 2018.

On Monday in his weekly newsletter, the president sought to separate the South African armed forces from their troubling past, listing several operations that benefitted communities, such as disaster relief efforts and law enforcement operations at the border.</p><p>He made it clear that the army’s role would merely be a supporting one “with clear rules of engagement and for specific time-limited objectives”.</p><p>Its presence may free up officers to focus on police work and would take place alongside other measures, such as strengthening antigang units and illegal mining teams, he said.</p><p>“Given our history, where the apartheid state sent the army into townships to violently suppress opposition, it is important that we do not deploy the [military] inside the country to deal with domestic threats without good reason,” Ramaphosa wrote.</p><p>Cummings said it was clear the president’s hand was forced amid an unrelenting wave of violence. “The rhetoric of the president up until now suggests that this was a directive that he was not necessarily too keen on implementing.”</p><p>On the ground, soldiers appear equally reluctant about their pending engagement.</p><p>Ntsiki Shongo is a soldier who was deployed in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told Al Jazeera, using a pseudonym, that any operation involving the police was almost certainly doomed.</p><p>“We [in the army] become so negative when we are working with them [the police] because always we don’t get what we need,” he said.</p><p>“We know how easy it is to get these gangsters, to get these drug lords, but unfortunately, the police, they are not cooperating with us because some of them are in cooperation with these criminals,” he charged. “Maybe they are scared for their lives because they are staying in the same areas with them.”</p><p>Shongo referred to an ongoing commission investigating police corruption that has implicated senior government officials and led to the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/13/south-african-police-minister-suspended-over-corruption-allegations\">suspension of national Police Minister Senzo Mchunu</a>.</p><p>“So this operation, … is it going to be a success? I don’t know. It all depends on the police,” he said, adding that he and his fellow soldiers long for the day the government lets the military solve the problem on its own.</p><p>“Even when we are just sitting having lunch as soldiers, we talk about the police. We pray that one day the state can say, ‘Let’s take the military inside the country and clean out all these weapons, all these guns, all these gangsters,’” he said.</p><p>“The military is ready, and they want to prove a point because we’ve been hungry for these things.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

United Kingdom on private jets that landed at Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) bases.</p><p>British newspaper The Telegraph reported on Thursday that Healey had told UK officials to search through two decades of Ministry of Defence files and “leave no stone unturned” in the hunt for any links between the late paedophile’s private jet and RAF facilities.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

launched by Healey comes days after former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged police to investigate whether the former prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, had used taxpayer-funded jet travel and RAF bases to meet with Epstein.</p><p>The Telegraph reported that Brown was particularly concerned about a private flight Epstein took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at an airbase in Norfolk in December 2000, before he visited the royal retreat of Sandringham with Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/ex-price-andrew-arrested-on-suspicion-of-misconduct-in-public-office\">arrested last week</a> over alleged misconduct in public office, while serving as the UK trade envoy, for

href=\"/news/2026/2/23/british-police-arrest-epstein-linked-ex-ambassador-mandelson\">Peter Mandelson</a> was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, despite his longtime ties to Epstein being well known.</p><p>“We are proceeding at pace to publish the first tranche of documents in early March,” a spokesperson for the intelligence committee said.</p><p>Mandelson, 72, was briefly arrested and then released by London’s Metropolitan Police as part of their investigation.</p><p>While Prime Minister Starmer fired Mandelson as ambassador last year following more revelations about his relationship with Epstein, the British leader is facing political fallout as questions remain over his decision to appoint him to the role of ambassador in the first place.</p><p>The European Union’s anti-fraud office OLAF also said on Thursday that it was looking into Mandelson’s actions while he was serving in Brussels as British commissioner for trade between 2004 and 2008, following a request from the European Commission.</p></div></div></body></html>"

New Delhi calls this separatism and views Nijjar and others in the movement as “terrorists”.</p><p>Following Nijjar’s killing, pressure mounted on Trudeau from the influential Sikh diaspora in Canada, demanding accountability. In October 2024, during an inquiry into foreign interference, Trudeau said there were “ever clearer indications” that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty by targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil.</p><p>India’s “actions”, Trudeau said, were a “horrific mistake”.</p><p>Canada also accused India of interfering in its domestic politics, including by providing funds to politicians whom New Delhi preferred. India firmly rejected the allegations, calling them “preposterous”, and urged Canada to take action against anti-Indian elements operating from its soil – an apparent reference to Sikh activists.</p><p>But Nijjar’s killing opened a can of worms for the Indian establishment. In November 2023, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian national with allegedly plotting to assassinate <a href=\"/news/2023/11/30/did-india-order-the-murder-of-a-us-sikh-separatist-heres-what-we-know\">Gurpatwant Singh Pannun</a>, an American lawyer and also a Sikh activist.</p><p>Nikhil Gupta, 54, accused of plotting to kill Pannun, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/indian-national-admits-role-in-us-sikh-leaders-assassination-plot\">pleaded guilty</a> to three criminal charges in a federal court in New York City earlier this month. He faces up to 40 years in prison for admitting to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p>Sikh activists in the United Kingdom were also reportedly warned of a threat from the Indian government.</p><p>Trudeau’s approach to the issue, in some sense, had become emblematic of the problem in bilateral ties, said Harsh Pant, a foreign policy analyst in New Delhi.</p><p>His confrontational approach “meant that issues that could have been dealt with at the bureaucratic level were elevated to the strategic level”, and it became difficult to disentangle the two, he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4341614\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4341614\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4341614\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-17T200914Z_1408408275_RC2C4FAUF7C6_RTRMADP_3_G7-SUMMIT-1772131938.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4341614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands before posing for a photo during the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, on June 17, 2025 [File: Amber Bracken/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"thaw-in-icy-relations\">Thaw in icy relations</h2><p>When Carney was <a href=\"/news/2025/3/9/who-is-mark-carney-canadas-new-liberal-leader-and-next-prime-minister\">elected new leader of the ruling Liberal Party</a> in 2025, he replaced Justin Trudeau amid historic tensions with the United States and fears of a trade war with the Trump administration. Carney took the stage, actively looking for new partners to mitigate this threat.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi leapt to congratulate him and immediately called on him “to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people”.</p><p>Soon, Carney had invited Modi to Canada for the G7 summit in June last year, where both leaders met on the sidelines. New envoys in both countries followed. Suddenly, everything had changed in the relationship, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst on South Asia.</p><p>“There is just more optimism and momentum for the relationship,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Under Carney, the Canadian government “recognises that this relationship is too important to let it flounder”.</p><p>The commercial incentives for Canada to get the relationship back on track are huge. “And that all starts with changing the tone and the mood,” Kugelman said. Hence, this week’s comments by Canadian officials that “India is no longer a threat”.</p><p>Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera that Ottawa has moved from a public, crisis-driven posture to a more deliberate, step-by-step “reset”.</p><p>Under Carney, “the emphasis is on rebuilding structured channels so security concerns – including transnational repression and interference – can be handled through sustained law enforcement and national security cooperation rather than megaphone diplomacy,” she argued.</p><p>“Ottawa is trying to do both at once: defend the rule of law at home while advancing areas of mutual interest abroad.”</p><p>But Carney’s change in approach does not mean the problem of threats against Sikh activists has vanished.</p><p>“Canadian officials definitely still worry about the transnational repression issue, and particularly as legal proceedings continue,” said Kugelman.</p><p>The current Canadian government is merely taking a different approach, he suggested: “a more ‘accommodationist’ approach – one that focuses on essentially working through this issue with India”.</p><p>Unlike the Canadian official in the background briefing, Foreign Minister Anita Anand evaded a direct question from reporters when quizzed about whether India is no longer considered a threat. Instead, she said, discussions on the issues of transnational violence are ongoing at the highest levels of both governments.</p><p>New Delhi will also want to address the challenges of “Khalistani extremism”, which will be a challenge for Carney, said Pant, who is vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4341621\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4341621\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4341621\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-17T214313Z_508775542_RC2F4FAJV0RY_RTRMADP_3_G7-SUMMIT-1772132084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4341621\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada, on June 17, 2025 [File: Amber Bracken/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-way-forward\">The way forward</h2><p>On Friday, Carney <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/27/canadian-pm-carney-heads-to-india-on-significant-trip-to-consolidate-ties\">began his two-day visit</a> to New Delhi, where the two prime ministers are holding talks at Hyderabad House and will review the India-Canada Strategic Partnership.</p><p>The Canadian PM is also expected to lock in deals on trade and investment, including on energy, critical minerals, agriculture, education, research and people-to-people ties.</p><p>Collaboration in these sectors will define the trajectory of this relationship going forward, said Pant.</p><p>Ultimately, the key external factor driving Carney’s visit to New Delhi is Trump’s trade war, said Kugelman. Both Canada and India have seen their relations with the US, a top trade partner, slide since Trump returned to the White House in January last year.</p><p>While India has somewhat <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\">stabilised its relations</a> with the US this year since trade negotiations reached the final stages, Ottawa and Washington remain at odds over their worldviews and international trade.</p><p>“[Carney’s approach] is part of a broader global trend that we’re seeing, countries that have worked with the US for a long time are now looking to strengthen ties with other partners,” said Kugelman. “From the perspective of Ottawa and New Delhi, it’s really a no-brainer that this relationship not only has to get back on track, but it also needs to be put in a position where it can grow even more.”</p><p>Nadjibulla of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada added that India is key to Canada’s efforts to reduce over-reliance on the US and to diversify its economic and strategic partnerships.</p><p>But unresolved issues, like the ones of transnational violence, undermine the durability of now-blooming bilateral ties, she added.</p><p>“If unresolved security allegations sit in the background without credible processes and enforcement cooperation, normalisation becomes politically brittle,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “Vulnerable to the next incident, leak, or court development.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

There are no restraints towards Israel at all, so the design is very colonial,” Shofwan added.</p><p>The board’s executive committee comprises Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner; US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East; Marc Rowen, CEO of Apollo Global Management; World Bank President Ajay Banga; former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Robert Gabriel Jr, US deputy national security adviser.</p><p>Palestinian participation in the board has been siloed into a “transitional committee” of apolitical technocrats led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.</p><p>Earlier this month, shortly after Prabowo signed on to the Board of Peace, representatives from some 40 civil society and religious groups in Indonesia met the president to discuss the Gaza mission, Indonesia’s state news agency Antara reported at the time.</p><p>Prabowo told the groups he was prepared to withdraw from the Board of Peace if it “fails to advance the goal of an independent Palestine”, Antara reported, citing Muhammad Cholil Nafis, vice chairman of Indonesia’s top Islamic advisory body.</p><p>Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also emphasised that the country’s troops will be in Gaza “solely to support Palestine’s recovery and its fight for independence and sovereignty”.</p><p>In addition to deploying troops to Gaza, Indonesia will also focus on humanitarian assistance and send several hospital ships.</p><p>But observers told Al Jazeera that Prabowo’s decision to join the Board of Peace reflected more his “personalised” style of leadership and his desire to be seen as a global player than a direct concern with the question of Palestine.</p><p>“We participated with peacekeepers in Lebanon and [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo, but now the new president wants to make Indonesia diplomatically stronger on the global level,” said Yon Machmudi, an expert in Indonesian politics and international relations, also at the University of Indonesia.</p><p>“This is also part of the motivation of the president to be involved in any kind of negotiations with the peace process,” he said.</p><p>“I think Prabowo truly wants to leave a significant legacy, remembered as a president active in global peace, not only in the Middle East but also in other regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war,” Machmudi said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325932\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325932\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325932\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-19T152221Z_1999133281_RC21PJAVWJ8M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-TRUMP-BOARD-1771563119.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and other world leaders attend the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., on February 19, 2026.

The White House initially planned to levy a “reciprocal” tariff of 32 percent on Indonesian exports, which was later cut down to 19 percent.</p><p>The Indonesian president late last week signed a formal trade deal with Trump on the sidelines of the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC. The deal kept tariff rates at 19 percent, while Indonesia agreed to cut tariffs on 99 percent of its US imports.

And India, with its 1.4 billion people, is a potentially large market for Canada’s vast petroleum and natural gas reserves, among other products.</p><p>But to build those economic bonds will require Carney to overcome diplomatic tensions and hesitancy about the costs of its exports, according to analysts.</p><p>“Canada domestically needs to figure out to what extent it wants to grow its oil and gas industry,” said Tarun Khanna, professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on energy policy.</p><p>“Improvement in the overall relationship can provide incentives to both nations.”</p><h2 id=\"repairing-a-diplomatic-rupture\">Repairing a diplomatic rupture</h2><p>Part of the hurdle for Carney is repairing recent diplomatic strains between his country and India.</p><p>The two countries engaged in a prolonged diplomatic freeze in September 2023, after Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alleged that India was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil.</p><p>India rejected the allegations as false, and both countries expelled each other’s diplomats.</p><p>A breakthrough came last year when Carney invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kananaskis, Alberta, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders’ summit in June.</p><p>Since then, relations have thawed. In September, both sides named new diplomats to serve as high commissioners to each other’s countries.</p><p>In the lead-up to this week’s meeting, more bilateral collaboration has unfolded. Officials from India and Canada have engaged in senior ministerial and working-level engagements in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), liquefied natural gas (LNG), critical minerals and supply chain resilience.</p><p>“This is a very significant visit and allows Prime Minister Carney to consolidate a reset that began in the relationship last year,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, a research institute.</p><h2 id=\"finding-alternative-trading-partners\">Finding alternative trading partners</h2><p>But the rapprochement with India also comes in a transition period for Canada.</p><p>The US has long been its primary trading partner: It is the only country it shares a border with. But since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the US has taken an aggressive stance towards trade with Canada.</p><p>Trump has stacked steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and automobile parts. He also suggested he would like Canada to cede its sovereignty and become a state within the US.</p><p>Carney has resisted such efforts, including by imposing counter-tariffs on US goods.</p><p>But in January, he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he outlined his vision for “middle-power” states to break from the superpowers that seek their “subordination”.</p><p>“From the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just,” Carney said.</p><p>“This is the task of the middle powers: the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and the most to gain from genuine cooperation.”</p><p>Carney’s trip to India, followed by Australia and Japan, is his first major trip to Asia following his Davos speech. Experts say the outing will give him a stage on which to spread his appeal for “genuine cooperation” among smaller economies.</p><p>“It allows him to take that message of middle-power diplomacy to India, Australia and Japan, the three most significant for Canada in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Nadjibulla.</p><p>The trip also comes at a time when, on the domestic front, Carney’s top priority is to strengthen economic resilience, make sure investments keep flowing into Canada, and protect industries that have been hit by Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>As part of that push, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/15/canadas-mark-carney-seeks-reset-on-pivotal-trip-to-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carney visited China last month</a>, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so in almost a decade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-market-for-canadian-energy\">A market for Canadian energy</h2><p>Carney’s latest trip is expected to yield announcements on Canadian exports of oil, natural gas, uranium and critical minerals, as well as cooperation with India on developing nuclear power as a clean energy source.</p><p>The outreach effort is “part of Carney’s strategy” to diversify its economic trading partners and find new markets for its products, according to MV Ramana, an expert in energy and security at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>Canada is the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and the fifth-largest oil producer overall. Its crude exports were valued at more than $100.7bn in 2024 alone.</p><p>But Ramana believes that negotiations will also centre on Canada’s uranium. The North American country is the world’s second-largest producer of the metal, which is key to nuclear power production.</p><p>“Canada is trying to position itself as an exporter, a petro-state of sorts — not just for oil and gas, but also critical minerals and uranium,” Ramana said.</p><p>India has a long history of nuclear cooperation with Canada, which provided it with a research reactor in the 1950s for its nascent nuclear programme.</p><p>It has continued to import uranium from Canada, and the two countries are in the midst of finalising a 10-year, $2.8bn deal that would ensure a supply of the metal to India.</p><p>Given that backdrop, Ramana said he expects to see announcements on small modular reactors for nuclear energy, even though there are currently only a few operating in Russia and China.</p><p>The first in North America — the Darlington New Nuclear Project — is in the works in Ontario, and Carney appears to be angling for Canada to become a leader in such small-scale reactors. But it won’t be easy, warned Ramana.</p><p>“These are supposed to be cheaper, but they also produce far less power. As a result, the cost per unit of power generation will be much higher,” he said.</p><p>Another complication is the fact that the licence for the modular reactor design is owned by a US company.</p><p>That means the US will need to be involved, said Ramana, a tricky balance as Carney continues to be in the crosshairs of Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"combination-of-price-and-strategic-decision\">‘Combination of price and strategic decision’</h2><p>With the largest population in the world, India’s already-huge energy demands are expected to keep increasing.</p><p>Khanna, the energy policy expert, said that means there is likely to be negotiation about fossil fuels as well during Carney’s trip.</p><p>“We don’t know what will materialise, but given the Indian energy situation, oil and gas is one thing that will be on the table,” said Khanna.</p><p>But India has also faced backlash under Trump about where it sources its energy supply from.</p><p>In August, the US president slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on India, doubling his tariffs on the South Asian nation to 50 percent, as a penalty for its import of Russian oil.</p><p>That was finally <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/trump-to-slash-us-tariffs-on-india-from-50-percent-to-18-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolled back</a> this month, and US tariffs on India were brought down to 18 percent, though that rate, among others, was overturned by a decision from the US Supreme Court.</p><p>Now, the current US tariffs on Indian imports sit at 10 percent. But experts have warned that Trump’s tariff policies have sown uncertainty among the US’s trading partners, including India.</p><p>So New Delhi is looking to secure its oil supplies, and Canada is looking for new buyers, Khanna said. But price will ultimately be the key.</p><p>“India is a price-sensitive market, so the Indian side will be looking for deals that secure supplies but at a reasonable price,” he pointed out.</p><p>If Ottawa seeks to increase its market, “then it’s up to them to see what kind of incentives they can hand out”, Khanna added.</p><p>For India to sign a deal, “it will have to be a combination of price and strategic decision”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We could hardly break it into smaller change or buy anything, as sellers don’t accept overused paper bills,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Moreover, the seller doesn’t accept it unless I spend it all, as they don’t have change.

A small group of traders effectively manages cash circulation through high-commission cashing operations.”</p><p>He said that when money itself becomes a traded commodity, it signals severe distortion in the monetary system. “Cash, like any commodity, becomes subject to supply and demand dynamics. When it becomes scarce, its value increases beyond its nominal worth. From an economic perspective, this represents a structural disruption of the monetary system.</p><p>“The formal banking sector and the Palestinian Monetary Authority were sidelined. What we are seeing is the neutralisation of the formal monetary system,” he said.</p><p>Abu Qamar said the deeper issue was confidence – not just in cash, but in the financial system as a whole. “Cash is inherently difficult to track, whereas electronic payments are traceable and can be frozen or restricted. Implementing such a transition abruptly produces severe economic and social distortions,” he warned.</p><p>“Widespread selling on credit is not a sign of market stability – it is an indicator of declining incomes and weakened purchasing power. When debt expands rapidly without a parallel increase in income, the result is social fragmentation. Approximately 95 percent of households in Gaza depend on aid,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4340209 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/When-money-is-scarce-every-choice-counts-bank-cash-or-on-credit.-1772105810.jpg?resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People purchasing goods at a grocery shop at Al-Zawya market [Ola al-Asi/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People shopping for goods at a grocery store in az-Zawya market [Ola al-Asi/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Profiteering from Gaza’s woes </strong></h2><p>The war has paved the way for middlemen to cash in illegally on the financial woes of Gaza, residents said.</p><p>Sukkar said that when her husband or sons needed cash, they were often forced to deal with brokers who charge a hefty commission that could reach 50 percent.</p><p>“We lose our money to them for nothing; they steal from us under our full consent,” she said.</p><p>Many residents, like Abu Harbeid, also do not trust bank transfers, saying they prefer physical cash in hand.</p><p>“I ask my sons, where does that money in the account appear?” said Sukkar.</p><p>“Who holds our money in their hands? I used to see money and count it, the banknotes and the change. On some days, when there are technical problems with the bank applications, we get nervous about the possibility of losing the money in their accounts,” she added.</p><p>Abdallah Sukkar, whose family ran a well-known family store in the Shujayea area in eastern Gaza before the war, said families who receive direct deposit salaries often buy with bank transfers.</p><p>“But I don’t like this method; I prefer cash,” he said.</p><p>He said he accepts all banknotes, whether new or worn-out ones, and allows people to buy on credit, but admitted that all of that affects his ability to make improvements to the roadside stall he now runs in place of his family’s old business.</p><p>He also complained of unpaid debts, adding that debts had soared by more than 500 percent during the war, while his profits barely reach 2 percent. He said he had given out 20,000 shekels’ worth of goods to new customers, “all of [whom] have become customers during the war”.</p><p>“People don’t have money; I can’t turn them away when they come to buy food on credit. It’s already catastrophic in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>“From the beginning of Ramadan till now, I haven’t had banknotes and change, which affects the sales. I don’t have small change to give to people who have cash, so they turn to other stalls or shops.</p><p>“Yesterday, when the bank application stopped, we were terrified that we might lose our money in the bank,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
