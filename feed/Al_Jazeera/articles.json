While the IMF wants the West African nation to undertake a painful restructuring before it will agree to a bailout, Senegal, which was recently downgraded to deep within “junk bond” status, is resisting this plan.</p><p>Earlier this month, credit rating agency S&amp;P lowered Senegal to CCC+, citing the fragile country’s poor government finances. “Despite actions taken to boost growth and tax collection, the level of debt and size of the interest bill mean Senegal’s public finances remain precarious, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive official support programme,” S&amp;P said on November 14.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Last year, the IMF suspended a $1.8bn funding package for Senegal after the government discovered $7bn in borrowing, which had been concealed by the previous administration.</p><p>Negotiations between Dakar and the IMF for a new bailout package are continuing as they hammer out what the government must do to restore public finances. But the two sides have so far failed to agree on a path forward.</p><h2 id=\"how-high-is-senegal-s-public-debt\">How high is Senegal’s public debt?</h2><p>In its latest <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3479905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rating review</a>, S&amp;P estimated Senegal’s public debt had risen to $42.1bn, or 119 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), at the end of 2024, making it one of the most indebted countries in Africa. That figure excluded about 9 percent of GDP in debt owed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).</p><p><span>Since 2008, Senegal has leaned heavily on borrowing to fund infrastructure projects. But during the <a href=\"/economy/2022/4/20/imf-world-bank-warn-of-huge-buildup-of-debt-in-poorest-nations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 crisis</a> and subsequent jump in global interest rates, </span>which made debt more expensive, costs soared as income fell. In turn, Senegal’s fiscal pressures grew significantly.</p><p>To address its debt load, the government is now hoping to shrink the fiscal deficit – the amount by which public spending exceeds taxes coming into the public purse – from 12.6 percent of GDP in 2024 to to 5.4 percent by next year and narrowing to just 3 percent of GDP by 2027.</p><p>But S&amp;P’s outlook is far less rosy. The agency is forecasting a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP next year and 6.8 percent of GDP in 2027. As such, S&amp;P estimates that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 123 percent next year, before falling slightly in 2027.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-led-to-the-current-impasse-with-the-imf\">What has led to the current impasse with the IMF?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2024/3/27/senegal-oppositions-faye-won-over-54-of-vote-full-provisional-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">March 2024</a>, Bassirou Diomaye Faye won Senegal’s presidential election. He <a href=\"/news/2024/3/15/we-want-sonko-senegal-opposition-boosted-after-leaders-freed-before-vote\">ran in place</a> of the disqualified opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, who had been barred from the election over a libel case involving the then-tourism minister. But after the vote, Sonko became Faye’s prime minister.</p><p>In September 2024, the new <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/senegals-ruling-pastef-party-secures-large-majority-in-parliament\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pastef party</a> government ordered an audit of the country’s public finances. Senegal’s court of auditors discovered that the previous administration, under President Macky Sall, had significantly understated the level of public debt.</p><p>The court estimated that Senegal’s real debt-to-GDP ratio was closer to 100 percent, compared with the roughly 70 percent which had earlier been reported, revealing almost $7bn in undisclosed borrowing, which largely stemmed from not including the liabilities of SOEs.</p><p><span>The IMF endorsed the auditors’ assessment, calling it a “conscious decision” by the Sall administration to mask the true extent of Senegal’s debt. The IMF then suspended its $1.8bn loan package with</span> Senegal, which it had approved in 2023.</p><p>IMF loan packages are typically paid over in tranches. By the time it pulled the plug on the Senegal programme, the IMF has already disbursed $700m of the full amount. The IMF’s executive board must now decide whether to continue with the arrangement. If its review goes against Dakar, the board could ask the government to repay the disbursed funds.</p><p>If its review is favourable, the IMF could decide to keep the programme in place and release the next instalment of funding soon.</p><p>For context, the IMF’s $1.8bn loan is equivalent to roughly half of Senegal’s 2024 deficit. The upshot is that it would provide essential funds for public spending. Without it, Senegal will face a big financing shortfall.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135880\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135880\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135880\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024-03-24T135203Z_1869916670_RC2AS6A1TV7X_RTRMADP_3_SENEGAL-ELECTION-1764257606.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Faye\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Presidential candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye, backed by Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, gestures after casting his vote in the presidential election at the polling station at Ndiaganiao in Mbour, Senegal, on March 24, 2024 [Abdou Karim Ndoye/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-hasn-t-the-imf-reached-a-decision-about-this-yet\">Why hasn’t the IMF reached a decision about this yet?</h2><p>On November 6, following a two-week visit to the West African nation, the IMF mission chief for Senegal, Edward Gemayel, said, “We’re engaged and determined to move as fast as possible to help.”</p><p>A few days later, Prime Minister Sonko revealed that Gemayel’s team had urged Senegal to carry out a restructuring – in which old debt is swapped for new debt with longer maturities, lower interest rates, or a reduced debt stock – so the country repays less. But these arrangements generally lead to reduced public spending and slower growth.</p><p>Countries that default on their debt typically struggle because they are forced to cut spending to stabilise their finances, leaving less money for public services and investment. Investor confidence also tends to fall, making it harder and more expensive for governments to borrow.</p><p>At a meeting of Pastef officials on November 8, Sonko, who has considerable influence over economic policy, said he had rejected the IMF’s proposal to restructure Senegal’s debt. But his decision to reject the IMF’s plan has left Dakar with few options to narrow his country’s fiscal gap.</p><p>Looking ahead, the prime minister will have to convince the Washington-based IMF to release its paused loan by presenting a credible fiscal plan that restores Senegal’s finances without resorting to a debt restructuring.</p><p>But Gemayel has already cautioned that the government’s 2026 budget is “very ambitious”, citing large tax increases. “We’ve never seen this before,” he said. “So, they need to be careful.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-impact-of-this-been-on-senegal-s-economy\">What has the impact of this been on Senegal’s economy?</h2><p>Sonko’s decision to reject the IMF’s restructuring plan has rattled investors. On Monday, November 10 – the first trading day after Sonko’s cabinet meeting – Senegal’s 2031-dollar bonds fell by 4 percent to $73.1. Elsewhere, its notes due in 2048 fell by 2.4 cents to $60.30.</p><p>“The bonds dropped as market players reacted to the IMF having requested a restructuring,” said Leeuwner Esterhuysen, an Africa analyst at Oxford Economics. “There’s clearly a high degree of debt distress and little prospect of IMF funding anytime soon.”</p><p>“It seems the Fund is making a new loan contingent on Dakar accepting a restructuring,” Esterhuysen told Al Jazeera. “For now, the government isn’t playing ball … which will extend the stalemate,” he said.</p><p>Another sign of market anxiety is that the cost of insurance against default – in the form of credit-default swaps – almost doubled in the days leading up to November 12, rising from 750 to 1,120 basis points, or 3.7 percentage points.</p><p>During a speech at a rally in Dakar on November 11, Sonko insisted, “Senegal is a proud nation. We will not be treated like a failed state. Mobilising tax revenue is better than accepting a debt restructuring.”</p><p>Since 2020, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Chad have all been forced to <a href=\"/features/2023/7/4/is-a-global-debt-bomb-about-to-explode\">restructure their debt</a>. But the long and drawn-out process, and accompanying economic hardship, have made debt rewrites unpalatable for other African governments.</p><p>Kenya, another debt-strapped country, instead opted for costly trade-offs – tax hikes and subsidy cuts – last year. The measures were aimed at reducing Kenya’s budget deficit. But they also sparked <a href=\"/features/2024/6/27/not-afraid-to-die-kenya-tax-protests-inspire-broader-demand-for-change\">deadly protests</a>, highlighting the political risks associated with austerity.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135888\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135888\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024-03-21T050227Z_531916148_RC2QP6ATVCBP_RTRMADP_3_SENEGAL-ELECTION-1764257756.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Faye Sonko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An electoral billboard for the Senegalese presidential candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye, backed by opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, in Dakar, Senegal, on March 20, 2024 [Luc Gnago/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-this-affected-the-political-situation-in-senegal\">How has this affected the political situation in Senegal?</h2><p>Sonko is opposed to an IMF-backed restructuring because “he doesn’t want to undermine his 2024 election campaign pledge to restore Senegal’s sovereignty”, said Paul Melly, a consulting fellow on the Africa programme at Chatham House.</p><p>Melly also noted that Sonko is contending with “tensions” between himself and President Faye. Earlier this month, it emerged that Sonko’s party rejected Faye’s attempt to lead a revamped coalition, a move viewed as an effort to consolidate power.</p><p>And though Sonko serves under Faye, he is widely viewed as a key power broker, often shaping policy on his own terms. “Sonko was never going to be a subordinate prime minister,” Melly told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As such, Senegal’s fiscal position represents a major political challenge for Sonko. He still wants to assert his “sovereignty” line, but may need to impose unpopular spending cuts to stay ahead of debt repayments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-else-could-senegal-address-its-debt-problem\">How else could Senegal address its debt problem?</h2><p>In recent weeks, the government has introduced new levies on tobacco, alcohol, gambling and widely used mobile money transfers. It has also made efforts to cut back on travel outlays and car purchases as part of its internal efforts to cut spending.</p><p>“It’s a tricky balance,” said Melly.  “Expectations remain high even as the economic challenges are huge.”</p><p>If the government concedes to the IMF, “it may result in voter disillusionment at the next municipal elections in early 2027.” It may also result in civil strife.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If they do not pull back, we will achieve this by military means,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine has said that such a withdrawal would leave the way open for a Russian assault on its capital, Kyiv.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-president-has-lost-his-legitimate-status\">‘The president has lost his legitimate status’</h2><p>Putin also suggested that he was open to a negotiated settlement with Kyiv, but once again branded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government illegitimate, adding that it was “legally impossible” to sign any agreements with them.</p><p>“Broadly speaking, of course, we ultimately want to reach an agreement with Ukraine. But right now, this is practically impossible,” Putin said, repeating previous unfounded claims that Kyiv had lost the right to govern after failing to hold elections when Zelenskyy’s presidential term expired in May 2024.</p><p>“The Ukrainian leadership made a fundamental strategic mistake when it feared presidential elections, because since then, the president has lost his legitimate status,” Putin added.</p><p>Kyiv has maintained it could not hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russian attacks. In February, lawmakers in Ukraine’s parliament <a href=\"/news/2025/2/25/ukrainian-parliament-affirms-zelenskyys-legitimacy\">overwhelmingly approved</a> a resolution affirming Zelenskyy’s legitimacy to stay in office.</p><p>Putin also claimed that, due to the Zelenskyy government’s purported illegitimacy, any peace deal must be recognised by the international community, and that the international community must also recognise Russian gains in Ukraine.</p><p>The Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reiterated on Thursday that Zelenskyy “will not sign away territory”.</p><p>“As long as Zelenskyy is president, no one should count on us giving up territory,” Yermak told US magazine The Atlantic.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, the US revealed a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point peace plan</a> for Ukraine that was widely viewed as extremely favourable to Russia.

Three candidates have surged to the front of the race, but none has taken a definitive lead in the polls.</p><p>They include Rixi Moncada from the LIBRE party; Nasry Asfura from the right-wing National Party; and Salvador Nasralla from the centrist Liberal Party.</p><p>The race, however, has been marred by accusations of fraud and election-tampering.</p><p>Those allegations have raised tensions in Honduras, whose political system is still recovering from the legacy of a United States-backed 2009 <a href=\"/news/2019/6/28/ten-years-after-coup-hondurans-flee-amid-violence-and-repression\">military coup</a> that was followed by a period of repression and contested elections.</p><p>“Honduras is heading into these elections amid mounting political pressure on electoral authorities, public accusations of fraud from across the political spectrum, and paralysis within key electoral bodies,” said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas division at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.</p><p>“These dynamics have created real uncertainty about the integrity of the process.”</p><p>Who are the candidates, what will voting look like, and what are the stakes of the election? We answer these questions and more in this brief explainer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-election\">When is the election?</h2><p>The election will take place in a single round of voting, held on November 30.

That group, however, is restricted to voting on the presidential candidates.</p><p>Voting is obligatory in Honduras, but there are no penalties for those who do not participate.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-candidates\">Who are the candidates?</h2><p>Three of the five presidential candidates have emerged as main challengers in the race.</p><p>Competing as the candidate for the left-leaning LIBRE Party is Rixi Moncada, a close confidant of President Castro who has served first as her finance minister, from 2022 to 2024, and later as her secretary of defence.</p><p>Moncada resigned that position in May to pursue her presidential bid.</p><p>If elected, she has pledged to “democratise the economy”, pushing back against efforts to privatise state services. Her platform also promises greater access to credit for small businesses and a crackdown on corporate corruption.</p><p>Another contender is Salvador Nasralla, a familiar face in Honduran politics. A candidate for the centrist Liberal Party, he is running for president for a fourth time.</p><p>A 72-year-old with a background in civil engineering, Nasralla formerly served as Castro’s vice president before resigning in April 2024.</p><p>Nasralla has said that he will streamline government functions while seeking to bring informal workers, who make up a large portion of the country’s labour force, into the formal economy.</p><p>Finally, running as the candidate for the right-leaning National Party is Nasry “Tito” Asfura.</p><p>Previously a mayor and representative for the capital of Tegucigalpa, Asfura has said he will run the country as an “administrator” and “executor”, promoting pro-business policies to attract investment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135921\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135921\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135921\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25328122083756-1764258908.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Honduran candidate Salvador Nasralla cheer at a political event\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of the Liberal Party cheer for presidential candidate Salvador Nasralla during his campaign’s closing event in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on November 23 [Delmer Martinez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-foreign-relations-played-a-role-in-the-election\">How have foreign relations played a role in the election?</h2><p>On foreign relations, Moncada is expected to continue her predecessor’s pursuit of closer ties with countries <a href=\"/news/2023/6/5/honduran-president-set-to-visit-china-after-establishing-ties\">such as China</a> and support for other left-wing figures in the region.</p><p>Both Nasralla and Asfura have said they will orient Honduras towards the US and its allies, including Israel and Taiwan.</p><p>On Wednesday, in the waning days of the presidential race, US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Asfura.</p><p>Trump also cast Honduras’s presidential race as part of his broader campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, blaming the South American leader for drug trafficking and the establishment of left-wing governments across the region. There is no basis for Trump’s claims, and the US president has a history of intervening in the politics of other countries on behalf of right-wing allies.</p><p>“Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115618236412963848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform Truth Social.</p><p>“The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against Maduro, is Tito Asfura.”</p><h2 id=\"what-do-the-polls-say\">What do the polls say?</h2><p>Though pre-election surveys have shown Moncada, Nasralla and Asfura to be in the lead, no clear frontrunner has emerged.</p><p>In September, a <a href=\"https://x.com/cidgallup/status/1973141261264515198\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> released by the firm CID Gallup found that Nasralla had 27 percent support, Moncada 26 and Asfura 24. Those percentages separating the three candidates were within the poll’s margin of error.</p><p>An additional 18 percent of respondents in that survey indicated they were undecided.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-election-integrity-been-a-concern\">Why has election integrity been a concern?</h2><p>Questions of corruption have long dogged Honduras’s fragile democracy, and this election season has brought those fears back to the fore.</p><p>During the March primaries, for instance, there were “irregularities” in the distribution of election materials, and some polling stations reported delays, long lines and thin staffing that forced the vote to stretch late into the night.</p><p>There has also been discord between the two government agencies that handle Honduras’s elections: the National Electoral Council (CNE) and the Electoral Justice Tribunal.</p><p>Congress elects the main leaders for each of the two agencies. But both the tribunal and the CNE have been targeted for investigation recently.</p><p>In October, prosecutors opened a criminal probe into CNE leader Cossette Lopez over alleged plans for an “electoral coup”.</p><p>The Joint Staff of the Armed Forces has also asked the CNE for a copy of a vote tally sheet for the presidential race on election day, prompting concerns over possible interference by the armed forces.</p><p>The Electoral Justice Tribunal, meanwhile, has faced an investigation into whether it has voted without all of its members present.</p><p>Both President Castro and members of the opposition have spoken about the potential for fraud in Sunday’s vote, heightening scrutiny on the vote.</p><p>Organisations such as Human Rights Watch and the Organization of American States (OAS) have expressed concern over the pressure facing election officials.</p><p>“What matters most now is that electoral institutions are allowed to operate independently, that the Armed Forces adhere strictly to their limited constitutional role, and that all political actors refrain from actions or statements that could inflame tensions or undermine public trust,” said Goebertus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He had never previously held elected office.</p><p>His brief tenure, which lasted only around 16 months, was defined by frequent shake-ups among his top ministers and clashes with the opposition-led Congress.</p><p>Castillo’s arrest in 2022 sparked pushback from Indigenous residents and his rural base, members of which blocked roads, particularly in Peru’s south.</p><p>The unrest fuelled <a href=\"/opinions/2023/2/15/understanding-the-crisis-in-peru\">widespread, years-long protests</a> across the country. His successor, former Vice President Dina Boluarte, oversaw a brutal crackdown of those demonstrations that left at least 50 people dead.</p><p>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has accused the government of using “disproportionate, indiscriminate and lethal use of force” in its response to the protests.</p><p>Boluarte, the country’s first female president, was subsequently impeached in October, amid concerns about rising crime and investigations into her behaviour. She has been replaced by the right-wing politician Jose Jeri, who previously was the head of Peru’s Congress.</p><p>Thursday’s sentencing caps a nine-month trial punctuated by a diplomatic rift.</p><p>During the court proceedings, the Mexican embassy granted asylum to Castillo’s former prime minister, Betssy Chavel, who was also facing charges related to the former president’s effort to consolidate power.</p><p>Peru’s government <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/peru-bans-mexicos-president-sheinbaum-as-diplomatic-dispute-grows\">subsequently labelled</a> Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, a vocal supporter of Castillo, “persona non grata”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Castillo has been denied the possibility of serving his sentence under house arrest.

The Civil War spanned from 1861 to 1865, and nearly 700,000 soldiers were killed.</p><p>The proclamation for the national holiday came about after a campaign led by <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/5393-the-woman-behind-thanksgiving#:~:text=%2C%20and%20plenty.%E2%80%9D-,Abraham%20Lincoln,death%20of%20her%20lawyer%20husband.\">Sarah Hale</a>, a poet, editor and activist, that began in 1846.

Both were joint-stock trading companies, much like the British East India Company, which was set up in India in 1608.</p><p>This was still more than a century and a half before the US was born.</p><p>The goals of these British trading companies were to find gold, search for trade routes and compete with other European powers.</p><p>The first settlement by the English in the New World was in 1607 when the Jamestown colony was established on the banks of the James River in present day Virginia. This was the ancestral home of the Powhatan Indigenous people.</p><p>In 1619, the first recorded African slaves were brought to the colony to work in the profitable tobacco fields.</p><p>Jamestown as a colony was ravaged by famine, disease and resistance from Indigenous communities.</p><p>On November 11, 1620, a group of 102 English families, known as the Pilgrims, reached present-day Provincetown Harbor, Massachusetts, before anchoring their ship, the Mayflower, in present-day Plymouth Harbour on December 16.

She worked for the armed forces for nearly 20 years, and after she retired, she began a journey to get her tribe recognised by federal authorities.</p><p>“I took my combat boots off and put my moccasins back on to try to help our people as much as I can,” Locklear says.</p><p>Her tribe is almost 60,000 people strong, and she has been recently to Capitol Hill with help from North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis to fight for her tribe’s chance for federal recognition.

But the government instead carved up the new Native homelands into smaller, fixed allotments under federal oversight.</p><p>As their descendants grew, the size of individual land holdings shrank. “So there’s a lot of Natives here that have like a half an acre [2,023sq metres] left or a quarter of an acre [1,011sq metres] or they’ve lost all their land,” Carpella explains.</p><h2 id=\"indian-reorganization-act\">1939 – impact of Indian Reorganization Act</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4135671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135671\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135671\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/service-gmd-gmd370-g3701-g3701g-ct002650-copy-1764252643.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Dept. of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, 1939.

Oklahoma, where Carpella lives, is a case in point.</p><p>A 2020 Supreme Court ruling declared a large portion of eastern Oklahoma as “Indian” country.</p><p>“But 80 percent of the people who live here are not Native and they live within cities, so it’s like this overlapping concept of municipalities on top of sovereign nations. And so you have regular police officers and then you have tribal police officers and then you have Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers,” he explained.</p><p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the US federal agency responsible for managing relations with American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, overseeing land, services and treaty obligations. It is housed within the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, and led by a presidentially appointed director. Many employees in the BIA are Natives, especially for tribal liaison, education and culture programmes.</p><p>As a result, Carpella says, there is a constant battle over jurisdiction. “Our cars have tribal plates, so police don’t want to stop us because we have a Native American licence plate,” he explains. If they are stopped, they have to call the tribal police, starting a time-consuming exercise.</p><p>“In our treaties, it says that Native people can hunt whenever we want wherever we want in Oklahoma in perpetuity without government intervening, but what happens is the state government will send out its wildlife officers to give tickets to individual citizens that are just out there hunting deer for their family,” he says.</p><h2 id=\"native-americans-today\">Native Americans today</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4135710\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135710\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/idc1-028635-1764253298.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Bureau of Indian Affairs -Department of Interior - US Government June 2016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Bureau of Indian Affairs June 2016]</figcaption></figure><p>Carpella has spent the past 15 years putting together a map based on Native peoples’ voices and memories passed down from generation to generation about where their people came from and what languages they spoke.</p><p>This open source map is unique in the US. Carpella uses this map to do workshops in educational institutes to spread awareness. He copyrighted his map in 2012.</p><p>“I used to be an activist. I felt like I was outside of the fence, like shaking the fence trying to change at a city council meeting or at a school, trying to get them to change a racist mascot or something. And now I have these products that are in the schools changing minds,” Carpella says.</p><p>“It’s really good to see that there’s a growing awareness. I think 20 years ago, half of Americans didn’t even know that Native Americans still existed,” he says, citing polls that indicated at the time that about half of Americans thought Indigenous Americans were ”all gone”.</p><p>According to the 2020 US census, 9.6 million people in the US identify as having Native American heritage, which is an 85 percent increase from 2010. The growth is mainly attributed to how data are collected.</p><p>The blood quantum policy, created by the US government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, defined Native identity by calculating the fraction of “Indian blood” a person carried, often requiring at least one quarter to qualify. Many tribes say it is a colonial system that divides families and threatens the long-term survival of Native nations.</p><p>According to Locklear, there is no universal meaning of the word “Indian” in the United States.</p><p>“If both parents are Native, the child is considered 100 percent [Native],” he says. “If mixed-race parents, the child would be half, three-quarters, one-eighth or something like that.”</p><p>“Over time, blood quantum was a genocidal policy because it helps limit membership or citizenship over time,” Locklear says. “One of our sovereign powers is to decide who can be a Lumbee citizen. I think this right is essential to our ability to self-govern.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135687\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135687\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Native-American-Nations-NO-Borders-1764252864.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Courtesy Tribal Nations/Aaron Carpella\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Courtesy Tribal Nations Maps/Aaron Carpella]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

One 34-year-old woman was struck on the head and spent nearly a month in a coma.</p><p>As of 2025, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade has only been cancelled three times, from 1942 to 1944, in an effort to conserve materials during World War II. It has never been cancelled due to the weather.</p><p>This year’s edition features 34 giant, helium-filled balloons, including new entries like the Disney character Buzz Lightyear, the video game character Pac-Man and the plumber Mario from the game Super Mario Bros.</p><p>The star of the Wicked film series Cynthia Erivo and singers from the Netflix hit K-Pop Demon Hunters made appearances as the parade’s 28 floats sailed down the street.</p><p>Macy’s estimates that 3.5 million people line the streets each year to see the parade, and more than 50 million watch the event’s broadcast.</p><p>The parade snakes across four kilometres (2.5 miles) in downtown New York, travelling along Central Park West and 6th Avenue to end in front of the Macy’s flagship store.</p><p>The widely watched event has also been a magnet for protests, with Palestinian solidarity demonstrators briefly blocking the parade route last year and in 2023 to draw attention to Israeli human rights abuses in Gaza and the West Bank.</p></div></div></body></html>"
