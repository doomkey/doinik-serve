Israel completely blocked aid to the Strip from March this year, claiming that Hamas was stealing aid provided by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Israel did not provide any evidence for this and also blocked UNRWA workers from entering the Strip from February.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While the UNRWA network operated about 400 sites across the Strip before that, the GHF, guarded by armed US private security contractors, set up only <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/5/29/visual-guide-to-how-the-gaza-aid-distribution-turmoil-unfolded\">four “mega-sites”</a> – three in southern Gaza and one near Gaza City – to distribute food and other aid to Gaza’s population of about two million Palestinians.</p><p>Furthermore, since the organisation began operations in Gaza in May, Israeli forces and some US contractors have routinely opened fire on Palestinians arriving to receive aid. Disorganisation around the sites has caused large crowds to gather, and some people have suffocated or died in stampedes.</p><p>While GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement on Monday that the organisation delivered the “only aid operation that reliably and safely provided free meals directly to Palestinian people in Gaza”, more than 2,000 aid seekers have been crushed to death or killed by gunfire, according to UN figures.</p><p>Here is how the GHF “mission” to Gaza unfolded this year:</p><p><strong>May 26 –</strong> GHF issues a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/26/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-to-launch-aid-deliveries-despite-losing-chief\">statement</a> announcing it will begin direct aid delivery inside the battered enclave, hours after its executive director, Jake Wood, resigned, citing concerns about the agency’s independence. The UN and other aid agencies refuse to work with GHF, warning that requiring Palestinians to gather at a few centralised aid points would put people at risk and undermine other aid efforts.</p><p><strong>May 27</strong> – GHF begins operating in Gaza. Israeli forces open fire on thousands of Palestinians attempting to receive food in southern Gaza’s Rafah area, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens. Aid seekers are forced to clamber over fences and <a href=\"/gallery/2025/5/27/photos-thousands-of-palestinians-crowd-a-controversial-aid-centre-in-gaza\">push through packed crowds</a> to reach life-saving supplies. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric says seeing thousands of Palestinians storming the aid site is “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/heartbreaking-chaos-in-gaza-as-starving-palestinians-seek-us-israeli-aid\">heartbreaking</a>” as the chaos underscores the staggering level of hunger gripping Gaza. Gaza’s Government Media Office calls the incident a “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/heartbreaking-chaos-in-gaza-as-starving-palestinians-seek-us-israeli-aid\">deliberate massacre</a> and a full-fledged war crime.”</p><p><strong>May 29</strong> – Israeli forces open fire at an aid point in southern Gaza, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. Shortly after, multiple <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/two-dead-after-crowds-rush-un-aid-warehouse-amid-gaza-hunger-crisis\">explosions</a> are reported near another aid centre on the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip. It is not clear what caused the blasts, and there are no reports of casualties.</p><p><strong>May 30</strong> – Israeli forces <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/5/30/live-israel-forces-new-displacement-in-north-gaza-as-strikes-intensify\">open fire</a> on civilians waiting to collect food at a GHF distribution point on Salah al-Din Street in central Gaza, wounding at least 20 people.</p><p><strong>June 1</strong> – Israeli tanks <a href=\"/news/2025/6/1/israel-kills-32-palestinians-waiting-for-food-at-us-backed-gaza-aid-sites\">kill at least 32 Palestinians</a> waiting to get food at two aid distribution sites in Gaza, leaving more than 200 others injured.</p><p><strong>June 3</strong> – UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the killing and injuring of Palestinian aid seekers is “unacceptable” and calls for an independent investigation after Israeli forces open fire close to an aid distribution site in Rafah. Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 27 Palestinians have been killed in the incident and 90 injured.</p><p><strong>June 8</strong> – At least 13 Palestinians are killed, and more than 150 are injured when Israeli troops and US security contractors open fire on crowds waiting for food near two aid distribution sites in Gaza, one east of Rafah and another near the Wadi Gaza Bridge. Gaza’s Government Media Office accuses Israel of turning distribution sites into “<a href=\"/news/2025/6/8/gaza-aid-sites-branded-human-slaughterhouses-under-deadly-israeli-fire\">human slaughterhouses</a>”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>July 16</strong> – At least 21 Palestinians are killed at a GHF aid distribution centre in southern Gaza.

At least 15 people died of suffocation, while others were shot. Twenty-four-year-old Mohammed Abedin, who survived the incident, told Al Jazeera that they were “<a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/suffocation-stampede-death-tragedy-at-gazas-aid-centre\">shot at like animals</a>”.</p><p><strong>July 22</strong> – The United Nations says the number of Palestinians killed while trying to access food in Gaza from GHF distribution points has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">topped 1,000</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3848760\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3848760\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3848760\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-Israel-Gaza-Aid-under-tank-fire-july-21-2025-1753099771.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel - Gaza -Aid under tank fire - july 21, 2025-1753099771\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3848760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p><strong>August 1</strong> – A former contractor for GHF, Anthony Aguilar, tells Al Jazeera about what he describes as the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/8/1/hear-from-the-former-guard-blowing-the-whistle-on-ghf-aid-sites-in-gaza\">deadly and unprofessional practices</a> he witnessed firsthand at aid distribution sites in Gaza.

against a backdrop of poor public finances and widespread public discontent with the governing Labour Party.</p><p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the onerous task of restoring the public finances to health, while upholding a number of pledges that leave her with little manoeuvring room on taxes and spending.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Economists say that Reeves will have little choice but to compromise on her plans as she faces what a leading think tank has dubbed an “impossible trilemma”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-budget-so-challenging-for-the-uk-government\">Why is this budget so challenging for the UK government?</h2><p>The UK has struggled with weak economic growth, high inflation and a rapidly expanding national debt for years.</p><p>After Germany, the UK has had the weakest economic performance among the Group of Seven (G7) countries in the post-COVID era.</p><p>GDP grew just 1.7 percent from the final quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2024, compared with 8.7 percent in the US, 5.1 percent in Canada, and 4.6 percent in Italy, according to government data.</p><p>While Labour promised to revive the economy upon its election in a landslide victory in July last year, economic conditions continue to be difficult.</p><p>While the economy had a strong start to 2025 – putting the UK on track to be the best-performer in the G7 after the US – growth slowed to a meagre 0.1 percent in the quarter ending in September.</p><p>At the same time, the UK’s borrowing costs have soared, with the interest rate on long-term government bonds in September hitting its highest level in nearly 30 years.</p><p>In October alone, the UK government borrowed 17.4 billion pounds to cover the gap between tax revenues and spending.</p><p>Reeves, whose Labour Party campaigned against spending cuts after years of austerity policies under the Conservatives, has made the already difficult task of drafting her budget more challenging with a number of self-imposed pledges.</p><p>Reeves’s “fiscal rules” dictate that the exchequer should balance day-to-day spending and reduce the national debt by 2029-30 – all without raising income tax, VAT or national insurance.</p><p>Reeves raised taxes by about 40 billion pounds ($52.6bn) in last year’s budget – the biggest hike in revenue-raising measures in decades – in what she cast as a one-off dose of pain needed to put the government’s finances on an even keel.</p><p>Despite the tax hikes, Reeves has once again found herself facing a major shortfall between spending and revenues amid the rising cost of government borrowing.</p><p>National Institute of Economic and Social Research, one of the UK’s top think tanks, estimated earlier this year that Reeves would need to find another 41.2 billion pounds to meet her targets – leaving her with the “impossible trilemma” of higher taxes, reduced spending or amended fiscal rules.</p><p>Other estimates, including more recent assessments based on improved economic data, have put the fiscal “black hole” closer to 20 billion pounds ($26.3bn).</p><p>“I do think it is a particularly challenging budget in that the Government is caught between their commitments to avoiding deep cuts to public services, not raising taxes for working people, and self-imposed fiscal rules and a jittery bond market,” Jasper Kenter, an economics professor at Aberystwyth University in Wales, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They are also suffering from major hangovers from the last government, who put in place significant tax cuts to national insurance shortly before they left as a failed electoral stunt.”</p><p>After backtracking on an income tax hike that would have broken Labour’s manifesto pledge, Reeves is expected to announce other revenue-raising measures, including a tax on properties worth more than 2 million pounds ($2.6m) and a freeze on adjustments to the income tax thresholds.</p><p>In the lead-up to the budget, Labour’s standing in the polls has plummeted, falling far behind the right-wing populist Reform UK.</p><p>Costas Milas, an economics professor at the University of Liverpool, said Reeves had exacerbated the UK’s economic difficulties with conflicting signals in the run-up to the budget.</p><p>“Investors are unwilling to invest in the economy until they see what economic measures she will actually implement,” Milas told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Consumers are also worried and therefore hesitant to consume and spend, at least until they see what extra taxes they will be faced with.”</p><h2 id=\"why-has-the-uk-economy-struggled-in-recent-years\">Why has the UK economy struggled in recent years?</h2><p>Some of the UK’s difficulties stem from factors shared by almost all developed economies, in particular, falling birth rates and rising welfare bills.</p><p>But more so than many of its peers, the UK has had a longstanding problem with low labour productivity growth.</p><p>In 2023, the UK’s labour productivity (GDP per hour worked) placed it fourth among the G7 nations.</p><p>However, productivity growth in the UK has lagged behind its peers in recent decades.</p><p>GDP per hour worked in the UK grew only about 6 percent from 2007 to 2022, according to OECD data, compared to 17 percent in the United States, 12 percent in Japan and 11 percent in Germany.</p><p>Economists have blamed the productivity gap on years of chronic underinvestment resulting from austerity policies introduced in the wake of the 2007-08 global financial crisis.</p><p>According to a PwC analysis of World Bank figures, the UK’s investment spending from 2017 to 2021 was equal to 18 percent of GDP, compared with 25 percent of GDP in Japan, 23 percent in France and 21 percent in the US.</p><p>Brexit has been widely blamed for exacerbating the post-financial crisis trend.</p><p>The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the UK’s exit from the bloc will reduce long-term productivity by 4 percent.</p><p>Jonathan Daniel Portes, an economist at King’s College London, said the UK needed to tackle long-run structural problems, including by undertaking “pro-growth tax reform” and “reversing anti-growth policies on immigration and universities”.</p><p>“I expect significant tax rises but no major tax reform. I don’t think it will make a huge difference,” Portes told Al Jazeera, describing his expectations for the budget.</p><p>Michael Ben-Gad, a professor of economics at City St George’s, University of London, said the UK could benefit from tinkering with the tax system, but it will be unable to avoid reforms to its welfare state over the longer term.</p><p>“Pay-as-you-go national pension schemes were designed for a growing population or at least one that was stable,” Ben-Gad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“No one anticipated either below replacement fertility or the lengthening of life-spans when modern welfare states were introduced.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two years later, Kelly was re-elected to a full term. In the Senate, he has focused on national security and the military.</p><h2>Is Kelly right about ‘illegal orders’?</h2><p>According to Bruce Fein, a lawyer specialising in constitutional and international law and who served as Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice under former President Ronald Reagan, Kelly was “simply echoing the law”.</p><p>“[For example] a member of the United States Armed Forces is required to disobey a clearly illegal order of a superior. There is no ‘following orders’ defence,” Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Lt William Calley was convicted of war crimes for the [1968] My Lai Massacre against civilians in Vietnam. His ‘following orders’ defence was rejected,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pentagon-investigation-about-then\">What is the Pentagon investigation about, then?</h2><p>In a statement posted on X on Monday, the Pentagon said it had received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly, suggesting that the video had interfered with the “loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.</p><p>“A thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures. This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,” the statement read.</p><p>“All service members are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice] to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful. A service member’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it added.</p><p>On the same day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X that the “seditious six” lawmakers in the video were “despicable, reckless, and false”.</p><p>“Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion – which only puts our warriors in danger,” Hegseth said, adding that only Kelly falls under the Department of Defense’s jurisdiction.</p><p>“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately,” Hegseth said.</p><p>While all six lawmakers served in the military or intelligence agencies, Kelly is the only person to have formally retired from the military, meaning he can still be recalled for active duty or face a court martial for misconduct.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-kelly-said-about-the-action-against-him\">What has Kelly said about the action against him?</h2><p>In a post on X on Monday, Kelly wrote that he had “sworn an oath to the Constitution in 1986”.</p><p>“I’ve upheld it through 25 years of service and every day since I retired. If [President Donald] Trump’s trying to intimidate me, it won’t work. I’ve given too much to our country to be silenced by bullies who care more about power than the Constitution,” he said.</p><p>In a post last week, Kelly wrote he “had a missile blow up next to my airplane, been shot at dozens of times by anti-aircraft fire, and launched into orbit – all for my country”.</p><p>“I never thought I’d see a President call for my execution. Trump doesn’t understand the Constitution, and we’re all less safe for it,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform last week, the president wrote that the video was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country”.</p><p>“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” he said. In a separate post, Trump added that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH”.</p><p>But a day after his comments, Trump told Fox News that he wasn’t threatening death but the Democrats were in “serious trouble”.</p><p>When asked how far the Trump administration could realistically take its action against Kelly, Fein said it could “harass Kelly with a spurious investigation or charges”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-trump-administration-focusing-on-this\">Why is the Trump administration focusing on this?</h2><p>The fury over the video comes at a time when the US military is conducting strikes on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">vessels</a> that the Trump administration has alleged are carrying drugs.</p><p>The strikes have killed at least 83 people in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.</p><p>At the end of October, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to hand over all legal opinions on the legality of the military’s strikes.</p><p>“Summarily killing criminal suspects is prohibited under domestic and international law in both peacetime and wartime,” they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi that the Reuters news agency saw.</p><p>But two weeks ago, a memo from the DOJ stated that service members could not be prosecuted for the killings.</p><p>“The strikes were ordered consistent with the laws of armed conflict, and as such are lawful orders. Military personnel are legally obligated to follow lawful orders and, as such, are not subject to prosecution for following lawful orders,” The Hill, a US political website, reported, citing a statement from a DOJ spokesperson.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, there were no reported scientific forecasts for the eruption.</p><p>The volcano has not previously erupted in the current Holocene Era, which began about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age, according to the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program.</p><p>Satellite imagery shared on social media channels shows the eruption as viewed from space, with a mass of billowing ash shooting up and visibly spreading east towards the Red Sea. Footage captured from the ground also showed huge mountains of ash rising into the skies above the mountain range, blanketing the horizon.</p><p>VAAC reported that the massive waves of volcanic ash plumes emitted rose to about 45,000 metres (148,000 feet) in height at the time of the eruption, and that the ash moved primarily in a northwesterly direction.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-have-local-communities-been-affected\">How have local communities been affected?</h2><p>Local media in Ethiopia have reported that plumes of ash blanketed the areas around the volcano, including hilly villages which are well-known tourist attraction sites. In the neighbouring village of Afdera, one resident told The Associated Press he had heard a loud sound as the eruption occurred.</p><p>“It felt like a sudden bomb had been thrown with smoke and ash,” Ahmed Abdela told The AP. He added that by Monday, the village was still covered in ash, and that tourists and guides heading to the nearby Danakil Desert were stranded.</p><p>Afar TV reported that vibrations and moderate tremors were felt in Ethiopia’s Wollo area, in the northern Tigray region, and as far away as in the neighbouring country of Djibouti.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, dark smoke, rather than white ash, enveloped the area, plunging it into near-darkness, residents said.</p><p>There are concerns about how the eruption has affected air quality in the nearby villages.</p><p>Local administrator Mohammed Seid also told The AP the eruption could have economic implications for the local community, where most are livestock herders and depend on forage – plants eaten by animals – for their livestock. Much of this is now covered with a thick layer of dust. “While no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash, and as a result, their animals have little to eat,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-hayli-gubbi-volcano\">What do we know about the Hayli Gubbi volcano?</h2><p>Hayli Gubbi, a shield volcano – named so because it has a low profile and resembles a shield when viewed from above – is located about 800km (500 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital city.</p><p>Hayli Gubbi, which rises to 500 metres (1,640 feet), is the southernmost volcano of the Erta Ale Range, a chain of low-lying shield volcanoes in the Afar region. It has had no known eruptions for 12,000 years.</p><p>Erte Ale volcano, one of Ethiopia’s most active, is also located within this range, which itself is set in the Rift Valley. Erte Ale, whose name means “smoking mountain” in Afar, last overflowed with lava in January 2023, according to The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program.</p><h2 id=\"where-has-the-ash-travelled-and-how-have-flights-been-affected\">Where has the ash travelled and how have flights been affected?</h2><p>Clouds of ash have travelled across the Red Sea, first over Yemen and Oman, and then on to Pakistan and India, according to monitoring website Flightradar24.</p><p>Volcanic ash clouds contain abrasive particles which can enter and damage aircraft engines, contaminate airfields, and reduce visibility, making flying hazardous.</p><p></p><p>The eruption has, therefore, caused widespread travel disruption in neighbouring countries and continents, although there are so far no reports of flight delays in Ethiopia, which is one of Africa’s biggest flight hubs.</p><h3>India</h3><p>In India, the ash had reached the Western Rajasthan region by Monday evening and then moved northeast, according to local newspaper The Hindu.</p><p>The ash prompted several airlines, including national carrier Air India, IndiGo and Akasa, as well as Dutch carrier KLM, to cancel their flights as a precaution. Air India cancelled 11 flights on Monday and Tuesday while Akasa scrapped flights scheduled on the same day to Jeddah, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The country’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued advisories on Monday urging airlines to avoid affected altitudes and regions, and warning that volcanic ash could harm aircraft engines, according to The Hindu.</p><p>The agency also advised airlines to conduct precautionary checks on aircraft which had already flown over affected routes, and to report any suspected impact of ash on engine performance, or any smoke or odours in the cabin. Airports were also ordered to inspect runways for contamination.</p><p>The plumes have reportedly spread across the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. India is expected to have clear skies by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday as the ash cloud moves towards China, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>In Pakistan, the country’s meteorological service reported that the ash cloud was seen 60 nautical miles (111km) south of the port city of Gwadar on Monday, according to local newspaper Dawn.</p><h3>Gulf</h3><p>Air Arabia cancelled several flights from Sharjah, UAE, on Tuesday.</p><p>In Oman, the Environment Authority activated its emergency response to monitor the ash clouds but reported no immediate impact on air quality, according to Times of Oman.</p><h2 id=\"when-have-volcanic-eruptions-caused-travel-chaos-in-the-past\">When have volcanic eruptions caused travel chaos in the past?</h2><p>Severe volcanic ash eruptions that lead to widespread disruptions like this one have been rare.</p><p>The last reported incident was in 2010, when the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland erupted continuously between March and June, sending plumes of volcanic ash over swaths of Scandinavia, the UK and other European countries. The eruption ejected ash up to 11km (seven miles) into the atmosphere. That ash had small, sharp particles of glacial debris because the eruption had occurred beneath glacial ice.<strong> </strong></p><p>In April that year, the UK was forced to close down its entire airspace for six days, during which time some 95,000 flights were cancelled. According to the Center for Economics and Business Research, the UK airline industry lost $1.45bn during the prolonged shutdown. Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria and Germany were also forced to close airspace in May.</p><p>Air traffic across Europe during that period was severely restricted as many countries continued to intermittently close their airspace. About 1.2 million passengers were stranded each day during what was the largest air traffic shutdown since World War II.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.</p><p>It was published online on October 30 in JAMA Oncology.</p><p>Doctors say these study results won’t change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.</p><p>Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.</p><p>Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24 percent higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn’t. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year – about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.</p><p>Co-authors Asa Johansson and Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.</p><p>Rachel Fey, interim co-CEO of Power to Decide – a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods – said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media.</p><p>“I get really angry at this because it’s designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,” she said. “It’s really frustrating … especially when it’s given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they’re talking about providing that context.”</p><p>The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel – found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea – but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo‑Provera.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-interpret-the-findings\">How to interpret the findings</h2><p>Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumours, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.</p><p>“A substantial proportion of the ‘cases’ would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,” said Lina S Morch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. Morch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-doctor-patient-conversation\">The doctor-patient conversation</h2><p>Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasise that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: That hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman’s needs and values.</p><p>Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won’t change how she talks to her patients.</p><p>“When counselling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what’s important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),” White wrote in an email. “Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counselling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.”</p><p>Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.</p><p>Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, “For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,” referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.</p><p>Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women’s Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn’t change their advice yet.</p><p>Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. “It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,” they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.</p><h2 id=\"keeping-the-risk-in-perspective\">Keeping the risk in perspective</h2><p>Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. Morch noted that even small risks are worth discussing, but said decisions should be guided by women’s “values and preferences”.</p><p>White said it’s important to see the big picture. “The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85 percent for people who do not use contraception – so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,” she wrote.</p><p><em>KFF Health News is a national newsroom that partners with PolitiFact and produces in-depth journalism about health issues.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It was also the first club to earn $1bn in revenue.</p><p>The nonprofit status allows Spanish clubs to preserve some traditions of their clubs and for members to take an active role in the organisations.</p><p>Graham Hunter, a British football journalist who specialises in Spanish football, pointed to the example of Joan Laporta, the current president of the other Spanish mega club, Barcelona.</p><p>“Laporta went from being a member and a lawyer to being [club] president in seven years,” he said.</p><p>In stark contrast, football clubs in England or the United States – Manchester United or Inter Miami being just two examples – can be owned by individuals, corporations and in some instances, acquired on public stock exchanges, resulting in more commercialised ownership structures.</p><p>It means their club’s performances are often centred on more short-run processes like profit maximisation, whereas in Spain, the club is in the hands of fans – not large private investors – allowing scope for longer-term business strategies to be enacted.</p><p>If Perez’s plan goes ahead, this could open the door for this famous Spanish club to become more like its foreign rivals.</p><p>The high-profile, multi-billionaire boss of Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault, was named in Spanish media on Monday as a potential investor in the club, should the new minority ownership rules be adopted.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3394168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3394168\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3394168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241218__36QM4W6__v2__HighRes__FblFifaQatRealMadridPachuca-1734543018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid's French forward #9 Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid's Brazilian forward #7 Vinicius Junior look on ahead of the 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup final football match between Spain's Real Madrid and Mexico's Pachuca at the Lusail Stadium in Doha on December 18, 2024.
