            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"177\" data-end=\"967\">The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/bbc-director-general-tim-davie-resigns-over-editing-of-trump-speech\">resignations</a> of BBC Director General Tim Davie and Director of News Deborah Turness over a Panorama edit of a 2021 speech by United States President Donald Trump have plunged the United Kingdom’s national broadcaster into one of the deepest crises in its history.</p><p>But the scandal did not begin with a single programme or a single misjudgement. Close to the centre of this crisis is Robbie Gibb, a man who has spent more than a decade shaping the BBC’s political coverage, zig-zagging between the BBC and the Conservative government while advancing his own partisan project that has distorted the corporation’s journalism on Brexit, Trump and, eventually, Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"177\" data-end=\"967\">I saw the effects of that influence myself when the BBC delayed and then <a href=\"https://observer.co.uk/news/national/article/bbc-bosses-pulled-our-film-on-israel-attacking-gazas-medics-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped</a> our film on Gaza’s doctors. What is unfolding today is simply the moment when a long-running pattern of interference has burst into full public view.</p><p data-start=\"969\" data-end=\"1419\">Gibb has been such a huge figure in the wings of public life in the UK for so long that it is a relief he is now being publicly named and discussed. Until the Panorama scandal and the resignations it triggered, he was rarely scrutinised outside political and media circles. Now he is suddenly in headlines and the subject of fierce debate across social media, as people try to understand how one unelected figure came to wield such influence.</p><p data-start=\"1421\" data-end=\"2334\">It is hard to think of anyone who has had a more pervasive influence on British public life without any accountability, from within both No 10 and the BBC. Gibb has been arguably the most influential yet hidden helping hand to Brexit politics, the Conservative Party and Israel, while bestriding two of the nation’s most important institutions as, variously, the head of the BBC’s Westminster team, the head of press at No 10, and then a pivotal BBC board member influencing BBC News. There has been little change in his guiding motivations or modus operandi between these roles, just a strong belief that only he could hold the line against an overwhelmingly liberal and left-leaning BBC “wokerati” and ensure impartiality. But in so doing, he has destroyed any notion of it, leading to the present crisis in the BBC, a $1bn battle with Trump and a collapse in the credibility of its coverage of Gaza.</p><p>As the editor of Channel 4 News from 2012 to 2022, I had experience of Gibb from the moment he was appointed press secretary at No 10 in 2017. His instinct to manage political reporting in ways that advanced his own political project was evident from the start. From the outset, he severely restricted Channel 4 News’s access to government ministers, access that remained freely available to the BBC and reflected the close relationships he had built during his years overseeing parts of its political output. Gibb was well known inside the BBC for his longstanding support for Brexit, a cause he had championed since working for the Conservative Party from 1997 to 2002. His conduct at No 10 with the BBC seemed little different from his BBC years; his direct control of the output was swapped for bargaining over access, helping him to continue to shape British politics. And he had all the BBC’s political staff on speed dial.</p><p data-start=\"3131\" data-end=\"3801\">Relations worsened in 2018 when Channel 4 News became the first broadcaster to cover the Windrush scandal. It had emerged that hundreds of Black British citizens, most of whom had arrived from the Caribbean more than 50 years earlier, had been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. The scandal resulted from policies implemented by Theresa May in her previous role as home secretary. As we continued to report on the growing number of older victims, Gibb reacted furiously. He barred Channel 4 News from interviews with the prime minister and other ministers, reportedly telling aides we were “banging on and on about something no one else cares about”.</p><p data-start=\"3803\" data-end=\"4202\">He then extended that ban to the Conservative Party conference, excluding us from the traditional round of prime ministerial interviews that had been granted for decades. Every other broadcaster, including the BBC, signed a letter warning that the ban set a dangerous precedent. A former BBC colleague of Gibb later approached me at the conference to say he was “hopping mad, he’s absolutely livid”.</p><p data-start=\"4204\" data-end=\"5063\">Multiple BBC journalists told me at the time that Gibb was still effectively directing parts of the BBC’s political coverage from No 10, using his influence and longstanding relationships to shape what was reported and who gained access. Many said they struggled to distinguish between Gibb at the BBC and Gibb at No 10 because he continued to exert influence over key decisions. One of the major advantages for No 10 was Gibb’s sway over the BBC’s post-Brexit coverage. The BBC chose not to look back and investigate what had happened during the referendum, unlike Channel 4 News, which pursued the Vote Leave and Cambridge Analytica investigations. Several BBC colleagues later told me this reluctance to scrutinise the referendum was not new but reflected how Gibb had operated in real time when he oversaw BBC political output during the campaign itself.</p><p data-start=\"5065\" data-end=\"5752\">In 2019, we obtained emails between Arron Banks, the major Brexit donor, and Gibb sent in the run-up to the referendum. The emails showed that Banks complained to Gibb about a BBC inquiry into Leave. The European Union’s attempts to build support within far-right online communities and asked Gibb to intervene. After Banks raised his concerns with Gibb, the investigation was dropped. The BBC said the story did not meet editorial standards, but weeks later, the same investigation was published by The Sunday Times. Banks also told Gibb that Nigel Farage did not appear often enough on the BBC. In the months leading up to the referendum, Farage then appeared repeatedly across the broadcaster’s output.</p><p data-start=\"5754\" data-end=\"6784\">In 2019, after Gibb left No 10 with Theresa May, Boris Johnson appointed him to the BBC board, an influential position from which he was not meant to interfere in day-to-day editorial decisions. Despite this, multiple allegations emerged that he continued to do so, including attempts to block appointments, visits to newsrooms and repeated involvement in editorial matters. In 2020, he took a controlling interest in the Jewish Chronicle – the world’s oldest Jewish newspaper, a paper long regarded as the voice of Britain’s Jewish community – on behalf of undisclosed backers, and the paper then shifted sharply to the right. Several of its most respected journalists resigned amid allegations that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was influencing its coverage. All of this occurred while Gibb, as the most experienced editorial voice on the BBC board, was allegedly exerting an increasingly dominant influence, despite the board’s rules prohibiting direct editorial involvement. In Gibb’s case, old habits clearly died hard.</p><p data-start=\"6786\" data-end=\"7904\">After the horrific Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel’s unrelenting two-year assault on Gaza, which flattened much of the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 70,000 people, including 20,000 children, I was told by multiple sources that Gibb, as the strongest editorial voice on the BBC board, was placing BBC News under pressure over its Israel coverage from the very start. The pressure came to a head in February, when the BBC broadcast and then withdrew the film Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.</p><p>The film had been produced externally and failed to disclose that its 13-year-old narrator’s father was a deputy agriculture minister in Gaza’s Hamas-run government. In the aftermath, the BBC delayed our investigation into Israel’s destruction of Gaza’s healthcare system and the killing of more than 1,500 medics, offering a series of excuses until eventually admitting they would not run it while they examined the other film. It was an extraordinary and unprecedented decision that effectively silenced and blunted their coverage. Only after we went public was Gaza: Doctors Under Attack finally broadcast, not on the BBC but on Channel 4.</p><p data-start=\"6786\" data-end=\"7904\">I was told that the board, under Gibb’s influence, effectively pushed Tim Davie and Deborah Turness to first obscure their position on our film, then ask us to make significant changes, before finally saying they would run only three one-minute clips from our 65-minute investigation on their news outlets. This was a film about hospitals being bombed and evacuated, about doctors and medics and their families being targeted and killed, and about hundreds of others detained and tortured. It had already been approved by the BBC and later ran on Channel 4 – and Mehdi Hasan’s new media platform, Zeteo – without any complaints. It has since been nominated for many awards and is now beginning to win them.</p><p data-start=\"7906\" data-end=\"8795\">In the end, it seems Davie and Turness did not fall because they stood up to Gibb, but because they reacted too slowly to the crisis his world helped create. After years of pressure over Gaza and mounting complaints about bias, the misleading Panorama edit of Trump’s speech and their hesitant response to his legal and political onslaught became the final straw. Only Gibb knows whether he intended to push the BBC into a position where it is now facing a potential billion-dollar lawsuit from a sitting US president, but his influence and alliances were central to the chain of decisions that led there. And now, hiding in plain sight, Gibb’s decades-long mission to reshape the national broadcaster around his own political agenda, dressed up as a defence of impartiality, can finally be seen for what it is: an absolute disaster for the BBC and for the public it is meant to serve.</p><p data-start=\"7906\" data-end=\"8795\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He will mark the 1,700th anniversary of a pivotal moment in Christianity: the 325 AD Council of Nicaea, where bishops formulated the Nicene Creed, a declaration of faith still recited by millions of Christians worldwide. The creed professes belief in one God, acknowledges Jesus as the human son of God, and the Holy Spirit as an equal person in the Trinity.</p><p>This historic council occurred when Eastern and Western churches remained unified, long before the Great Schism of 1054 divided them primarily over papal authority. Nevertheless, the Nicene Creed continues to be embraced by Catholic, Orthodox and most traditional Protestant denominations, serving as a rare point of consensus and the most universally accepted creed in Christendom.</p><p>Consequently, celebrating its origins represents a significant milestone in the centuries-long effort to reunify Christianity.</p><p>Addressing the congregation at the cathedral, Leo emphasised that the creed was not merely a doctrinal statement but the “essential core of the Christian faith”.</p><p>“Therefore, its development is organic, akin to that of a living reality, gradually bringing to light and expressing more fully the essential heart of the faith,” he said.</p><p>Leo arrived in Turkiye on Thursday, promoting a message of peace during his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He will carry this same message to Lebanon on Sunday during the second and final leg of his journey as history’s first American pope.</p><p>At Tuesday’s cathedral service, Leo encouraged Turkiye’s small Catholic community of about 33,000 people in a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation of 85 million. He particularly praised the church’s outreach to migrants and newcomers.</p><p>“The logic of littleness is the church’s true strength,” Leo told them in English. “The significant presence of migrants and refugees in this country presents the church with the challenge of welcoming and serving some of the most vulnerable.”</p><p>His message resonated strongly with the diverse crowd gathered outside, which reflected the multinational character of Turkiye’s Catholic Church.</p><p>“With all my heart I am so happy,” said Debora Martina Da Silva, a political science student from Guinea-Bissau.</p><p>Mateusz Zajdecki, a 21-year-old from Szczecin, Poland, acknowledged the ecumenical importance of Leo’s visit.</p><p>“I think it is important for Turkiye to be united at one table, eucharistic table, and to pray together to one Father who is in heaven,” Zajdecki said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This fragility, compounded by years of sanctions, has also led to one of the world’s largest exoduses as Venezuelans seek stability and better opportunities abroad.</p><p>Here are 10 charts to help explain how Venezuela reached this point:</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-at-a-glance\">Venezuela at a glance</h2><p>Venezuela is home to about 28.4 million people, making it the 53rd most populous country in the world.</p><p>About 85 percent of Venezuela’s population lives in urban areas in the north of the country, a coastal mountainous region where most of the country’s major cities are located. The most populous cities are the capital, Caracas (3 million people), Maracaibo (2.4 million) and Valencia (2 million).</p><p>According to the latest World Bank data, Venezuela’s life expectancy is about 73 years with a fertility rate of two, meaning each woman on average has two children. This is much higher than in many Western nations, where fertility rates are far below the replacement rate of 2.1, the number of children a woman must have if a population is to remain at current levels.</p><p>Venezuela’s gross domestic product (GDP) stands at $108.5bn, placing it among the smallest economies in Latin America despite its vast natural resources.</p><p>Nearly 90 percent of Venezuela’s population is Christian, primarily Catholic.</p><p>Venezuela gained independence from Spain in 1811. Spanish is the official language of Venezuela, but several Indigenous languages are also spoken.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129625\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-AT-A-GLANCE-2025-1764062410.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-AT-A-GLANCE-2025-1764062410\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-big-is-venezuela\">How big is Venezuela?</h2><p>By area, Venezuela is the 32nd largest country in the world and South America’s sixth largest country, covering 916,445sq km (353,841sq miles). Venezuela is roughly the same size as Nigeria or Pakistan and about 1.5 times the size of the US state of Texas.</p><p>Its landscape is made up of mountains, namely the Andes to the west and the Montanoso coastal range to the north and east; tropical jungles, including the Amazon rainforest; river plains; and coastal plains.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129642\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA_SIZE_2025-1764062791.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA_SIZE_2025-1764062791\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"political-leadership\">Political leadership</h2><p>Venezuela’s political landscape has historically swung between democratic rule, populism and hardline rule. Since the end of military rule in 1958, alternating governments have taken power in the country, largely led by two major parties, Democratic Action, a social democratic party, and the Christian democratic COPEI party.</p><p>By the 1980s, the country’s oil-dependent economy began to falter. The global oil glut triggered a severe downturn, forcing Venezuela to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and adopt unpopular austerity measures. Economic decline, corruption and growing public disillusionment with traditional parties weakened the two-party system through the 1990s.</p><p>This turmoil paved the way for the rise of Hugo Chavez, a former military officer who had led a failed coup in 1992. Capitalising on public anger towards what many Venezuelans saw as a corrupt political order, Chavez was elected president in 1999 after he promised to abolish the old political system.</p><p>Once in power, he launched what he called the Bolivarian Revolution, named after Simon Bolivar, the South American independence leader. Chavez redirected oil revenues into social programmes that expanded access to housing, education, healthcare and military spending instead of going directly to the political elite via a patronage system. While Chavez’s populist government initially reduced poverty and inequality, Venezuela’s unsustainable spending and deep reliance on oil left the country vulnerable.</p><p>By the mid-2010s, an oil bust and tightening US sanctions had triggered a major economic crisis, leading to one of the largest mass emigrations in the world.</p><p>After Chavez’s death in 2013, Maduro, his handpicked successor, ascended to the presidency and consolidated Chavez’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela into the country’s dominant political force.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129715\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-POLITICAL-LEADERSHIP-1764064638.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-VENEZUELA-POLITICAL-LEADERSHIP-1764064638\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"venezuela-s-economy-and-trading-partners\">Venezuela’s economy and trading partners</h2><p>Venezuela funds the majority of its government budget from oil revenues. In 2024, oil export revenues and taxes paid by the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, were estimated to make up about 58 percent of state income.</p><p>The country’s economy has been deeply turbulent for more than four decades, and its GDP shrank by more than 70 percent from 2014 to 2024.

This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn).</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a vast region in the eastern part of the country that stretches across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>The Orinoco Belt holds extra heavy crude oil, which is highly viscous and dense, making it much harder and more expensive to extract than conventional crude. Producing oil from this region requires advanced techniques, such as steam injection and blending with lighter crudes to make it marketable.</p><p>Because of its density and sulphur content, extra heavy crude usually sells at a discount compared with lighter crudes.</p><p>In addition to crude oil, Venezuela exports smaller volumes of refined petroleum products, such as petrol and diesel, but its potential to increase these is limited due to ageing refinery infrastructure, technical challenges and sanctions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925530\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925530\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Worldwide-proven-oil-reserves-1756989583.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Worldwide proven oil reserves-1756989583\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-migration-crisis\">The migration crisis</h2><p>About 2015, Venezuela’s net migration dipped sharply with a record 1.4 million people emigrating in 2018.</p><p>Over the past decade, Maduro has tightened his grip on power, eroding democratic institutions through censorship, restricted internet access and the persecution of political opponents.</p><p>Combined with sanctions and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis has deepened, leading to severe shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Half the population still lives in poverty although the rate has slightly improved since 2021.

Gerasimov is just a liar,” and he repeated the claim a week later.</p><p>Ukraine has also had successes on the ground, according to its commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskii. “Despite enemy pressure, the Defence Forces of Ukraine managed to carry out counteroffensive actions in the Dobropillia direction from the end of August to October this year,” he said, referring to a failed Russian flanking manoeuvre towards a town northwest of Pokrovsk.</p><p>“As a result, the units split the enemy’s offensive group and liberated over 430 square kilometres [166 square miles] north of Pokrovsk. Russian losses amounted to more than 13,000 killed and wounded.”</p><p>Russia also kept up pressure on Ukraine’s rear, launching 1,169 drones and 25 missiles at its cities during the week of November 20-26. Ukraine downed 85 percent of the drones and 14 of the missiles, but Zelenskyy called for more short- and medium-range defences.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127618\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127618\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127618\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1763991689.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1763991689\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"questionable-diplomacy\">Questionable diplomacy</h2><p>Europe, Ukraine and members of the US Congress have all pushed back against a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point peace plan</a> presented by the US administration of Donald Trump last week, describing it as too Russia-friendly.</p><p>In its original form, the plan granted key points that Russia has demanded. That included a promise from Ukraine never to join NATO and the surrendering of almost all the territory Russia has taken by force, along with the unoccupied remainder of Donetsk. The US and Ukraine’s other Western allies would have to recognise those annexations as legal.</p><p>Ukraine would have to hold an election within 100 days of the plan’s signature – one that Russia seems to believe would unseat Zelenskyy.</p><p>Russia has also demanded that Ukraine effectively disarm. The 28-point plan suggests reducing its armed forces by about a third, to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Right now is one of the hardest moments in our history,” Zelenskyy told the Ukrainian people after seeing the plan, describing it as a choice between “either the loss of our dignity or the risk of losing a key partner”.</p><p>The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Senator Roger Wicker said in a statement: “This so-called ‘peace plan’ has real problems, and I am highly skeptical it will achieve peace.”</p><p>Polish Premier Donald Tusk politely said on social media: “It would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.”</p><p>The plan drew heavily from a Russian non-paper submitted to the White House in October, said the Reuters news agency.</p><p>“Trump’s 28-point plan, which we have, enshrines the key understandings reached during the Alaska summit,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters.</p><p>“I would say not all, but many provisions of this plan, they seem quite acceptable to us,” Putin aide Yury Ushakov told the TASS Russian state news agency.</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany drafted a counter-proposal on Sunday, and a Ukrainian delegation led by former Defence Minister Rustem Umerov met with US negotiators under Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva to discuss both documents.</p><p>Europe ruled out accepting territorial exchanges resulting from aggression, and suggested territorial negotiations begin from the line of contact without prior Ukrainian concessions. It also suggested Ukraine maintain a strong army of no fewer than 800,000 people, and receive an effective NATO security guarantee.</p><p>Their joint statement on Monday simply said they would “continue intensive work”, with final decisions to be made by Trump and Zelenskyy.</p><p>Much had been done to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/russia-ukraine-peace-plan-whats-the-latest-version-after-us-kyiv-talks\">refine the original 28 points</a> into a workable agreement, said Zelenskyy. “Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable,” he told Ukrainians somewhat cryptically, describing the work that remained as “very challenging”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ukraine has pushed for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump before December to thrash out the plan’s final form, but on Tuesday, Bloomberg released transcripts of a leaked telephone conversation between Trump confidant Steve Witkoff and Putin aide Yury Ushakov, in which Witkoff advised Ushakov to have Putin call Trump before Zelenskyy had a chance to meet him. Witkoff suggested that Putin flatter Trump as a peacemaker to win his favour and shape the peace plan directly with him.</p><p>That leak prompted opposition to Witkoff travelling to Moscow next week to discuss the reworked plan with Russian officials. The White House said he is to replace General Keith Kellogg, who resigned as mediator for Ukraine after seeing the original 28-point plan.</p><p>“It is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” wrote Republican Congressman Don Bacon on social media.</p><p></p><p>In his first extensive remarks on the peace proposal, in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin backed away from an agreement with Ukraine, saying, “Signing documents with the Ukrainian leadership is pointless,” because Zelenskyy was a president who had outlived his mandate.</p><p>“I believe that the Ukrainian authorities made a fundamental and strategic mistake when they succumbed to the fear of participating in the presidential elections,” he said, referring to the spring of 2025, when Zelenskyy’s four-year term expired.</p><p>Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, and the parliament has twice extended his tenure under the constitutional provision of a national emergency.</p><p>Putin said the 28 points did not amount to a peace treaty, calling them “a set of questions that were proposed for discussion and final wording”.</p><p>“In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,” Putin said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127614\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127614\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127614\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-Ukraine-Refugees-1763991679.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE Ukraine Refugees-1763991679\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Ever since the fall of the former Syrian regime and even before that, Israel was carrying out air strikes and going deep into Syrian territory.”</p><p>“For a year now, Israel has been occupying more and more Syrian land, carrying out operations and detaining Syrian nationals, taking them inside Israel. In Israel itself, the latest operation is being described as extraordinary – not because Syrians were killed, but because Israeli soldiers were injured,” she added.</p><p>“For now, the Israeli army and government treat Syrian territory as fair game, ” Odeh concluded.</p><p>Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst, told Al Jazeera that some in Israel see “any kind of instability” at its border with Syria as a justification to start a military operation and establish what he termed as a “security zone”.</p><p>Israel seized territory in the Syrian Golan Heights following the 1967 war and has held it ever since. However, following the fall of al-Assad, Israel violated a 1974 agreement and again invaded its neighbour’s territory, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table\">occupying more land along the border</a> as part of a “buffer zone”, including the strategically vital summit of Jabal al-Sheikh.</p><p>Israel was already bombing Syria before the fall of al-Assad, an ally of its regional enemy Iran. But instead of seeking to start on a new path with Syria, Israel has doubled down on its bombing campaign and increased the number of strikes this year, including in the capital, Damascus, leading to the deaths of several Syrian soldiers and hitting the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s appearance with Israel’s troops in illegally occupied territory in southern Syria angered Damascus, and raised further doubts over whether a security deal between the two countries can be agreed.</p><p>Netanyahu’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/syria-condemns-israeli-pm-netanyahus-illegal-visit-to-seized-territory\">visit</a> – accompanied by several of his senior officials – signalled that he is not planning to shift from his hardline position on Syria, despite encouragement from the United States.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/israeli-incursions-abductions-stoke-fear-in-syrias-occupied-golan-heights\">Across Quneitra province</a>, the Israeli military’s tanks have established checkpoints and patrols, even setting up gates. They stop and search civilians, and some are abducted.</p><p>Described by Israel as security operations, Syrian authorities and human rights groups refer to such incidents as abductions or unlawful arrests. As many as 40 people have reportedly been detained in recent weeks.</p><p>As well as repeated Israeli bombardments and incursions, the fledgling government of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has been contending with keeping a lid on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/aftermath-of-homs-killings-may-mark-turning-point-for-syrias-government\">eruptions of sectarian violence</a> in a nation ravaged by 14 years of ruinous civil war, as the country comes out of its isolation to rejoin the international fold, securing critical economic lifelines.</p><p>The latest Israeli incursion comes as al-Sharaa’s government marks the anniversary of the beginning of the lightning rebel offensive that toppled al-Assad in December 2024. On Thursday, al-Sharaa delivered a televised address urging Syrians to celebrate the occasion.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4137106\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4137106\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4137106\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Interactive_Syria-control-map_BeitJinn_Nov28_2025-01-1764318339.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Syria control map_Nov28_2025\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4137106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
