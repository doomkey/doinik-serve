At the start of the so-called refugee crisis, some European nations embraced refugees, especially those fleeing war in Syria. But now, as the hard right advances across Europe, casting lone, male migrants and asylum seekers as a scourge, they are discriminated against by several sections of society and in the media.</p><p>A 2024 report by the International Organization for Migration found that 63 percent of recent arrivals to Europe were single men travelling alone. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford in 2026 noted that male refugees often travel alone due to the perils of the journey, and family and children join them later.</p><p>Young people like Ahmed also make up a small but significant proportion of applicants. European Union figures from 2024 showed 35,000 asylum applicants were unaccompanied minors. In many cases, families believe that young people have a better chance of reaching Europe and being accepted, according to a 2014 report by the UNHCR.</p><p>Ahmed said he sometimes feels as if he is treated as a “threat”, despite his young age and vulnerability.</p><p>Ahmed, who is softly spoken over the phone, is in his last year of high school in Germany and hopes to be able to go to university this coming summer. But he speaks of the stigma he has faced as a young male.</p><p>“I experience discrimination simply for being a young refugee man,” he said. “My housing applications are ignored because of my name. In society, I hear the tired, hurtful refrain that we are taking jobs and houses, and that the government should pay for their people and not for us. They tell us we should go back where we came from. They also say that we are all the same – dangerous. Sometimes they use irony, saying, ‘Don’t take your knife out; I’ll give you everything you want.'”</p><p>He added, “This kind of stuff really hurts because, at least I can speak for myself, I am trying to begin a new life here where I feel safe. We experienced a lot of horrible things in the wars in our country and on the way here … [We’re] not really accepted by society, even though you try your best. This happens simply because your name is Ali or Mohammad and you are seen as a threat.”</p><p>Ahmed’s account echoes a broader shift across Europe, where hostile portrayals of migrants have been drawn upon by far-right figures, such as the British convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, who at a September 2025 rally in London said women in the UK were under threat because of “uncontrolled” migration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305226\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305226\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305226\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-07T125517Z_1642120527_RC2Z6HAQ1PL6_RTRMADP_3_MIGRATION-GREECE-1770809038.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Migrants stand ashore Tsilia beach, after a group of migrants have been found safe ashore in the south of the island, while four bodies were recovered at sea during a SAR operation, a coastguard official said, on the island of Lesbos, Greece, October 7, 2025.

            "time": "2026-02-11T12:26:13",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698c74e0-1770812640.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"309\" data-end=\"899\">A victim of Russia’s brutal aggression that’s generating a proper humanitarian catastrophe this winter, Ukraine is also stuck between two kinds of Western populism. One is that of Donald Trump and his European far-right equivalents, who don’t care much about either Ukraine or the rules-based order, only their private interests. The other one is that of the anti-Russian (and anti-Trump) hawks who tend to wrap the cynical interests of the military-industrial complex in phoney liberal rhetoric as they pretend to defend the values they don’t truly adhere to — not in Ukraine anyway.</p><p data-start=\"901\" data-end=\"1345\">With the Munich Security Conference, Europe’s most important event for foreign policy and military experts, approaching, its longtime chairman, Wolfgang Ischinger, set the agenda regarding the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which is shifting into its fifth year this month. As long as Ukraine defends Europe, he told the Tagesspiegel, the Russian threat to Europe isn’t huge, but once the war is over, it will increase enormously.</p><p data-start=\"1347\" data-end=\"1641\">Even as he rushed to deny that he doesn’t want peace to be achieved any time soon, the message was clear: Ukraine is helping European countries to prepare for war with Russia (no matter how implausible this eventuality is looking now, given it presumes Kremlin rulers are essentially suicidal).</p><p data-start=\"1643\" data-end=\"1937\">At least this is how the Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin, Andrii Melnyk, read Ischinger’s stance. The argument that “Ukraine should bleed out just to buy Europe more time for its own defence” was cynical, he told Ischinger on X. Ukrainians urgently need a ceasefire, insisted the ambassador.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2479\">Meanwhile, the idea that peace in Ukraine would be premature remains predominant in a few major European capitals, especially London, as well as inside hawkish American think tanks which have invested their reputation in defeating Russia — a goal that appears to be further away than ever before. Two prominent foreign policy scholars, Michael Kimmage and Hanna Notte, put it far more candidly than Ischinger in a Foreign Affairs piece. “Most important, the US and Europe shouldn’t rush any talks to end the conflict,” they wrote.</p><p data-start=\"2481\" data-end=\"2936\">This sentiment prevailed at the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council at the end of January, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto suggested in an interview. Several European foreign ministers, he claimed, openly stated at the meeting that “the European Union is not prepared for peace”. This echoes Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s claim, made a year ago (according to Ukrainian media), that peace in Ukraine was riskier than war.</p><p data-start=\"2938\" data-end=\"3353\">The rationale behind these arguments is really hard to comprehend. Western powers have been steering Ukraine towards refusing any realistically attainable compromise for many years. The only result this policy has achieved is that realistic conditions for peace have considerably deteriorated compared to what Ukraine would have been getting by default during the talks in Istanbul in 2022 or Minsk in 2015.</p><p data-start=\"3355\" data-end=\"3867\">The threat of Russia attacking NATO countries is even harder to substantiate in a rational, unemotional conversation. Direct conflict between Russia and the West, which both sides made a point to avoid in the last four years, means nuclear war, which would end human civilisation as we know it. Economically and demographically, Russia is a dwarf compared with the EU alone, not to mention the combined force of the EU, the US and Britain. It can’t win a war against the West without resorting to nuclear weapons.</p><p data-start=\"3869\" data-end=\"4466\">An all-out conflict with the West is not a part of the mainstream political discourse in Russia or an ideological goal — unlike the USSR, modern Russia has no real ideology. There is no way Russia would attack NATO countries unless it senses a genuinely existential threat — through the blockade of its Baltic ports or Western-assisted missile strikes on Moscow from Ukraine’s territory. It’s indicative enough that for the last four years, Moscow hasn’t been directly responding to what people like former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson openly call the West’s proxy war against Russia.</p><p data-start=\"4468\" data-end=\"4775\">Wild claims grossly misinterpreting Russia’s motives and intentions are an integral part of jingoistic populism, which has been fuelling this conflict for years. So, it has turned out, was the false promise of defeating the world’s leading nuclear power by a combination of economic and military means.</p><p data-start=\"4777\" data-end=\"5198\">Speaking at the Munich conference in 2022, days before the start of Russia’s all-out invasion, the same Boris Johnson — then still in office — said that “Russia must fail and be seen to fail”. Just over a month later, Johnson would help derail the peace talks in Istanbul, which could have ended the armed conflict at the outset, according to top Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia and a plethora of other sources.</p><p data-start=\"5200\" data-end=\"5794\">Addressing a huge crowd in Warsaw in March 2022, then-US President Joe Biden effectively pledged to topple Vladimir Putin: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power”. He also claimed that Western sanctions had “reduced the rouble to rubble” and that the dollar was trading at 200 roubles at the time of speaking. It was a direct lie. The real rate on that day was 95 roubles per dollar. It is less than 80 roubles per dollar today. Last year, the rouble emerged as one of the world’s best-performing currencies, surging by 44 percent against the dollar year on year.</p><p data-start=\"5796\" data-end=\"6222\">EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas kept saying that she believed in Ukraine’s ability to defeat Russia as late as October 2025 — an assessment that completely contradicted the reality on the ground since 2023 when, after the failed Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russia began its slow offensive, which continues today, while Ukraine’s crucial infrastructure is being turned into rubble and the country is rapidly depopulating.</p><p data-start=\"6224\" data-end=\"6706\">Coming from people who claim to be “liberals”, this unhinged populism creates a paradoxical situation in which certified far-right populists, such as Trump or Hungary’s Orban, as well as the leaders of Germany’s AfD, begin to come across as reasonable and conflict-averse people when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine. They’ve long figured out that they can exploit their opponents’ Russophobia by exposing their incessant lies, exaggerations and unfounded boasts.</p><p data-start=\"6708\" data-end=\"7255\">The West’s entire policy towards Russia and Ukraine for the last 30 years has been a catastrophic failure, which has created a great boon and an inexhaustible source of political fuel for anti-establishment actors. The never-ending postponement of peace in Ukraine derives from the fact that too many people have been too badly invested in unrealistic outcomes of the war, so they keep buying more and more time to mitigate the impact. But it comes at a huge cost that Ukrainians are paying with their lives and their country’s future.</p><p data-start=\"6708\" data-end=\"7255\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

storm it and remove the national flag.</p><p class=\"p1\">The attack came days after the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), the executive body of Yemen’s internationally recognised government, announced a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/hope-and-scepticism-as-yemens-saudi-backed-govt-announces-a-new-cabinet\">new cabinet</a> with diverse political and regional affiliations, as part of efforts to govern the divided Arab nation.</p><p class=\"p1\">Last month, the PLC established its hold over southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia after an STC attempt to take control over two southern provinces failed, leading to the latter’s collapse and dissolution and the withdrawal of United Arab Emirates forces, which backed the group according to Saudi and Yemeni leaders, from southern Yemen.</p><p class=\"p1\">The security committee in Shabwah said it would take action against anyone proven to be involved in inciting or planning action, or using weapons, urging citizens to resist any calls to get involved.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But surely it’s nothing that can’t be solved by more business as usual.</p><p>Indeed, it seems the winds are just right for the resurgence of the “<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2019/08/the-long-disturbing-voyage-of-the-u-s-s-honduras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USS Honduras</a>” – the endearing nickname that was bestowed on the country in the 1980s on account of its outstanding service as an imperial military base from which to terrorise neighbouring Nicaragua, which had committed the outrageous offence of telling the gringos to take their capitalist system and shove it.</p><p>Some 50,000 Nicaraguans perished in the US-backed Contra war, while CIA mercenaries aided the war effort by raking in <a href=\"https://fair.org/home/20-years-after-his-death-gary-webbs-truth-is-still-dangerous/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">profits from the drug trade</a>, speaking of the US track record on that front.</p><p>Nor was life on board the USS Honduras anything to write home about. Throughout the 1980s, a CIA-trained death squad by the name of <a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/28/memories-of-a-honduran-coup\">Battalion 316</a> made life hell for hundreds of Honduran citizens who were suspected of improper political orientation and were kidnapped, tortured, and killed.</p><p>And the US was calling the shots for just about everything. Writing in The New York Times in 1988, journalist Stephen Kinzer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/25/world/hondurans-trust-of-military-leaders-plummets-with-drug-arrest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offered</a> the lowdown on imperial machinations in Honduras with a straightforwardness uncharacteristic of the US newspaper of record: “Behind the guise of formal democracy [in Honduras], military leaders make all important decisions, and they respond to direction from the United States Embassy.”</p><p>This embassy, Kinzer noted, was “one of the largest State Department outposts in the world”, adding that “American diplomats exercise more control over domestic politics in Honduras than in any other country in the hemisphere.”</p><p>And yet there were rough waters ahead for the USS Honduras – particularly with the 2006 election of ever-so-slightly-left-leaning President Manuel Zelaya, who had the nerve to raise the urban minimum wage to <a href=\"/opinions/2015/6/28/the-honduran-meltdown-made-in-usa\">$290 a month</a> and otherwise stab international corporations in the back.</p><p>The metaphorical naval vessel having been thus definitively blown off course, there was no choice but for the Honduran military to – very democratically – kidnap Zelaya in the wee hours of June 28, 2009, and whisk him off to Costa Rica in his pyjamas, never to be reinstated to his elected post.</p><p>The US-validated coup d’etat ushered in an era of intensified impunity in Honduras, as the domestic forces of law and order responded sadistically to unarmed anti-coup protesters, <a href=\"/opinions/2016/3/29/hillary-clintons-faux-feminism\">femicides skyrocketed</a>, and the small nation embarked on its path to becoming the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/06/13/190683502/honduras-claims-unwanted-title-of-worlds-murder-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">murder capital</a> of the world.</p><p>In other words, all was dandy from a capitalist point of view, and, once illegitimate elections had been staged by the Honduran coup regime, the Democratic regime of then-US President Barack Obama wasted no time in signing off on the electoral triumph of the right-wing Porfirio Lobo, who quickly <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/cities-of-the-night\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared</a> Honduras “Open for Business.”</p><p>Things then got even better with the reign of the aforementioned narco-President Juan Orlando Hernandez, whose re-election in 2017 amid ubiquitous fraud allegations was swiftly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-government-general-news-6a90990250ef43c4b1a036d393c785f2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recognised</a> by the first Trump administration – and never mind the ensuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/us-silent-as-honduras-protesters-killed-in-post-election-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slaughter</a>, by US-funded security forces, of Hondurans protesting the election results.</p><p>Now that Trump is back at the helm of the USS Honduras with Asfura as first mate, it would have been remiss had Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not turned up on deck, as well.</p><p>During a January <a href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/pages/spoke-meet180126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit</a> to Jerusalem to kiss Israel’s <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/26/israels-genocide-wiped-out-over-2700-families-in-gaza\">genocidal</a> backside, Asfura made a downright disgusting mockery of his own Palestinian origins, responding with enthusiasm to Netanyahu’s declaration that he looked “forward to working with your government, both in economic fields and agriculture and technology in any of the areas that I think are laid before us”.</p><p>The man with the blood of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/press-briefing-francesca-albanese-16sep25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">potentially many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians</a> on his hands proceeded to reassure the Palestinian-descended Honduran head of state, “You should know that as far as Israel is concerned, the sky is the limit.”</p><p>Under Asfura, Honduras is, no doubt, on course to renew its status as a key node of US power and influence in the hemisphere, giving Trump even greater leeway to wreak havoc in <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">Venezuela</a>, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">Cuba</a>, and wherever else he sees fit – and probably guaranteeing a lot more spectacular violence to come in Honduras itself.</p><p>And as the USS Honduras sets off with vigour on its latest voyage of imperial servitude, you might say the sea is the limit, too.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Guthrie’s front door on the night she vanished from her home in the city of Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel said the “armed individual” in the black and white videos, which offered the

Experts often attribute this to the country’s strict gun laws, which make it difficult to obtain assault-style weapons like those which have been used in many US school shootings.</p><p>Some of the deadliest include:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>April 2020</strong>: <strong>Portapique, Nova Scotia –</strong> An attacker, who at one point masqueraded as a police officer, killed 22 people in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia during a 12-hour rampage, in the country’s worst modern-era mass shooting.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2017:</strong> <strong>Quebec City, Quebec </strong>– A man opened fire during evening prayers at a mosque, killing six people and wounding five. Twelve others were treated for minor injuries.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2016:</strong> <strong>La Loche, Saskatchewan</strong> – A student killed his two cousins at home before opening fire at a remote community high school, killing two more people and wounding seven others.</li>\n<li><strong>June 2014:</strong> <strong>Moncton, New Brunswick</strong> – An attacker killed three RCMP officers and wounded two others.</li>\n<li><strong>March 2005: Mayerthorpe, Alberta</strong> – A man shot dead four RCMP officers who had arrived at his home to execute a warrant to repossess property. He then killed himself.</li>\n<li><strong>April 1999: Ottawa, Ontario –</strong> A former employee of Ottawa’s urban transit service shot dead four of his colleagues and wounded two before taking his own life.</li>\n<li><strong>April 1996: Vernon, British Columbia</strong> – A man killed nine relatives gathered for the wedding of his estranged wife’s sister and wounded two others before killing himself.</li>\n<li><strong>December 1989: Montreal, Quebec –</strong> An attacker killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the Ecole Polytechnique before dying by suicide in Canada’s worst school attack.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"
