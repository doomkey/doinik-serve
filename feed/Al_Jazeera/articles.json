Then in June, when Hasina was 16, her teacher announced the school’s funding had been cut. The school was closing. In an instant, both her education and childhood vanished.</p><p>With educational opportunities eliminated and her family fearing worsening conditions from aid reductions, Hasina – like hundreds of other underage girls – was quickly married off. Many, including Hasina, now endure abuse from their husbands.</p><p>“I dreamed of being something, of working for the community,” Hasina says softly. The The Associated Press news agency is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. “My life is destroyed.”</p><p>In a sweltering building near her cramped shelter, Hasina nervously fidgets with her pink phone case marked “Forever Young”. Though still young, the aid cuts forced her prematurely into adulthood – and horror. Soon after marriage, her husband isolated her from her family and began physically and sexually abusing her. She constantly dreams of school, where she excelled in English and aspired to become a teacher. Now she’s largely confined to her shelter, performing domestic duties while dreading the next assault.</p><p>She would escape, if possible, but has nowhere to go. Return to Myanmar is impossible, with the military responsible for the 2017 genocide still controlling her homeland. Her husband now controls her future, though she no longer envisions one.</p><p>“If the school hadn’t closed,” she says, “I wouldn’t be trapped in this life.”</p><p>The situation has become increasingly dangerous for the 600,000 children in these overcrowded camps. UNICEF reports that child violations have surged this year, with abduction and kidnapping cases more than quadrupling to 560 compared with last year. Reports of armed groups recruiting children have increased eightfold, affecting 817 children.</p><p>In the Bangladesh camps, the US has reduced funding by nearly half compared with last year, while the overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50 percent funded for 2025. Although UNICEF has repurposed some remaining funds to reopen most of its learning centres, many schools run by other aid organisations remain closed, leaving thousands of children without education.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Women face “gang rape while simultaneously trying to flee from killing and bombs,” he said, describing conditions as particularly horrific in el-Fasher.</p><p>The heaviest fighting has now shifted from Darfur to the country’s central regions where the country is bisected between territory controlled by the RSF and SAF.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">A <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/yale-report-unveils-rsf-attempt-to-cover-up-sudan-atrocities-mass-burials\">report</a> released on Tuesday by Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab found that RSF forces engaged in a “systematic multi-week campaign to destroy evidence” of mass killings in el-Fasher through burial, burning and removal of human remains after the city fell in October.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In a 19-minute <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/17/live-trump-to-highlight-achievements-amid-venezuela-economic-tensions\">address to the nation</a> on Wednesday night, United States President Donald Trump made no major announcements, as presidents are usually wont to do. Instead, he took the opportunity to further denigrate immigrants, highlight his perceived personal achievements and make grandiose promises of prosperity to come.</p><p>“Our nation is strong. America is respected, and our country is back stronger than ever before. We’re poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen,” he said.</p><p>Members of the Democratic Party were quick to capitalise on Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/trumps-approval-rating-drops-to-39-amid-economic-concerns-us-poll\">flagging approval ratings</a> and popular concerns about <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">affordability</a>.</p><p>“Quickly lost track of how many lies Trump shouted out tonight, but the main takeaway is that he has clearly lost touch with reality. Delusional,” Senator Chris Van Hollen said. “The most honest thing he said was, ‘No one can believe what’s going on.’”</p><p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential future presidential contender who frequently needles Trump in his social media posts, mocked him for giving a speech focused on “Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me”.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from his address:</p><h2 id=\"he-blamed-immigrants-for-the-us-s-problems\">He blamed immigrants for the US’s problems</h2><p>The US president took aim at immigrants, blaming them for the housing crisis and economic problems.</p><p>“Illegal aliens stole American jobs and flooded emergency rooms getting free healthcare and education paid for by you – the American taxpayer,” Trump said.</p><p>“They also increased the cost of law enforcement by numbers so high that they are not even to be mentioned.”</p><p>The US president, who recently called the Somali community “garbage” in a racist tirade, falsely claimed that Somalis “took over the economics” of the state of Minnesota and stole “billions and billions of dollars”.</p><p>Repeated studies have shown that immigrants contribute more to the economy than they take from it, and provide labour in vital sectors, including agriculture and construction. In the US as well, immigrant labour, including by undocumented workers, has long propped up the <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/18/ripple-effect-in-us-anti-immigrant-policy-strains-child-and-eldercare\">childcare, home care and elder care industries</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-promised-an-economic-boom-in-2026\">He promised an ‘economic boom’ in 2026</h2><p>Recent polling has shown that Americans are increasingly concerned about the cost of living and Trump’s handling of the economy.</p><p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released on Wednesday found that just 36 percent approve of Trump’s economic record, and 45 percent say that prices are their primary issue when it comes to economic concerns. More than half said they believed the country was already in a recession.</p><p>The president tackled this head-on with assurances that his policies are working and the economy is on track to experience a boom.</p><p>He added that the next chief of the Federal Reserve will agree to bring down interest rates “by a lot”. Current chair Jerome Powell’s term comes to an end in May 2026 and Trump is expected to announce a successor soon. This year, he has pressured the US central bank to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/trump-threatens-major-lawsuit-against-federal-reserve-chief-jerome-powell\">reduce interest rates</a>, and even suggested he could fire Powell over the issue.</p><p>He did address the issue of rising medical costs, which Democrats say will soar when key healthcare subsidies for people on low incomes expire at the end of this year. To counter this, Trump pointed to his efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs through a series of agreements he has made with pharmaceutical companies to sell drugs direct to consumers on his new website, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/3/what-is-trumps-new-trumprx-website-and-will-it-bring-medicine-prices-down\">TrumpRx</a>.</p><p>“There has never been anything like this in the history of our country,” he said. “Drugs have only gone up, but now they’ll be going down by numbers never conceived possible,” Trump said, stating that new price reductions would become available in January and “greatly reduce the costs of healthcare”.</p><p>But he stayed away from some other key concerns among voters – namely, energy and grocery prices, something he pledged to get under control, having slammed the Joe Biden administration for soaring inflation. He has yet to do so.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said: “He was arguing that since he’s taken office, many things, including the main concern for most Americans, which is the affordability of energy as well as food prices, have turned around.</p><p>“But if you’ll notice, as the US president was talking, he didn’t mention anything about energy prices, which are still relatively high for most consumers.</p><p>“And when it comes to the affordability of groceries and food items, going out to restaurants, these are still very high for most Americans, and that has a lot to do with the president’s tariffs, which he says are bringing an enormous amount of revenue into the country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-claims-he-brought-peace-to-the-middle-east\">He claims he brought peace to the Middle East</h2><p>The US president claimed: “I’ve restored American strength, settled eight wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing peace for the first time in 3,000 years, and secured the release of the hostages, both living and dead here at home,” Trump said.</p><p>Observers <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/nobel-peace-prize-2025-what-are-trumps-credentials-and-can-he-win\">dispute</a> that Trump has ended eight wars or brought peace to the Middle East. In particular, the US actively took part in the military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during hostilities between Iran and Israel in June, which ended with a ceasefire mediated by both the US and Qatar.</p><p>He also announced the end of hostilities between Pakistan and India in May after four days of fighting. But while Pakistan credits the US president for helping to halt the fighting, <a href=\"/video/the-bottom-line/2025/9/7/how-did-india-us-relations-decline-so-suddenly\">India insists he had no role</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel was founded in 1948 – rather than 3,000 years ago – and has continued to carry out daily strikes on the Gaza Strip – and to prevent aid from entering – <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/24/no-there-is-no-ceasefire-in-gaza\">despite the ceasefire in place</a>.</p><p>Palestinians, rights groups and some analysts have said a ceasefire exists in name only as Israel violates it almost daily.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-announced-a-warrior-dividend-for-us-troops\">He announced a ‘warrior dividend’ for US troops</h2><p>Trump said 1.45 million United States military service members will soon receive bonus cheques for $1,776 each, paid from revenues raised from trade tariffs imposed on other countries by Trump this year.</p><p>“Think of this: 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call ‘Warrior Dividend’ before Christmas,” Trump said in his televised address, adding that the specific amount was in honour of the year the US was founded.</p><h2 id=\"he-did-not-mention-venezuela-tensions\">He did not mention Venezuela tensions</h2><p>Some observers had speculated that Trump might take the opportunity to make a dramatic announcement about military action against Venezuela during his address – or make a case for military action in the future.</p><p>But despite the fact that he has imposed an oil blockade on Venezuela and amassed the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast\">largest military force</a> in the region in decades, close to the coast of the country, he did not mention the rising tensions between the US and Venezuela.</p><p>Instead, he made just a passing mention of the military strikes carried out on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which the Trump administration claims are trafficking drugs, despite providing no evidence of this, and which have killed about 90 people.</p><p>Legal experts say the targeting of vessels in international waters in the Caribbean and Pacific <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">likely violates</a> US and international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.</p><p>Trump said the US has “decimated the bloodthirsty foreign drug cartels”. He has previously claimed that each strike on a boat “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/does-each-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-save-25000-us-lives\">saves 25,000 American lives</a>” by preventing drugs from reaching the US. However, experts say this is doubtful as there is <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">little evidence</a> that Venezuela is a major source of drugs trafficked to the US.</p><p>This week, he signed <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-signs-executive-order-labeling-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction\">an executive order</a> declaring the potent opiate drug, fentanyl, which he says is one of those being trafficked, a “weapon of mass destruction”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c2368c33fdc84e50bcd227228e3edb94_6.webp?resize=1200%2C675",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"235\" data-end=\"673\">For more than a decade, the Arab Spring has been widely dismissed as a failure, often portrayed as a brief eruption of idealism that collapsed into repression, war and authoritarian restoration. Tunisia’s uprising, which started on December 17, 2010, with the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in Sidi Bouzid, is often remembered in this register: as a tragic prelude to dashed hopes rather than a transformative political moment.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"736\">This reading is incomplete and, in important ways, misleading.</p><p data-start=\"738\" data-end=\"1189\">Bouazizi’s act was not merely a reaction to police brutality, corruption or economic exclusion, although all three were real. It was a moral rupture that shattered the quiet normalisation of humiliation and laid bare the ethical foundations of authoritarian rule. What followed in Tunisia, and soon across much of the Arab world, was not simply protest, but an awakening: a collective realisation about dignity, belonging and the limits of obedience.</p><p data-start=\"1191\" data-end=\"1630\">The Arab Spring should therefore be understood less as a failed transition than as a lasting transformation of political consciousness. Its most consequential effects were not institutional but experiential, reshaping how people understood citizenship, legitimacy and their own capacity to act. Even where regimes survived or reasserted control, that shift did not disappear. It altered the terrain on which power is contested to this day.</p><p data-start=\"1632\" data-end=\"2086\">For this reason, the uprisings cannot be understood as isolated national revolts. From Tunis to Cairo, Sanaa to Benghazi, different societies moved in parallel, shaped by distinct histories but animated by a shared emotional and political grammar. Protesters were not only demanding material change; they were asserting themselves as political subjects, rejecting the idea that power could indefinitely deny them visibility, voice and equal citizenship.</p><p data-start=\"2088\" data-end=\"2455\">The uprisings were enactments of this shift. They redefined what legitimacy meant and who could claim it. In occupying public space, people were not merely opposing regimes but rehearsing alternative ways of living together. The Arab Spring was less a programme than a practice, shaped through action rather than design: a lived reimagining of political possibility.</p><p data-start=\"2457\" data-end=\"2930\">One of its most consequential dimensions was the transformation of streets and squares into sites of collective learning. Places long monopolised by the state’s coercive and symbolic power were reclaimed as arenas of participation and mutual recognition. In Cairo’s Tahrir Square, Tunis’s Bourguiba Avenue and Sanaa’s Change Square, common citizens organised security, cleaned streets, debated demands and negotiated differences. Public space became a school of politics.</p><p data-start=\"2932\" data-end=\"3366\">These moments mattered for a simple reason: they showed that democracy is not only a constitutional arrangement but a social practice learned through action. Protesters did not simply demand rights; they enacted responsibility. Even when these spaces were later cleared or violently reclaimed, the experience of inhabiting them left a lasting imprint. Once people have lived democracy, however briefly, they carry its memory forward.</p><p data-start=\"3368\" data-end=\"3884\">The Arab uprisings also revealed why cities matter. Revolts are often ignited in peripheral and marginal spaces, with Sidi Bouzid being the most powerful example, but they are sustained or defeated in urban centres. This is not a claim about virtue but about structure. Cities concentrate institutions, social networks and historical memory. They bring people into direct confrontation with the machinery of power, including ministries, courts and security services, and make authority tangible rather than abstract.</p><p data-start=\"3886\" data-end=\"4238\">Urban life fosters dense repertoires of sociability: trust, cooperation, debate and solidarity forged in markets, neighbourhoods, mosques and universities. These networks enable collective action to persist beyond the initial moment of rupture. Without them, uprisings risk remaining episodic. With them, they acquire durability, even under repression.</p><p data-start=\"4240\" data-end=\"4534\">Repression, of course, came swiftly and brutally. The exhilaration of those early months was followed by counter-revolution, militarisation and war. In many Arab cities, regimes responded by reasserting control over bodies, spaces and memory. It would be dishonest to romanticise what followed.</p><p data-start=\"4536\" data-end=\"4935\">Yet repression did not erase the symbolic struggle unleashed in 2011. Across the region, protesters targeted not only rulers but the imagery and rituals that sustained authoritarian power. Portraits were torn down, slogans scrawled over symbols of dominance, and statues defaced. These acts were not theatrical excesses. They were attempts to dismantle the emotional architecture of fear and submission.</p><p data-start=\"4937\" data-end=\"5260\">Such moments leave traces even when they are followed by defeat. The experience of collective transgression, of crossing lines once deemed inviolable, alters how authority is seen and felt. People learn that power can be confronted, mocked and undone, even if temporarily. That knowledge does not disappear with repression.</p><p data-start=\"5262\" data-end=\"5596\">This is why the Arab Spring is not dead, despite sustained efforts to portray it as a historical error or a cautionary tale. What survived was not a set of institutions but a pedagogy of liberty. Learned through action and reflection in public space, this pedagogy reshaped how people understood agency, responsibility and resistance.</p><p data-start=\"5598\" data-end=\"6035\">Its effects are visible today in quieter, more fragmented struggles. Across the region, younger generations mobilise around social justice, environmental degradation and public accountability. They may not invoke 2011, but they operate with an inherited refusal of fatalism. A graffiti in Hay Ettadhamen, a marginalised suburb of Tunis, captures this enduring scepticism: “Is Tunisia a republic, a monarchy, an animal farm, or a prison?”</p><p data-start=\"6037\" data-end=\"6393\">The Arab Spring’s most enduring contribution lies here. It demonstrated that even acts originating in marginal spaces can reshape collective imagination and expand the horizon of the possible. Bouazizi’s defiance did not produce instant democracy. But it ignited a critical consciousness that continues to animate struggles against injustice and exclusion.</p><p data-start=\"6395\" data-end=\"6458\">The uprisings did not fail. They changed form, but not meaning.</p><p data-start=\"6395\" data-end=\"6458\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

What followed was not simply a regional revolt, but a historic demand for dignity, accountability, and democratic rule.</p><p>Predictably, regimes responded with <a href=\"/features/2011/2/21/gaddafi-hits-with-deadly-force\">heavy-handed</a> tactics – numerous demonstrators were killed, beaten, or arrested.</p><p>But the pro-democracy movement achieved significant early successes.</p><p>Within months, four longstanding dictators – Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, and Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh – were all toppled.</p><p>In a handful of countries – Bahrain, Algeria, and Iraq among them – regimes successfully quelled protests, ending them before they could gain serious momentum.</p><p>Protest movements in other countries resulted in limited reforms or, in the case of Syria, prolonged civil war without immediate regime change.</p><p>Like Syria, Libya and Yemen ultimately descended into violent conflict.</p><p>Egypt and Tunisia were the only Arab Spring countries that could point to significant longer-term successes – both countries quickly toppled their dictators and almost immediately began democratic transitions.</p><p>Despite mixed results, observers generally praised the Arab Spring as a revolutionary democratic moment for a region long mired in tyranny. Yet, 15 years on, it is clear that while popular demands for democracy endured, authoritarian regimes have learned how to ensure such uprisings would never succeed again.</p><h2 id=\"the-cases-of-egypt-and-tunisia\">The cases of Egypt and Tunisia</h2><p>In both Egypt and Tunisia, democratic transitions appeared initially to take hold: Constituent assemblies were formed, new constitutions were drafted, new political parties and media outlets were established, and new political leaders were elected.</p><p>Importantly, in both countries, parties formed by the Muslim Brotherhood – which has long been well-organised in much of the region – quickly gained influence.</p><p>Some observers viewed the political rise and influence of centrist Islamists as something benign, even positive, while others argued it posed a problem.</p><p>Arguments about the potential merits or shortcomings of political Islam aside, both Egypt and Tunisia were initially seen as hopeful models of Arab democratic transformation, precisely because they suggested that authoritarianism was not an Arab inevitability.</p><p>Although their transitions were fraught with serious challenges and sometimes full-on crises, both countries showed that modern Arab societies were capable of building democratic systems, even if imperfect and fragile.</p><p>More importantly, perhaps, the examples of Egypt and Tunisia showed that Arab citizenries were democratically eager – election turnout figures in both countries were comparable to those of some established Western democracies.</p><p>But appearances and voter turnout numbers were at least partly deceiving, particularly in the case of Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party and its representatives came out victorious in referendums and elections, including the presidency, but never truly held power.</p><p>Egypt’s “<a href=\"/opinions/2012/1/25/egypt-the-revolution-that-shame-built\">deep state</a>” – the military, police, intelligence agencies, judiciary and media apparatus – never fully exited the political scene.</p><p>The old regime successfully sabotaged a pair of elected parliaments and then, in the summer of 2013, collaborated with anti-Islamist Egyptian liberals to overthrow Egypt’s first-ever democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi.</p><p>The 2013 Egyptian <a href=\"/features/2018/7/2/egyptian-society-being-crushed-five-years-after-military-coup\">coup</a> represented a complete democratic reversal, a return to the pre-2011 status quo, and arguably something even more tyrannical.</p><p>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who had served as Morsi’s defence minister, quickly consolidated power. He <a href=\"/opinions/2016/1/24/another-arab-spring-is-coming-to-egypt\">oversaw</a> mass killings, mass arrests, political party bans, media closures, sham elections, and the eventual overhaul of Egypt’s legal and political frameworks.</p><p>Experts have argued cogently that the authoritarian system el-Sisi has created is even more despotic than Mubarak’s.</p><p>Tunisia’s flirtation with democracy lasted longer than Egypt’s but ultimately experienced a similar backslide.</p><p>In 2014, Tunisia prepared a new constitution and elected its first democratic president, Beji Caid Essebsi.</p><p>But the 2019 election of a new president, Kais Saied, marked the beginning of the end of Tunisia’s democratic experiment.</p><p>In July 2021, about two years after taking office, Saied overthrew Tunisia’s nascent democracy, claiming emergency powers, dismissing the prime minister, and suspending parliament.</p><p>Since that time, Saied has further consolidated power.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons learned</h2><p>It is clear that the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes learned at least one thing from the 2010-2011 pro-democracy protest movements: Their dictatorships had not been sufficiently authoritarian.</p><p>In both nations, the political and legal frameworks have been carefully reengineered to prevent exactly the kind of civil disobedience witnessed 15 years ago.</p><p>Not even the slightest protest or opposition is to be tolerated.</p><p>In Egypt, for example, a 2013 protest law prohibits public demonstrations; and a 2015 terrorism law considers any act of “intimidation” which “harms national unity”, “disturbs the public order”, or “impedes public authorities … from carrying out their work” to be an act of “terrorism”.</p><p>The post-2013 Egyptian military regime has also demonstrated that it will not leave any elections to chance.</p><p>The government has orchestrated <a href=\"/opinions/2018/3/24/is-egypts-sham-election-made-in-the-usa\">sham</a> elections, passed an electoral <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/27/egypts-all-important-parliamentary-elections-arent-elections-at-all\">law</a> that guarantees the parliament’s fealty to the president, and revised the constitution to extend el-Sisi’s rule to 2030.</p><p>Where cracks have allowed opposition figures to run for president, el-Sisi has used his grip on power to have them arrested or forced into permanent exile.</p><p>Experts have noted how closely Tunisia’s Saied has followed in el-Sisi’s footsteps.</p><p>Although he hasn’t established el-Sisi-level repression in Tunisia, Saied has, like his Egyptian counterpart, rewritten the constitution, expanded presidential powers and eliminated checks and balances.</p><p>Data gathered by the Bertelsmann Transformation Index show that, on numerous political and economic indicators, Tunisia has regressed to pre-Arab Spring levels.</p><h2 id=\"cracks-in-the-system\">Cracks in the system</h2><p>Fifteen years after the Arab Spring, the root problems that led to demonstrations – corruption, injustice, and economic hardship – still exist and are perhaps more pressing now than they were back then.</p><p>Arab countries overwhelmingly score poorly on the annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), with many placed near the bottom of the world rankings, and states also remain mired in injustice.</p><p>For example, out of 21 Arab countries recently evaluated by Freedom House, none were rated “free”; and of the nine Arab nations assessed in 2025 as part of the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, most placed near the bottom of global rankings.</p><p>Importantly, as a whole – Gulf countries notwithstanding – the Arab region continues to be mired in economic hardship.</p><p>According to the World Bank, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) remains exceedingly low in most non-Gulf states, and the United Nations says food shortages and hunger remain significant problems across much of the region.</p><p>Economic problems in Egypt and Tunisia are indicative of conditions in much of the rest of the region.</p><p>In Egypt, since the 2011 uprising, both the military’s economic empire and the inequality gap have grown, while inflation and poverty have increased.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tunisian economy is also backsliding.</p><p>According to a recent report published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Saied’s economic approach has led to a huge increase in internal debt and a “collapse of [economic] growth”, in addition to “reduced real wages and increased unemployment”.</p><h2 id=\"democracy-the-elephant-in-the-room\">Democracy: The elephant in the room</h2><p>What is perhaps most alarming for Arab regimes is that their citizenries continue to overwhelmingly desire democratic government.</p><p>According to the Arab Opinion Index, more than 70 percent of Arab respondents support democracy, compared with only 19 percent who do not.</p><p>Survey results also suggest that Arab citizens provide negative assessments of democracy levels in their countries; tend to associate democracy with freedom, equality, and justice; and hold favourable views of the Arab Spring.</p><p>More recent Arab Barometer polling suggests similar findings.</p><h2 id=\"the-arab-spring-is-not-over\">The Arab Spring is not over</h2><p>In December 2024, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was toppled and forced into exile, about 14 years after the uprising against him began.</p><p>This cataclysmic event demonstrated, perhaps better than anything else, that analysts may have been premature in declaring the death of the Arab Spring.</p><p>Recent <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/gen-z-protesters-rally-across-morocco-demanding-health-education-reforms\">Gen Z protests</a> in Morocco offer more evidence that many Arabs – especially young people – are able, willing, and ready to fight for change.</p><p>It may, then, be only a matter of time before a boiling point is reached and another round of protests begins.</p><p>Governments know the risk is real. Egypt’s el-Sisi regime again provides a useful case in point.</p><p>In recent years, el-Sisi has been forced to repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2020/9/27/egypts-sisi-warns-of-instability-after-protest-calls\">warn</a> Egyptians against protesting.</p><p>During public remarks several years ago, he said that a repeat of the 2011 uprising would “never happen again” in Egypt.</p><p>The paranoia is real – Egypt’s deep state does not appear willing to take any chances by opening up the political arena.</p><p>The regime has recently put its broad election-rigging program into <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/27/egypts-all-important-parliamentary-elections-arent-elections-at-all\">overdrive</a> and is reportedly seeking to extend el-Sisi’s rule indefinitely.</p><p>Not content with eliminating opposition at home, the Egyptian government has also sought to prevent opposition abroad.</p><p>The regime has tried to shut down opposition media outlets based outside Egypt and has sought to have popular opposition figures extradited to the country.</p><p>Earlier this year, a young Egyptian, Anas Habib, organised a peaceful protest at the Egyptian embassy in The Hague.</p><p>In response, Egypt’s foreign minister urged embassy staff there to detain protesters and have them arrested. In an act of apparent revenge, Egyptian authorities arrested Habib’s elderly uncle in Egypt.</p><p>Beyond Egypt, Arab states have recently begun intensifying internal security cooperation, with governments aggressively seeking out individuals wanted in other countries for extradition.</p><p data-start=\"11510\" data-end=\"11660\">These extreme actions underscore the paranoia: Arab regimes appear to understand that this is an intermission, not a finale, in the Arab Spring.</p><p data-start=\"11662\" data-end=\"11751\">History suggests that when the movement continues, it will not be announced in advance.</p><p data-start=\"11753\" data-end=\"11858\">The people almost always have the last word. We simply do not know when they will choose to speak it.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Short vowels are typically omitted in everyday writing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179362\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179362\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-The-Arabic-alphabet-Arabic-Language-day-1765976624.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - The Arabic alphabet - Arabic Language day-1765976624\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>These features, together with Arabic’s extensive vocabulary, have contributed to the perception that the language is difficult for non-native speakers to learn.</p><p>However, Al Hamad says this perception is far from accurate for many people.</p><p>“One of the biggest misconceptions about Arabic is that it is among the most difficult languages in the world,” he said. “In reality, it is simply a language with systems that differ from English or from many European languages.”</p><p>He added that while the Arabic script may appear unfamiliar to some learners, it is “quite familiar” to speakers of other languages, such as Urdu and Farsi. Speakers of those languages, Al Hamad says, often find Arabic easier to read while Turkish speakers may find its vocabulary easier to memorise due to the thousands of Arabic words Turkish has absorbed.</p><h2 id=\"from-a-for-algebra-to-t-for-tariffs\">From A for algebra to T for tariffs</h2><p>One of the biggest contributions the Arabic language has made to the world is in the fields of mathematics and science.</p><p>Over time, some of these words entered other languages in shortened or adapted forms, becoming so familiar that their origins are often forgotten.</p><p>One example is algebra, a cornerstone of mathematics. The term comes from the Arabic word al-jabr, meaning “restoration” or “reunion”. It originally appeared in the title of a ninth-century work on solving equations by the Baghdad-based Persian scholar Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, after whom the word “algorithm” is derived.</p><p>Other Arabic words underwent more dramatic transformations. Carat, the unit used to measure the weight of gemstones, traces its roots to the Arabic word qirat.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179838\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Common-English-words-with-Arabic-roots-1765989016.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Common English words with Arabic roots-1765989016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>According to Al Hamad, these changes reveal how English and other languages adapt unfamiliar sounds. “Because English has relatively few words beginning with Q,” he explains, “Arabic words such as qirat were reshaped using more familiar sounds like C, G or K, producing forms such as carat.”</p><p>The same process can be seen in everyday vocabulary beyond science and mathematics. The word giraffe, for instance, comes from the Arabic zarafa, and went through a similar transformation as English and other European languages reshaped the original sounds to fit their own phonetic patterns, much as they did with words beginning with the Arabic letter Q.</p><p>On the other hand, words such as tariff, which is derived from the Arabic word ta’rif, meaning “to notify” or “to announce”, entered English through contact with other languages involved in trade.</p><p>Al Hamad says these words “most likely entered the English language via Romance languages” although not necessarily in the forms we recognise today. He adds that they also passed through Turkish, which “borrowed heavily from Arabic” and influenced the medieval world through trade and warfare. Later, during the British colonial era, English both borrowed from and contributed words directly to Arabic.</p></div></div></body></html>"
