At least 10 officers sustained minor injuries, police said. According to Berisha, 25 protesters were arrested.</p><p>In November, a special corruption court suspended Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku, a close Rama ally, over her alleged role in a public procurement corruption case. Balluku, who also serves as infrastructure and energy minister, has denied the allegations, while Rama condemned her suspension as a “brutal act of interference in the independence of the executive”.</p><p>Following a request from the government, the Constitutional Court in December temporarily reinstated Balluku pending its final ruling.

He had been on hunger strike since November, briefly pausing in December due to severe ill health.</p><p>The group “allegedly blocked prison staff from entering and leaving, threatened police officers and a number managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building”, the police said.</p><p>Videos of the incident verified by Al Jazeera show police officers shoving protesters to the ground and handcuffing them as shouts ring out in the background. Two groups of police also appeared to kettle protesters – a police tactic that involves officers surrounding and closing in on a group of demonstrators in an effort to contain them.</p><p>“Why are you assaulting me?” a woman can be heard asking at one point.</p><p>Those arrested were detained under suspicion of aggravated trespass, the police said.</p><p>Khalid <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/pro-palestine-activist-on-hunger-strike-says-he-will-begin-refusing-water\">told Al Jazeera</a> last week that he planned to escalate his hunger strike to exclude all fluids starting on Saturday, the day of the protest.</p><p>After speaking with him on Monday by phone, Khalid’s mother, Shabana Khalid, told Al Jazeera that a prison guard remains outside his cell in case he needs urgent medical attention. She added that he is also being monitored closely with hourly medical observations.</p><p>“I’m reassured in one sense,” she said, “but the fact he’s on [hunger strike] still is quite scary. He’s starting to get tired. You can hear in his voice.”</p><p>Umer Khalid is among a group of five activists <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">accused of breaking into</a> the United Kingdom’s largest airbase, Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire in June and spray-painting two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. The group has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/five-pro-palestinian-activists-plead-not-guilty-over-uk-air-base-break-in\">pleaded not guilty</a>.</p><p>At the time, the pro-Palestine protest group Palestine Action said two of its members were involved and red paint “symbolising Palestinian bloodshed was also sprayed across the runway and a Palestine flag was left on the scene”.</p><p>Within days, the UK government moved to <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">ban the group</a> under “antiterrorism” laws and made it illegal to support or promote the group.</p><p>The decision – which has been challenged in court and heavily criticised as “unjustified” by the United Nations – has led to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/10/uk-police-arrested-522-people-at-palestine-action-protests-in-london\">multiple</a> <a href=\"/news/2025/9/7/uk-police-arrest-almost-900-protesters-at-pro-palestine-action-rally\">protests</a> with hundreds of arrests in the months since.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"ongoing-hunger-strikes\">Ongoing hunger strikes</h2><p>Aside from Umer Khalid, seven other protesters have been involved in rolling hunger strikes since November.</p><p>Khalid became the only one still refusing food after three members of the group <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/three-palestine-action-activists-end-uk-hunger-strike\">ended their protests</a> this month. They said one of their demands had been met after a UK-based subsidiary of the Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems was denied a UK government contract.</p><p>“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state,” the Prisoners for Palestine Group said.</p><p>Two of the prisoners who concluded their hunger strikes, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed, were on the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-near-death-intent-on-continuing-protests\">brink of death</a> after more than two months without food. Still, Muraisi <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uk-hunger-striker-heba-muraisi-i-think-about-how-or-when-i-could-die\">told Al Jazeera</a> in the days before the announcement that she felt “it’s important to fight for justice and for freedom”.</p><p>The group’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/palestine-action-hunger-strikes-what-are-their-demands\">list of demands</a> includes bail, the right to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action as well as for Elbit sites to be closed in the UK. They’re also seeking an end to what they call censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls, books and visitation rights.</p><p>Before starting to refuse liquids on Saturday, Umer Khalid told Al Jazeera: “The only thing that seems to have any impact, whether that is positive or negative, is drastic action.”</p><p>“The strike reflects the severity of this imprisonment,” he added. “Being in this prison is not living life. Our lives have been paused. The world spins, and we sit in a concrete room. This strike reflects the severity of my demands.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s what the chairman has said too, so we’ll wait for their decision.”</p><p>India will ​host the majority of the T20 World Cup ‌matches, but Pakistan will play exclusively in Sri Lanka because of the fraught political relations between New Delhi and Islamabad.</p><p>Bangladesh have been replaced by Scotland for their refusal ‌to tour India due to safety concerns, which the ICC rejected last week.</p><p>In addition to Babar, spin-bowling all-rounder Shadab ⁠Khan and fast bowler Naseem Shah have also returned, but there was no place for wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan.</p><p>Pakistan’s selectors excluded fast bowler Mohammad Wasim from the 16-member squad announced for next week’s three-match T20 series against Australia in Lahore.</p><p>They also continued to ignore Rauf, who hasn’t played since competing in the Asia Cup in September but kept faith with struggling Babar, who scored 202 runs at a strike rate of 103.06 in 11 Big Bash League games while opening the batting for Sydney Sixers.</p><p>“We don’t see him opening the batting [at the World Cup],” head coach Mike Hesson said. “He hasn’t opened the batting for us because the ability to attack in the powerplay is very important.”</p><p>Hesson said Babar could come in handy on slow pitches in Sri Lanka, where Pakistan are scheduled to play all their games, including the playoffs if they advance in the tournament.</p><p>“He [Babar] certainly has the skill to control the middle overs if required and then to feed the strike to certain players,” Hesson said. “If we’re chasing a lower score, he certainly has that ability to control a chase. … The conditions in Australia are significantly different than what we’re going to face in Sri Lanka, so we factored all those things in.”</p><p>Hesson said the selectors preferred the three fast bowlers – Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza and Naseem Shah – after taking into account their abilities to bowl in all three T20 phases.</p><p>With the wickets likely to suit spinners, Pakistan included four spinners: Mohammad Nawaz, Khan, Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq.</p><p>Pakistan play their opening Group A match against the Netherlands on February 7, followed by matches against the United States (February 10), India (February 15) and Namibia (February 18).</p><p><strong>Pakistan squad:</strong> Salman Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay (wicketkeeper), Mohammad Nawaz, ‍Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wicketkeeper), Saim Ayub, Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wicketkeeper), Usman Tariq</p></div></div></body></html>"

In another case, the father of a five-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a US citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a five-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.</p><p>The events have led to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/minnesota-sues-trump-administration-over-immigration-crackdown\">protests</a> and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain people? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public and private spaces, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?</p><p>Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.</p><h2 id=\"what-rights-do-people-have-when-approached-by-ice\">What rights do people have when approached by ICE?</h2><p>Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone, including immigrants suspected of being in the US illegally, is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/a-constitutional-loophole-how-phone-inspections-test-us-civil-rights\">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p><p>“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specialising in immigration cases.</p><p>The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.</p><p>For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions – such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest – require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the US illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.</p><p>Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption”, said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed, or would be committed.</p><p>Agents must meet a higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause”, which generally requires sufficient evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.</p><h2><span>What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?</span></h2><p>Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.</p><p>In the Noem vs Perdomo case of 2025, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favour of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles, California. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.</p><p>Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area”, Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile”.</p><p>Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling”, said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.</p><p>But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not cosigned by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility”, said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.</p><p>Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump vs Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.</p><h2 id=\"do-people-s-rights-differ-inside-their-homes-versus-in-a-public-space\">Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?</h2><p>The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.</p><p>“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as when an officer encounters a violent crime in progress or someone needing medical care.</p><p>Securing a judicial warrant is time-consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.</p><p>In the past, federal immigration officers would typically not enter homes forcibly if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE, without a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/us-judge-orders-curbs-on-ice-agents-actions-against-minnesota-protesters\">judge</a>’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Specific ICE officials have the authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.</p><p>A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press news agency reported on January 22.</p><p>The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo”.</p><p>The memo dated May 12, 2025, signed by acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the US Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose”.</p><p>If this policy were to be challenged in court, it is unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-people-do-if-they-think-ice-has-infringed-on-their-fourth-amendment-rights\">What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?</h2><p>If one believes that their rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, their options for suing for compensation are limited.</p><p>Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil <a href=\"/features/2026/1/23/are-ice-agents-trained-to-shoot-and-evade-lawsuits\">lawsuits</a> against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions before tightening them again.</p><p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”</p><p>David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p><p>Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The eruption of fighting has rocked a nation trying to recover from nearly 14 years of war.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The truce extension has offered a respite as the army closed in on the last SDF strongholds last week. Al-Sharaa abruptly announced the ceasefire on January 17, giving the SDF until Saturday night to lay down its arms and come up with a plan to integrate itself into the army or to resume fighting.</p><p>The extension gives the SDF more time for such a plan.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Raqqa, said the ceasefire extension has been received positively in the region. “The news certainly lifted the mood of the residents here in Raqqa,” he said.</p><p>He added that locals said they want long-term stability with schools, which “have not been operational in a meaningful manner in a decade”, reopening in the region.</p><p>Basravi said the government aims to use the coming two weeks to “cement a long-term ceasefire and focus on reconstruction efforts”.</p><p>State media reported on Sunday that two young people were killed by SDF gunfire in northeastern Syria despite the ongoing ceasefire.</p><p>One person was killed in Hasakah and another one in a rural area in Qamishli, according to to the state media report.</p><p>Meanwhile, the SDF claimed that “Damascus factions” are launching attacks on villages located in the west of Kobani city, and al-Jalbia located in the southeast of the city.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"extension-after-truce-expires\">Extension after truce expires</h2><p>An hour before midnight – three hours after the four-day truce expired – on Saturday, the Ministry of Defence announced that its forces would cease military operations for a further 15 days to support an ongoing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">US operation</a> to transfer ISIL (ISIS) detainees from SDF prisons in Syria to Iraq.</p><p>The SDF confirmed the extension, saying it was reached “through international mediation while dialogue with Damascus continues”.</p><p>“Our forces affirm their commitment to the agreement and their dedication to respecting it, which contributes to de-escalation, the protection of civilians, and the creation of the necessary conditions for stability,” it said in a statement.</p><p>Basravi said Syrians in Raqqa have been celebrating not only the extended truce but also the release of people there, including minors, from <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/syrian-govt-says-it-controls-prison-in-raqqa-with-isil-linked-detainees\">al-Aqtan prison</a> who locals said have been imprisoned on unjust charges.</p><p>“The Syrian administration here is going through all of those case logs and looking for anyone who is underage or unjustly accused,” Basravi said. “They are separating dangerous detainees, particularly the ISIL ones, from everyone else.”</p><p>Kurdish authorities who previously managed al-Aqtan prison said in a statement on Saturday that a section of it held juveniles “who were involved in crimes” as well as “others who had fallen victim to recruitment and exploitation by ISIS”.</p><p>“Due to security circumstances, the Prisons Administration transferred these juveniles approximately three months ago from the juvenile detention centre to al-Aqtan Prison,” the statement said, adding that they received special treatment in accordance with international standards during their time there.</p><h2 id=\"kobani-s-humanitarian-crisis\">Kobani’s humanitarian crisis</h2><p>Basravi noted that the international community has been worried about the humanitarian conditions in the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, in northern Syria, where some of the SDF forces have withdrawn as the Syrian army advanced in the region.</p><p>He added that the United Nations in Syria and the government confirmed the arrival of a humanitarian convoy of 24 trucks carrying food, fuel and relief items in the city, which has been harshly impacted by the hostilities, suffering days without power and water.</p><p>Dilo Doman, an armed Kurdish volunteer in the northeastern SDF-held town of Hasakah, said fighters were deployed on the front line with “high morale”.</p><p>“As far as it takes, we will not attack, but they might attack,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We are ready if the war erupts.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"fraught-government-sdf-talks\">Fraught government-SDF talks</h2><p>Al-Sharaa, whose forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive in late 2024, has promised to bring all of Syria under state control, including SDF-held areas in the northeast.</p><p>But Kurdish authorities, who have run autonomous civilian and military institutions there for the past decade, have resisted joining with state and military institutions.</p><p>After a year-end deadline for the merger passed with little progress, Syrian troops launched their offensive this month.</p><p>They swiftly captured two key Arab-majority provinces from the SDF, bringing key oilfields, hydroelectric dams and facilities holding ISIL fighters and affiliated civilians under government control.</p><p>Labib Nahhas, a Syrian political analyst, believes the ceasefire extension happened because the SDF has not decided what to do with its agreement with the Syrian government.</p><p>“It is no secret that there is a massive division in the leadership ranks of the organisation – between the PKK-linked elements and what we could call the more moderate elements within the leadership,” he told Al Jazeera from London, referring to the Turkiye-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which is designated as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the United States and European Union.</p><p>“There has not been a decision. There have not been any real confidence-building measures between the Syrian authorities and the SDF,” Nahhas said, adding that the two sides’ communications have been based on exchanging accusations in the past few days.</p><p>ISIL swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014, taking over vast swaths of both countries and declaring Raqqa its de facto capital, committing massacres and other atrocities before ultimately being vanquished by a United States-led coalition, in which the SDF did most of the fighting.</p><p>There have been concerns of a regional ISIL resurgence, especially in Syria, where the group has carried out deadly attacks on Syrian and US forces.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was there to perpetuate violence,” Noem said at a news conference.</p><p>Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commander, Gregory Bovino, said Pretti wanted to do “maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”, while Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, described the victim as “a would-be assassin”.</p><p>But bystander videos verified by the Reuters news agency showed Pretti, holding a mobile phone in his hand, not a gun, as he ⁠tries to help other protesters who have been pushed to the ground by the federal agents.</p><p></p><p>As the videos begin, Pretti can be seen filming as a federal agent pushes away one woman and shoves another ​to the ground. Pretti moves between the agent and the women, then raises his left arm to shield himself as the agent pepper-sprays him.</p><p>Several agents then take ‍hold of Pretti – who struggles with them – and force him onto his hands and knees.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>By any measure, Gaza’s devastation demands urgent and serious reconstruction. Homes, hospitals, schools, farms, cultural heritage, and basic infrastructure lie in ruins. Entire neighbourhoods have been erased. The humanitarian need is undeniable. But urgency should never become an excuse for illusion, spectacle, or political shortcuts.</p><p>The contrast between rhetoric and reality could not be sharper. While United States President Donald Trump and a group of world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, to sign the charter of the so-called Board of Peace and unveil glossy reconstruction plans, the killing in Gaza continued.</p><p>Since the ceasefire came into effect on October 10, no fewer than 480 Palestinians have been killed. Four of them <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/22/live-trump-to-lead-signing-of-charter-for-gaza-board-of-peace-in-davos\">were killed</a> on the very day the charter was signed by 19 ministers and state representatives, many of whom were less interested in the issue of Gaza and much more in being seen alongside Trump.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the board’s carefully staged optimism feels like performance rather than transformation. It resembles a sandpit where those signing up get to build sandcastles with Trump that will wash away with the first real wave.</p><p>The proposals may look impressive and sound hopeful, but structurally, they are hollow. They sidestep the real drivers of the conflict, marginalise Palestinian agency, privilege Israeli military priorities over civilian recovery, and align uncomfortably with longstanding efforts to maintain the occupation, displace Palestinians, and deny the right of return for the population uprooted in 1948 and 1967.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-is-not-a-real-estate-prospectus\">Gaza is not a real estate prospectus</h2><p>The glossy vision of presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner treats Gaza not as a traumatised society emerging from catastrophic violence, but as a blank investment canvas for luxury housing, commercial zones, data hubs, beachfront promenades, and aspirational gross domestic product (GDP) targets.</p><p>It reads less like a recovery plan and more like a real-estate prospectus. Development language replaces political reality. Sleek presentations replace rights. Markets replace justice.</p><p>But Gaza is not a failed start-up looking for venture capital. It is home to more than two million Palestinians who have endured siege, displacement, repeated wars, and chronic insecurity for decades. Reconstruction cannot succeed if it is detached from their lived experiences or if it treats Gaza primarily as an economic asset open to speculative investment, including by extreme Zionists, rather than as a human community struggling to preserve its identity and social fabric.</p><p>For many families, even modest homes in Gaza’s formal refugee camps represented a fragile bridge worth holding on to as a step towards an eventual return to places from which they were forced to flee, in what is today known as Israel.</p><p>These homes were valued not for their comfort or market worth, but for the social networks they sustained and their symbolic links to continuity, memory, and political claims. Palestinians are therefore unlikely to be swayed by offers of glitzy towers, luxurious villas, or promises of a “market economy” under siege. Their experience over the past decades has taught them that no level of material improvement can substitute for deeper aspirations tied to dignity, rootedness, and the right of return.</p><h2 id=\"a-future-designed-without-palestinians\">A future designed without Palestinians</h2><p>A glaring flaw of Trump’s plan is the systematic exclusion of Palestinians themselves from shaping the vision of their future. These plans are unveiled in elite conference halls, not debated with the people whose neighbourhoods have been flattened.</p><p>Without Palestinian ownership, legitimacy collapses. Experience from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere has shown repeatedly that reconstruction imposed from the outside — however well branded — reproduces the very power imbalances that fuel instability in the first place.</p><p>Equally troubling is the plan’s deliberate avoidance of addressing the root causes of Gaza’s suffering: occupation, blockade, and military control. You cannot rebuild sustainably while continuing to preserve and fund the machinery that repeatedly destroys what is built.</p><p>No amount of concrete, branding, or foreign investment can substitute for political resolution. A territory that remains militarily besieged, economically sealed, and politically subjugated will never achieve durable recovery.</p><p>Prosperity cannot flourish inside a cage. The European Union learned this lesson the hard way through multiple reconstruction cycles it funded in Gaza, which may help explain why none of its members rushed to join the board, despite being able to afford the permanent membership fee and despite the political incentives of cultivating a more cordial relationship with Trump in light of the war in Ukraine and his threats on Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"aiding-israel-s-military-control-through-spatial-redesign\">Aiding Israel’s military control through spatial redesign</h2><p>There is also a serious risk that the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/23/analyst-breaks-down-map-of-trumps-gaza-plan#flips-6388132353112:0\">proposed physical design of Gaza</a> would entrench Israeli military strategy rather than restore Palestinian life. The plans envision buffer zones, segmented districts, and so-called “green spaces and corridors” that would break up the territory internally.</p><p>This kind of spatial engineering would facilitate surveillance, control, and rapid military access. Urban planning would become security architecture. Civilian geography would turn into militarised space. What is sold as modernisation would constitute a sophisticated system of containment, just like the illegal settlement networks and road systems in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The emphasis on reclaiming land from the sea using rubble may repeat the problems of Beirut’s reconstruction after the civil war, where newly reclaimed areas attracted disproportionate investment because they were free of unresolved ownership claims, ultimately allowing elites to appropriate the city’s waterfront and pull it away from public use.</p><p>The demographic implications of the plan are equally profound. Shifting Gaza’s population centre southward — closer to Egypt and further from Israel’s settlements — would quietly alter the political and social centre of gravity of Palestinian life.</p><p>It may ease Israeli security anxieties, but it would do so at the expense of Palestinian continuity, identity, and territorial coherence. Population engineering under the banner of reconstruction raises serious ethical concerns and risks externalising Gaza’s long-term humanitarian burden onto neighbouring states. This may also help explain Egypt’s absence from the signing ceremony and its decision to limit participation to its intelligence leadership.</p><h2 id=\"no-amount-of-political-theatre-can-replace-freedom\">No amount of political theatre can replace freedom</h2><p>The Board of Peace itself also deserves careful scrutiny. Its branding suggests neutrality and collective stewardship, yet its political framing remains highly personalised around Trump, with little clarity about how it is meant to operate in practice.</p><p>This is not the kind of multilateral peacebuilding mechanism envisaged by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803 of November 2025; it is political theatre. Peace mechanisms anchored in personalities rather than institutions and international law rarely survive political change.</p><p>At the heart of all this lies a familiar but dangerous assumption: that economic growth can substitute for political rights. History teaches the opposite. People do not resist simply because they are poor; they resist because they lack dignity, security, freedom of expression, and self-determination. No master plan can bypass these realities. No skyline can compensate for political exclusion.</p><p>This does not mean Gaza must wait for the perfect peace before rebuilding. Recovery must proceed urgently. But rebuilding must empower Palestinians rather than redesign their constraints. It must dismantle systems of control, not embed them into concrete and zoning maps. It must confront the political roots of destruction rather than cosmetically repackage its aftermath.</p><p>Until those foundations exist, the Board of Peace and Kushner’s vision risk becoming exactly what they resemble — a form of sandcastle diplomacy: impressive to the global public, comforting to elites, and destined to wash away when the first serious wave of political reality arrives.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It prompted the ICC to broker an agreement between the two countries, allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.</p><p>All of India’s Champions Trophy matches, including the final, were hosted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Outspoken former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi questioned the ICC’s decision and said it left him “deeply disappointed”.</p><p>“Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect – not mixed standards,” he wrote on X.</p><p>“The ICC should build bridges, not burn them.”</p><p></p><p>While India and Bangladesh do not share the same hostile relationship, their ties have been affected by recent political tensions.</p><p>Another former Pakistan captain, Mohammad Yousuf, said Bangladesh’s cricket fans were being “deprived of cricket”.</p><p>“Very sad to see a cricket-loving nation like Bangladesh being deprived of cricket due to security concerns not being addressed,” he said.</p><p>Yousuf, who also worked as Pakistan’s batting coach, urged the ICC to show fairness in its practices.</p><p>“When similar concerns were raised earlier, a neutral venue was approved,” he said.</p><p>“Standards cannot change from country to country. ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”</p><h2 id=\"pakistan-slams-injustice\">Pakistan slams ‘injustice’</h2><p>While Pakistan are set to play all their T20 World Cup fixtures in Sri Lanka, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi said their participation was still not confirmed.</p><p>“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, said when asked to comment on the ICC’s decision.</p><p>“Our stance [on World Cup participation] will be what the government of Pakistan instructs me,” he said. “It’s the [Pakistan] government’s decision. We obey them, not the ICC.”</p><p>Naqvi said the ICC did an injustice to Bangladesh.</p><p>“You can’t have double standards. You can’t say for one country [India] they can do whatever they want and for the others to have to do the complete opposite,” he said. “That’s why we’ve taken this stand and made clear Bangladesh have had an injustice done to them. They should play in the World Cup; they are a major stakeholder in cricket.”</p><p>Naqvi said if the government blocked Pakistan from playing in the World Cup, “then maybe the ICC will bring in a 22nd team [after Scotland]. It’s up to the government”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, has been thrust into the geopolitical spotlight for weeks amid United States President Donald Trump’s escalating threats to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trump-rules-out-using-force-to-take-over-greenland-calls-for-negotiations\">seize the island</a>.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trump-nixes-european-tariff-threats-over-greenland-after-nato-chief-talks\">appeared to partly back off</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, claiming he had ruled out taking Greenland by force. He and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte had agreed on a “long-term” framework for a future deal involving Greenland and the Arctic region, the president said.</p><p>Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said much of the supposed deal was murky, including whether Trump would seek control of territory near US military bases, as some reports suggested.</p><p>“I don’t know what there is in the agreement, or the deal, about my country,” Nielsen said.</p><p>“But sovereignty is a red line,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
