Colombia has, for many years, been the world’s largest source of cocaine.</p><p>And like Trump, Noboa has increasingly relied on tariffs against Colombia to force adherence to Ecuador’s national security strategy.</p><p>His government has accused Petro’s of failing to cooperate with border security measures. The two countries both sit on the Pacific coast, and they share a land border that stretches roughly 586 kilometres, or 364 miles.</p><h2 id=\"questions-about-electricity\">Questions about electricity</h2><p>Thursday’s announcement follows an initial 30 percent tariff imposed by Quito in early February.</p><p>Ecuadorian officials have also justified the protectionist measures by citing a growing trade deficit.</p><p>According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data analysis firm, nearly 4 percent of Colombian exports go to Ecuador, worth roughly $2.13bn. Ecuador imports significant quantities of medicines and pesticides from Colombia.</p><p>Fewer exports go from Ecuador to Colombia, though. Roughly 2.3 percent of Ecuador’s exports abroad go across the shared border, amounting to a value of $863m.</p><p><span>Ecuador’s trade deficit with Colombia sits at roughly $1.03bn through 2025, according to government data, excluding oil.</span></p><p>But in spite of the anticipated tariff hike, it is unclear whether Ecuador will apply the new tariffs to Colombian electricity — a critical resource for the country.</p><p>In a retaliatory move following the initial tariffs, Colombia suspended all energy sales to its neighbour.</p><p>That suspension risks fuelling tensions in Ecuador against Noboa’s government. Recent droughts have created disruptions to Ecuador’s hydroelectric dams, which provide nearly 70 percent of the country’s power.</p><p>Those disruptions have caused <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/12/19/in-the-dark-how-rolling-blackouts-have-transformed-life-in-ecuador\">widespread power outages</a> in recent years, which in turn have prompted antigovernment protests. In the past, Noboa has responded by buying electricity from Colombia.</p><h2 id=\"pipeline-standoff\">Pipeline standoff</h2><p>The transportation of fossil fuels has also become a flashpoint between Ecuador and Colombia in the aftermath of February’s tariffs.</p><p>Noboa’s government has hiked fees for Colombian crude delivered through the Trans-Ecuadorian System Oil Pipeline (SOTE) by 900 percent.</p><p>That raises the cost to approximately $30 per barrel. Colombia has responded by halting all oil shipments through the line.</p><p>Despite high-level diplomatic efforts, tensions between the neighbouring countries remain at an impasse.</p><p>Officials representing foreign policy and security held a meeting this month in Ecuador, but the gathering concluded without a breakthrough.</p><p>In announcing the latest tariff hike, Ecuador’s Ministry of Production and Foreign Trade levelled criticism at Colombia for failing to implement “concrete and effective” measures to curb drug trafficking along the border.</p><p>Once considered a bastion of stability, Ecuador has seen a spike in homicide and other violent crimes.</p><p>According to the Geneva-based Organized Crime Observatory, the Andean nation recorded a homicide rate of approximately one murder every hour last year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It argues that the sanctions are an effort to punish Albanese for bringing attention to rights abuses Israel has perpetuated against Palestinians.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Since 2022, Albanese, a legal scholar, has served as the special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, where she monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians. The UN Human Rights Council selected her for the position.</p><p>The Trump administration, however, sanctioned her last July, calling her “unfit” for her role and accusing her of “biased and malicious activities” against the US and its ally, Israel.</p><p>It also highlighted her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which — at the recommendation of Albanese and other experts — issued an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>Albanese’s family, however, defended her comments as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.</p><p>“Francesca’s expression of her views about the facts as she has found them in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and about the work of the ICC is core First Amendment activity,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-role-chronicling-abuses\">A role chronicling abuses</h2><p>Albanese, an Italian citizen, has long fielded criticism from the Israeli government and its allies in the US for her criticisms of the violence committed against Palestinians.</p><p>Her international profile has grown since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023. More than <a href=\"/features/2026/2/18/gaza-death-toll-exceeds-75000-as-independent-data-verify-loss\">75,000</a> Palestinians have died in that conflict, according to experts and local health officials.</p><p>In March 2024, six months into the war, Albanese <a href=\"/news/2024/3/26/un-expert-accuses-israel-of-several-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza\">testified in a report</a> that she had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the standards for genocide had been reached in Gaza, as outlined in the UN Genocide Convention.</p><p>Israel rejected the findings. Albanese, meanwhile, said <a href=\"/news/2024/3/27/un-expert-says-she-faces-threats-after-israel-gaza-genocide-report\">she faced threats</a> after making her statement to the UN.</p><p>Her public role and blistering condemnation of Israeli abuses have made her a subject of frequent ire for Israeli and US authorities.</p><p>But in Thursday’s lawsuit, Albanese’s family members questioned whether US sanction power should be used to stifle allegations of human rights abuses.</p><p>They also highlighted Albanese’s situation as the mother of a US citizen.</p><p>“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” the court filing said.</p><p>The US Department of State, however, has waved aside the lawsuit as “baseless lawfare”. It maintains that the sanctions against Albanese are “legal and appropriate”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-wider-campaign-in-the-us\">A wider campaign in the US</h2><p>Sanctions generally freeze the US-based assets of an individual and prevent anyone else in the US from doing business with them.</p><p>Since returning for a second term, Trump has used sanctions as penalties for several critics of Israeli and US actions, even beyond Albanese.</p><p>Last June, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-administration-sanctions-international-criminal-court-judges\">sanctioned four ICC judges</a> for taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel. Then, in August, two more ICC judges, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/20/us-expands-sanctions-targeting-international-criminal-court\">plus two prosecutors</a>, were also slapped with sanctions.</p><p>As recently as December, <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">another pair of ICC judges</a> were added to the list for their involvement in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>A growing number of scholars, rights groups and international organisations have said that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.</p><p>Israel and the US, however, have largely refuted that assessment. They have also questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction in their countries.</p><p>Though the US and Israel are not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding document, both have been accused of rights abuses in countries that are members.</p><p>In Albanese’s case, the US government has accused the rapporteur of anti-Semitism and criticised her for pushing for boycotts of US companies implicated in Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.</p><p>“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” the US State Department said in its sanctions <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a>.</p><p>But Albanese has indicated that she remains committed to her work regardless of the disruptions to her life.</p><p>“My daughter is American. I’ve been living in the US, and I have some assets there. So of course, it’s going to harm me,” Albanese said after the sanctions announcement.</p><p>“What can I do? I did everything I did in good faith, and knowing that, my commitment to justice is more important than personal interests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Advocacy groups have called the practice a violation of constitutionally protected rights.</p><p>The Columbia statement did not identify the detained student, but the student newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, said Ellie Aghayeva, a neuroscience researcher, had been targeted.</p><p>At 3:18pm local time (17:00 GMT), New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced he had spoken with President Donald Trump about the situation.</p><p>“I shared my concerns about Columbia student Elaina Aghayeva,” Mamdani <a href=\"https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/2027115998944305457?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> of his meeting with Trump. “He has just informed me that she will be released imminently.”</p><p>Aghayeva subsequently posted on her Instagram account that she was “safe and okay” and on her way home.</p><p>“I need a little bit of time to process everything.

The statement added that the “building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment”.</p><p>Protesters had gathered on Thursday on the campus, which was the site of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/columbia-university-suspends-expels-nearly-80-students-over-gaza-protests\">mass pro-Palestine demonstrations</a> in 2024.</p><h2 id=\"mass-deportation-drive\">Mass deportation drive</h2><p>In a student group chat, Aghayeva wrote to fellow students early on Thursday: “DHS illegally arrested me.

Al Busaidi mediated between the two teams throughout the day, and the US delegation also held separate talks over Ukraine.</p><p class=\"s2\">Also taking part in the talks was Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will have to undertake nuclear monitoring and verification duties in Iran in case of any agreement.</p><p>The UN watchdog will hold several days of board meetings starting on March 6, which is around the 10- to 15-day deadline floated by Trump last week for Iran to reach a deal.</p><p>Western media outlets have suggested the board could once again consider a move to censure Iran depending on the results of the Geneva talks. Iran has accused Grossi of taking politicised action and criticised the IAEA after Israel attacked Iran in June, one day after the agency passed a resolution saying Tehran was not complying with its commitment to nuclear safeguards.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340028\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340028\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340028\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260226__98ZJ79E__v2__HighRes__TensionsIranUsa-1772100954.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gerald Ford carrier\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The US Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford departs Souda Bay on the island of Crete on February 26, 2026, for the coast of Israel, leading a second US carrier strike group to take up positions against Iran [Costas Metaxakis/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fundamental-differences\" class=\"s5\">Fundamental differences</h2><p class=\"s2\">The two sides have been at odds over key issues, including uranium enrichment and missiles.</p><p class=\"s2\">Washington has repeatedly emphasised, in lockstep with Israel, that it will not accept any nuclear enrichment taking place on Iranian soil, even at civilian-use levels agreed during the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran agreed with world powers. Trump unilaterally abandoned that deal in 2018.</p><p class=\"s2\">In the days leading up to the Geneva talks, US officials increasingly focused on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, saying the missiles threaten US military bases across the Middle East as well as Israel. Iran has refused to entertain any talks on its conventional weapons. Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, have repeatedly said they will never develop nuclear weapons.</p><p class=\"s6\">Speaking to local officials during a provincial visit, Pezeshkian also shot back at Trump’s assertion during a lengthy <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/trump-says-preference-is-to-solve-iran-tensions-through-diplomacy\">State of the Union speech</a> that Iran was “the world’s number one sponsor of terror”.</p><p class=\"s2\">Pezeshkian said numerous Iranian officials and nuclear scientists have been assassinated over the decades, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p class=\"s2\">“If the realities are seen fairly, it will become clear that Iran is not only not a supporter of terrorism, but one of the main victims of terror in the region and across the world,” he said.</p><p class=\"s2\">The Iranian government’s IRNA news agency said Tehran’s proposal was expected to gauge US “seriousness” in the talks because it contained “win-win” offers.</p><p class=\"s2\">Iranian officials have not publicly discussed all the details of their proposals, but they are believed to include diluting part of the country’s 60-percent enriched uranium and keeping the uranium inside the country. Iranian authorities envisage that could be paired with economic opportunities for the US related to Iranian oil and gas and the purchase of airplanes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340995\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340995\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340995\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_69a05e68ab-1772117608.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TEHRAN, IRAN - FEBRUARY 21: People are shop at Tajrish bazar in Tehran on February 21, 2026 in Tehran, Iran.

He also said Trump would be unable to overthrow Iran’s government after the US president said regime change would be “the best thing that could happen” in Iran.</p><p>Araghchi said during an interview on Wednesday that even if Khamenei is killed, the theocratic establishment in Iran would carry on because it has legal procedures in place to appoint a successor. Pezeshkian added on Thursday: “They can eliminate me, eliminate anyone. If they hit us, a hundred more like us will come up to run the country.”</p><h2 id=\"double-digit-inflation-as-iran-braces-for-war\" class=\"s5\">Double-digit inflation as Iran braces for war</h2><p class=\"s2\">Iranian and US officials have been hailing supposed “progress” in the indirect talks this month, but many Iranians continue to prepare for war.</p><p class=\"s2\">In Tehran and across the country, people are buying bottled water, biscuits, canned foods and other essentials in case of a war.</p><p class=\"s2\">“A few days ago, I bought a power bank to keep the electronics charged. Now I’m looking for a short-wave radio so we can hear the news if the state shuts down the internet and electricity infrastructure is bombed,” said a 28-year-old resident of the capital who asked not to be named.</p><p class=\"s2\">As bombs fell during the 12-day war with Israel in June, Iranian authorities cut off almost all internet access for several days, followed in January by an <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">unprecedented 20-day total blackout</a> imposed on about 92 million people as thousands of people were killed during nationwide protests.</p><p>The Iranian government, which blames “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel for the protests, has rejected Trump’s claim that 32,000 Iranians were killed during the demonstrations. It said more than 3,000 people were killed, and rejects documentation by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that its security forces were behind the killings.</p><p class=\"s2\">As the threat of war intensifies, not all Iranians are capable of stocking up on food and other necessities due to rising inflation that has gripped the country for more than a decade as a result of a mix of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/corruption-mismanagement-in-spotlight-as-iran-dissolves-major-private-bank\">chronic local mismanagement</a> and US and UN sanctions.</p><p class=\"s2\">According to separate reports by the Statistical Centre of Iran and the Central Bank of Iran released on Thursday, inflation has now shot beyond 60 percent.</p><p class=\"s2\">The Statistical Centre put annual inflation in the Iranian month of Bahman, which ended on February 19, at 68.1 percent, while the Central Bank said it was 62.2 percent.</p><p class=\"s2\">Food inflation was by far the strongest driver at a whopping 105 percent. That included a 207-percent inflation rate for cooking oil, 117 percent for red meat, 108 percent for eggs and dairy products, 113 percent for fruit and 142 percent for bread and corn.</p><p>Iran’s national currency, the rial, stood at about 1.66 million rials to the US dollar on Thursday, near an all-time low.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He gave it top billing in his speech on Tuesday.</p><p>The legislation, dubbed by the president his “Big Beautiful Bill” and by critics as Trump’s “Big Ugly Bill”, codified several of Trump’s top agenda items from his campaign, including populist economic pledges to alleviate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.</p><p>The bill included a raft of other top Trump agenda items: temporarily extending certain tax cuts that had been set to expire; deeply cutting funding for welfare, healthcare and foreign aid programmes; raising the national debt ceiling; rolling back clean energy incentives; and surging billions of dollars to both increase enforcement at the southern border and support Trump’s mass detention and deportation drive.</p><p>“Last year, I urged this Congress to begin the mission by passing the largest tax cuts in American history, and our Republican majorities delivered so beautifully,” Trump said during the speech although <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/fact-checking-donald-trumps-state-of-the-union-address\">fact checkers</a> have challenged his historic characterisation of the cuts in what they have assessed as one of several misleading claims the president made about his record and the economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Thank you, Republicans,” he said.</p><p>Polls have shown the US public is not noticing a major change in their lived experience. Trump’s approval rating has slumped in the months since the bill was passed with views of his handling of the economy sliding as he entered the second year of his second nonconsecutive term in office.</p><p>“Trump takes credit for what he says are improvements that have been made, telling people why their lives are better or why they’re saving money from taxes or why costs are lower for gas,” Kall noted.</p><p>“But clearly there’s a disconnect between a good portion of the public vs the kind of story Trump’s telling.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-on-affordability\">Trump on affordability</h2><p>Trump on Tuesday did not call for another sweeping bill like the one passed last year but instead pitched several pieces of legislation broadly aimed at addressing the high cost of living.</p><p>While Trump has generally preferred a go-it-alone approach, his statements underscored that he still needs Congress for many of the policy initiatives he touted on Tuesday, even as he blamed Democrats and the administration of former President Joe Biden for the stubbornly high cost of living in the US.</p><p>For example, on healthcare, Trump hailed the 16 “most favoured nations” agreements his administration has struck with pharmaceutical companies. While full details of those agreements have not been released, they generally involve pegging prescription drug prices to the typically lower rates negotiated by foreign countries.</p><p>The deals have been the basis of the White House’s “TrumpRX” medication marketplace, an entity that the administration has pitched as a cheaper alternative for Americans willing to bypass insurance and pay cash for drugs. But Trump hinted at concerns over the staying power of the scheme.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“So now I’m calling on Congress to codify my most-favoured nation programme into law,” Trump said, although it remains unclear under what legal mechanism the deals could be legislated.</p><p>Trump then pointed to an executive order he signed last month that seeks to ban investment firms from buying single-family homes to rent. The phenomenon has contributed to a housing access and affordability crisis in the country and has become a particularly salient issue as the midterm elections approach.</p><p>“And now I’m asking Congress to make that ban permanent because all this for people, really, that’s what we want,” Trump said during the State of the Union, which came hours after Democrats pitched their own version of legislation aimed at the practice. “We want homes for people, not for corporations.”</p><p>Finally, Trump pitched a plan to boost retirement accounts for seniors by providing federal contributions to retirement savings programmes, known as 401(k)s. After the speech, his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told NBC News that the plan could likely be achieved only through legislation.</p><h2 id=\"tariffs\">Tariffs</h2><p>The largest question mark over Trump’s economic initiatives has been on his <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/new-trump-tariffs-take-effect-days-after-supreme-court-decision\">tariff policy</a>.</p><p>Trump has long framed aggressive tariffs on trade partners as part of his America First vision, saying it would lead to a hard reset on global trade that would incentivise US domestic industry growth.</p><p>During the State of the Union, he hailed his tariff policy as “one of the primary reasons for our country’s economic turnaround”, even as he lamented the Supreme Court’s “unfortunate ruling” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\">deeming illegal</a> large portions of the tariffs he announced last year.</p><p>Trump has since used a new authority to impose 10 percent tariffs on global trading partners, which he hopes to increase to 15 percent, saying on Tuesday that the plan would remain as is under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Congressional action will not be necessary,” he said.</p><p>Still, the new measures will expire in 150 days, just months before the midterm elections, unless Congress acts. Some trade experts have questioned the legality of the programme with analysts at the libertarian CATO Institute think tank among those <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/new-trump-tariffs-are-also-unlawful\">arguing</a> the new tariffs “almost certainly violate the law”, opening the door to further legal challenges.</p><p>Meanwhile, refunds for levies collected from US businesses under the recently deemed illegal tariffs have not yet been addressed, leaving another potential political vulnerability for Republicans in the months ahead.</p><h2 id=\"trump-on-dhs-standoff\">Trump on DHS standoff</h2><p>Standing at the podium in the House of Representatives at the US Capitol, Trump showed little departure from the hardline approach to immigration that has defined the first year of his second term, even as the issue has become an increasingly political liability for Republicans.</p><p>Trump hailed what has been in effect a closure of the US border to asylum seekers, which he enacted under an emergency declaration that continues to face legal challenges likely bound for the Supreme Court. He used several guests to tie undocumented people to high rates of crime, a premise that has been challenged by several studies.</p><p>In one particularly theatrical moment aimed at <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/trump-says-lawmakers-ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-should-be-removed-from-us\">Democrats in attendance</a>, Trump asked lawmakers who agreed that “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand up. He did not mention <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/us-witnessed-many-ice-related-deaths-in-2026-here-are-their-stories\">two US citizens</a> killed by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota in January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Exit polls showed Trump’s 2024 victory was, in part, buoyed by his hardline immigration stance, but more recent opinion polls have shown increased dismay over the tactics used. The issue is considered particularly fraught for Republicans facing strong Democratic challengers in the months ahead.</p><p>In the short term, Democrats have seized on the politically potent issue, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/us-department-of-homeland-security-to-go-into-shutdown-due-to-funding-lapse\">holding up</a> annual funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to press for greater oversight and reform. DHS oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and US Border Patrol as well as the Secret Service, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p><p>“Tonight, I’m demanding the full and immediate restoration of all funding for the border security, homeland security of the United States and also for helping people clean up their snow,” Trump said during his speech as he appeared to suggest that FEMA – which rarely aids in snow removal – has been unable to respond to a recent storm that struck the US Northeast in light of the shutdown.</p><h2 id=\"save-act\">SAVE Act</h2><p>Trump also revisited a defining message of his 2024 election campaign, his repeated claim that the US elections, including his 2020 loss to Biden, are marred by high rates of fraud and other forms of malfeasance.</p><p><span>Despite repeated studies, including from conservative organisations, finding tiny and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/donald-trumps-actions-stir-election-concerns-in-the-lead-up-to-us-midterms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largely inconsequential</a> rates of voting fraud across decades of elections, Trump maintained during the address that “cheating is rampant in our elections”.</span></p><p>He called on Republicans to pass the so-called Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that would create higher documentation requirements when registering to vote and arriving at the polls as well as requiring states to hand voter rolls to DHS to identify noncitizens.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rights groups have said the legislation would disenfranchise untold voters, noting, for example, that about half of US citizens do not have a valid passport.</p><p>The bill has passed the Republican-controlled House, but passage in the Senate would almost surely involve changing rules on the filibuster, a tool used by the opposing party to scuttle bills that do not meet a 60-vote threshold in the 100-seat chamber.</p><p>Changes to filibuster rules have long been viewed as a “nuclear option” by both parties.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-priorities\">Shifting priorities</h2><p>The annual State of the Union address is an opportunity for presidents to make the case for their leadership and vision for the months ahead. They also reveal an administration’s shifting priorities.</p><p>For example, as Kall explained, with the US on the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/how-trumps-2026-iran-war-script-echoes-and-twists-the-2003-iraq-playbook\">brink of escalation</a> with Iran, uncertainty still lingering after the US <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\">abduction</a> of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Trump recently pledging $10bn in support of his Board of Peace, launched to address rebuilding in Gaza and other conflicts around the world, the president chose not to dive into foreign policy until more than 90 minutes into his speech.</p><p>Critics have seen Trump’s foreign adventurism as a direct contradiction to his campaign promises to end US intervention abroad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump’s desire to take control of Greenland was another major point in his March address to a joint session of Congress. But after a so-far unsuccessful <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/danish-pm-says-more-greenland-talks-due-after-meeting-uss-marco-rubio\">pressure campaign</a> beginning in January against European countries, the self-governed Danish territory was not mentioned in this year’s speech.</p><p>Meanwhile, while marquee themes like the economy, immigration and trade remained constant from Trump’s last address to a joint session of Congress, other areas received no mention, including the formerly Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which made cuts to the federal government workforce, leading to agency disruptions but falling far short of savings pledges.</p><p>“The president has the benefit of how to frame the State of the Union,” Kall said. “Trump’s speech reflected the political reality of the time.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Both are Democrats.</p><p>The pair have maintained they had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activity and have long said they have provided all relevant information to the lawmakers on the panel.</p><p>In her statement, Clinton also accused the Republicans of using the hearings as a red herring to divert blame away from the administration of President Donald Trump.</p><p>“You have compelled me to testify, fully aware I have no knowledge that would assist in your investigation, in order to distract attention from President Trump’s actions and to cover them up,” Clinton wrote.</p><p>She also questioned why the panel has allowed other subpoenaed individuals to provide answers in writing, and why its hearings have taken place behind closed doors.</p><p>Clinton and her husband, meanwhile, were threatened with charges of contempt, after they resisted the subpoena to appear in person.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"scrutinising-epstein-s-social-circle\">Scrutinising Epstein’s social circle</h2><p>The conflict centres around a long-running push to pursue accountability for those who may have been involved in shielding Epstein from justice.</p><p>Epstein, a wealthy financier, had cultivated contacts with high-powered individuals in politics, academia and the arts. His circle of friends included both Bill Clinton and Trump.</p><p>But he was also a convicted sex offender, whose victims, experts say, number in the hundreds.</p><p>In 2008, he was convicted in Florida of soliciting a minor for prostitution, but he served only 13 months of an 18-month sentence, as part of a plea deal criticised as overly lenient.</p><p>In 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with running a sex-trafficking ring, but Epstein, 66, died by apparent suicide while in custody, awaiting trial.</p><p>Speculation has continued to grow over how his influential social circle may have aided his crimes.</p><p>But the scandal has been a thorn in the side of the Trump administration, which faced backlash over its initial resistance to publishing the government’s full Epstein file.</p><p>Media reports over the last year have also highlighted elements of Trump’s past relationship with Epstein, including a sexually suggestive birthday note the Republican leader appeared to have written.</p><p>In her statement, Clinton said that, if the House panel were committed to a fair investigation, “it would ask [Trump] directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files”.</p><p>She also made a reference to an email exchange between Epstein and billionaire Elon Musk, released in a trove of documents by the Department of Justice.</p><p>If the panel were “serious”, she wrote, “it would subpoena anyone who asked on which night there would be the ‘wildest party’ on Epstein Island”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-full-blown-coverup\">‘A full-blown coverup?’</h2><p>New details emerged about Epstein and his associates on January 30, when the Department of Justice published nearly 3.5 million government documents related to the convicted sex offender.</p><p>A law, passed in November, had compelled the Trump administration to release all its Epstein files within 30 days.</p><p>But critics have continued to accuse the administration of failing to release all of the investigative files, as required.</p><p>The Justice Department has said it would review claims it has illegally withheld documents containing allegations against Trump.</p><p>A person’s appearance in the files does not necessarily imply criminal conduct. But survivors, sexual violence advocates and some politicians have called for greater accountability and transparency, given the scale and nature of Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for further action.</p><p>“What else is the administration keeping behind a lock and key? Is this incompetence or is it a full-blown coverup?” he said. “Pam Bondi owes the American people some answers.”</p><p>For his part, House Oversight Committee chair James Comer denied that the panel’s investigation was a “witch hunt”.</p><p>He told supporters in advance of Thursday’s hearing that there was bipartisan support for the Clintons to testify.</p><p>Comer also said the government had “failed” Epstein’s victims. While the panel cannot prosecute anyone involved, he added that he hoped it could help bring transparency.</p><p>A full transcript and video of the Clinton hearings, which are expected to stretch on for several hours, will be released “as soon as everyone approves it”, according to Comer.</p><p>Speaking in advance of the hearing, Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the panel, called for Trump himself to testify “to answer the questions that are being asked across this country from survivors”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Leicestershire Police also renewed its contract with the Israeli spyware company in March for 328,688 pounds ($445,300).

Police forces and private firms can use BriefCam’s Protect &amp; Insights platform to sift through and condense hours of CCTV and home-surveillance footage, making it easily searchable.</p><p>The system includes facial-recognition and licence-plate search tools and allows police to build “watch lists” of specific faces or vehicle plates.</p><p>The technology has been used in East Jerusalem, Palestinian territory illegally occupied by Israel.</p><p>According to undated files accessed by the research centre <a href=\"https://www.whoprofits.org/companies/company/6672?briefcam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Who Profits</a>, a tender document published by the Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction inviting companies to bid for maintenance contracts for 98 security systems within East Jerusalem specified that the successful bidder must be able to maintain BriefCam’s software.

Mass emigration of Cuba’s skilled labour force, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has added to the country’s difficulties.</p><p>With Trump’s latest oil embargo, the US has added a severe energy crisis to the mix. Widespread power blackouts of up to 20 hours at a time are now being reported across Cuba, impacting hospitals, businesses and households alike.</p><p>Surgeries have been suspended, schools have cancelled classes, and waste trucks are parked as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/waste-piles-up-in-cuba-as-us-imposed-fuel-blockade-halts-collection-trucks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rubbish piles up</a> in the streets.</p><p>Four United Nations special rapporteurs warned in early February that the situation is contributing to a severe public health problem in the country and said it could lead to a “severe humanitarian” crisis.</p><p>Cuba has lost 90 percent of its fuel supply, and despite shutting beach resorts and restricting aviation fuel sales, the country could experience a total blackout as early as late February, according to Ignacio Seni, a risk analyst writing for the US-based intelligence firm Crisis 24.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4309636\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4309636\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4309636\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AA-20260209-40506553-40506545-MEXICAN_GOVERNMENT_SENDS_HUMANITARIAN_AID_TO_CUBA_ABOARD_TWO_NAVY_SHIPS-1770924989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cuba aid\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4309636\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Mexican government dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba on board two ships of the Mexican Navy, Veracruz, Mexico, February 9, 2026 [Mexico Ministry of Foreign Affairs via Anadolu Agency]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-has-the-us-blocked-oil-deliveries-to-cuba\">Why has the US  blocked oil deliveries to Cuba?</h2><p>Cuba produces crude oil but does not have the capacity to refine enough to meet domestic demand.</p><p>Venezuela was providing as much as 50 percent of Cuba’s oil before the US government took control of its oil industry at the start of this year, about 35,000 barrels per day.</p><p>Under a special barter agreement in place since 2000, Cuba provides support for education, healthcare, and security services in return for discounted Venezuelan fuel. Indeed, about 30 members of Maduro’s security detail who were killed in the operation to abduct him in January were from Cuba.</p><p>Then, days after Maduro was abducted, Trump turned his aim at Cuba itself, warning Havana to “make a deal before it is too late”. He did not, however, give details about what type of deal he wanted.</p><p>On January 29, Trump issued an executive order imposing new trade tariffs on any countries selling oil to Cuba because of what he called the “policies, practices and actions” of the Cuban government, which, he said, pose an “extraordinary threat” to the US.</p><p>Trump also claimed, without evidence, that Havana funds “terrorism”.</p><p>Besides Venezuela, Cuba was also sourcing oil from Mexico, Russia and Algeria, but all oil imports into the country ceased. Trump’s order, therefore, effectively amounted to a blockade.</p><p>The US has also reportedly seized fuel tankers in open waters transferring oil to Cuba, according to a New York Times investigation into ship movements in the Caribbean Sea published last week.</p><p>The US began building up its naval presence in the area in September last year as it prepared to attack Maduro, and its troops continue to patrol the waters.</p><p>In mid-February, one tanker loaded with Colombian oil was intercepted by the US Coast Guard as it came within 70 miles of Cuba, the Times reported. The vehicle, called the Ocean Mariner, was previously used to covertly transport oil between Venezuela and Iran.</p><p>Before Maduro’s capture, US forces also struck multiple Venezuelan boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean that the US claimed – without evidence – were trafficking drugs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-have-cuba-and-others-reacted-to-the-us-blockade\">How have Cuba and others reacted to the US blockade?</h2><p>Cuban authorities under President Miguel Diaz-Canel have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/cuban-official-decries-massive-punishment-by-us-oil-blockade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> the US of imposing collective punishment on the country.</p><p>On Wednesday, it also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/cuban-border-agents-fire-upon-florida-tagged-speedboat-killing-four\">accused</a> the US of links to armed men who entered the country’s waters on a Florida-tagged speedboat. Four Americans of Cuban origin were killed in the altercation, and two were injured.</p><p>In the past, Havana has said it is open to “reciprocal dialogue” with Washington, but Diaz-Canel has also said Cubans will “defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”.</p><p>Meanwhile, on February 12, a UN expert panel condemned the US’s directive as illegal and said the claim that Havana funds terrorism “lacks credibility and appears designed to justify the use of extraordinary and coercive powers”.</p><p>“It is an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion with extraterritorial effects, through which the United States seeks to exert coercion on the sovereign state of Cuba and compel other sovereign third States to alter their lawful commercial relations,” the panel said.</p><p>Other countries are trying to help. Mexico has sent two deployments of humanitarian aid to Havana between mid-February and this week, while Russia has floated the possibility of sending fuel to Cuba.</p><p>On Wednesday, Canada pledged food aid with 8 million Canadian dollars ($6.7m).</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340703\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340703\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340703\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-21T065531Z_1725153129_RC2AXIA4IRJV_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-CUBA-INTELLIGENCE-1772113507.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C491&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cuba\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s interim president Delcy Rodriguez and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Padilla attend the ceremony honouring Venezuelan and Cuban military and security personnel who died during the US operation to capture Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, in Caracas, Venezuela, on January 8, 2026 [File: Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-relief-has-the-us-announced-now-and-will-it-change-anything\">What relief has the US announced now, and will it change anything?</h2><p>Washington <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/1238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> on Wednesday it would issue companies with special licences to resell Venezuelan oil to Cuba “in solidarity” with the Cuban people.</p><p>That came after Washington announced $6m in humanitarian aid to Cuba to be distributed by the Catholic Church in early February.</p><p>However, “persons or entities associated with the Cuban military, intelligence services, or other government institutions” will be barred from obtaining oil sales licences, the US Treasury Department said this week.</p><p>Transactions should only support “exports for commercial and humanitarian use”, the statement added.</p><p>It is unclear if the new order will allow Havana to continue buying Venezuelan oil at a heavily subsidised rate as it was previously doing.

You are more than a friend. You are a brother,” Netanyahu told Modi when both leaders addressed the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on Wednesday.</p><p>Netanyahu showed Modi around Yad Vashem, a memorial in Jerusalem to the victims of the Holocaust, and hosted a dinner after they had spoken to the Knesset, where Modi was conferred with the parliament’s highest honour.</p><p>This was the second ever visit by an Indian prime minister to Israel after Modi’s first visit in 2017.

We share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond,” he said. “No cause can justify the murder of civilians. Nothing can justify terrorism.”</p><p>The Indian prime minister referred to the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which New Delhi has <a href=\"/news/2021/1/2/pakistan-arrests-mumbai-attacks-plotter-for-terrorism-financing\">blamed on neighbouring Pakistan</a>, saying: “Like you, we have a consistent and uncompromising policy of zero tolerance for terrorism with no double standards.”</p><p>Modi also threw his weight behind United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, stating that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.</p><p>While Modi said he backed “dialogue, peace and stability in the region”, he skipped any mention of the continuing genocide in Gaza, where the Israeli army has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians since October 2023.</p><p>Anwar Alam, a senior fellow at the Policy Perspective Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said the timing of Modi’s visit is “too poor and has grossly compromised India’s historical pro-Palestine stand”.</p><p>Alam argued that while New Delhi, a leader of the anticolonial nonalignment movement, can continue to maintain ties with Tel Aviv, “India cannot allow itself to display such insensitivity to Palestinian sufferings and stand with the coloniser.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340238\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340238\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340238\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260226__98Z73B2__v1__MidRes__IsraelIndiaDiplomacy-1772106036.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340238\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modi signs the guestbook at Yad Vashem as Netanyahu and Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum, watch on February 26, 2026 [Ilia Yefimovich/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"modi-emphasises-civilisational-ties-with-israel\">Modi emphasises ‘civilisational ties’ with Israel</h2><p>One reason Modi, unlike previous Indian leaders, has displayed such warmth towards the Israeli prime minister is the Indian Hindu right’s enthusiasm for the ideology of Zionism, analysts said.</p><p>Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, which ultimately seeks to transform India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.</p><p>During his speech to the Knesset, therefore, Modi doubled down on what he called the “civilisational ties” between the two nations. He started his address to the Knesset by announcing himself as “a representative of one ancient civilisation addressing another”.</p><p>“We are both ancient civilisations, and it is perhaps no surprise that our civilisational traditions also reveal philosophical parallels,” he said, quoting the Israeli “principle of ‘tikkun olam’ about healing the world”.</p><p>“In India, there is great admiration for Israel’s resolve, courage and achievements,” Modi said. “Long before we related to each other as modern states, we were linked by ties that go back more than 2,000 years.”</p><p>Modi mused about “returning to a land to which I have always felt drawn”. “After all, I was born on the same day that India formally recognised Israel – September 17, 1950.”</p><p>While India formally recognised Israel in 1950, two years after its formation, it only established diplomatic relations with it in 1992.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4337525\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4337525\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4337525\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_699eda19-1772018201.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi disembarks a plane as he arrives at Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, near Tel Aviv, Israel February 25, 2026.

In 2024 as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an <a href=\"/features/2024/6/26/india-exports-rockets-explosives-to-israel-amid-gaza-war-documents-reveal\">Al Jazeera investigation</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Modi held talks with Netanyahu focused on further boosting ties in the areas of defence and security along with trade, technology and agriculture.</p><p><span>“We have decided to establish the Critical and Emerging Technologies Partnership. This will give new momentum to cooperation in areas such as AI, quantum, and critical minerals,” Modi said.</span><em><span><br>\n</span></em></p><p>The two countries are also currently negotiating a free trade agreement.</p><h2 id=\"elevating-strategic-ties\">Elevating strategic ties</h2><p>India and Israel are reportedly inching closer to an alliance, along with other global powers, to boost security cooperation.</p><p>Before Modi’s visit, Netanyahu pitched a “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/whats-netanyahus-planned-hexagon-alliance-and-can-it-work\">hexagon of alliances</a>” that he said would include India, Greece, Cyprus and other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states to collectively stand against what he called “radical” Shia and Sunni Muslim “axes” of adversaries in the region.</p><p>Modi has not confirmed this plan but did call for cooperation on multilateral projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2, consisting of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and US.</p><p>The IMEC envisions connecting India with the Middle East and Europe through an integrated rail and shipping corridor. The economic corridor would pass through India, the UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Europe. It was unveiled in September 2023 during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.</p><p>“IMEC is very ambitious in bringing together these countries in ways that at one point would have been incomprehensible,” said Harsh Pant, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “Today, it has become possible because India’s footprint has grown in the Middle East and in Europe.”</p><p>Geopolitical analysts have referred to the I2U2 as “the West Asian Quad” in reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a forum of the US, Japan, Australia and India.</p><p>Modi also referred to the Abraham Accords, brokered by the US since 2020 for Gulf and North African countries to normalise relations with Israel, and “applauded your courage and vision”.</p><p>“Since then, the situation has changed significantly. The path is even more challenging. Yet it is important to sustain that hope,” Modi said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340228\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340228\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260225__98X477A__v1__MidRes__IsraelIndiaDiplomacy-1772105923.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Netanyahu and Modi greet children in the Knesset during Modi’s two-day visit to Israel, aimed at deepening ties with a key trade and defence partner [Debbie Hill/Pool/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"dehyphenating-india-from-israel-palestine\">‘Dehyphenating’ India from Israel-Palestine</h2><p>Pant said, like some Arab nations, India wants to dehyphenate its relations in the region to suit its own strategic interests better. Dehyphenation is a foreign policy under which a country aims to maintain independent relationships with nations that may be in conflict with each other.</p><p>“India’s own relationships have developed to a point where India is no longer hyphenating its relationships in the region,” Pant said.</p><p>Analysts argued New Delhi has bet on Israel for its own strategic interests, even if <a href=\"/features/2026/2/23/how-modi-broke-down-walls-between-india-israel-at-palestines\">at Palestine’s expense</a>. From the Indian government’s point of view, “this is the beginning of a new strategic imagination for the region,” Pant told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Modi remarked in his speech to the Knesset that many Indians have migrated to Israel for work, adding that Indian youth have contributed to the building of modern Israel, including “also on the battlefield”. Thousands of foreign nationals have served in the Israeli military, including <a href=\"/news/2026/2/15/thousands-of-western-nationals-fought-israels-war-on-gaza-what-to-know\">nearly 200 soldiers</a> who are dual citizens of India and Israel.</p><p>Modi, however, did not mention Colonel Waibhav Kale, a former Indian army officer who died in May 2024 when a United Nations vehicle was struck by the Israeli army in Gaza. He was the first international UN worker in Gaza to die in the war.</p><p>“India’s stance is clear: Humanity must never become a victim of conflict. A path to peace has been created through the Gaza peace plan. India has fully supported these efforts,” Modi said before departing on Thursday.</p><p>However, analysts said the divergence from earlier Indian support for Palestine is stark and India will not call out Netanyahu for war crimes in Palestinian territory.</p><p>While governments before Modi laid the foundations for current bilateral ties, Modi has brought “this relationship out into the open”, Pant said. “What used to be hush-hush behind closed doors is now a matter of fact.”</p><p>“India is trying not to make ties with Israel a hostage to the issue of Palestine,” he argued.</p><p>Azad Essa, the author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, said that earlier, India had positioned itself as a friend of Palestine “because it suited its national interests to be seen as pro-Palestine”.</p><p>Popular political forces in New Delhi have shifted that stance since then, however. Given the deep defence and security tie-up between Israel and India, Essa said, “It will be very difficult for opposition parties to promise a U-turn because being pro-Israel has become integral to the national interest.”</p><p>“To be pro-Palestine is now seen as being against the Indian national interest,” he said. Some have been detained and charged for expressing support for Palestine in India.</p><p>“India will have to become far more democratic and break out of the grip of majoritarian politics if it is to change more than just its tone on Palestine,” Essa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

With spectacle, social contradictions (inequality, social crises and instability) are dramatised rather than structurally challenged.</p><p data-start=\"1086\" data-end=\"2645\">The enduring media and public fixation on the Epstein files, particularly as their release proceeds with little accountability and continued narratives that discredit and isolate survivors, serves less as accountability and more as a political diversion from systemic injustices: Racism, capitalism, the growth of the police state and ongoing international impunity.</p><p data-start=\"1086\" data-end=\"2645\">More troubling still, it marks another step in the erosion of democracy and the consolidation of expansionist, war-driven fascism.</p><h2 id=\"fascist-spectacle\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">Fascist spectacle</h2><p id=\"in-work-by-walter-benjamin-hannah-arendt-guy-debord-umberto-eco-and-others-fascist-spectacle-involves-anti-intellectual-and-emotionally-driven-mass-mobilisation-around-simple-moral-binaries-pure-people-vs-corrupt-elites-where-action-is-revered-while-thought-is-reviled-the-replacement-of-institutional-process-with-symbolic-imagery-and-drama-and-mythic-narratives-of-national-decay-and-rebirth-political-theorist-roger-griffin-calls-this-rebirth-palingenic-ultranationalism-that-is-destruction-as-a-precondition-for-rebirth\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">In work by Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Guy Debord, Umberto Eco and others, fascist spectacle involves anti-intellectual and emotionally driven mass mobilisation around simple moral binaries (pure people v the corrupt ruling class), where action is revered while thought is reviled; the replacement of institutional process with symbolic imagery and drama; and mythic narratives of national decay and rebirth. Political theorist Roger Griffin calls this rebirth “palingenic ultranationalism”, that is, destruction as a precondition for rebirth.</p><p id=\"conspiracy-theories-are-the-narrative-engine-of-spectacle-they-transform-systemic-crisis-and-social-instability-into-simple-emotionally-gripping-stories-of-social-taboo-breaking-centred-on-hidden-and-untouchable-enemies-laying-the-groundwork-through-which-authoritarian-solutions-are-marketed-as-necessary-and-even-redemptive\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">The function of spectacle is to subvert principled analysis and resistance to oppression with emotion – outrage, disgust, despair and helplessness.</p><p data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">Conspiracy theories are the narrative engine of spectacle. They transform systemic crisis and social instability into simple, emotionally gripping stories of social taboo-breaking, centred on hidden and untouchable enemies, laying the groundwork through which authoritarian solutions are marketed as necessary and even redemptive.</p><p data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">When structural violence becomes visible, but accountability remains absent, public anger often seeks explanation through personalised and conspiratorial narratives rather than systemic analysis.</p><p id=\"amid-growing-distrust-and-corruption-in-mainstream-media-and-the-rise-of-citizen-driven-and-alternative-social-media-ecosystems-conspiracy-theories-surrounding-the-epstein-case-have-blossomed-claims-of-secret-global-cabals-engaged-in-immoral-sexual-criminality-ritualistic-fantasies-involving-human-sacrifice-cannibalism-and-ancient-symbolic-structures-and-explicitly-racist-and-antisemitic-tropes-about-hidden-rulers-among-others\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">Amid growing distrust and corruption in mainstream media and the rise of citizen-driven and alternative social media ecosystems, conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case have blossomed: Claims of secret global cabals engaged in immoral sexual criminality, ritualistic fantasies involving human sacrifice, cannibalism and ancient symbolic structures and explicitly racist and anti-Semitic tropes about hidden rulers, among others.</p><p id=\"theories-like-these-whether-wholly-true-partially-true-or-false-are-not-new-fascist-movements-have-historically-mobilised-around-the-idea-that-the-nation-is-being-secretly-corrupted-by-degenerate-elites-with-a-radical-cleansing-necessary-to-return-to-a-righteous-path\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">Theories like these, whether wholly true, partially true or false, are not new; fascist movements have historically mobilised around the idea that the nation is being secretly corrupted by a degenerate ruling class, with a radical cleansing necessary to return to a righteous path.</p><p id=\"these-narratives-do-not-expose-a-corrupt-system-they-obscure-and-mystify-it-by-sensationalising-corruption-into-myth-and-providing-explicit-though-untouchable-targets-for-public-outrage-they-displace-rigorous-anti-colonial-and-material-analyses-of-structural-exploitation-greed-and-state-violence-with-collective-authoritarian-longing-for-a-strongman-and-the-suppression-of-dissent-to-restore-order\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">These narratives do not expose a corrupt system; they obscure and mystify it. By sensationalising corruption into myth and providing explicit, though untouchable, targets for public outrage, they displace rigorous anti-colonial and material analyses of structural exploitation, greed and state violence with collective authoritarian longing for a strongman and the suppression of dissent to restore order.</p><p id=\"in-doing-so-it-promotes-the-aesthetics-of-politics-the-spectacle-rather-than-grounded-critiques-of-capitalism-and-imperial-power-further-it-serves-to-distract-from-failures-ultimately-promoting-oppression-and-war-according-to-federico-caprotti-various-forms-of-fascist-spectacle-produce-a-collage-which-both-expresses-and-obscures-the-syncretic-ideology-of-the-regime\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">The criminality of Epstein and the powerful figures who orbited him and participated in his abuses have come to symbolise a degenerate ruling class with identifiable names and faces, targets who could be exposed and jailed, thereby clearing the narrative space for a heroic white knight to ride in with promises of salvation.</p><p id=\"in-doing-so-it-promotes-the-aesthetics-of-politics-the-spectacle-rather-than-grounded-critiques-of-capitalism-and-imperial-power-further-it-serves-to-distract-from-failures-ultimately-promoting-oppression-and-war-according-to-federico-caprotti-various-forms-of-fascist-spectacle-produce-a-collage-which-both-expresses-and-obscures-the-syncretic-ideology-of-the-regime\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">As Hannah Arendt warned, conspiracy thinking thrives when trust in institutions collapses. The Epstein scandal intensified the sense of a ruling class operating above the law and of a justice system which protects its own, conditions ideal for authoritarian movements to exploit by insisting the system is irredeemably rigged and that only a strong leader can tear it down.</p><p id=\"in-doing-so-it-promotes-the-aesthetics-of-politics-the-spectacle-rather-than-grounded-critiques-of-capitalism-and-imperial-power-further-it-serves-to-distract-from-failures-ultimately-promoting-oppression-and-war-according-to-federico-caprotti-various-forms-of-fascist-spectacle-produce-a-collage-which-both-expresses-and-obscures-the-syncretic-ideology-of-the-regime\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">As such, the spectacle of the Epstein scandal can absorb and manipulate public outrage, redirecting it away from necessary structural accountability in the form of decolonisation and redistribution of wealth, ultimately reinforcing the very systems it appears to challenge.</p><p id=\"in-doing-so-it-promotes-the-aesthetics-of-politics-the-spectacle-rather-than-grounded-critiques-of-capitalism-and-imperial-power-further-it-serves-to-distract-from-failures-ultimately-promoting-oppression-and-war-according-to-federico-caprotti-various-forms-of-fascist-spectacle-produce-a-collage-which-both-expresses-and-obscures-the-syncretic-ideology-of-the-regime\" data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"6365\">In doing so, it promotes the aesthetics of politics – the spectacle – rather than grounded critiques of capitalism and imperial power. Further, it serves to distract from failures ultimately promoting oppression and war. According to Federico Caprotti, various forms of fascist spectacle produce a “collage” which both expresses and obscures the syncretic ideology of the regime.</p><h2 id=\"the-grand-spectacle-war\" data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6393\">The grand spectacle: War</h2><p data-start=\"6395\" data-end=\"6772\">When politics becomes theatre rather than collective progress dependent on accountability, transformation or reform, crisis becomes emotional drama, drama demands release (internal resolution) or escalation and escalation inevitably finds its expression in externalised war, in which the nation performs a grand spectacle of unity and sacrifice on the largest possible stage.</p><p data-start=\"6774\" data-end=\"7187\">War acts as a stabilising force when internal contradictions cannot be resolved through collective mobilisation. With its uniforms and marches, war channels discontent by uniting a fragmented, outraged population against an externalised enemy, transforming righteous anger at the violence, oppression and greed of a ruling class into manufactured unity, heroism and meaning through violence against “the other”.</p><p data-start=\"7189\" data-end=\"7519\">These dynamics, outlined by Benjamin decades ago, feel alarmingly familiar in the present moment, including in the spectacle surrounding the Epstein scandal.</p><p data-start=\"7189\" data-end=\"7519\">In this context, external conflict functions not only as policy but as emotional consolidation, redirecting internal disillusionment towards collective national purpose.</p><p data-start=\"7521\" data-end=\"7785\">Fascist forces deploy such spectacles to distract and mobilise, and are doing so presently; accelerating the dismantling of what remains of US democracy and the post-war international order, to be replaced by a system ruled by force and naked self-interest.</p><p data-start=\"7787\" data-end=\"8403\">Spectacle politics does not require loyalty to specific leaders but to the emotional narrative they embody, rendering individual figures ultimately expendable.</p><p data-start=\"7787\" data-end=\"8403\">In this logic, even Trump could be discarded, sacrificed to clear the way for a “purer” white male strongman (Vance? Pence? Carlson?) who promises to cleanse the ruling class and by extension its foreign so-called “handlers” (enemies like Russia, China and Iran or even allies like Israel and Europe, the latter already being threatened by Trump), of its unsavoury elements, particularly if Trump’s baggage with Epstein proves politically irredeemable.</p><p data-start=\"8405\" data-end=\"8866\">By contrast, liberation and reconciliation and an end to capitalist oppression, with its accompanying genocidal violence and planetary destruction, require a steadfast structural framework aligned with broader leftist, antiracist and anti-colonial principles. Such a framework prioritises systemic transformation over spectacle. Within this view, the Epstein scandal is not treated as the disease itself, but as a symptom of capitalism’s inherent corruption.</p><p data-start=\"8405\" data-end=\"8866\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Our mandate over the land of Israel is biblical, [and] the biblical borders of the land of Israel are clear … Therefore, the borders are the borders of the Bible,” the apparently secular Israeli politician said.</p><p>So what is Greater Israel exactly? And is it really an ultimate goal for some Israeli politicians?</p><h2 id=\"defining-greater-israel\">Defining Greater Israel</h2><p>The most expansionist claim for a Greater Israel is based on a biblical verse (Genesis 15:18-21), which narrates God making a covenant with Abraham that promises his descendants the land between the Nile and the Euphrates.</p><p>That would include the Jewish people, with the tribes of Israel believed to be descended through Abraham’s son, Isaac. But it would also include the children of another of Abraham’s sons, Ishmael (Ismail), regarded as the forefather of the Arabs.</p><p>Other definitions based on different biblical verses are narrower in their territorial scope and specify that the land of Israel would be promised to the tribes of Israel descended from Isaac.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why “Greater Israel” Is No Longer A Fantasy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gDbGvK2Og0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><h2 id=\"how-has-israel-worked-to-achieve-expansion\">How has Israel worked to achieve expansion?</h2><p>The current state of Israel emerged from the British Mandate for Palestine in 1948. The mandate, created by the League of Nations in the wake of World War I and the occupation of Palestine by the British, geographically limited Israel upon its creation.</p><p>The 1948 war that followed the end of the mandate led to Israel taking control of all of Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p><p>But Israel soon expanded by force – in 1967 it defeated Arab forces and took control of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and Syria’s occupied Golan Heights. Israel continues to occupy all of those regions, with the exception of the Sinai, which it returned to Egypt in 1982.</p><p>Since then, Israel has ignored international law and continued occupying Palestinian and Syrian land, and has shown little respect for its neighbours’ sovereignty, occupying more land in Syria, as well as in Lebanon.</p><h2 id=\"how-popular-is-the-idea-of-greater-israel\">How popular is the idea of Greater Israel?</h2><p>This needs to be broken down into two separate concepts – the expansion of Israel into the territory that immediately borders it, and the most extreme definition of Greater Israel: between the Nile and the Euphrates.</p><p>In terms of expansion into its immediate surroundings, Israeli Jews by and large support the annexation of East Jerusalem, which is occupied Palestinian territory, and the Golan Heights.</p><p>The Israeli government continues to move towards the de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank. Israeli politicians vary in how open they are in their support for the formal annexation of the West Bank, but most mainstream Israeli politicians are supportive of the illegal Israeli settlements in the territory.</p><p>An expansion of Israeli settlements into Gaza is not as popular, but is supported by far-right Israeli parties.</p><p>A Greater Israel, including parts of Jordan, or the most irredentist definition between the Euphrates and the Nile, is more controversial. Pre-1948, many Zionists sought not just Palestine but also Jordan for their future state – one of the most important Zionist armed groups at the time, the Irgun, even included the map of both Palestine and Jordan in its emblem.</p><p>But after the foundation of Israel this took a back seat, and open calls for a vastly expanded Israel were largely restricted to the fringes. But those fringes – far-right figures like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – are now in government, reflecting a wider radicalisation within Israeli society itself.</p><p>That means the Israeli ‘mainstream’, politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and centrists like Lapid, are either more open in their support for some form of Greater Israel beyond the West Bank, or less willing to publicly oppose it.</p><h2 id=\"how-threatened-do-regional-countries-feel\">How threatened do regional countries feel?</h2><p>Regional states have said that the annexation of the West Bank would be a red line, but have been unable to reverse Israel’s occupation.</p><p>Hints at a wider expansion have led to an angry reaction from Arab countries. This goes further back than Huckabee’s recent comments. For example, Jordan condemned Smotrich – Israel’s finance minister – when he gave a speech in 2023 at a podium that displayed a map that showed Jordan as part of Israel.</p><p>And Huckabee’s support for Greater Israel was <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">roundly condemned</a> by more than a dozen states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkiye.</p><p>For Arab and Muslim states, the anger at the comments partially emanates from the sense of a lack of respect towards the sovereignty of regional states by a US official. But it also highlights fears that the balance of power in the region is weighted towards an Israel that is increasingly willing to attack across the Middle East, and has little interest in peace.</p><p>Even if the takeover of the land between the Nile and the Euphrates is not feasible, a region where Israel is the primary hegemon will likely lead to more attacks, more wars, and, if Israel determines it necessary, more occupation of land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
