That move coincided with mass protests that had broken out over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who was arrested for allegedly wearing the hijab improperly.</p><p>More recently, US President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that he wanted to see Starlink restore internet access to Iran and he would speak to Musk about the issue.</p><p>Although neither Starlink nor Musk has publicly confirmed the news, a person familiar with Starlink services told Bloomberg that the company is offering free services to Iran.</p><p>Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam – director of Iran Human Rights, a human rights group with members inside and outside Iran – <span>told Al Jazeera that access to Starlink has played a pivotal role in sharing information about the protests, including estimates about the death toll.</span></p><p>“It has been extremely important because the alternative would have been no information,” Amiry-Moghaddam said.</p><p>Iran has released no official death toll, but authorities said more than 100 members of the security forces have been killed. Opposition activists said the toll is much higher and includes more than 1,000 protesters. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said the number of dead has climbed to at least 2,571.

In 2022, there were some areas, for some hours, and it was moving. But it has never been the whole country the way it is now and for so many days. It has never been that extensive,” Amiry-Moghaddam said.</p><p>The Fars news agency, which is affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in a Telegram post on Wednesday that access to the National Information Network, the state-controlled domestic intranet, had been restored.</p><p>The post said the “final decision on greater access to the internet” would be made in the next two weeks by “relevant institutions”.</p><h2 id=\"how-is-iran-blocking-communications\">How is Iran blocking communications?</h2><p>Iran’s latest shutdown was preceded by several days of internet traffic “anomalies” as antigovernment protests swept Iran, according to a Cloudflare analysis.</p><p>After the initial shutdown on Thursday, there were brief periods of connectivity on Friday, but as of Saturday, Iran “remains almost entirely cut off from the global internet”, according to its analysis.</p><p>Iran’s government has also tried to jam Starlink’s signals and seize terminals in a departure from past blackouts.</p><p>“In previous incidents, none of the internet shutdowns were as severe as this one,” Amir Rashidi, director of internet security and digital rights at the nonprofit Miaan Group, told Al Jazeera. “We never saw Iran trying to jam Starlink. That was not the case at all. Now they’re doing it.”</p><p>Iranian state media shared a video on Telegram on Tuesday of confiscated Starlink terminals and other telecommunications equipment still in their original packaging, which it described as “electronic espionage and sabotage items.”</p><p>Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence said the items were supposed to be distributed in areas that were experiencing unrest, according to the post.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-starlink-work\">How does Starlink work?</h2><p>Starlink’s “constellation” of telecoms satellites circle in a low Earth orbit about 550km (340 miles) above the ground.</p><p>On Earth, the person wanting to hook up to the internet must have a wifi-enabled satellite receiver. Much like a mobile phone connecting to different base stations as a user moves around, Starlink receivers, also known as terminals, must constantly hand off from one satellite to another as they pass overhead.</p><p>This contrasts with traditional telecommunication satellites, which are “geostationary”, meaning they orbit over the same spot on the Earth’s surface. That means Starlink customers don’t depend on just any one satellite. But it also means that the Starlink receiver is designed to accept signals from a wider angle – and that in turn leaves it more vulnerable to jamming.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-starlink-been-used-in-ukraine-and-other-places\">How has Starlink been used in Ukraine and other places?</h2><p>Starlink is also offering free broadband service to Venezuela through February 3, according to SpaceX. It decided this after the January 3 <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\">abduction</a> of President Nicolas Maduro by US special forces.</p><p>The company has also offered a month of free service to users impacted by natural disasters like Hurricane Melissa or the Canadian wildfires of 2025.</p><p>Starlink, however, has a mixed and even controversial record in some countries.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-controversies-that-have-surrounded-starlink-use\">What are the controversies that have surrounded Starlink use?</h2><p>The satellite service provided Ukraine’s military with a vital communications lifeline after Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion, but in September of that year, Musk reportedly ordered a Starlink shutdown over several regions of Ukraine as Kyiv prepared a counteroffensive.</p><p>Starlink has also been used by different groups in Sudan and Myanmar, two countries that are fighting years-long civil wars and experience frequent communications blackouts.</p><p>Scam centres in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have used Starlink to stay online despite international law enforcement efforts to cut off their power and internet connections. SpaceX said in October that it had disabled thousands of terminals in Myanmar although scam centres persist in the region. The United Nations estimated in 2023 that at least 220,000 people were trafficked to work in scam centres, where they engage in romance, investment and cryptocurrency scams online on behalf of criminal syndicates.</p><p>Meanwhile, critics say that the decision by the private company to operate in Iran without a licence has raised questions about the power of major corporations to violate the sovereignty of nations.</p><p>In 2023, Iran complained to the International Communication Union (ITU), the UN’s telecoms arm, about Starlink’s deployment in the country without authorisation. The ITU ruled in Iran’s favour, declaring Starlink’s actions illegal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Emerging from the mountains of Yemen’s far north, they have come back from near total defeat against the Yemeni military in the late 2000s to their current position as the de facto authority in Yemen’s most populous regions.</p><p>Fired by religious zeal and devotion to a leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, who they believe to be divinely appointed, the group still thinks they are in a strong position, even if the Yemeni government is showing signs of life.</p><p>The central issue that prevented a peace deal in Yemen – the belief on both sides that total victory is achievable – remains.</p><p>For the Houthis, the Yemeni government is a mere puppet in the hands of Saudi Arabia and the West, and not worth talking to.</p><p>Instead, they are of the opinion that real negotiations can only be had with Riyadh, and are firm that the end result will be their continued presence in Sanaa.</p><p>The Houthis also think that previous attacks against Saudi Arabia have eventually led to negotiations, with missile attacks on targets like an <a href=\"/news/2022/3/25/saudi-aramco-jeddah-storage-facility-hit-by-attack\">oil storage facility in Jeddah</a> in 2022 damaging the kingdom’s image as a safe and business-friendly country.</p><p>The Houthis, therefore, know that they retain a threat towards Saudi Arabia and the Gulf – a threat that may prevent a full-throated campaign to retake Sanaa. That means the Houthis have no need to make any rash moves, and are instead able to wait and observe the fallout from events in southern and eastern Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"houthi-gamble\">Houthi gamble</h2><p>And yet, Saudi Arabia’s willingness in December to openly militarily confront the allies of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Yemen may indicate a change of mentality in Riyadh.</p><p>The STC launched an offensive against Saudi-backed government troops in December, seeking an independent state in the south.</p><p>Their advance aimed to control broad swaths of southern Yemen, including the Hadramout and Mahra provinces, in defiance of warnings from Riyadh. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, while Mahra is close to the border.</p><p>The conflict between the Houthis and their opponents has been largely frozen since a ceasefire in 2022. During that time, negotiations between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia have taken place periodically, indicating an openness from the latter to close the chapter of its involvement in Yemen’s war.</p><p>Do the Houthis now think they are at risk of renewed attack from the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia? Or do they feel confident that they are strong enough to deter any such attack?</p><p>A reorganised and united anti-Houthi force would be a much greater threat than the Houthis have faced since at least 2018. Then, the Houthis almost lost their most important port – Hodeidah on the Red Sea coast – before international pressure stopped the anti-Houthi advance.</p><p>Hodeidah seems to be the most obvious choice for the Yemeni government if it does decide to move militarily against the Houthis. It is easier to fight the Houthis on the coastal plain than it is in the mountains, and the international community may be less willing to step in to stop an attack after the Houthis’ <a href=\"/news/2024/2/4/how-have-red-sea-attacks-by-yemens-houthi-fighters-affected-companies\">conduct in the Red Sea</a>.</p><p>Losing the port city would also be a vital blow to the Houthis economically, particularly with the group’s main backer, Iran, going through its own economic problems, and likely unable to provide the same level of support as it has previously.</p><p>The Houthis face a dilemma. Do they attack first, or do they hope that they have established enough of a deterrence to stop any Saudi-backed moves against them?</p><p>Yemen’s frozen conflict may be about to thaw – and the Houthis, increasingly alone in the region, will have to gamble on what their move will be soon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

When international cooperation begins to bypass constitutional institutions, fragment national authority, and distort internal political balances, it ceases to be partnership and becomes illegal interference.</p><p>At its core, sovereignty is not an empty slogan; it is a system. It means that political, security, and economic relations with foreign states must flow through a country’s recognised national institutions. When parallel arrangements emerge, direct dealings with sub-national entities, security cooperation outside federal oversight, or agreements concluded without national consent, the integrity of the state is gradually eroded. Somalia experienced precisely this pattern over an extended period with the UAE engagement in the country. Therefore, our national decision on the UAE agreements was not a rejection of positive bilateral engagement, nor an abandonment of diplomacy: It was an affirmation of boundaries in line with international law.</p><p>Some critics of the Somali government’s decision to annul all UAE agreements have framed the decision as “drastic,” arguing that Somalia should have absorbed these practices for the sake of short-term stability or economic convenience. That argument misunderstands both Somalia’s recent history and the foundations of durable statehood. Fragile states do not become stable by tolerating fragmented authority driven by external interests. They become stable by consolidating institutions, clarifying chains of command, and ensuring that foreign engagement strengthens rather than substitutes the state. The nullification of UAE agreements concluded with sub-national administrations, and the suspension of bilateral security arrangements, must be understood in this context.</p><p>Under international law, and through all established diplomatic rules, sovereign nations must engage through their relevant national institutions. National institutions are solely responsible for the engagement with sub-national level institutions and actors. Accordingly, absolutely no independent country can accept security structures that operate outside its constitutional framework or port arrangements that dilute national control over strategic assets and undermine intergovernmental fiscal federalism.</p><p>What Somalia has done is draw a clear, lawful line. It has said that engagement is welcome but only on transparent, state-to-state terms, consistent with constitutional authority and international law. It has affirmed that dialogue remains possible but that principles are not negotiable.</p><p>Given Somalia’s strategic location, concerns about economic disruption resulting from the annulment of the UAE agreements are understandable. However, our government has put in place mechanisms to ensure continuity in port operations and security responsibilities, including the use of neutral international operators to continue facilitating global trade where necessary. Fundamentally, Somalia recognises that sustainable economic development and growth depend on the right enabling environment, political coherence and legal clarity, which investors are seeking across the world. Only a strong and unified state can provide this, not a fragmented one, divided within by destructive external interests.</p><p>Somalia’s decision to annul the UAE agreements reflects a broader regional reality. Somalia sits at a strategic crossroads linking the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the wider Horn of Africa. Any use of Somali territory, ports, or political space to advance external conflicts or agendas carries risks not only for Somalia, but for regional trade and stability as a whole. Therefore, a strong and united Somalia, reinforcing its national sovereignty, is a regional and global asset.</p><p>For too long, Somalia has been spoken about as an object of regional politics rather than as a subject of international law. The Cabinet’s decision on the UAE agreements signals a shift away from that narrative. It asserts that Somalia will engage the world as a sovereign equal, not as a fragmented space open to parallel influence and abuse.</p><p>History is often unkind to states that delay difficult decisions in the name of convenience. Somalia chose clarity instead. That choice deserves to be understood not as confrontation, but as an overdue act of constitutional self-respect.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"221\" data-end=\"383\">There is a crisis of belief in Western media, one that has little to do with evidence and everything to do with whose deaths align with the interests of empire.</p><p data-start=\"385\" data-end=\"759\">For two and a half years, Western media has scrutinised every dead Palestinian, and the ways in which their bodies were maimed, broken and burned in Gaza. Were they real people? If they were, were they truly dead? If dead, were they actually killed by Israel’s bombs, bullets, torture and siege? If they were killed, how could anyone know they were not combatants, and thus actually “deserved it”?</p><p data-start=\"761\" data-end=\"1038\">The destruction reported by Palestinians on the ground, by those watching their loved ones fall one by one, was not believed. Even the death toll periodically released by the Gaza Health Ministry, widely acknowledged to be a massive undercount, was repeatedly questioned.</p><p data-start=\"1040\" data-end=\"1971\">As of late 2025, the Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 70,117 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, with a large majority of those victims civilians. The United Nations and countless independent researchers agree that the official toll is an undercount. In the first nine months of the war alone, the number of deaths from traumatic injury was estimated at around 64,000, approximately 40 percent higher than the ministry’s figure, and that does not account for deaths caused by lack of healthcare, starvation or failures in water and sanitation. All demographic modelling suggests that overall mortality is significantly higher once indirect deaths are included. A July 2024 study published in The Lancet put the figure at more than 186,000. There is no doubt that hundreds of thousands more have lost their lives to bombs, bullets, avoidable illnesses and hunger since.</p><p data-start=\"1973\" data-end=\"2415\">The Health Ministry documents deaths through hospital morgues, recording names and ID numbers, counting only the bodies it is able to identify because, as we all know, many bodies in Gaza, blown to pieces, crushed under rubble or flattened by tanks, can never be identified. Further, with every hospital in the Gaza Strip bombed or rendered inoperable, there were periods when morgues were unable to count even bodies that were identifiable.</p><p data-start=\"2417\" data-end=\"2711\">Yet Western media, to this day, refuses to report the true scale of the carnage, and even the undercount it does publish is wrapped in caveats. It is “disputed by Israel”, “cannot be confirmed”, or merely “claimed” by the “Hamas-run health ministry”, never treated as an established fact.</p><p data-start=\"2713\" data-end=\"2986\">Now, as the genocide in Gaza continues, albeit at a slower pace under the guise of a so-called “ceasefire”, another story of conflict, loss and death has emerged in the same region. In Iran, people are taking to the streets to resist the regime, and are being killed as they do so.</p><p data-start=\"2988\" data-end=\"3137\">The way this tragedy is handled by the very same media outlets that spent years questioning the scale of devastation in Gaza is markedly different.</p><p data-start=\"3139\" data-end=\"3384\">Striking death tolls emerging from Iran, in many cases based on estimates by diaspora organisations such as the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which have no ground access and no direct communication lines into the country, are being accepted as fact almost instantly.</p><p data-start=\"3386\" data-end=\"3876\">CBS reported on Tuesday that “two sources, including one inside Iran”, told its journalists that “at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed”. The report acknowledged that foreign journalists are not allowed into Iran and underlined the ongoing communications shutdown, yet still treated the toll claimed by an anonymous source as credible. It ran with the headline: “Over 12,000 feared dead after Iran protests, as video shows bodies lined up at morgue.”</p><p data-start=\"3878\" data-end=\"4062\">Videos of piled-up bodies, footage of children burning alive in their tents, and photographs of mass graves, however, were never accepted as proof of a staggering death toll in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"4064\" data-end=\"4091\">This is just one example.</p><p data-start=\"4093\" data-end=\"4334\">Since the beginning of the Iran protests, Western media appears to have suddenly developed a new understanding of what counts as credible, accurate and acceptable reporting of death tolls in a crisis that it cannot directly access.</p><p data-start=\"4336\" data-end=\"4678\">Deaths in Gaza, despite being recorded and tallied as meticulously as possible amid an ongoing genocide, were relentlessly questioned and routinely presented as unreliable by the very same journalists now ready and eager to accept figures produced by the Iranian opposition, or more precisely, by Washington-based Iranian diaspora networks.</p><p data-start=\"4680\" data-end=\"4686\">Why?</p><p data-start=\"4688\" data-end=\"4939\">It seems Western media applies a far lower threshold for credibility when it comes to Iranian deaths, because reporting on them, unlike reporting on Palestinians shot, crushed, starved and tortured to death by Israel, serves the interests of empire.</p><p data-start=\"4941\" data-end=\"5154\">Thousands of Iranians killed while protesting their government offer Washington an opportunity to manufacture consent for bombing or toppling that regime, this time in the name of “human rights” and “democracy”.</p><p data-start=\"5339\" data-end=\"5575\">This is not to say that Iranians resisting the regime are not dying. It is not to say they should not be believed, or that their deaths should be ignored because they are difficult to count or because the regime restricts information.</p><p data-start=\"5577\" data-end=\"5653\">Their struggle matters. Their deaths matter. Every innocent death matters.</p><p data-start=\"5655\" data-end=\"5884\">But as we listen to Iranians resisting the regime, we must not ignore the hypocrisy of media outlets that amplify their story while simultaneously transforming their struggle into a convenient pretext for imperial intervention.</p><p data-start=\"5886\" data-end=\"6243\">These same outlets refused to believe us for years as we Palestinians documented our American-enabled slaughter. They did not believe us when we said Israel was hunting us as we queued for aid. They did not believe us when we said our babies were freezing to death or starving as Israel blocked timber, tents and even baby formula from entering the Strip.</p><p data-start=\"6245\" data-end=\"6597\">They never believed our dead were really dead. They did not believe us when the Gaza Health Ministry published over 1,500 pages of names, the first few hundred listing only children under 16, nor when the United Nations said these figures, while still an underestimate, were the most credible available. Our corpses required endless verification.</p><p data-start=\"6599\" data-end=\"7074\">This is because Palestinian deaths at the hands of Washington’s cherished “democratic” and “civilised” ally Israel expose the cruelty, impunity and violence of United States power. Our bodies pile up as evidence of an international order that decides which lives are expendable. The deaths of Iranians at the hands of a US-opposed government, by contrast, offer Washington a chance to present itself as the benevolent saviour, ready to “help” and deliver “democracy” once again.</p><p data-start=\"7076\" data-end=\"7269\">So selective belief is perfected by the empire’s media. Reports of mass Iranian deaths, even when based on estimates by anonymous sources thousands of miles away, receive instant credibility.</p><p>This is not a failure of journalism alone, but a failure of moral consistency. Death is not measured by evidence, but by political utility. Some corpses demand action, others demand silence. Until Western media confronts the role it plays in deciding which deaths are worthy of belief and which are not, it will remain complicit in the violence it claims only to observe.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

and splits it with the officer, who has already found her another “fiance”.</p><p>“It’s a real business,” a Donetsk resident told Al Jazeera, explaining an alleged scheme that has also been reported by Ukrainian and exiled Russian media last year.</p><p>The resident spoke on condition of anonymity because anyone interviewed by foreign media risks reprisal.</p><h2 id=\"drugs-and-stolen-arms\">Drugs and stolen arms</h2><p>But this is just one of the ways fast money can be made in the Russia-occupied part of Donetsk – about four-fifths of the rustbelt region the size of Albania, dotted with dozens of mines and factories.</p><p>The presence of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers creates a bonanza for some locals.</p><p>Undersupplied Russian servicemen spend part of their monthly pay of several thousand dollars on flak jackets, tactical boots and other gear.</p><p>Restaurants, shops selling alcohol, underground brothels and casinos are booming, according to Ukrainian officials and media reports – along with a black market for drugs, especially amphetamines and crystal meth that help soldiers stay awake and overcome fear and boredom.</p><p>There is another black market – of stolen weaponry, from pistols and assault rifles to explosives and even grenade launchers, according to dozens of Russian court records that often name Chechen servicemen as mastermind contrabandists.</p><p>The market dates back to 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists carved out two “People’s Republics” in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk.</p><p>In 2022, Moscow declared their annexation along with two more Ukrainian regions, even though none of them are 100 percent occupied.</p><p>But Donetsk and Luhansk – known collectively as Donbas – still keep the vestiges of “independence” such as a “head of state”, a “parliament”, border checkpoints and customs offices.</p><h2 id=\"militarising-the-economy\">‘Militarising the economy’</h2><p>Moscow’s reasons are simple, according to the head of the Strategic Research and Security Institute, a Kyiv-based think tank.</p><p>“They need to create a militarised springboard that is not on Russian territory,” Pavel Lisyanskiy told Al Jazeera. “They militarise the economy, there’s fewer and fewer people, it will be a huge military base to frighten Europe.”</p><p>However, Moscow “is no longer ashamed to just dispatch its appointees” who control the economy despite occasional objections from separatists, Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Moscow is not ceremonious with them, jailing and assassinating the most disobedient ones, Fesenko said.</p><p>Ukrainian officials and media reports have claimed that Moscow had several separatist <a href=\"/news/2022/4/22/reporters-notebook-how-donbas-evolved-under-separatists\">strongmen killed</a>, and several more have been forced out and jailed in Russia.</p><h2 id=\"everyone-s-in-jail\">‘Everyone’s in jail’</h2><p>Moscow has poured billions of dollars into construction projects in the Donbas, where entire cities such as Avdiivka or Bakhmut have nearly been razed to the ground, and dozens of plants and factories cannot possibly be restored.</p><p>“Unfeasible” was the word Donetsk’s “head” Denis Pushilin used in September when describing the rebuilding of the colossal Azovstal and Ilych steel plants in the southern city of Mariupol.</p><p>The plants once churned out two-fifths of Ukraine’s steel that contributed 0.6 percent to the nation’s gross domestic product.</p><p>Instead, Pushilin said, new resorts will be built in their stead near the Sea of Azov, which is favoured by tourists with little children because of its shallow waters with next to no waves.</p><p>But the construction boom goes hand in hand with corruption.</p><p>Under Ukraine, it was “controllable”, analyst Fesenko said. “But after 2014, a big redistribution began, and criminal wars added to the corruption.”</p><p>In November, Donetsk’s “deputy construction minister”, Yulia Mervaezova, was charged with embezzling 9 billion rubles ($115m), and the amount “will probably go up”, prosecutors reportedly said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donetsk residents use rainwater and melted snow for drinking because of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/ticking-environmental-bomb-water-crisis-worsens-in-russia-annexed-donbas\">catastrophic water shortages</a> caused by the destruction of a sophisticated water supply system.</p><p>A pipeline drawing water from southwestern Russia cannot provide nearly enough, but no construction company wants to build a second pipeline because of corruption risks, a top official admitted.</p><p>“Nobody wants to approach [the second pipeline], because everyone who built the first one is in jail,” Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said in November.</p><p>The unveiling of construction projects “has become a tool of political theatre and elite enrichment rather than genuine efforts at recovery”, according to analysis by the Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington, DC, published in December. “This approach prioritises political visibility and control over genuine reconstruction.”</p><p>Russia’s federal budget can no longer foot the bills – and Moscow forced some 40 Russian regions to “sponsor” the construction of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and roads in occupied Ukrainian cities, towns and districts.</p><p>“Sponsor regions play the key role in the region’s restoration and development,” Donetsk’s “construction minister” Vladimir Dubovka said in January 2025.</p><p>The regions also dispatch thousands of teachers, health professionals and construction workers to the Donbas.</p><p>The city of Moscow “sponsors” the regional centres of Donetsk and Luhansk, St Petersburg – Mariupol, while the town of Shakhtarsk is “supervised” by the resource-rich Pacific island of Sakhalin.</p><p>The “sponsors” often find the money by ignoring their own needs.</p><p>As the northwestern Arkhangelsk region paid for the rebuilding of occupied Melitopol, its administration reportedly turned a blind eye to the plight and pleas of residents of several apartment buildings that stood on concrete stilts nailed in permafrost, which thawed because of global warming.</p><h2 id=\"irreversible-consequences\">‘Irreversible consequences’</h2><p>Donbas has some of the world’s richest coal mines, including ones with coking coal necessary for steel making.</p><p>It also boasts deposits of iron ore, lithium, graphite, manganese, nickel, titanium, rare earths and noble gas neon used in chip-making.</p><p>But the renewed and so far limited extraction of minerals is “barbaric”, analyst Lisyanskiy said.</p><p>Last year, half a dozen small water bodies disappeared because of tectonic fissures caused by irresponsible mining, he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaining rivulets, lakes and groundwater in Donbas are contaminated by chemical waste as safety standards are routinely snubbed.</p><p>“The consequences are irreversible, it’s not even a hundred years, believe me,” said Lisyanskiy, who spent years working as a mine engineer in the Donbas region.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the promise of American help is also problematic in far more significant ways.</p><p>For starters, “help” is not exactly a specialty of the US – and particularly not under the guidance of the man who <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/22/by-bombing-iran-the-us-continues-to-make-the-world-safe-for-war\">bombed Iran</a> just last summer, right after returning to power on a pledge to keep the US out of foreign wars.</p><p>Trump is furthermore responsible for maintaining a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">crippling sanctions regime</a> against the Islamic Republic, thereby fuelling the high inflation that triggered the present protests in the first place. As is par for the course in such forms of economic warfare, the nonelite of Iran have paid the highest price.</p><p>In addition to constituting a departure from his whole “America First” premise, Trump’s recent offer of “help” to the Iranians marks a shift in presidential rhetoric vis-a-vis the much-maligned country. Previously, the Trumpian discourse mainly targeted Iran’s alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles equipped with chemical and biological warheads – all of which were marketed as a dangerous threat not only to the US but also to America’s BFF and current regional <a href=\"/opinions/2024/5/9/give-or-take-a-few-bombs-us-complicity-in-genocide-remains-ironclad\">partner in genocide</a>, the state of Israel.</p><p>Now, however, Trump is in “rescue” mode, <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2007082423121748269\">warning</a> this month that “if Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/trump-cancels-iran-meetings-urges-protesters-to-take-over-institutions\">assured</a> Iranian protesters that “help is on the way” without elaborating as to what this might consist of. Right-wing US media have pitched in with such encouraging <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-historic-chance-help-topple-irans-america-hating-regime\">headlines</a> as “Trump has historic chance to help topple Iran’s America-hating regime.”</p><p>For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has chimed in with the affirmation that Israel supports the Iranian protesters’ “struggle for freedom and firmly condemns the mass killings of innocent civilians” – quite the statement from someone who has been presiding over the genocide of Palestinians for more than two years.</p><p>With his recent promises of assistance, one can’t help but wonder if Trump isn’t taking a page from the old playbook of former US President <a href=\"/opinions/2022/5/22/george-w-bush-is-not-funny\">George W Bush</a>, the ex-“war on terror” chief and the face of an administration that was dedicated to propagating the very <a href=\"/news/2021/9/10/decades-after-9-11-what-became-of-the-uss\">neo-conservative ideology</a> to which Trump has long ostensibly been so vehemently opposed.</p><p>In essence, the neo-con objective is to wreak military havoc throughout the world using democracy promotion and other superficially nice ideas as an excuse for deadly imperial expansion. And while Trump successfully wooed many US voters with his alleged commitment to abandoning such pursuits in far-off lands in favour of total self-absorption and “making America great again”, it seems the neo-conservative impulse is hard to kick.</p><p>To be sure, Trump’s presidency recalls Bush’s in more ways than one. Both men possess clownish demeanours – not to mention an intriguing relationship with English grammar and spelling – that would be entirely amusing if not for the extensive bloodshed over which they have respectively presided.</p><p>Likewise, both men have proven disproportionately eager to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/2/did-god-want-trump-to-bomb-iran\">invoke God</a> as an ally in their destructive endeavours.</p><p>Despite Trump’s professed opposition to the policy of regime change and the Bush-era interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan – part of a “war on terror” that ultimately left <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/31/here-is-to-a-quarter-century-of-us-military-havoc\">millions of people dead</a> – he has in his first year back in office managed to bomb an assortment of nations as well as <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">kidnap the president of Venezuela</a>, Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Florida Congressman Randy Fine, who has just <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/florida-congressman-files-bill-let-155609049.html\">introduced a bill</a> that would permit Trump to annex Greenland, has also taken to X to <a href=\"https://x.com/RepFine/status/2011105866389602514\">propose</a> that “Maybe we should Maduro Khamenei.” In this case, “Khamenei” refers to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei while “Maduro” functions as a brand-new verb for abducting the leader of a sovereign state.</p><p>But as Trump now promises that the US is “ready to help!!!” Iran, it’s worth thinking back on other instances of American “help!!!” in the country – like that time in 1953 that the CIA engineered a coup d’etat against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, which set the stage for the long reign of the torture-happy shah of Iran, who was finally overthrown by the Iranian Revolution in 1979.</p><p>The late shah’s son, it so happens, is now conveniently agitating for US intervention from his position of <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/reza-pahlavi-selling-his-royal-residence-in-potomac-maryland-for-3-1m/\">gilded exile</a> outside Washington, DC.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump may have caught on to the perks of “helping” people in other countries as a means of distracting from certain antidemocratic realities at home – among them that the US has been converted into a <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/20/trumps-big-beautiful-police-state-is-here\">full-fledged police state</a> where immigration agents feel free <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/us-woman-killed-by-ice-agent-called-domestic-terrorist-what-it-means\">to murder US citizens</a> at will.</p><p>And as Trump continues semi-channeling Bush, pretty much the last thing Iranians need is for the US to “come to their rescue”.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
