Sarma has been accused of running xenophobic campaigns against Muslims, who form <a href=\"/news/2025/10/8/muslims-in-indias-poll-bound-bihar-battle-bangladeshi-infiltrator-tag\">one-third of the state’s population</a>, before state elections expected in March or April.</p><p>The video also included images of Sarma dressed as a cowboy and pointing a pistol, overlaid with text such as “Foreigner free Assam”.</p><p>The Assam BJP unit accused of producing anti-Muslim rhetoric has not officially commented.</p><p>“There is no comment.

If they ask 5 rupees [6 United States cents], give 4 rupees [4 cents]. They will leave Assam only if they face hardships,” he said.</p><p>Only the federally run territories of India-administered Kashmir in the north and the Lakshadweep islands in the Arabian Sea have a higher Muslim percentage of the population than Assam.</p><h2 id=\"no-basic-decency\">‘No basic decency’</h2><p>Aman Wadud, an Assam-based leader from the opposition Indian National Congress party, called the video “deeply disturbing”.</p><p>“BJP has proven time and again that it has absolutely no regard for law or even basic decency,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This also shows desperation of BJP. They are losing the plot in Assam. The wise people of Assam are ready to defeat this politics of hatred and division,” he added.</p><p>In a statement, Congress said the video “amounts to a call to mass violence and genocide”.</p><p>All India Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra urged India’s Supreme and High Court judges to take notice of the Sarma video, asking in a post on X “what more this man needs to do” for the judiciary to “wake up”.</p><p>In September, the BJP in Assam posted another AI-generated video titled “Assam without BJP”, depicting the state taken over by Muslims, whom it paints as “illegal immigrants”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in Assam comes against the backdrop of a BJP culture war against Muslims, who make up 14 per cent of India’s 1.4 billion people.</p><p>According to Hindu-majoritarian ideology, which guides the ruling BJP, Muslims are <a href=\"/news/2024/4/22/infiltrators-modi-accused-of-anti-muslim-hate-speech-amid-india-election\">considered</a> outsiders. Muslim asylum seekers and refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar are in particular targeted as “infiltrators”. India also amended its citizenship laws in 2019, making faith a basis for acquiring citizenship in the officially secular nation. Muslims were excluded from applying.</p><p>Since the election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, dozens of Muslims have been lynched on suspicion of consuming beef or transporting cattle, which are considered sacred by some Hindus. Muslims have faced discrimination in employment and education for decades, but under the BJP government, their plight has worsened as Hindu nationalist parties have weaponised laws against Muslims.</p><p>Human rights groups said <a href=\"/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india\">hate speech and violence</a> against Muslims have exploded in recent years.</p><p>Last month, research by the India Hate Lab, a project of the Washington, DC-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate, found that the country had recorded 1,318 hate speech events in 2025, an average of more than three per day.</p><p>At least 98 per cent of the events targeted Muslims and explicitly so in 1,156 cases, the report added.</p><p>Modi himself has been accused of using inflammatory language about Muslims to generate fear among Hindu voters. Human Rights Watch said in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/08/14/india-hate-speech-fueled-modis-election-campaign\">a report</a> published in August 2024 that Modi and several party leaders “frequently used hate speech against Muslims and other minorities, inciting discrimination, hostility, and violence” during campaigning for the 2024 general election.</p><p>Modi was <a href=\"/news/2005/3/18/us-revokes-indian-ministers-visa\">denied a US visa</a> for links to a 2002 anti-Muslim massacre in the state of Gujarat while he was serving as its chief minister. More than 1,000 people were killed, most of them Muslims, in some of the worst anti-Muslim violence since India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Since becoming prime minister, however, Modi has visited the US numerous times.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Pakistan positions itself as a regional security provider, rising militancy and economic constraints continue to test the sustainability of that ambition.</p><p>From February 2 to 4, Libya’s eastern commander, renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, visited Rawalpindi for talks at Pakistan’s army headquarters with the army chief, Asim Munir. The visit might have seemed routine, but it highlights Pakistan’s expanding defence diplomacy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).</p><p>Pakistan reportedly signed a $4bn defence deal with Haftar’s self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), including 16 JF-17 fighters and 12 Super Mushak trainer aircraft, structured over roughly two and a half years. The acquisition of this 4.5-generation fighter grants the LNA a “game-changing” airpower advantage, potentially upending the military balance with its Tripoli-based rivals unless the latter secures a comparable capability in time.</p><p>Pakistan is also reportedly in the final stages of a $1.5bn package to supply the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) with 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones and air defence systems to bolster its capabilities in the ongoing war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p><p>In purely national-interest terms, Pakistan’s growing defence profile in MENA is not a problem automatically. A larger footprint can generate foreign exchange, expand diplomatic access, and increase Pakistan’s visibility in a region where security partnerships are being diversified. It can also strengthen longstanding military-to-military links in the Gulf and beyond.</p><p>Yet the same burst of activity raises a quieter question: is Pakistan’s foray into MENA largely transactional — focused on exporting weaponry — or part of a coherent strategy to provide security? In other words, Pakistan can export military services and equipment; the harder question is whether it can sustain a “security provider” posture when domestic militancy and border volatility keep pulling capacity inwards.</p><p>The Middle East is a useful recent example because it exposes a pattern of contingent, deal-driven activism: Pakistan can offer military cooperation and weapons, and it can gain diplomatic visibility, but the approach is being shaped less by a durable economic base and domestic security stability than by events and short-term openings.</p><p>The May 2025 India-Pakistan crisis helps explain why Pakistan’s defence industry suddenly looks more marketable in parts of MENA. Pakistan’s successful counter-air campaign against India, which reportedly included the downing of India’s premier Rafale fighter aircraft, has proved to be a windfall for the country, resulting in a surge in high-value defence partners and customers.</p><p>The crisis bolstered Pakistan’s airpower narrative, highlighting its superior training standards and operational integration when confronting a conventionally larger adversary — qualities that have increasingly drawn the interest of regional partners.</p><p>In September 2025, Saudi Arabia formalised a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement with Pakistan, stating that an attack on one would be treated as an attack on both. The agreement is a significant diplomatic marker and reinforces Pakistan’s standing as a security partner at a time when Gulf states are diversifying their defence relationships.</p><p>But beyond airpower, training, and defence-industrial cooperation, Islamabad lacks the economic weight to anchor these relationships at scale.</p><p>In 2024-25, Pakistan’s net foreign direct investment from all countries was about $2.5bn, while its total trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations was roughly $20bn. By contrast, India’s GCC-sourced investment alone was $4.7bn in 2024, and its GCC trade was about $179bn.</p><p>Moreover, Pakistan remains a net seeker of capital — relying on Gulf “rollover” loans and central bank deposits to stabilise its own economy — whereas India has transitioned into a strategic investor in Gulf infrastructure, energy, and technology. This “dependency gap” ensures that while Pakistan is a valued security guarantor, it is rarely a peer-level economic partner.</p><p>This imbalance matters because Gulf capitals increasingly treat defence cooperation as one strand within a much bigger partnership portfolio — energy, trade, investment, technology, and supply chains. India and the United Arab Emirates, for example, recently discussed deeper defence cooperation through a letter of intent to establish a strategic defence partnership, alongside a $3bn LNG supply deal and ambitious trade targets.</p><p>In that environment, Pakistan’s security value can open doors, but without comparable economic depth that fosters diverse interdependence, it is harder to convert access into durable influence.</p><p>The other constraint on the “net security provider” narrative is the condition of Pakistan’s own security environment.</p><p>Pakistan recently confronted one of its deadliest security flare-ups in years in Balochistan: a wave of simultaneous, province-wide attacks targeting administrative centres and security installations in Quetta and beyond. The resulting <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/pakistan-army-says-it-killed-216-fighters-in-weeklong-balochistan-campaign\">weeklong counteroffensive</a> reportedly led to the death of 216 armed fighters, though at the steep cost of 22 security personnel and 36 civilian lives.</p><p>Whatever one’s preferred political explanation, the figures underline how much bandwidth the state is still expending to stabilise a key province.</p><p>Then came another signal from the Islamabad Capital Territory. On February 6, a suicide attacker struck a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/deadly-islamabad-bombing-sharpens-focus-on-cross-border-attacks-in-pakistan\">Shia mosque</a> on the outskirts of the national capital during Friday prayers, killing more than 30 people and injuring about 170. A splinter faction linked to ISIL (ISIS) claimed responsibility. This was the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/deadly-islamabad-bombing-sharpens-focus-on-cross-border-attacks-in-pakistan#:~:text=Capital%20under%20fire,November%20last%20year.\">second major attack</a> in the capital in three months.</p><p>The western border with Afghanistan is another reminder that Pakistan’s security bandwidth is not infinite. Islamabad is now <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/afghanistan/afghanistan-and-pakistan-square\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locked</a> in a confrontation with a Taliban regime that refuses to curb cross-border militancy. This grinding conflict — which killed <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1964537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1,034 people</a> in 2025 alone — compels the state to divert critical military resources to the frontier, draining the very capacity needed for power projection abroad.</p><p>Indeed, the grim situation South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman portrays — of a Pakistan “sandwiched” between hardcore enemies — presents a strategic nightmare. He argues the Afghanistan-Pakistan situation is now more volatile than the India-Pakistan rivalry and could spur global terrorism.</p><p>None of these is to argue for retreat. Pakistan’s defence diplomacy in MENA can be good for the country, especially economically and diplomatically. But it does suggest a strategic tension: expanding security partnerships abroad is easier to sustain when internal stabilisation is more durable, and when foreign influence rests on a broader economic base as well as military capability. If Pakistan wants to be seen as exporting security, not just selling equipment, it will need a clearer doctrine, firmer internal stabilisation, and a wider economic foundation — so that events do not keep dictating its foreign policy priorities.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It was signed by foreign ministers from Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.</p><p>The European Commission has not fulfilled the request. Currently, products originating from the settlements can be imported into Europe, but do not benefit from the preferential tariffs of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Since an EU court ruling in 2019, they must be labelled as originating from Israeli settlements.</p><p>Hugh Lovatt, senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), said the EU theoretically has an obligation to align its policies with international law.</p><p>Whether that happens “comes down to a political decision”.</p><p>“Human rights abuses should be a core criterion for deciding what to buy and what to invest in,” he said. “But in the current global attitude, that approach has been increasingly undermined.”</p><p>In 2022, restrictions on trade and investment were imposed on Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine following Moscow’s full-scale invasion, but no similar measures were taken towards illegal Israeli settlements.</p><p>A few member states have opted to take independent action. Spain and Slovenia last year banned the imports of goods produced in Israeli settlements, while Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands are working on legislation.</p><p>As of January 2026, Spain banned importing goods produced in Israeli settlements, but its measures do not make explicit mention of transshipments through its ports.</p><p>Bills of lading obtained as part of this investigation show that the port of Valencia plays a key role, receiving 358 out of a total of 390 shipments transiting through Spain.</p><p>Several bills of lading directly reference illegal settlements in the Syrian Golan Heights.</p><p>Aquestia Ltd, a company that specialises in hydraulic systems, list Kfar Haruv and Ramat HaGolan in the shipper address. Miriam Shoham, which exports fresh fruit, also lists Ramot HaGolan, while polypropylene manufacturer Mapal Cooperative Society lists Mevo Hama.</p><p>PYM said, “MSC’s transfers to and from Israeli settlements are systemic and in violation of both international and domestic Spanish laws.</p><p>“MSC provides the infrastructure connecting illegal settlements to global markets, thus encouraging further occupation of Palestinian and Syrian land.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is instead a purposefully slow and heavily conditioned pathway.</p><p>Official figures expose a stark gap between demand and reality.</p><p>Between May 8, 2024, and January 18, 2025, only 459 patients were evacuated through Karem Abu Salem. During a subsequent ceasefire period between January 19 and March 17, 2025, when Rafah was partially reopened, the number rose to 1,702 patients, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/we-just-sit-and-cry-gazas-cancer-patients-die-waiting-for-treatment\">including hundreds of children</a>, clearly indicating that evacuations improve only when additional movement routes were available.</p><p>Once that period ended and reliance on Karem Abu Salem resumed, evacuations again dropped sharply to just 352 patients between March 18 and July 16, 2025.</p><p>By contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) today reports that more than 18,500 patients in Gaza remain in urgent, life-saving need of medical treatment outside the Strip.</p><p>The disparity between need and outcome shows that evacuations conducted over many months addressed only a tiny fraction of actual demand, leaving thousands trapped on open-ended waiting lists in war-battered Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cruel-and-inhuman-treatment\">‘Cruel and inhuman treatment’</h2><p id=\"more-than-1-600-palestinians-have-died-while-waiting-for-healthcare-abroad-in-this\">More than 1,600 Palestinians have died while waiting for healthcare abroad. In this context, al-Hussaini said restrictions on movement amount to one of Israel’s gravest violations during the genocide.</p><p>“Thousands of wounded and ill Palestinians, including children and cancer patients, were denied the ability to travel outside Gaza for medical treatment, or were forced to wait for weeks or months under complex and opaque procedures. In many cases, their health deteriorated or they died before permission to leave was granted,” she said.</p><p>“Such practices cannot be justified on security grounds and constitute a direct violation of the right to life, amounting to cruel and inhuman treatment.”</p><p>When Rafah was partially reopened this month after the United States applied pressure on Israel’s leaders, the underlying reality did not fundamentally change. On February 2, the WHO announced the evacuation of just five patients and seven companions.</p><p>It was a tightly controlled border opening with Egypt governed by multiple layers of scrutiny: small numbers allowed to cross, prior Israeli security authorisation for returnees, European screening at Rafah, followed by a second identification and interrogation process in a corridor administered by the Israeli army.</p><p>Al-Hussaini said the restrictions imposed during the war, taken in totality, show that Israel uses freedom of movement in Gaza to regulate the daily life of Palestinians, determining who receives aid, who accesses health treatment, and who remains trapped in the Strip, placing these policies at the heart of legal debates around proportionality, the prohibition of collective punishment, and the obligations of an occupying power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298933\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298933\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6988f477719a-1770583159.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Etedal Rayyan (29), who recently returned back to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, looks out the window of her heavily-damaged house in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in the northern Gaza Strip on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Etedal Rayyan, 29, recently returned to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"blockade-as-permanent-policy-since-2007\">Blockade as permanent policy since 2007</h2><p>Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement in Gaza did not begin with the current war. Since 2007, they have evolved from purportedly temporary security measures into a permanent policy structuring the lives of 2.4 million people.</p><p>Following Hamas’s rise to power in 2007 through democratic elections, Israel imposed a comprehensive land, sea and air blockade. The International Committee of the Red Cross has consistently stated that the comprehensive closure of Gaza targets the civilian population as a whole, infringes on fundamental rights, and constitutes a form of collective punishment prohibited under international humanitarian law.</p><p>UN agencies have similarly stressed that long-term restrictions, even during periods of relative calm, lack any legitimate legal justification.</p><p>Economically and socially, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have documented how the blockade has paralysed Gaza’s economy, eroded its productive base and driven unprecedented levels of poverty and unemployment. Severe restrictions on goods, raw materials and exports have made any form of sustainable economic recovery impossible, entrenching chronic dependence on humanitarian aid.</p><p>Israel further reinforced the blockade by a policy of separating Gaza from the occupied West Bank, treating the Strip as a distinct territorial unit despite their status as a single territory under international law.</p><p>UN special rapporteurs and rights groups say this separation has fractured social and family ties, and obstructed access to education, work and healthcare.</p><p>For more than 15 years, these restrictions have been recalibrated after each escalation. The severe constraints imposed during the current war are merely an intensification of a system in place since 2007.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298188\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gaza-death-count-1770566375.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-feb 4, 2026_Gaza death count-1765555845\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"controlling-food-water-medicine\">Controlling food, water, medicine</h2><p>In March 2024, OCHA reported that only 26 percent of aid missions were facilitated by Israel’s army, while 40 percent were denied, 20 percent delayed, 11 percent impeded and 3 percent withdrawn.</p><p>May 2024 marked a turning point, as crossing closures and restrictions led to a sharp reduction in aid and humanitarian personnel entry.</p><p>As security conditions on convoy routes deteriorated, aid increasingly failed to reach the intended destinations. This prompted the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to suspend aid entry through the Karem Abu Salem crossing on December 1, 2024, citing unsafe conditions and repeated looting incidents. In many cases, aid was unloaded on roads or seized before reaching warehouses.</p><p>In August 2025, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitor, confirmed that <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/famine-confirmed-in-northern-gaza-global-hunger-monitor-says\">famine had taken hold</a> in northern Gaza.</p><p>Subsequent updates reiterated that famine risk would persist as long as Israeli military operations continued and humanitarian access remained restricted, noting that the vast majority of the population faced extreme levels of food deprivation.</p><p>“Restrictions on movement were among the gravest violations.

But for Jamaat’s leadership, the manifesto is less about fiscal arithmetic than signalling intent, say analysts.</p><p>For years, critics have tried to portray Jamaat, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, as driven too much by religious doctrine to be able to govern a young, diverse, forward-looking population. The manifesto, by contrast, presents a party long excluded from power as a credible alternative – and as a force that sees no contradiction between its religious foundations and the modern future that Bangladeshis aspire to.</p><p>His audience was telling too.</p><p>Until recently, Bangladesh’s business elites and foreign diplomats either kept their distance from Jamaat or engaged with it discreetly.

It upended the country’s political order, hollowing out the familiar duopoly that for decades defined Bangladeshi politics – the rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p><p>With the Awami League effectively barred from the political field and the BNP the only big party left standing, a vacuum emerged. Many initially assumed it would be filled by the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Instead, Jamaat – long pushed to the margins – moved to occupy the space.</p><p>As Bangladesh heads towards a high-stakes election in less than two weeks, Jamaat has now emerged as one of the country’s two most prominent political forces. Some pre-election polls now place it in direct competition with the BNP.</p><p>At the centre of that transformation is Rahman, according to Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general and a longtime associate of the party chief.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Zubair, who worked closely with Rahman when he led Jamaat in the country’s Sylhet region, said the resurgence is the result of years of grassroots social work and political survival under repression.</p><p>Rahman, a soft-spoken former government doctor, took over as Jamaat’s chief in 2019, at a time when the party was banned under Hasina. In December 2022, he was arrested in the middle of the night on charges of supporting militancy and was released only after 15 months when he secured bail.</p><p>In March 2025, months after the student-led protest had overthrown Hasina and an interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus had taken office, Rahman’s name was dropped from the list of accused in the case.</p><p>Since then, his carefully calibrated, emotional public appearances have drawn wide attention.</p><p>At a massive rally in Dhaka last July, Rahman collapsed twice on stage due to heat-related illness but returned to finish his speech, defying doctors’ advice.</p><p>“As long as Allah grants me life, I will fight for the people,” he told the crowd, barely sitting on the stage, supported by the doctors. “If Jamaat is elected, we will be servants, not owners. No minister will take plots or tax-free cars. There will be no extortion, no corruption. I want to tell the youth clearly – we are with you.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293585\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293585\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293585\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26034328142472-1-1770410903.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman waves a their party flag during an election campaign in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jan. 22, 2026.

Everyone in the party trusts him,” said Lokman Hossain, a Jamaat supporter in Dhaka. He said that over the past year and a half, the party has reached far more people than before, with Rahman’s appeal beyond Jamaat’s traditional base playing a central role.</p><p>Rahman’s challenge, however, is no longer purely electoral – it is reputational.</p><p>As new supporters drift towards Jamaat, he is attempting to reframe how the party is seen: less as an Islamic force defined by doctrine and history, and more as a vehicle for clean governance, discipline and change.</p><p>Whether this reinvention is substantive or merely cosmetic will define both Rahman’s leadership and Jamaat’s future, say analysts.</p><p>Any attempt to recast Jamaat’s public image, however, runs up against the unresolved legacy of 1971. For decades, the party’s role during Bangladesh’s war of independence – when it sided with Pakistan – and the subsequent trials and executions of several senior leaders have shaped perceptions of Jamaat at home and abroad.</p><p>Rahman has approached that history with caution. He has avoided detailed admissions but has recently acknowledged what he calls Jamaat’s “past mistakes”, asking forgiveness if the party caused harm.</p><p>The language marks a subtle shift from outright denial, while stopping short of naming specific actions or responsibilities. Supporters say this reflects political realism rather than evasion – an attempt to move the party beyond its dark chapter. Critics, by contrast, see the ambiguity as deliberate, arguing it softens Jamaat’s image without confronting the substance of its past.</p><p>“He knows what those mistakes were,” said Saleh Uddin Ahmed, a United States-based Bangladeshi academic and political analyst. “But stating them explicitly would destabilise his leadership inside the party.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmed nonetheless considers Rahman more moderate than Jamaat’s previous leaders, noting his relative willingness to discuss unresolved historical questions and address issues such as women’s rights – topics the party long avoided. “This opening up is also happening because of increased public and media scrutiny,” Ahmed said. “People are asking questions now, and Jamaat has to respond.”</p><p>Jamaat’s effort to reach voters beyond its traditional base and reassure foreign audiences, while retaining the loyalty of its conservative supporters, has created a persistent tension – one that has often resulted in dual messaging.</p><p>That balancing act has been evident in public statements by senior leaders. Abdullah Md Taher, one of Rahman’s closest aides, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said Jamaat is a moderate party, adding that it would not impose or strictly adhere to Islamic law.</p><p>The party has also, for the first time in its history, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\">nominated a Hindu candidate</a>.</p><p>Yet when addressing conservative supporters, the party continues to emphasise its Islamic identity, with some backers encouraging votes for Jamaat as an act of religious merit – a practice the rival BNP has criticised as the misuse of religious sentiment.</p><p>The strategy appears to have helped Jamaat re-enter political conversations that were once closed to it. At the same time, it has sharpened doubts about how far Rahman is willing – or able – to go in reinterpreting the party’s past and ideology as he courts a broader electorate.</p><p>Those limits are most visible in Jamaat’s stance on women and leadership. They came into sharp focus during his Al Jazeera interview in which Shafiqur Rahman said it was not possible for a woman to hold the party’s top position – a remark that reignited longstanding criticism of Jamaat’s gender politics, despite its attempts to project a more inclusive image.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.”</p><p>Critics argue that the stance exposes the limits of Jamaat’s claims of moderation.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct researcher at the Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative at Western Sydney University in Australia and author of Narratives of Bangladesh, also questioned Jamaat’s internal culture, noting that even female leaders who publicly endorse such views operate within a male-dominated hierarchy. He was referring to the party’s large number of female supporters and members, including women within its Majlis-e-Shura, the highest decision-making body. “It reflects a structure where women follow what men say in that party,” he said.</p><p>The criticism carries particular weight given the movement that helped reopen political space for Jamaat itself. The July 2024 uprising against Hasina, analysts note, saw extensive participation by women, often at the front lines of protest. “Women were part of that movement as much as men, if not more,” Hasan said. “Undermining them now gives Jamaat a deeply problematic outlook.”</p><p>Political historians argue this is not a new contradiction but a longstanding one. Since contesting elections under its own symbol in 1986, Jamaat has never fielded a woman candidate for a general parliamentary seat, relying instead on reserved quotas.</p><p>“This isn’t a temporary position or a tactical lapse,” said political historian and author Mohiuddin Ahmad.“It reflects the party’s ideological structure, and that structure has not fundamentally changed.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293590\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293590\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26021348970837-1770411239.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Head of Bangladesh's interim government Muhammad Yunus, center, with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Ameer Shafiqur Rahman, inaugurate the July Uprising Memorial Museum, once the official residence of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026.

White-bearded, soft-spoken and visibly attentive to supporters, Rahman fits the image.</p><p>“He connects with young people through his words,” said Abdullah Al Maruf, a Gen Z law student from Chattogram and a Jamaat supporter. “There is something about his recent work that feels like the relationship between a grandfather and his grandchildren. Where BNP leaders often belittle young people, Shafiqur speaks to them with respect.”</p><p>Maruf added that Rahman’s appeal extends beyond Jamaat’s traditional base. “Outside the usual Jamaat circle, he is more popular than previous Jamaat leaders,” he said.</p><p>Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general, described the party’s outreach beyond traditional voters – such as the decision to nominate a Hindu candidate – not as a tactical move but one rooted in Jamaat’s constitutional framework rather than political expediency.</p><p>“Our constitution allows any Bangladeshi, regardless of religion, to be part of the party if they support our political, economic and social policies,” he said. “Supporting our religious doctrine is not a requirement for political participation.”</p><p>Jamaat leaders argue the move reflects a broader effort to shift the party’s public image – from one defined primarily by theology to one centred on governance and accountability. “We are emphasising corruption-free politics, discipline and public service,” Zubair said. “People have seen our leaders stand with them during floods, during COVID, and during the July uprising. That is why support is growing.”</p><p>Krishna Nandi, the party’s Hindu candidate from the city of Khulna, agrees. “When families fall into poverty, Jamaat-linked welfare networks step in without asking about religion or political loyalty. This culture of service explains why many citizens see Jamaat not as a party of slogans but as a party of discipline, structure and responsibility,” <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nandi wrote for Al Jazeera</a>.</p><p>The Jamaat’s outreach has also extended well beyond domestic audiences. Zubair said the party’s leadership has held meetings with Indian diplomats in Dhaka who paid a courtesy visit to Shafiqur when he was ill. Jamaat figures were invited to India’s 77th Republic Day reception at the Indian High Commission last month – an unprecedented step.</p><p>European and Western diplomats, he added, have also sought engagements with Rahman in recent months. That shift has been mirrored in Washington. In a leaked audio recording reported by The Washington Post, a US diplomat was quoted as saying American officials wanted to “be friends” with the Jamaat, asking journalists whether members of the party’s influential student wing might be willing to appear in their programmes.</p><p>As Jamaat’s international engagement expands – and as it emerges as a serious electoral force alongside frontrunner BNP – many general supporters express confidence in Rahman’s leadership.</p><p>“He is a patriot,” said Abul Kalam, a voter in Rahman’s Dhaka constituency. “Whether as prime minister or opposition leader, he will lead us well.”</p><p>What lies next for the party is unclear. But analysts say that irrespective of the outcome of the elections, Rahman’s stature within Jamaat – and beyond, in Bangladesh – appears resolute.</p><p>“Shafiqur Rahman is an experienced politician and is frequently in the headlines,” Ahmad, the political historian, said. “His political thinking is not yet fully clear, but his grip over the party is evident.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We will only repay them by working at our utmost to bring all the good things to them, to our country,” he said.</p><p>Asked about forming a coalition and appointing a cabinet, Anutin said he was waiting for clarity on the final numbers, and that each party would need to hold internal discussions on how to proceed.</p><p>Anutin called the election in December after fewer than 100 days in office, seeking to capitalise on a wave of ‌nationalism generated by Thailand’s three-week conflict with Cambodia.</p><p>He described the election result as “a victory for all Thais”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The People’s Party has already ‌ruled out the possibility of joining a coalition led by ⁠Anutin, with its leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, saying late on Sunday that it would not seek to form a rival coalition.</p><p>Polls at the end of January suggested the People’s Party was significantly ahead of Bhumjaithai.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng, reporting from Bangkok, called the outcome of Sunday’s election “somewhat of a surprise”.</p><p>“But the two things we kept hearing from Thai voters, regardless of political affiliation, was that people wanted stability to return to Thai politics. This was an election that shouldn’t have happened. The last one only happened three years ago. So it was a sign Thailand was teetering on the edge,” Cheng said.</p><p>“The other thing Thai voters wanted was economic growth. This is a country that’s been in economic stagnation for nearly two decades now, while it’s surrounded by countries seeing huge growth: Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam – all growing between 5 and 6 percent. Thailand is barely scraping along at 1.5 percent GDP growth. And it’s falling back. And the voters wanted to arrest that halt and to give it a significant boost,” he added.</p><p>Bhumjaithai will now look to smaller parties to form a coalition.</p><p>Possible partners include Deputy Prime Minister Thammanat Prompao’s party, Kla Tham, which looks set to win an estimated 58 seats, according to Thai media.</p><p>Together, Bhumjaithai and Kla Tham could surpass the 251 votes required to form a government.</p><p>The prime minister previously indicated that if he was re-elected, ‌the incumbent ministers of finance, foreign affairs and commerce would retain their roles in a new cabinet.</p><p>“Bhumjaithai will start negotiations to form a coalition government in a position of great strength. They won’t need to give away important ministries to smaller parties. They will be able to bring in a couple of partners, but they’ll very much be in the driving seat,” said Al Jazeera’s Cheng.</p><p>“With this return to power, Anutin has got a popular mandate, his party will be firmly back in parliament, they’ll be able to pass the bills he needs, and I think, again, that’s what Thai voters wanted,” he said.</p><p>“They voted for stability and economic growth.”</p><p>Thai voters on Sunday also backed a proposal to change the ‌constitution, with nearly two-thirds in favour of replacing a charter put in place after a 2014 military coup, which critics say gave too much power to an undemocratic Senate.</p><p>It is expected to take at least two years to implement the new constitution, with two more referendums required to endorse the drafting process and the final text.</p></div></div></body></html>"
