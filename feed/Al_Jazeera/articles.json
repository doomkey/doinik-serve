Four years later, he named his company after that dream.</p>\n<p>“When I first came to Tanzania at 28, no one imagined why I would head south,” Ginah, who is lightheartedly called the “Mayor of Egyptians in Dar-es-Salaam”, told Al Jazeera, saying that in the minds of many of his friends and family back home, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are tainted by stereotypes of famine, poverty and disease.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p>But when Ginah arrived, what he found were opportunities – and a chance to build something new.</p>\n<p>“In 2021, I established my company, Dream [Trading],” he said, in recognition of his “dream” to be a success. He set it up with savings of $3,000, tapping into a growing market importing and exporting aluminium household goods. As the years progressed, he expanded into the steel business.</p>\n<p>But beyond work, the 36-year-old is also somewhat of a benevolent godfather figure for other North African migrants making the journey southward.</p>\n<p>Ginah has a standard daily routine. Every morning, his driver, Hamed, drops him off at the household goods warehouses attached to Dream Trading. A while later, he drives him to City Mall, the most popular shopping centre in Dar es Salam’s Kariakoo neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Ginah is a regular at the Somali cafe there, where he sits until about noon, meeting other Egyptians and Tanzanians, often over a breakfast of mandazi – deep-fried dough fritters dusted with powdered sugar – or a chipsi mayai, a popular street food omelette with French fries, tomato sauce and vegetables.</p>\n<p>Typically, Egyptians who move to Tanzania already have a relative or friend living there. For those who don’t, Ginah helps them find a place to stay, sometimes offering them a job at Dream and helping cover their rent if they’re an employee. He also introduces them to the work system in Tanzania, and gives them a lay of the land about cities where they can potentially work.</p>\n<p>“However, the most important thing I provide,” said Ginah, “is a trusted, guaranteed translator.” In urban centres in Tanzania, people speak English. But many village residents only speak Swahili. This could lead to misunderstandings and expose newcomers to “fraud or scams”, Ginah said, so he lends a helping hand.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851757\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851757\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-4-1753249837-e1753252133318.jpeg?w=590&amp;resize=590%2C838&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egyptians in Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ahmed Ginah, right, and two Egyptians recently arrived in Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But Ginah is determined to help only those who want to help themselves.</p>\n<p>“I help those who come to work, not those who lie on their laurels and delegate the work to the translator or others,” he said. “In such cases, I advise the person that this country has a lot to offer, but it doesn’t give to the lazy or dependent.”</p>\n<p>Ginah has gained a lot in eight years. Today, his company distributes products throughout Africa, and he has helped dozens of young men from his home village relocate and establish themselves in Tanzania, where an estimated 70,000 Arabs live – including 1,200 Egyptians, according to figures provided by Egypt’s ambassador to the country, Sherif Ismail, in 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-south-migration\">South-south migration</h2>\n<p>While Europe fortifies its borders against North African migrants, ambitious young Egyptians in a struggling economy are looking for alternatives to emigrating to the West, according to Ayman Zohry, a demographer and expert on migration studies at the American University in Cairo.</p>\n<p>This south-bound migration has accelerated significantly in recent years.</p>\n<p>Official statistics show the number of Egyptians in non-Arab African countries increased from 46,000 in 2017 to 54,000 by 2021.</p>\n<p>This trend stands in stark contrast to the perilous journeys many Egyptians still make across the Mediterranean. In 2023, Egyptians represented more than 7 percent of all arrivals in Italy along the Central Mediterranean route, making them the fifth most common nationality, according to a report by the Mixed Migration Centre.</p>\n<p>The European Union recently responded with a new 7.4 billion euro ($8.7bn) agreement with Egypt, partly aimed at boosting border controls to reduce irregular migration to Europe.</p>\n<p>Zohry explained that Egypt’s youth migration trends are undergoing a notable transformation.</p>\n<p>“While traditional destinations were the Gulf and Europe, there is a new trend towards the south, specifically some African countries,” Zohry told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“Economic migration” sees young people seeking investment opportunities in emerging and promising markets. “This trend has grown in tandem with the expansion of the Egyptian government’s diplomatic and commercial relations with several African countries.”</p>\n<p>However, Zohry said, migration to Africa is often circular or temporary. “This means that the migrant returns to Egypt after a short period, or moves between several countries according to available opportunities.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851894\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851894\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2013-07-12T000000Z_813075216_GM1E97D004201_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-ECONOMY-1753254714.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C476&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania [File: Andrew Emmanuel/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The back-and-forth flow is evident every Friday night in Dar-es-Salaam, as an aeroplane takes off from Julius Nyerere airport, heading to Cairo.</p>\n<p>During high seasons like Eid al-Adha or Eid al-Fitr, whole families fill the departure gates, as Egyptians take their earnings home to visit family, contribute to building a new home, prepare a family member for marriage, or help their parents fulfil a dream of performing the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-to-egyptian-skills\">‘Open to Egyptian skills’</h2>\n<p>Across the African continent, diaspora communities of Arabs and North Africans are growing.</p>\n<p>South Africa accounts for the highest percentage of Egyptian residents in Africa, accounting for 85 percent, followed by Nigeria, Kenya and Senegal.</p>\n<p>Ginah recounts a story from the late 1990s which has since become an urban legend among youth seeking greener pastures in Africa.</p>\n<p>“A young man went to South Africa on vacation to visit a friend. Bizarrely, he was arrested in Cape Town for a visa irregularity,” said Ginah. “When he was released, he was broke. All he had were some aluminium utensils, so he sold them to make enough money to buy a ticket home.”</p>\n<p>That’s when the word got out, he says, and people discovered the huge demand for Egyptian aluminium household goods. Young people realised they could make money – and that’s how the home appliance and home goods trade between Egypt and other African countries picked up. Since then, Egyptian business interests across the continent have diversified to include manufacturing, agricultural processing, and mining.</p>\n<p>Although North Africans have long travelled south, the trend surged following the 2011 mass uprisings in Egypt and the ensuing political, economic and social change, Ginah says.</p>\n<p>“There was a new wave of emigration within Africa – both [to] South Africa and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa – as the Gulf and Libya were greatly affected by the political turmoil.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851767\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851767\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2017-08-14T000000Z_1779850285_RC1BF3CDACC0_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-EGYPT-1753250634.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egypt Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi walks past a guard of honour at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar-es-Salaam [File: Emmanuel Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Locally, migrants have also found a more friendly working environment, many say.</p>\n<p>The government of Tanzania has made strides to support entrepreneurship and foreign investment. According to Lloyds Bank country profile, foreign investors can benefit from many fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.</p>\n<p>“Tanzania has natural resources and significant investment opportunities,” said Makame Iddi Makame, the commissioner general and chief of staff at the Tanzanian embassy in Cairo.</p>\n<p>He said the country established the Tanzania Investment Centre to manage investment affairs. This includes reducing customs duties to 5 percent in priority sectors and 0 percent in leading sectors; providing tax exemption on mining, agricultural, and industrial inputs; facilitating the issuance of residence, work and business permits, and the repatriation of capital gains abroad; and deferring taxes and VAT for loss-making projects for up to five years.</p>\n<p>The country’s political stability also provides a high degree of investment security, as there is low inflation (4.2 percent) and stable exchange rates, he added.</p>\n<p>“Given the limited opportunities within Egypt, some African countries may appear less competitive but are more open to Egyptian skills in sectors like construction, agriculture, education, and information technology,” according to migration expert Zohry.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the potential opportunities and generally more welcoming atmosphere, migration to African countries is still limited, compared with the Gulf and Europe, he added, due to a stigmatised mental image many North Africans have about the rest of the continent.</p>\n<p>However, there are signs the continent may become a gradual alternative for some youth seeking opportunities beyond traditional borders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-opportunities-shared-friendships\">Business opportunities, shared friendships</h2>\n<p>Some 550km (340 miles) southeast of Dar-es-Salaam is Mayan village.</p>\n<p>There, Mohamed el-Shafie, 34, another Egyptian, built two cashew-processing factories in the Mtwara region in 2018, tapping into a strategic crop that accounts for 10-15 percent of Tanzania’s foreign exchange earnings.</p>\n<p>“Cashew sales are built purely on trust,” el-Shafei told Al Jazeera. “The cashew growing and harvesting operation is meticulous and requires sensitive handling by farm workers to produce a pure cashew nut. This is followed by the ‘processing’ stage to prepare it for export in good condition.”</p>\n<p>Tanzania is one of Africa’s leading producers and exporters of cashew nuts, ranking among the top three on the continent and eighth globally.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851751\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-3-1753249819.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers at Mohamad El-Shafei’s cashew processing factory, Mayan Village, Mtwara region, Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>El-Shafei’s company has customers across the Arab world and Turkiye, and employs some 400 Egyptian, Chinese and Tanzanian workers, besides the seasonal labourers hired during the cashew harvest season in October.</p>\n<p>His foray into the cashew industry was accidental, said el-Shafei, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Cairo University, before moving to Beijing to continue his education.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I had a lot of Vietnamese friends who worked in the cashew industry. That was when I learned that Tanzania had a promising business opportunity and that Chinese equipment specialised in cashew crop processing was a gap that I could fill,” he said.</p>\n<p>With a little help from his friends, he connected with cashew farmers in Tanzania in late 2017, and with a small capital investment of  200,000 Egyptian pounds (about $11,000 back then), el-Shafei set up shop and imported two cashew processing machines from China to start the business. In 2023-2024, Elshafei Investment Limited had made 13 export shipments with a total value of approximately $719,700.</p>\n<p>El-Shafei decided to relocate his small family to Dar-es-Salaam so his young children would not be far from him. Today, they all live amid the Arab and Egyptian community, as well as Tanzanians of Yemeni, Omani, and Iranian origin who moved there during the Arab rule before the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution.</p>\n<p>Egyptians in Tanzania are not isolated from the local population, el-Shafei says.</p>\n<p>“We share celebrations and holidays such as the July 7 Saba Saba Day, which marks the founding of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954, a significant step towards independence and nation-building. We also celebrate Swahili Language Day and Eid al-Adha through communal meals held in cashew farm villages,” he says.</p>\n<p>For Ginah, living in Dar-es-Salaam with his wife and children, Egyptians are part of the fabric of their new community.</p>\n<p>“We maintain good relationships with Tanzanians, and we share friendships,” he said, including meeting at work, mosques and social clubs.</p>\n<p>But amid the successes, there are also difficult moments in living far from home, he said.</p>\n<p>“The pain of alienation hits hardest when someone dies. We [Egyptian immigrants] know each other well, whether in East or West African countries, so it’s very difficult. We immediately band together to make arrangements for the body to be repatriated, and we support the family financially and emotionally, whether they remain in Tanzania or return home to Egypt.”</p>\n<p>But when there is family by your side, “the feeling of alienation disappears,” Ginah said. And thanks to technology, “we can see family and friends on a daily basis on mobile phone calls.”</p>\n<p>Ginah feels Tanzania is the country where he was destined to make his living.</p>\n<p>“It has certainly become a second home for me, where my children are growing up,” he said. “When will I return to my homeland, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Egab</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It has dealt us powerful blows, and we have struck it hard in its depths, but it is concealing its losses.”</p>\n<p>He added that Israel’s strikes, which assassinated leading military figures and nuclear scientists, and damaged nuclear facilities, had sought to “eliminate” Iran’s hierarchy, “but it has completely failed to do so”.</p>\n<p>More than 900 people were killed in Iran, large numbers of them civilians, and at least 28 people were killed in Israel before a ceasefire <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/israel-and-iran-agree-ceasefire-amid-waves-of-missiles\">took hold on June 24</a>.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"enrichment-programme-will-continue\">Enrichment programme will continue</h2>\n<p>Pezeshkian said Iran would continue its uranium enrichment programme despite international opposition, saying the development of its nuclear abilities would be carried out “within the framework of international laws”.</p>\n<p>“[US President Donald] Trump says that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon and we accept this because we reject nuclear weapons and this is our political, religious, humanitarian and strategic position,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We believe in diplomacy, so any future negotiations must be according to a win-win logic, and we will not accept threats and dictates.”</p>\n<p>He said the claim from Trump “that our nuclear programme is over is just an illusion”.</p>\n<p>“Our nuclear capabilities are in the minds of our scientists and not in the facilities,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pezeshkian’s comments echoed earlier remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/irans-fm-says-nuclear-enrichment-will-continue-but-open-to-talks\">who said</a> in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News aired Monday that Tehran would never abandon its uranium enrichment programme, but was open to a negotiated solution to its nuclear ambitions, in which it would guarantee that the programme was for peaceful purposes in response for the lifting of sanctions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"israel-sought-to-overthrow-leadership\">Israel sought to ‘overthrow’ leadership</h2>\n<p>Pezeshkian also addressed <a href=\"/news/2025/7/13/iranian-president-lightly-wounded-while-escaping-israeli-attack\">an attempt</a> by Israel to assassinate him at a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council in Tehran on June 15, which was reported to have left him with minor injuries.</p>\n<p>Asked about the assassination attempt, he said it had been part of a plan by Israeli commanders to target Iran’s political leadership in the wake of its assassination of senior military figures, in a bid “to put the country into chaos in order to overthrow it completely”.</p>\n<p>But the plan had failed, he said.</p>\n<p>He also stressed that Tehran’s strikes on Qatar’s Al Udeid base in the wake of US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities had not been an attack on Qatar and its people.</p>\n<p>“We do not even have a thought or imagination that there should be hostility or rivalry between us and the state of Qatar,” he said, adding that he had <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/irans-pezeshkian-expresses-regret-to-the-emir-of-qatar\">called</a> Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the day of the strikes to explain his position.</p>\n<p>“I say clearly and honestly that we did not attack the State of Qatar, but we attacked a base for America that bombed our country while all our intentions towards Qatar and its people are good and positive.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"talks-with-european-powers-to-resume\">Talks with European powers to resume</h2>\n<p>Araghchi said on Monday that Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization is still evaluating how the attacks last month had affected Iran’s enriched material, saying Tehran would soon inform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its findings.</p>\n<p>He said Iran had not stopped cooperation with the IAEA, adding that any request for the IAEA to send inspectors back to Iran would be “carefully considered”.</p>\n<p>IAEA inspectors left Iran earlier this month after Pezeshkian <a href=\"/news/2025/7/2/iran-president-signs-law-suspending-cooperation-with-iaea\">signed a law</a> suspending cooperation with the agency.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/20/iran-to-hold-nuclear-talks-with-3-european-powers-on-friday\">talks are set to take place</a> between Iran, France, Germany and the UK in Turkiye on Friday.</p>\n<p>The three European parties to the former <a href=\"/news/2015/7/14/iran-and-world-powers-clinch-historic-nuclear-deal\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a>, which Tehran signed with several world powers in 2015 before the US pulled out in 2018, have said Tehran’s failure to resume negotiations would lead to international sanctions being reimposed on it.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

However, they now find themselves fighting for their own survival.</p>\n<p>On July 19, Al Jazeera journalists began posting heart-wrenching messages on social media, signalling that their capacity to continue was waning.</p>\n<p>One powerful post by Anas al-Shariff, Al Jazeera Arabic channel correspondent in Gaza, stated, “I haven’t stopped covering for a moment in 21 months, and today, I say it outright … And with indescribable pain. I am drowning in hunger, trembling in exhaustion, and resisting the fainting that follows me every moment … Gaza is dying. And we die with it.”</p>\n<p>As these brave journalists continue to document the harrowing realities in Gaza, they are often overlooked, reduced to mere informants rather than being acknowledged as witnesses to their own stories.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Mostefa Souag, director general of Al Jazeera Media Network, commenting on the plight of journalists in Gaza, stated, “We owe it to the courageous journalists in Gaza to amplify their voices and put an end to the unbearable suffering they are enduring due to forced starvation and targeted killings by Israeli occupation forces.”</p>\n<p>“The journalistic community and the world bear an immense responsibility; it is our duty to raise our voices and mobilise all available means to support our colleagues in this noble profession. If we fail to act now, we risk a future where there may be no one left to tell our stories. Our inaction will be recorded in history as a monumental failure to protect our fellow journalists and a betrayal of the principles that every journalist strives to uphold,” he added.</p>\n<p>Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed five Al Jazeera journalists – Samer Abudaqa, Hamza Dahdouh, Ismail al-Ghoul, Ahmed al-Louh, and Hossam Shabat – and many of the family members of Al Jazeera and other journalists. Yet, these courageous journalists, along with their colleagues, refuse to succumb to the threats and pressure tactics employed by the Israeli authorities to silence them.</p>\n<p>Submission to such intimidation would have resulted in an almost total blackout of coverage of the ongoing genocide, forced starvation, and crimes against humanity inflicted upon the civilian population of Gaza.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera Media Network calls for immediate action by concerned international organisations to bring an end to this forced starvation that does not spare journalists who are the bearers of truth.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Five companies based in China were also included on the EU’s sanctions list.</p>\n<p>China’s Ministry of Commerce said that the sanctions on Chinese banks and companies “seriously harmed” trade and economic ties with the EU and threatened to respond with its own measures against Europe.</p>\n<p>William Yang, a senior analyst for Northeast Asia at the Crisis Group, a Brussels-based nonpartisan think tank, said these issues will cast a shadow over the EU-China summit on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“Beijing considers its relationship with Russia as a core interest amid ongoing competition with the US, and it keeps denying the EU’s criticism that it is an enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With these fundamental contradictions, prospects of any significant breakthrough at the upcoming summit are unlikely.”</p>\n<p><strong>A close but bumpy trade relationship</strong></p>\n<p>Another recent source of tension has been the EU-China economic relationship.</p>\n<p>China is the EU’s third-largest trading partner for goods and services, but EU officials are concerned about their ballooning trade deficit with China, which doubled in value between 2015 and 2024, to reach 305.8 billion euros ($359bn) last year, according to EU trade data.</p>\n<p>The EU and member states have long accused China of engaging in overproduction and “dumping” its cheap state-subsidised exports on the European market, but the issue has heightened recently.</p>\n<p>“The view on the trade and balance in Europe is slightly different from the United States… where it’s basically about who’s going to be number one. This is a dimension that is not present in Europe,” Rudyak said.</p>\n<p>“Europe is really concerned about its core industries, including the automotive. There is a huge concern about Chinese EV overcapacity being dumped on the EU market at prices where European companies cannot compete, and subsidised Chinese overcapacity crowding out European backbone industries,” she continued.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>European automakers have also suffered from Beijing’s recent decision to curb its exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential components in many auto parts and electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>Beijing, for its part, has opened its own investigations into European “dumping”, targeting key products like dairy, brandy and pork.</p>\n<p>Beijing has other frustrations with Europe, even as it tries to reset relations, according to Wang Yi-wei, the director of the EU Research Centre at Renmin University in the Chinese capital.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list for Beijing is the EU’s often conflicting approach to its relationship with the US and China, Wang said.</p>\n<p>“China has at times engaged in wishful thinking, expecting Europe to resist US influence. In reality, however, the EU seeks to balance both resisting American dominance and cooperating with the US, including supporting its efforts to contain China – for example, justifying tariff disputes as addressing ‘Chinese challenges’, rather than questioning US unilateralism,” Wang said in remarks shared with Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>China wants the EU to stop portraying their relationship as one of “competitive cooperation”, and instead see it through the paradigm of “cooperative competition”, he noted.</p>\n<p>With expectations for a breakthrough low, Marta Mucznik, a senior EU analyst at the Crisis Group, said observers hope that the summit will at least open up channels of communication between officials from both sides.</p>\n<p>“The EU doesn’t expect breakthroughs from this summit but sees it as a chance to keep communication channels open with Chinese leaders while it works to carve out its geopolitical role and reduce critical dependencies,” she said.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

During that period, they would also begin negotiations on a permanent end to the war.</p>\n<p>While there has been some minor progress, officials say that Israel and Hamas remain divided on the extent to which Israeli troops would withdraw after any ceasefire takes place.</p>\n<p>Qatar has meanwhile called on the US and the international community to put more pressure on Israel.</p>\n<p>Foreign Ministry official Majed al-Ansari told a conference that “the Israeli government does not view Palestinians as human beings” and that Israel’s reckless behaviour, not only in Gaza, but also with its attacks on Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran, has endangered security in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful [for ceasefire talks], but the parameters remain. If there is no change in the Israeli directive not to have a deal and sabotage any talks, if there is no serious pressure from the international community, particularly the United States, the parameters of the talks will not change,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But we are doing right now is trying to push using the momentum was created by another mediation that we were doing, which is the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to make sure that momentum helps us reach a deal between both sides, and hopefully get us to an end to this terrible chapter in the history of our region,” he added.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

I always say it has to be great for everybody,” he said.</p>\n<p>US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent hailed the deal as a “historic agreement”.</p>\n<p>“I am happy to reaffirm our commitment to deepening this longstanding alliance and building the next chapter of US-Japan cooperation as we enter a new Golden Age under President Trump,” Bessent said on X.</p>\n<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose ruling coalition is reeling from the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/20/japans-far-right-party-makes-electoral-gains-with-anti-globalist-message\">loss of its upper house majority over the weekend</a>, on Wednesday told reporters that he would “carefully examine” the details of the agreement, but he believed it was in the national interest.</p>\n<p>Confirming local media reports, Ishiba said US tariffs on Japanese automobiles would be lowered from 25 percent tariff to 15 percent.</p>\n<p>Trump’s auto tariffs, as well as 50 percent duties on aluminium and steel, had been a major sticking point in the months-long negotiations between Washington and Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Japan’s trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa said the aluminium and steel tariffs were not covered in the deal and would stay in place.</p>\n<p>Japan, which until now has been subject to Trump’s 10 percent baseline tariff as well as the higher levies on autos, steel and aluminium, was facing a 25 percent duty on most exports if Washington and Tokyo did not reach a deal by an August 1 deadline.</p>\n<p>William Chou, deputy director of the Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, said the 15 percent tariff rate was “relatively good news” for Japan.</p>\n<p>Japanese auto stocks soared following Trump’s announcement, with Mazda rising more than 17 percent and Toyota, Nissan and Honda up by between 8.5 and 12 percent on Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225, which tracks the broader stock market, rose nearly 3 percent.</p>\n<p>“Although the specifics remain unclear, both parties called the pact deal a success,” Min Joo Kang, senior economist for South Korea and Japan at ING, said in a note.</p>\n<p>“Trump appears to view it as a massive deal, while Ishiba characterised it in less grandiose terms. Ishiba pointed out that among countries with a trade surplus with the United States, Japan negotiated the lowest tariff rate.”</p>\n<p>While details were sparse, Trump’s announcement is potentially the most significant of his trade deals to be unveiled so far, following preliminary agreements with the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, and a 90-day trade truce with China.</p>\n<p>Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy, is the US’s fifth-largest trading partner.</p>\n<p>The US imported $148.2bn worth of Japanese goods in 2024, while Japan bought $79.7bn worth of US products, according to the US Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>“It’s a sign of the times that markets would cheer 15 percent tariffs,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at US-based Annex Wealth Management.</p>\n<p>“A year ago, that level of tariffs would be shocking.

This is what the Trump administration tried to do. They tried to silence me. But I’m here to say that we will continue to resist.

Nonetheless, politically minded judges refused to allow her to continue in her position, replacing Alina with the First Assistant,” Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1947768353025556950\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p>\n<p>“Accordingly, the First Assistant United States Attorney in New Jersey has just been removed. This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges.”</p>\n<p>Habba’s time as interim US attorney has sparked controversy as yet another example of Trump picking close personal contacts to serve in government roles.</p>\n<p>Habba herself has also been accused of carrying out politically motivated prosecutions while acting as the US lawyer.</p>\n<p>During her four-month tenure, she pursued cases against several Democratic lawmakers, including Newark Mayor <a href=\"/news/2025/5/9/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-arrested-during-ice-detention-centre-protest\">Ras Baraka</a> and US Representative LaMonica McIver.</p>\n<p>Both prosecutions stemmed from an effort by lawmakers to visit and inspect an immigrant detention facility in New Jersey. Trump has made mass deportation a central pillar of his second term, and that, in turn, has stirred fears about the safety and rights of those held in the detention facilities.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"controversial-cases\">Controversial cases</h2>\n<p>In the case of Baraka and McIver, the incident in question took place on May 9 at the Delaney Hall detention centre outside of Newark.</p>\n<p>Baraka, at the time a gubernatorial candidate for the Democratic Party, had repeatedly protested the newly opened facility for allegedly lacking the proper local permits.</p>\n<p>According to Baraka’s defence team, he was invited inside the Delaney Hall gate along with members of the US Congress, who have a right to inspect federal facilities as part of their oversight duties.</p>\n<p>But he was asked to leave, and once he was outside the gate, he was handcuffed and led away. Habba later announced he had been charged with trespassing.</p>\n<p>Within 10 days, however, Habba <a href=\"https://x.com/USAttyHabba/status/1924610971919622210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">walked back</a> those charges “after extensive consideration”.</p>\n<p>In a court hearing to dismiss the case, US Magistrate Judge Andre Espinosa chided a representative from Habba’s office for making a “worrisome misstep”.</p>\n<p>Espinosa told prosecutors that arresting a public figure should not be used as an “investigative tool” and warned that criminal charges carry “significant reputational and personal consequences”.</p>\n<p>Still, at the same time as she dropped the case against Baraka, Habba launched a case against Representative McIver, who had sought to defend the Newark mayor as he was being arrested.</p>\n<p>Habba <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/us-lawmaker-denies-charges-stemming-from-immigration-centre-visit\">sued McIver</a> for physical assault after she allegedly pushed into a federal agent in the tightly packed crowd outside Delaney Hall.</p>\n<p>McIver has denied the charge and accused Habba of attempting to “intimidate” her. Baraka, meanwhile, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/malicious-new-jersey-mayor-ras-baraka-sues-us-attorney-after-arrest\">sued Habba</a> over “malicious prosecution”.</p>\n<p>Habba has also launched investigations into Democratic Governor Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over resistance to working more closely with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"ties-to-trump\">Ties to Trump</h2>\n<p>Before joining the Trump administration as an interim US attorney, Habba served as the president’s personal lawyer.</p>\n<p>She represented him in several civil cases before he returned to the White House in January. In one case, Habba represented Trump in a defamation suit brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his reality television show The Apprentice.</p>\n<p>After Habba threatened a countersuit, Zervos dropped her defamation complaint.</p>\n<p>But she also was part of two high-profile cases that Trump lost: a civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James and a defamation suit brought by writer E Jean Carroll. Trump has appealed both.</p>\n<p>In March, shortly after taking office for a second term, Trump appointed Habba to serve in the Department of Justice as a US attorney, the chief law enforcement officer in a given district.</p>\n<p>But her position was on an interim basis, capped at 120 days. Continuing in the position beyond the interim period required the approval of a judicial panel.</p>\n<p>Still, Trump has signalled that he had hopes to keep Habba in her position. Earlier this month, he submitted a formal nomination to the US Senate for Habba to remain a US attorney.</p>\n<p>But that nomination faces opposition from New Jersey Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim, who question whether Habba is qualified.</p>\n<p>Habba had not worked as a prosecutor until Trump appointed her to the role, and the Senate has yet to act on her nomination.</p>\n<p>Several of Trump’s other nominees to the Department of Justice have faced similar pushback.</p>\n<p>Last week, a US District Court for the Northern District of New York declined to keep interim US attorney John Sarcone in place after his 120-day term neared its end.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, members of the Trump administration were defiant in the face of the setbacks.</p>\n<p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, another former personal lawyer to the president, accused the judges in New Jersey of having “forced out” Habba on political grounds.</p>\n<p>“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law—it was about politics,” Blanche <a href=\"https://x.com/DAGToddBlanche/status/1947768601454514308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media. “This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Israel cut off all goods from entering the territory in March, but has allowed in a trickle of aid starting in May, mostly through the controversial United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).</p>\n<p>According to the UN, Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians seeking food aid since the GHF began its operations, most of them near the group’s distribution points.</p>\n<p>The 81 Palestinians killed on Tuesday include at least 31 aid seekers, according to medics in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Fifteen others were killed in an Israeli attack on a building housing displaced people in northern Gaza City, according to a source at al-Shifa Hospital, while 13 more were killed and 50 others wounded in a strike on the nearby Shati refugee camp, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence.</p>\n<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the Security Council, highlighted the “horror show” for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the enclave.</p>\n<p>“Malnourishment is soaring, starvation is knocking on every door, and now we are seeing the last gasp of a humanitarian system built on humanitarian principles,” he said. “This system is being denied the space to function, denied the space to deliver, denied the safety to save lives.”</p>\n<p>Guterres said that Israel has intensified military operations in Gaza, including by issuing new forced displacement orders in parts of central Deir el-Balah, a city that was considered the last remotely safe area in the Strip.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>According to UN figures, nearly 88 percent of the entire Gaza Strip is now within Israeli militarised zones or under displacement orders, forcing the population into an ever-shrinking space.</p>\n<p>Guterres said the latest order was layering devastation “upon devastation”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"staff-fainting-on-duty\">Staff fainting on duty</h2>\n<p>Doctors in Gaza, meanwhile, said they are seeing increasing numbers of malnourished people arriving at their hospitals.</p>\n<p>Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told reporters that there could be “alarming numbers” of deaths due to starvation.</p>\n<p>Khalil al-Daqran, the spokesperson for Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza, said doctors are not able to help those suffering from malnutrition.</p>\n<p>“Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire.

Symptoms among those going hungry include dehydration and anaemia, he said.</p>\n<p>Healthcare workers and humanitarian staff in Gaza were also reporting fainting on the job because of the hunger and exhaustion, according to officials.</p>\n<p>“No one is spared: caretakers in Gaza are also in need of care,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, wrote on X. “Doctors, nurses, journalists &amp; humanitarians are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger &amp; exhaustion while performing their duties: reporting atrocities or alleviating some of the suffering.”</p>\n<p>Lazzarini went on to say that seeking food in Gaza has become as deadly as the Israeli bombardments and denounced the GHF schemes as “a sadistic death trap”.</p>\n<p>“Snipers open fire randomly on crowds as if they are given a licence to kill.

There is nothing left,” Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the NRC, told Reuters.</p>\n<p>“Hundreds of truckloads have been sitting in warehouses or in Egypt or elsewhere, and costing our Western European donors a lot of money, but they are blocked from coming in,” Egeland said.</p>\n<p>“Israel is not yielding. They just want to paralyse our work,” he added.</p>\n<p>Israel denies targeting civilians and rejects responsibility for the shortages of food in Gaza. The GHF has also rejected what it said were “false and exaggerated statistics” from the UN about the killings at its aid sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assault-on-deir-el-balah\">Assault on Deir el-Balah</h2>\n<p>Humanitarian groups also say that Israel’s military operations in central Deir el-Balah, which is the main hub for aid efforts, have compromised their ability to operate in the Strip.</p>\n<p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the secretary-general of the World Health Organization, said on X that the agency’s staff residence was attacked three times during the Israeli assault, while its main warehouse was damaged.</p>\n<p>Israeli troops entered the residence, forced women and children to evacuate, and handcuffed and stripped male staff and family members.</p>\n<p>Four staff were detained, and one remains in Israeli custody, he said.</p>\n<p>“WHO demands the immediate release of the detained staff and protection of all its staff,” Tedros wrote. “With the main warehouse nonfunctional and the majority of medical supplies in Gaza depleted, WHO is severely constrained in adequately supporting hospitals, emergency medical teams and health partners, already critically short on medicines, fuel, and equipment,” he added.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>While the Israeli military has claimed its operation in the area is now over, Palestinians living there have not been able to return.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said residents were afraid to go back to their homes “as they are in the firing line of heavy artillery”. He said that “quadcopters and surveillance drones also hover over the area, creating an atmosphere of intimidation and fear”.</p>\n<p>Israel’s war on Gaza – which began after the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023 – has killed at least 59,106 Palestinians and wounded 142,511. Most of the victims are women and children.</p>\n<p>The killings and destruction come as ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel remain stalled.</p>\n<p>The two sides have been holding indirect talks in Qatar on a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire, during which Hamas would release more of the Israelis it took captive in the October 7 attacks, while Israel would free Palestinian prisoners and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>\n<p>While there has been some progress, officials say a main sticking point is the redeployment of Israeli troops after any ceasefire takes place.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Hamas called on Arab nations to break their ties with Israel over its “systematic genocide and criminal starvation” in the enclave.</p>\n<p>“We affirm that the official responses and positions do not rise to the level of the catastrophe facing two and a quarter million people. The deafening silence of our nation’s rulers encourages war criminal Netanyahu to pursue his policy of starvation and genocide,” the Palestinian group said.</p>\n<p>“Our people are starving while thousands of aid trucks are piling up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing. We call on Arab and Islamic countries to sever all ties with the fascist occupation entity and expel Zionist ambassadors,” it added.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
