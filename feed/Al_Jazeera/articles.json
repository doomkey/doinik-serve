On Tuesday, the Gates Foundation’s India office posted on X that Gates would attend the summit and “deliver his keynote as scheduled”.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, hours before the scheduled speech, it released a statement saying that “After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr Gates will not be delivering his keynote address.”</p><p>It added that Ankur Vora, president of the Gates Foundation’s Africa and India offices, would deliver the speech instead.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-alleged-links-between-epstein-and-gates\">What are the alleged links between Epstein and Gates?</h2><p>Bill Gates was named in documents related to Epstein released in January by the US Department of Justice.</p><p>In a draft email included among the documents, Epstein alleged Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs and sought his help in procuring drugs “to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls”.</p><p>It was unclear whether Epstein actually sent the email, and Gates denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>The Gates Foundation, in a statement to The New York Times, called the allegations “absolutely absurd and completely false”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-india-s-government-said\">What has India’s government said?</h2><p>Very little.</p><p>Despite criticism and calls from opposition figures to explain the invitation to Gates, the Indian government has not directly addressed the controversy that culminated in Gates’s withdrawal.</p><p>While unnamed government sources told local media he would not attend the summit, officials stopped short of explaining why.</p><p>Asked about Gates’s participation, Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw declined to give a clear answer to reporters, while Modi made no reference to the issue in his public remarks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-are-the-epstein-files-a-sensitive-subject-for-india\">Why are the Epstein files a sensitive subject for India?</h2><p>The controversy surrounding Gates’s planned participation comes close on the heels of a series of disclosures in the Epstein files that have forced the Modi government on the backfoot.</p><p>In one email to an unidentified individual he referred to only as “Jabor Y”, Epstein referred to Modi’s historic visit – the first by an Indian prime minister – to Israel in July 2017.</p><p>Epstein wrote: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago.. IT WORKED. !”</p><p>Modi’s visit to Israel – and his subsequent embrace of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, with military, intelligence and other ties strengthened over the past decade – had already drawn criticism from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause. India was the first non-Arab nation to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, and did not establish full diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992.</p><p>But the Epstein email turbocharged the opposition criticism of Modi’s Israel policy – with questions now also asked about whether it was influenced by Washington.</p><p>The Indian Ministry of External Affairs dismissed the Epstein email in an unusually sharply worded statement.</p><p>“Beyond the fact of the prime minister’s official visit to Israel in July 2017, the rest of the allusions in the email are little more than trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal, which deserve to be dismissed with the utmost contempt,” spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p><p>But the Epstein cloud continues to hover over India.</p><p>The files also show that India’s current oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, exchanged dozens of emails with Epstein after he joined Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014.</p><p>In many of them, Puti appears to be taking Epstein’s help in getting US investors, such as LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, to visit India. In others, he appears to suggest that he had a fairly comfortable personal relationship with Epstein.</p><p>“Please let me know when you are back from your exotic island,” Puri wrote in December 2014, for instance, asking to set up a meeting in which Puri could give Epstein some books to “excite an interest in India”.</p><p>Puri, in a new conference, has claimed that he only met Epstein “three or four times”, but the Congress party has argued that the emails suggest a much closer relationship.</p><h2 id=\"gates-s-work-in-india\">Gates’s work in India</h2><p>The Gates Foundation has long been a key partner in India’s public health and development sectors, backing major vaccination drives, disease prevention campaigns and sanitation programmes.</p><p>At the same time, he has had vocal critics, including environmental activist Vandana Shiva, who has argued that Gates’s brand of “philanthro-imperialism” uses wealth to control global food systems.</p><p>Gates also faced heavy criticism after a 2024 podcast in which he said India was “a kind of laboratory to try things … that then, when you prove them out in India, you can take to other places” when discussing development programmes and the foundation’s work there.</p><h2 id=\"orion-the-robodog-and-other-controversies\">‘Orion’ the robodog and other controversies</h2><p>Beyond the fallout over Bill Gates’s cancelled keynote, the AI Impact Summit has faced several controversies.</p><p>One incident involved a robotic dog named “Orion”, which Galgotias University, based in the New Delhi suburban town of Greater Noida, presented as its own innovation.</p><p>Online users quickly identified the machine as a commercially available Chinese-made model, prompting organisers to ask the institution to vacate its stall.</p><p>The event also drew criticism on its opening day after facing logistical issues, including long queues and confusion over entry procedures, according to local media.</p><p>On Wednesday, large crowds were seen walking for miles after police cordoned off roads for VIP access.</p><p>Dhananjay Yadav, the CEO of a company exhibiting high-tech wearables, made headlines after he reported on social media that devices had been stolen from the company’s stand.</p><p>The Times of India later reported that two maintenance workers at the event had been arrested for allegedly stealing the wearables.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This follows new data released by the Centre for Migration Control, suggesting that 752,000 migrants joined the GP register last year.</p><p>The Centre for Migration Control, a think tank focused on reducing immigration in the United Kingdom, based its claim on Flag-4 GP registrations, a category that counts anyone whose previous address was outside the UK for three months or more – a group that can include returning British residents as well as new arrivals. The figure of 752,000 Flag-4 registrations may seem large, but it accounted for just more than one in 10 of the roughly 6.5 million new GP registrations last year, a share that falls well short of the “unquenchable demand” Reform portrays. While the party continues to blame immigration for GP access pressures, it overlooks a central fact about the NHS workforce: More than 40 percent of doctors currently licensed to practise in the UK qualified overseas, and international graduates now make up the majority of new entrants to the medical register. The system Reform claims is being overwhelmed by migrants is, in reality, heavily sustained by them. Yet rhetoric tying GP shortages solely to migrant patients is becoming more frequent.</p><p>These claims echo across the UK’s wider far right. Tommy Robinson, the anti-Islam activist and former leader of the English Defence League, has repeatedly claimed the NHS is being “swamped by the rest of the world”, framing healthcare as another border to be defended. In this telling, the NHS becomes the last national institution under siege from migration. Yet the NHS is woven into Britain’s sense of itself. Almost every citizen has relied on it at some point in their lives, as it was designed to serve people from cradle to grave, and the emotional attachment to it remains strong despite its present strains. But unlike other parts of British life that politicians routinely blame migrants for reshaping, the NHS has always been intertwined with migration – just not for the reasons now being invoked.</p><p>The NHS was built on migrant labour, something that no politician has quite come to grips with since it was introduced. In 1948, an exodus of British doctors began at the formation of the health service, with many leaving for countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, and Britain increasingly looking to its former colonies for a continued workforce supply. By 1971, about 31 percent of NHS doctors in England were born and qualified overseas. Even Enoch Powell, widely regarded as the chief architect of Britain’s modern anti-immigration movement, called for and supported the recruitment of doctors from abroad during his time as minister of health in the early 1960s. In a 1961 House of Lords debate, Lord Cohen of Birkenhead stated that the “Health Service would have collapsed” had it not been for junior doctors from India and Pakistan. This is without even taking into account the effect of the Windrush generation or Irish migrants, who formed a significant part of the nursing workforce in post-war Britain. This cognitive dissonance was apparent even in recent governments. Take former Home Secretary Priti Patel, under Boris Johnson’s Conservative government, who enforced some of the harshest migration conditions in recent decades, yet also introduced the Health and Care Visa and oversaw a significant increase in the recruitment of overseas healthcare workers during and after the pandemic to meet workforce shortages. Britain knows its health service cannot function without migration, but it never has.</p><p>This is not a new debate. In the 2010s, successive Conservative governments, while overseeing years of austerity and historically low funding growth in the health service, blamed migrants for its woes. The NHS migrant surcharge was introduced in 2015 as the Immigration Health Surcharge, forcing migrants who move to Britain to pay additional costs to use the NHS, despite many also contributing through income tax and national insurance. Currently, the surcharge stands at 1,035 pounds ($1,405) per year per adult, which can easily rack up significantly higher costs for families relocating to Britain. Thus, migrants do pay more to use the National Health Service. So why does Britain continue to blame them for the faltering service time and again?</p><p>The redirection tactic is easier to use than dealing with the complexity of fixing the NHS. The service has become so fragmented that it is almost impossible to work out where exactly the blame should lie internally, or where to begin when trying to fix the numerous problems that lead to poor wait times. Blaming migrants, however, is easy. It is tangible, too. Images regularly circulate on social media of A&amp;E departments filled with brown and Black patients waiting to be seen, with racist captions blaming “foreigners” for the wait – even though they could very easily be British nationals. None of those posts ever considers that close to half of doctors currently practising in the UK qualified overseas. Instead, visible ethnic differences are enough to convince them that immigration is the cause of the NHS’s faults. Politicians jump on this sentiment, and the truth becomes irrelevant.</p><p>Reform, for example, fails to take into account that research from the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government found that areas with more migrants do not experience longer NHS waiting times and, in some cases, even record slightly shorter waits. Migrants are often younger, healthier and therefore less likely to use GP services than Britain’s ageing population. Explaining that to the British public, however, is more complicated than adding it to the ever-growing list of things to blame immigrants for.</p><p>British politics has become encapsulated in two recurring debates – fixing the NHS, and migration. Just as the NHS stokes up emotion in British politics, migration causes a heated conversation. Combining the two creates a political firestorm that Reform believes will lead them to election victory – a tactic which has been used before, when the now infamous Vote Leave bus claimed the NHS would receive money going to the European Union, helping the Vote Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum. It wins voters, even if the figures do not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>This is why, now, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has introduced fast-tracked legislation to prioritise British doctors in training posts over international ones, to “back homegrown talent”, and the Labour government has proposed tightening the social care worker visa route. Britain remains short of doctors, nurses and social care workers, but the last few years have proved a marked ideological shift. No longer is the debate about “good immigrants” who are needed in the NHS – the policy is to deter all migrants, for short-term political gain. Perhaps when Britain releases itself from the idea that it is competing with migrants for care, it will realise that migrants are the care.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

If we find Zaghawa, we will kill them all … We want to eliminate anything Black from Darfur.'”</p><p>It said the alleged violations indicated the RSF intent to destroy the Zaghawa and Fur communities in whole or in part.</p><p>The report also stated that girls and women between the ages of seven and 70, including pregnant women, were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, including whipping, beatings and forced nudity.</p><p>It quoted survivors reporting that “numerous” women were raped and recounting point-blank killings of civilians in homes, streets, open areas or while attempting to flee el-Fasher.</p><p>“They described individuals being gunned down in the streets, trenches and public buildings where they were hiding, while bodies of men, women and children filled the roads,” it stated.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>There was no immediate comment by the RSF, which has previously denied such accusations.</p><p>Sudan descended into conflict nearly three years ago when a rivalry between its army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the commander of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, exploded into an all-out war.</p><p>Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed while millions have been forced from their homes, with both sides accused of war crimes.</p><p>The RSF was formed out of tribal “Janjaweed” militias, which became a notorious state-backed group that was used as a counterrebel force during the Darfur war that began in 2003. About 300,000 people died in combat as well as from famine and disease brought on by the conflict.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel – backed by its principal ally, the United States – has poured billions of dollars into waging its war on Gaza. So, how much does the killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians cost? How much do you need to spend on munitions to commit a genocide? And what is the impact of industrialised mass killing on an economy?</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-has-israel-spent-on-the-gaza-war\">How much money has Israel spent on the Gaza war?</h2><p>The Bank of Israel put the overall economic toll of the war at about 352 billion shekels ($112bn). That total includes roughly 243 billion shekels ($77bn) in direct defence costs, 33 billion shekels ($10.5bn) for the property tax compensation fund, civilian outlays of 57 billion shekels ($18bn) and interest payments of 19 billion shekels ($6bn).</p><p>In early 2025, taking the Gaza war in isolation, Israel’s former chief military economic adviser, Gil Pinchas, estimated that the cost to Israel had been 150 billion shekels ($48bn), running at an average cost of 300 million shekels ($96m) per day. On average, 100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza every day, according to Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).</p><p>“Every item the [Israeli army] uses in combat has a price tag in shekels, detailed in a special, highly specific price book,” Pinchas told journalists, referring to the price paid by the Israeli army, and not Palestinians, for every combat ration, litre of fuel, vehicle, bullet and missile launched against Gaza. “The book is updated constantly, including during the war … We keep our finger on the pulse.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-of-the-war-s-expenditure-was-spent-on-munitions\">How much of the war’s expenditure was spent on munitions?</h2><p>We don’t know for sure.</p><p>Pinchas did say that Israel had spent 340 billion shekels ($108bn) on munitions since the war began, but nowhere near all of that has been used. A significant proportion of that money has also been spent on purchasing arms from Israeli manufacturers, which has helped to offset the wider impact of the war on the Israeli economy.</p><p>Line-by-line details for most military budgets are rarely available. But some insights can be gleaned from Israel’s other wars in the region.</p><p>According to an estimate midway through the war by The Wall Street Journal, Israel’s war on Iran was costing it $200m per day, with the missiles used to intercept Iranian rockets, sometimes reaching 400 a day, estimated at anywhere between $700,000 and $4m each.</p><p>In addition, Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2024/9/18/more-devices-exploding-across-lebanon-whats-happening\">September 2024</a> attack on the Lebanese group Hezbollah’s communication devices, which relied on a plan that had been set into motion years earlier, is reported to have set the Israeli treasury back some one billion shekels ($318m).</p><h2 id=\"what-has-been-the-overall-cost-to-the-wider-israeli-economy\">What has been the overall cost to the wider Israeli economy?</h2><p>Considerable, and much of that is down to manpower.</p><p>Of Israel’s 465,000 military reservists, upwards of 300,000 were deployed to Gaza during the first year of the war. This is in addition to 170,000 active-duty personnel. The cost of maintaining that number of active soldiers, as well as the impact on the wider economy due to the loss of workers called up as reservists, is astronomical.</p><p>According to Israel’s treasury, some 70 billion shekels ($22.3bn) has been spent on its reserve forces alone during the course of the war, while the cost of maintaining its standing army in 2025 was estimated to be 15.37 billion shekels ($4.9bn).</p><p>The Bank of Israel estimates that the cost of one month of service for a military reservist is about 38,000 shekels ($12,100) in lost production.</p><p>With military budgets unlikely to recede in the wake of the genocide and other wars that Israel has engaged in over the past two years, a column in the Israeli liberal daily Haaretz suggested that over the next decade, the cost of the war could run to, at a minimum, 500 billion shekels ($159bn).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-has-israel-s-genocide-cost-the-us\">How much has Israel’s genocide cost the US?</h2><p>More than many US voters might suppose.</p><p>According to Brown University’s 2025 <a href=\"https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/paper/AidToIsrael\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Costs of War report</a>, since October 7, 2023, the US has provided Israel with some $21.7bn in military aid.</p><p>In addition to that, the American taxpayer has funded US operations in support of Israel in Yemen, Iran and the wider Middle East at a cost of $9.65bn to $12.07bn, meaning a total US investment of somewhere between $31.35bn and $33.77bn on Israel’s wars since 2023.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-will-it-cost-to-rebuild-gaza\">How much will it cost to rebuild Gaza?</h2><p>According to the United Nations, rebuilding Gaza – where Israel has destroyed the majority of buildings – would take decades and cost somewhere in the region of $70bn.</p><p>In a report, the UN noted that Israel’s military operations had “significantly undermined every pillar of survival” within the enclave and that the entire population of 2.3 million people faced “extreme, multidimensional impoverishment” – the term for poverty extending beyond financial duress, in areas such as a lack of clean water, proper sanitation and education.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Thursday, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged Polish citizens to leave Iran “immediately … and ⁠do not go to this country ‌under any circumstances”.</p><p>The satellite images offer a rare glimpse of Iranian activities at some of the sites at the centre of tensions with Israel and the US.</p><p>Some 30km (20 miles) southeast of Tehran, the Parchin complex is one of Iran’s most sensitive military sites. Western intelligence has suggested Tehran carried out tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations there more than 20 years ago. Iran has always denied seeking ⁠atomic weapons and says its nuclear programme is purely for civilian purposes.</p><p>Neither US intelligence nor the UN nuclear watchdog found any evidence last year that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons.</p><p>Israel reportedly struck Parchin in October 2024. Satellite imagery taken before and after that attack shows extensive damage to a rectangular building at Parchin, and apparent reconstruction in images from November 6, 2024. Imagery from October 12, 2025, shows development at the site, with the skeleton of a new structure visible and two smaller structures adjacent to it.</p><p>Progress is apparent in imagery from November 14, with what appears to be a metallic roof covering the large structure. By February 16, it cannot be seen at all, hidden by what experts say is a concrete structure.</p><p>The Institute for ‌Science and International Security (ISIS), in a January 22 analysis of satellite imagery, pointed to progress in the construction of a “concrete sarcophagus” around a newly built facility at the site, which it identified as Taleghan 2.</p><p>ISIS founder David Albright wrote on X: “Stalling the negotiations has its benefits: Over the last two to three weeks, Iran has been busy burying the new Taleghan 2 facility … More soil is available and the facility ⁠may soon become a fully unrecognizable bunker, providing significant protection from aerial strikes.”</p><p>The institute also reported in late January that satellite images showed new efforts to bury two tunnel entrances at the Isfahan complex – one of the three ⁠Iranian uranium-enrichment plants bombed by the US in June during the war. By early February, ISIS said all entrances to the tunnel complex were ⁠”completely buried”.</p><p>Other images point to ongoing efforts since February 10 to “harden and defensively ⁠strengthen” two entrances to a tunnel complex under a mountain some 2km (1.2 miles) from Natanz – the site that holds Iran’s other two uranium enrichment plants.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This comes as Washington seeks to negotiate a deal with Tehran on its nuclear programme while threatening military action if talks fail.</p><p>On Tuesday, US and Iranian representatives reached an understanding on main “<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/17/us-and-iran-reach-guiding-principles-in-geneva-nuclear-talks\">guiding principles</a>” during a meeting in Geneva, but felt short of achieving any breakthrough. The meeting in the Swiss city came after a first round of talks in Oman on February 6.</p><p>Reports suggest that Tehran would make detailed proposals in the next two weeks to close gaps. Among the many hurdles in the negotiations is the US push to widen the scope of the deal to include restrictions on Iran’s ballistic arsenal and support for its allies in the region.</p><p>That is fuelled by Israel’s demands and regional narrative, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly pressing US President Donald Trump to shift from nuclear-only parameters.</p><p>Tehran has insisted that these provisions are non-negotiable but that it is open to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>A previous negotiating effort collapsed last year when Israel launched attacks on Iran, triggering the 12-day war that Washington joined in by bombing key Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>As diplomacy forges a path, both parties are ramping up military pressure.</p><p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) held a series of war games on Monday and Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for “potential security and military threats”.</p><p>On Wednesday, Tehran announced new joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman. Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the exercises were aimed at preventing any unilateral action in the region, and enhancing coordination against threats to maritime security, including risks to commercial vessels and oil tankers.</p><p>The US has also escalated its military build-up in the region. Trump has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>The Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/white-house-says-iran-would-be-wise-to-take-deal-amid-military-buildup\">issued new threats against Tehran</a> with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Wednesday that “Iran would be very wise to make a deal” with the US. Trump escalated his rhetoric on social media.</p><p>“Should Iran decide not to make a Deal,” the US may need to use an Indian Ocean airbase in the Chagos Islands, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime”, he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead of aggressive rhetoric, it said it would <a href=\"/features/2025/11/19/cooperation-not-threats-nigeria-wants-us-alliance-to-curb-violent-attacks\">welcome US assistance</a> in dealing with security challenges that have long proved a thorn in the side of successive Nigerian governments.</p><p>Weeks later, on the night of December 25, the US launched what Trump described as “powerful and deadly” <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/26/live-nigeria-confirms-joint-us-strikes-on-isil-targets-in-its-north-west\">strikes</a> in northwest Nigeria but the US military’s Africa Command (AFRICOM) made clear the attacks were carried out “at the request of Nigerian authorities”.</p><p>That cooperation between the US and Nigeria only appears to have grown, culminating this week in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/us-deploys-100-soldiers-to-nigeria-for-training-mission-nigerian-military\">100 US military personnel</a> arriving in the country to help train Nigerian soldiers in the fight against armed groups.</p><p>Nigeria’s Ministry of Defence said US forces will assist with “technical support” and “intelligence sharing”, and despite not playing a direct combat role, will help target and defeat “terrorist organisations”.</p><p>To many, the developments come as a surprise – as in a little over three months, Nigeria appears to have overturned Trump’s “Christian slaughter” claim to instead win US military support for Abuja’s own military goals against armed groups.</p><p>“There’s been a strong shift,” said Ryan Cummings, the director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm. The narrative has “transitioned completely from a slap on the wrist to one where there seems to be a holding of hands in tackling this issue together”.</p><p>Although a notable shift, it is not fully surprising to many analysts, who see Nigeria’s cooperation as a strategic move to de-escalate tensions.</p><p>“It is neither unexpected nor hypocritical,” said Cheta Nwanze, the CEO of Nigerian risk advisory SBM Intelligence, who noted that Nigeria’s longstanding security partnerships since 1999 have favoured Western military doctrines.</p><p>What has shifted, he said, is the “US posture”: Washington now feels more entitled to get involved in a country where it sees strategic interests.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323271\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323271\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323271\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-22T131724Z_1703878274_RC296JAZ7DJY_RTRMADP_3_USA-NIGERIA-SECURITY-1771450457.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nigeria’s National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu and US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Allison Hooker deliver a speech during the inauguration of the Nigeria-US Joint Working Group to boost counterterrorism cooperation at the Office of the National Security Adviser in Abuja, Nigeria, on January 22, 2026 [Marvellous Durowaiye/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"lobbyists-and-working-groups\">Lobbyists and working groups</h2><p>Kabir Adamu, the director of Beacon Security and Intelligence in Abuja, feels the Tinubu administration has been “successful in de-escalating the Trump threat and in establishing a joint working group between the two countries”. But the “challenge”, the risk analyst said, is that Abuja has not been transparent enough about the process.</p><p>“At what cost did [the government] do this?” he asked. “It has so far failed to be transparent in letting Nigerians know what agreement it entered with the US government that led to a de-escalation of the situation.”</p><p>In January, the US and Nigeria convened a <a href=\"https://ng.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-at-the-end-of-the-first-session-of-the-us-nigeria-joint-working-group-to-address-nigerias-country-of-particular-concern-designation/\">joint working group</a> to address Nigeria’s designation as a CPC and how the country can work to reduce violence against vulnerable groups. But outside of that, details of what transpired between the first Trump threats and the first US strikes are scant.</p><p>However, Cummings of Signal Risk points to one deal, in particular, that he believes helped turn the tide: on December 17, the Nigerian government, through a legal intermediary, hired the <a href=\"https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/nigeria-hires-us-lobbyists-for-dollar9-million-to-communicate-its-position-to-the/k6sz113\">DCI Group</a>, Washington, DC-based lobbyists, for a reported sum of $9m.</p><p>According to the terms of the contract published online, DCI would “assist the Nigerian government through Aster Legal in communicating its actions to protect Nigerian Christian communities and maintaining U.S support in countering West African jihadist groups and other destabilizing elements”.</p><p>In hiring DCI, Nigeria has decided to “fight fire with fire”, Cummings said, comparing Abuja’s approach with what <a href=\"/features/2025/5/21/can-ramaphosa-charm-offensive-help-fix-south-africas-ties-with-trumps-us\">South Africa has done</a> in the face of similar false accusations by Trump’s government that a “white genocide” is taking place there.</p><p>In both Nigeria and South Africa, the claims were first spread by local minority lobby groups aided by Republicans and evangelicals in the US, Cummings said. These groups fed selectively framed or exaggerated accounts into the Trump administration.</p><p>Nigeria hired a lobby group “to basically persuade the Trump administration that what is happening in Nigeria and what has been told to the Trump administration by certain lobby groups was not an accurate reflection of the status quo,” Cummings said.</p><p>“And that seemingly has been pivotal in changing the stance of the US government towards Nigeria,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s Africa positions are strongly shaped by a conservative evangelical base in the US, Cummings added, displaying concern for Christians globally and sympathy for white minorities portrayed as supposed victims of Black governments.</p><p>In the sense of playing to his core constituency, Trump’s concerns for these groups are genuine, Cummings said, but in other ways, they are instrumental: Trump uses issues like “Christian persecution” or “white genocide” to pressure other countries on broader foreign‑policy alignment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-10T220656Z_254521550_RC29OIAZU7HR_RTRMADP_3_USA-NIGERIA-TROOP-1771450448.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People read newspapers reporting on US air strikes against Islamic State fighters in Nigeria, in Lagos, on December 26, 2025 [Sodiq Adelakun/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"calculated-trade-off\">‘Calculated trade-off’</h2><p>Pressuring states for geopolitical gains plays out not just in Africa but outside the continent as well, both Nwanze and Adamu pointed out, citing the US’s recent abduction of Nicolas Maduro, the then-president of Venezuela, which, like Nigeria, holds significant oil reserves.</p><p>“Nigeria holds tens of billions of barrels of oil reserves and is Africa’s largest producer. The US National Security Strategy prioritises securing strategic resources through unilateral action”, so to some extent, the US’s recent moves regarding Nigeria are about “asserting control over global energy flows”, Nwanze said.</p><p>“The counterterrorism framing is genuine but convenient because it provides cover for interventions that also serve resource security objectives,” he explained.</p><p>Also citing the example of Venezuela, Adamu said that witnessing the US’s abduction of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-says-hes-a-prisoner-of-war-why-that-matters\">Maduro</a> also likely “made the Nigerian government more disposed to US cooperation”.</p><p>Adamu described Nigeria’s decision to allow the US to intervene as “a calculated trade-off” – one that provides security benefits through US troops and intelligence sharing; and stronger diplomatic ties with a powerful country — while also maintaining Nigeria-led oversight of US operations.</p><p>From Tinubu’s side, cooperation with the US is an “operational necessity”, Nwanze said. “Nigeria’s security forces are overstretched, and US intelligence and air power offer tactical advantages against militant groups.”</p><p>However, Cummings cautioned that while US support may improve Nigeria’s tactical counterterrorism capacity, it “treats the symptoms” and not the socioeconomic conditions at the root of the violence.</p><p>“There hasn’t been enough focus on how America can actually assist the Nigerian government in addressing the causes of these insurgencies, which very much lies in basic economics – creating employment opportunities, ensuring governance and access to public services in these areas are good, and ensuring that you as a country or as a government can make a better deal for local communities than the jihadists can,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-escalation-by-armed-groups\">Risk of escalation by armed groups</h2><p>In fact, a US military presence in Nigeria may actually empower the armed groups, the analysts noted.</p><p>“There is a real risk of escalation,” Nwanze said, noting that recent security data compiled by his firm has shown “an uptick in attacks” since the US’s CPC designation.</p><p>He said armed groups like Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) and the al-Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) “have consistently exploited narratives of foreign intervention to recruit and radicalise”.</p><p>“The December strikes [on Nigeria by the US] provide propaganda material, allowing them to frame local grievances as part of a global war against Western forces,” he added.</p><p>“There is also the risk that militant groups will rebrand themselves as resisting foreign occupation, gaining propaganda advantages that outweigh tactical losses.”</p><p>Adamu said a US presence could motivate armed groups to intensify attacks, especially symbolically. But more than that, “due to the controversy and difference in support between Nigerians for the US presence, it can lead to a further polarisation of Nigeria along religious and ethnic divides”.</p><p>There are “domestic perception risks” for Abuja, he said, noting that previous Nigerian governments had faced public criticism when allowing US presence in Nigeria, and many now feel Tinubu is <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/856429-nigeria-on-the-brink-as-we-handover-sovereignty-to-america-by-jibrin-ibrahim.html\">“handing the country over to US imperialism”</a>.</p><p>The domestic “optics” are a concern, Nwanze agreed. “The perception of compromised sovereignty feeds nationalist resentment and deepens distrust in government,” he said.</p><p>For Cummings, Nigeria was in a tough spot in the face of US aggression, and “on balance, it was a smarter decision by the Tinubu government [to have] greater alignment with the United States”.</p><p>The analyst argues that Nigeria is historically more pro‑West, with economic, political, social and diaspora ties to the US. He says in the absence of alternative partners – like BRICS or other South-South alliances – Abuja’s cooperation and seeming alignment with the Trump administration was the best way to de-escalate this crisis.</p><p>But other analysts like Nwanze are concerned that by choosing to concede to Trump the right to violate Nigerian sovereignty — even with Nigerian oversight — the Tinubu government had left the country exposed to further crises.</p><p>“Adding a US military footprint, however limited, risks deepening instability by broadening the conflict’s ideological scope,” he warned. “The [armed] groups were already motivated; now they have a more compelling story to tell.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

supplies.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

specialized nutritious food to prevent malnutrition,” the UN said in a statement.</p><p>“Dilling and the nearby city of Kadugli have been largely cut off from aid for more than two years, leaving communities with severe shortages of humanitarian assistance,” the UN said.</p><p>The aid delivery came as more than 30 countries issued a statement on Wednesday expressing “grave concern” at a recent “severe escalation” in drone attacks amid “heavy fighting” in the Darfur and Kordofan regions.</p><p>The 28 European Union countries, plus Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, warned that “intentional attacks” against aid workers and “wilfully impeding” relief supplies, “may amount to war crimes”.</p><p>The statement was issued after 28 people were killed and dozens more injured when drone-fired missiles <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/drone-strike-on-busy-market-in-sudan-kills-at-least-28\">hit the al-Safiya market</a> in the town of Sodari in North Kordofan state on Sunday, according

latest killings are yet another reminder of the devastating consequences on civilians of the escalating use of drone warfare in Sudan,” Turk said.</p><p>“They also perpetuate a pattern that we have seen time and again in this conflict of attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure, including markets, health facilities and schools,” he added.</p><p>Turk said that at least 57 civilians had been killed in separate drone attacks on Sunday and Monday in four states across Sudan, including the attack on the market in Sodari, which he said was allegedly carried out by Sudanese Armed Forces

army and the RSF fight over the country’s vital east-west axis, which links the western RSF-held Darfur region, through el-Obeid, to the army-controlled capital, Khartoum, and the rest of Sudan.</p><p>After consolidating its hold on Darfur last year, the RSF has pushed east through the oil and gold-rich Kordofan region in an attempt to seize Sudan’s central

He was questioned for six hours, and a video and transcript are to be released soon.</p><p>In his written statement, Wexner described Epstein as a “conman” and said he had been “naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust” in the convicted sex offender.</p><p>Wexner said he was introduced to Epstein in the mid-1980s and later hired him to manage his vast wealth acquired as the founder of L Brands, which also operated leading brands like The Limited, Express, Bath &amp; Body Works, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wexner said he had “irrevocably cut ties” with Epstein after learning that “he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar” around 2007, a year after the late financier was first arrested for soliciting prostitution from a minor in the state of Florida.</p><p>Wexner said his wife, Abigail, had discovered that “Epstein had stolen vast sums from our family”, and following this revelation, he never spoke to his former adviser again.</p><p>“While others visited Epstein in jail and associated with him after his release, I did not. Nor did I witness, condone, or enable his crimes in any way,” the statement said.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-unconvinced\">Democrats unconvinced</h2><p>Some Democratic lawmakers, however, pushed back on Wexner’s narrative, given their long-running professional relationship.</p><p>“There is no single person that was more involved in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes than Les Wexner,” Representative Robert Garcia, the committee’s ranking Democrat, told reporters outside Wexner’s home.</p><p>“We have also directly heard from survivors about Mr Wexner, his involvement, and their concerns about the enormous amount of money that was transferred over and paid to Mr Epstein. We know of over a billion dollars that was either transferred, provided in stocks, or given directly to Mr Epstein by Wexner,” he said.</p><p>Garcia noted that Wexner appeared to be “unaware” of much of the money given to Epstein and had downplayed their personal ties.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The pair were close enough that at one point Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney, according to the tycoon’s testimony. Wexner also admitted to visiting Epstein’s properties, like his private island, Little Saint James, albeit on one brief occasion while accompanied by his family.</p><p>Wexner also responded to allegations by the late victim Virginia Giuffre, who claimed in court documents that the billionaire was among the men Epstein trafficked her to. Wexner testified to utter devotion to his wife of 33 years, saying he had never once been unfaithful “in any way, shape, or form”.</p><p>Wexner, whose name appears more than 1,000 times in the Epstein files, was investigated by the FBI at least once, according to an email released by the DOJ.</p><p>The email indicates that in August 2019, the month that Epstein died while awaiting trial, the FBI was looking into Wexner as a potential “secondary coconspirator” in his crimes. The FBI said it had been in contact with Wexner’s lawyers, but there “was limited evidence regarding his involvement”.</p><p>Epstein’s death in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell was ruled a suicide.</p><h2 id=\"i-feel-sorry\">‘I feel sorry’</h2><p>In one of the newly released documents, Epstein sent rough notes to himself about Wexner, saying, “never ever, did anything without informing Les” and “I would never give him up”.</p><p>Another document, an apparent draft letter to Wexner, said the two “had ‘gang stuff’ for over 15 years” and were mutually indebted to each other – as Wexner helped make Epstein rich and Epstein helped make Wexner richer.</p><p>A spokesperson for Wexner told The Associated Press news agency that Wexner never received the letter and characterised it as fitting “a pattern of untrue, outlandish, and delusional statements made by Epstein in desperate attempts to perpetuate his lies and justify his misconduct”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wexner did not publicly reveal until after Epstein’s arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 that he had severed their relationship. While he said that happened in 2007, the Justice Department’s newly released records show the two were in touch after that.</p><p>Wexner emailed Epstein on June 26, 2008, after a plea deal was announced that would require him to serve 18 months in a Florida jail on a state charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor to avoid federal prosecution. He wound up serving 13 months.</p><p>“Abigail told me the result. All I can say is I feel sorry. You violated your own number 1 rule always be careful,” Wexner wrote.</p><p>Epstein replied, “no excuse”.</p><p>Wexner’s spokesperson told the AP the 2007 date Wexner cited applied to firing Epstein as financial adviser, revoking his power of attorney and removing his name from Wexner’s bank accounts.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Several regional Middle East powers have joined the board, with Israel becoming a late, and to some, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">disconcerting</a> addition in early February.</p><p>As of Thursday’s meeting, the board still has no Palestinian representation, which many observers see as a major obstacle to finding a lasting path forward.</p><p>“What exactly does Trump want to get out of this meeting?” Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Israel-Palestine programme at the Arab Center Washington DC, questioned.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“I think he wants to be able to say that people are participating, that people believe in his project and in his vision and in his ability to move things forward,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But I don’t think that you’re going to see any major commitments until there are clearer resolutions to the key political questions that so far remain outstanding.”</p><h2 id=\"only-game-in-town\">‘Only game in town’</h2><p>To be sure, the Board of Peace currently remains the “only game in town” for parties interested in bettering the lives of Palestinians in Gaza, Munayyer explained, while simultaneously remaining “extremely and intimately tied to the persona of Donald Trump”.</p><p>That raises serious doubts over the board’s longevity in what is likely to be a decades-long response to the crisis.</p><p>“Regional players that have a serious concern over the future of the region and concern over the genocide have no choice but to really hope that their participation in this Board of Peace allows them to have some leverage and some direction over the future of Gaza in the next several years,” Munayyer said.</p><p>He assessed the greatest opportunity for member states who “understand the challenges and understand the context” would be to focus on “what realistically can be achieved in the time period … to focus on the immediate needs and address them aggressively”. That includes health infrastructure, freedom of movement, making sure that people have shelter, pushing for an end to ceasefire violations, to name a few, he said.</p><p>At least 72,063 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, with 603 killed since the October 11, 2025, “ceasefire” went into effect.

He said it would begin following full disarmament by Hamas and the withdrawal of the Israeli military, both issues that remain unresolved.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-israel\">Pressure on Israel?</h2><p>As the US administration stargazes over sweeping construction plans, it is likely to face a starker reality when it meets with a collection of the 25 countries that have signed on as members, as well as several others that are sending observers to the meeting, according to Annelle Sheline, a research fellow in the Middle East programme at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.</p><p>Any progress to show the board’s “proof of concept” would all-but-surely require asserting unilateral pressure on Israel, she noted.</p><p>“Trump is hoping to have countries back up his claim about the $5bn, to get actual commitments on paper,” Sheline told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is probably going to be challenging, because – especially the Gulf countries – have been very clear that they’re not interested in financing another reconstruction that’s just going to be destroyed again in a few years.”</p><p>Israel’s decision to join the board, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had initially opposed, has <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/why-did-israel-join-trumps-board-of-peace-after-raising-objections\">piqued concerns</a> about further influence over US policy. An act of good faith by the US to advance a more lasting peace could be the inclusion of a Palestinian official on the board, Sheline added.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321616\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Who-is-on-the-Board-of-Peace-FEB15-2026-1771396780.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Who is part of Trump's Board of Peace?\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>She proposed widely popular Palestinian political prisoner <a href=\"/news/2025/12/6/palestinian-groups-express-grave-concerns-over-marwan-barghoutis-safety\">Marwan Barghouti</a>, who is continuing to serve consecutive life sentences in Israel, as a possible candidate. His release, she said, could be an example of an area where Washington could use its leverage to immediate effect.</p><p>In the shorter term, “[interested member states] are largely waiting for the security situation to resolve. Israel violates the ceasefire daily and moves the yellow line”, Sheline said, referring to the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/yellow-line-the-de-facto-israeli-buffer-zone-shaping-life-in-gaza\">demarcation</a> in Gaza behind which Israel’s military was required to withdraw as part of the first phase of the “ceasefire” agreement.</p><p>Indonesia’s government has said it is preparing to commit 1,000 troops to a stabilisation force, which could eventually grow to 8,000. But any deployment would likely remain delayed without better ceasefire guarantees, she said.</p><p>“It’s still an active warzone,” Sheline added. “So it’s very understandable that even Indonesia, which has hypothetically said it would contribute troops to the stabilisation force, is likely going to say we’re not actually going to do that until the situation is stable.”</p><h2 id=\"an-opportunity\">An opportunity?</h2><p>Ensuring an actual ceasefire is enforced – including creating accountability mechanisms for violations – remained “by far the most critical” task for the board’s inaugural meeting, according to Laurie Nathan, the director of the mediation programme at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>Trump’s Board of Peace is “not going to be able to play a meaningful reconstruction role in the absence of stability in Gaza, and stability requires adherence to the ceasefire”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The next key step – and a major development that could come from Thursday’s meeting – would be a commitment of troops, although Nathan noted any deployment would still likely be deadlocked until a voluntary <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">Hamas disarmament</a> agreement is reached.</p><p>On the face of the situation, Trump would appear increasingly incentivised to use Washington’s considerable leverage over Israel to foster a stability in Gaza that the president has closely aligned with his own self-image.</p><p>After all, Trump and his allies have regularly portrayed the US president as the “peacemaker-in-chief”, repeatedly touting his success in conflict resolution, even if facts on the ground <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/12/eight-wars-ended-whats-happened-to-trumps-peace-deals\">undermine</a> the claims. Trump has been vocal in his belief that he should be <a href=\"/opinions/2025/10/16/how-trump-got-his-nobel-peace-prize-after-all\">awarded</a> the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>Still, “Trump’s motivation is multifold,” Nathan explained.</p><p>“Does he care about peace? I think he does. Does he want to be a peace broker? Yes. Does he genuinely want the Nobel Peace Prize? Yes.”</p><p>“On the other hand, he is performative … it’s never quite clear how much of it is serious for him,” he added. “The further problem is that personal interests are always involved when Trump is doing these things.”</p><h2 id=\"wider-ambitions\">Wider ambitions?</h2><p>Both Washington’s Western allies and experts in conflict resolution have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trumps-board-of-peace-an-effort-to-curtail-middle-powers-says-expert\">scrutinised</a> what appears to be the yawning scope of the Board of Peace, far beyond the Gaza purview approved by the UN Security Council last year.</p><p>A widely reported founding “charter” sent to invited countries did not directly reference Gaza as it took digs at pre-existing approaches to peace-building that “foster perpetual dependency and institutionalise crisis rather than leading people beyond it”. Instead, it envisioned a “more nimble and effective international peace-building body”.</p><p>Critics have further questioned Trump’s singular and indefinite role as “chairman” and sole veto-holder, which largely undermines the principles of multilateralism intended to be enshrined in organisations such as the UN. They have argued that the structure fosters a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/rights-advocates-welcome-canadas-exclusion-from-trump-board-of-peace\">transactional approach</a> both in dealings with the US government and Trump as an individual.</p><p>Richard Gowan, the programme director of global issues and institutions at International Crisis Group, said those concerns are unlikely to subside any time soon. Still, he did not see that precluding European countries from supporting the board’s effort if it is able to make meaningful progress.</p><p>“I think, in practical terms, you will see other countries trying to support what the board is doing in the Gaza case, while continuing to keep it at arm’s length over other issues,” he said.</p><p>Thursday’s meeting could indicate the Board of Peace’s dynamic and tone going forward.</p><p>“If Trump uses his authority under the charter to order everyone around, block any proposals he doesn’t like, and run this in a completely personalistic fashion,” Gowan said, “I think even countries that want to make nice with Trump will wonder what they’re getting into.”</p><p>“If Trump shows his mellower side. If he’s actually willing to listen, in particular to the Arab group and what they’re saying about what Gaza needs, if it looks like a genuine conversation in a genuine contact group,” he added, “that won’t erase all the questions about the board’s future, but it will at least suggest that it can be a serious sort of diplomatic framework.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He prays this month will pass peacefully without the horror of warplanes, missiles, and explosions.</p><p>“On a Ramadan night last year, I was lying in my room, facing the street. I heard the roar of a warplane. I was worried but did not panic. I reassured myself: This is a residential area with no military facilities, and it would not be targeted,” Faisal recalled.</p><p>About a minute later, an explosion rocked the area. The aluminium window frames were blown outwards, and shards of glass flew into Faisal’s room.</p><p>“The glass fragments struck parts of my body, including my head and hands. I wiped the blood away with a tissue as I tried to process happened. It was terrifying,” he said.</p><p>Faisal went outside to see exactly where the rocket had hit. “The missile landed in my neighbour’s kitchen. His house is about 20 metres [66 feet] away from my first-floor apartment. That spiritual Ramadan night turned into a moment of terror,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Fortunately, no one was killed or seriously injured. But Faisal’s neighbour’s house sustained damage.</p><p>“People in the neighbourhood rushed to the house. Some said it was an American missile. Others suggested the Houthis launched the missile to intercept the US plane over Sanaa, but it fell on the house accidentally.”</p><p>Faisal said his neighbour had to bear the financial burden of repairing the damage to his house alone.</p><p>“We fasted from food and drink last Ramadan, but not from fear and grief,” Faisal said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peace-vs-solidarity\">Peace vs solidarity</h2><p>In a speech on preparations for Ramadan on February 13, Houthi chief Abdel-Malik al-Houthi said Israel and the US have sought to dominate the Middle East.</p><p>“This is why [the US and Israel] focus on removing [Iran], because they consider it to be at the forefront of the major obstacles that stand in the way of achieving that goal,” he added.</p><p>Such a goal is unacceptable, he said. “This is something that no human being with even a shred of humanity or human dignity left can accept.”</p><p>While the Houthi leader views engaging in the war as a duty, others consider it “unfair” to risk peace in Sanaa for the sake of solidarity with Iran.</p><p>Ammar Ahmed, a law student in Sanaa, keeps abreast of the regional news and views the US-Iran military clash as catastrophic for northern Yemen.</p><p>“The Houthi leadership is defiant, and it will not hesitate to hit American military assets in the region. So, we [civilians in northern Yemen] will again face US strikes,” said Ammar.</p><p>He argued that peace in Yemen should be prioritised over solidarity with Iran.</p><p>“Iran is a powerful country, and it can defend its interests. Even if the Houthis intervened, their missiles or drones would not cripple the US military. They will only bring us trouble,” Ammar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"legitimate-concerns\">Legitimate concerns</h2><p>The future of Yemen’s Houthis is tied to Iran, and civilian worry over what lies ahead during Ramadan and in the months following is legitimate, Abulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“A war against the Houthis in northern Yemen remains an option [for anti-Houthi forces]. This option will be scrapped should the group come to talks and recognise the legitimacy of the UN-recognised Yemeni government,” said Mohammed.</p><p>He indicated that Houthi involvement in any US-Iran military conflict would only accelerate the launch of anti-Houthi operations by Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government in Yemen’s north.</p><p>The Yemeni government has been emboldened by a recent campaign against the separatist Southern Transitional Council, forcing them out of much of southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“The coming military operations against the rebel group, in my view, will not be limited to air strikes. There will be advances by local ground forces, coupled with foreign aerial cover. We witnessed how the separatists collapsed in the north, and the fall of the Houthis in the north is also possible,” Mohammed said.</p><p>The United Nations’s special envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, warned that stabilisation in any part of the country will not be durable if the broader conflict in Yemen is not addressed comprehensively.</p><p>“It is high time to take decisive steps in this regard. Without a wider negotiated political settlement to the conflict, gains will continue to remain vulnerable to reversal,” said Grundberg in a briefing delivered to the UN Security Council on February 12.</p><p>For Sanaa resident Ahmed Abdu, it does not matter who wins any future conflict in the country. His priority is staying safe from the direct consequences of hostilities.</p><p>“During Ramadan last year, I lost my source of income, the motorbike, in an air strike. That loss could be replaced. I only wish a peaceful Ramadan this year and a lasting end to the war,” said Ahmed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
