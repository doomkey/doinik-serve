Here’s what to expect from Trump’s State of the Union.</p><h2 id=\"when-and-where-will-the-speech-be\">When and where will the speech be?</h2><p>Trump will deliver the speech at 9pm local time (02:00 GMT, Wednesday) in front of members of the 100-member Senate and 435-seat House.</p><p>The speech will take place from the podium in the House chamber, with Trump likely flanked by Vice President JD Vance and the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson, as is tradition.</p><p></p><p>Johnson officially “invited” Trump to deliver the speech last month.</p><p>Under the US Constitution, presidents are required from “time to time” to give Congress “information of the State of the Union” and outline the legislative agenda the White House considers to be “necessary and expedient”.</p><h2 id=\"will-focus-be-on-economy\">Will focus be on economy?</h2><p>In 1992, in summing up the top concern for US voters, Democratic strategist James Carville famously quipped: “It’s the economy, stupid.”</p><p>The assessment has proven enduring. Exit polling suggested Trump’s success in the 2024 election was due, in no small part, to voter concerns over the cost of living, with the US economy still experiencing high inflation and soaring prices as knock-ons from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">regularly touted</a> the strength of the US economy, but several metrics have shown a mixed bag: relatively strong performance by Wall Street, steady job numbers, but, as announced last week, slower-than-forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) growth at the end of 2025.</p><p>Trump’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/trump-names-conservative-economist-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency\">move last year to fire</a> Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, baselessly accusing her of producing inaccurate labour statistics, has further stoked concerns over federal government data and reporting on the economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration’s hyperbolic assessments have run up against a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/19/the-us-economy-seems-strong-after-a-year-of-trump-but-is-it-really\">harsh reality</a>: Many US voters have not seen the gains Trump has claimed reflected in their lived experience.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has signalled that he will again send a message that his administration has overcome the country’s “affordability” woes, which he has portrayed as a Democratic bogeyman.</p><p>Public opinion polls indicate otherwise, with a Quinnipiac University poll released in early February showing that just 39 percent of registered voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 56 percent disapprove.</p><p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released in December found approval on the issue sat at about 36 percent, the lowest rating for a president over the question’s six-year history.</p><p>“I have to listen to the ‘fake news’ talking about affordability,” Trump said during a speech in Georgia last week.</p><p>“I’ve won affordability,” he added. “I had to go out and talk about it.”</p><h2 id=\"major-blow-to-trade-policy-but-trump-still-defiant\">Major blow to trade policy, but Trump still defiant</h2><p>Trump’s speech comes after he received one of the most substantial blows yet to his policy agenda, with the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\">Supreme Court rejecting</a> the president’s premise that US trade deficits represented an “emergency” for the country’s national security.</p><p>Trump’s wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs had roiled lawmakers within his own Republican Party, representing a rare area of bipartisan support for checking Trump’s broad interpretation of his executive power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump has made it clear that he will continue to impose tariffs on imports using existing US laws, rather than emergency powers.</p><p>“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs,” the US president wrote in a social media post on Monday. “It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”</p><p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis last week reported that the US <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/19/us-trade-deficit-swells-in-december-as-imports-surge\">trade deficit</a> continued to grow in 2025 despite the administration’s new policies, recording a 2.1 percent increase from 2024.</p><h2 id=\"deportation-drive\">Deportation drive</h2><p>Also closely watched will be how Trump approaches his government’s aggressive policies on immigration, which have seen the administration transform legal immigration, as well as refugee and asylum programmes, while undertaking a no-holds-barred mass deportation drive.</p><p>The first months of Trump’s second term have seen immigration and other federal agents surge to communities across the country, employing what advocates have called a “dragnet” approach, which has increasingly ensnared long-term undocumented residents with no criminal records.</p><p>Critics have further accused the administration of taking increasingly dire measures to meet sky-high immigration detention quotas, sparking outrage and protests among US citizens.</p><p>In January, two US citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration agents in separate incidents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the Trump administration initially offering <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/trump-administration-maga-allies-spread-misinformation-on-pretti-killing\">accounts of the killings</a> that diverged from video evidence.</p><p>Federal authorities have continued to freeze out independent state investigators from the probes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The issue has emerged as an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/trumps-approval-on-immigration-falls-to-record-low-new-poll-finds\">unexpected vulnerability</a> for Republicans heading into the midterms. While stricter immigration enforcement, on its face, maintains wide support among some segments of voters, public opinion polls have shown widespread dismay over the Trump administration’s actions.</p><p>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late January, 53 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump’s handling of immigration, up from 41 percent shortly after he took office. Meanwhile, 58 percent said immigration agents had gone too far. The poll was conducted after Good’s January 7 killing, and bridged the time period before and after Pretti’s January 24 killing.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC poll released in February suggested that 62 percent of Americans felt Trump’s deployments of immigration agents to cities across the country had gone too far.</p><p>Immigration raids have also become a key issue in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/catch-of-the-day-trump-launches-new-ice-immigration-crackdown-in-maine\">states like Maine</a>, where the Trump administration launched, and then backed away from, a major operation earlier this month.</p><p>Maine’s Republican Senator Susan Collins is considered one of the most vulnerable for the party in November.</p><h2 id=\"spectre-of-war\">Spectre of war</h2><p>Then there are the soaring tensions with Iran, which have seen the Trump administration lob repeated threats as it surged the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/iran-says-us-military-build-up-unnecessary-and-unhelpful-deal-achievable\">largest collection of military assets</a> to the Middle East since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>On February 19, Trump said he would take 10 to 15 days to decide whether to strike. It is an uncomfortable juxtaposition for a president who <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/trump-undermined-antiwar-vows-in-first-year-will-democrats-seize-on-this\">came into office decrying</a> decades of US “foreign entanglement”, as well as Washington’s past involvement in foreign regime change and “endless wars”.</p><p>Trump had already launched strikes on Iran in June last year, capping a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon has launched a bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, increased strikes in Somalia, Nigeria and Syria, and killed at least 145 people in strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, in an operation described by rights observers as extrajudicial killings.</p><p>The Trump administration began the year with the extraordinary US military abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a move decried as a flagrant violation of international law and sovereignty.</p><p>Trump is set to speak as a set of US lawmakers has again pledged to introduce a so-called “War Powers resolution” that would rein in Trump’s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval.</p><p>A similar resolution on Venezuela narrowly failed in January, as a handful of Republican holdouts folded.</p><p>Trump also announced last week that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/trump-announces-billions-of-dollars-in-gaza-aid-at-board-of-peace-meeting\">US was committing $10bn</a> to his so-called Board of Peace, a panel meant to focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation in Gaza, for which Trump has envisioned a wider global role.</p><p>But while the president has been pushing to involve US allies in the Middle East in the future of Gaza, his administration’s staunch support for Israel’s right-wing government is causing friction with some Arab countries.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have expressed outrage at US Ambassador <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/us-envoy-huckabee-tries-to-deny-saying-he-would-support-israel-expansionism\">Mike Huckabee</a> over the past few days for suggesting that it would be “fine” for Israel to take over most of the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"democratic-response-and-epstein-guests\">Democratic response and Epstein guests</h2><p>Democrats have tapped Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger to deliver the party’s response to the president’s address, which has become a tradition in the US.</p><p>The choice underscores the narrative Democrats hope to establish going into the midterms: one of stable pragmatism in the face of Trump’s policies of upheaval.</p><p>The selection of Spanberger, a former member of Congress and CIA agent, steers away from the more progressive flank of the party, embodied in figures like New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>Spanberger, who has faced criticism from progressives for her past support of Israel and stances on law enforcement, won her race against incumbent Governor Glenn Youngkin last year by a resounding 15 points, energising beliefs that her brand of affordability-focused politics can make inroads against vulnerable Republicans.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The governor has said she will address “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.</p><p>At least 12 Democrats, meanwhile, have said they will boycott Trump’s State of the Union and instead attend a counter-programming event on the National Mall, hosted by the progressive MoveOn and MeidasTouch groups.</p><p>“These aren’t normal times and showing up for this speech puts a veneer of legitimacy on the corruption and lawlessness that has defined his second term,” US Senator Chris Murphy, who is among those boycotting, said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives Jamie Raskin and Suhas Subramanyam have announced they will attend Trump’s address with family members of Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>It comes as Democrats continue to heap <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/ex-prince-andrews-arrest-spurs-epstein-accountability-calls-from-uk-to-us\">pressure on the administration</a> for accountability related to the sex trafficking ring that the financier, who was found dead by apparent suicide in 2019, was criminally charged with running.</p><h2 id=\"get-ready-to-weave\">Get ready to ‘weave’</h2><p>As with any of Trump’s public events, expect the unexpected.</p><p>The US president rarely stays on script, instead dipping into tangents, meandering stories, and lengthy exposition on personal and political vendettas.</p><p>During his 2024 presidential campaign, as Trump’s ubiquitous stump speeches often dragged on late into the night, he dubbed his rhetorical style “the weave”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Caine sees the stakes of a major operation in Iran as higher, with a greater risk for entanglement and American casualties,” Axios reported, citing two sources privy to high-level meetings in the US administration.</p><p>Trump hit back on his social media platform against what he called “fake news media” and reports that “General Daniel Caine… is against us going to War with Iran”.</p><p>“He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about. He only knows one thing: how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack,” Trump said.</p><p>“Everything that has been written about a potential War with Iran has been written incorrectly, and purposefully so,” the president said.</p><p>Trump has been mulling an attack on Iran for weeks, concentrating an enormous array of US forces in the Middle East in preparation for a possible war that could spread chaos and conflict across the region.</p><p>Iran offers little discernible threat to the US, and an unprovoked attack would likely violate international law.</p><p>Iran has expressed hope that negotiations can bear fruit, but it has rejected what it says are a series of maximalist US demands on issues such as nuclear enrichment, ballistic missiles, and support for regional proxies.</p><p>Analysts have noted that many of Washington’s demands on Tehran align with Israeli priorities.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Russian oil to Slovakia, making good on <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat\">an ultimatum</a> he issued to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>Fico’s announcement on Monday came two days after he warned Zelenskyy on social media that he would ask state-owned company SEPS to halt emergency supplies of electricity if flows of Russian crude oil via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline crossing Ukraine did not resume.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“As of today, if the Ukrainian side turns to Slovakia with a request for assistance in stabilising the Ukrainian energy grid, such assistance will not be provided,” Fico said in a video on his Facebook page.</p><p>Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement that it had not been officially informed yet, but that it would “not affect the situation in the unified power system of Ukraine”.</p><p>“The last time Ukraine requested emergency assistance from Slovakia was over a month ago and in a very limited volume,” it said.</p><p>Fico said the stoppage would be lifted “as soon as the transit of oil to Slovakia is restored”.</p><p>“Otherwise, we will take further reciprocal steps,” he said, adding his country would also reconsider “its previously constructive positions on Ukraine’s EU membership”.</p><p>He said the stalled oil supply was a “purely political decision aimed at blackmailing Slovakia over its international positions on the war in Ukraine”.</p><p>Slovakia and neighbouring Hungary, which have both remained dependent on Russian oil since the Kremlin launched its <a href=\"/features/2026/2/20/ukraines-patience-with-us-peace-push-wears-thin-as-russia-skirts-pressure\">invasion of Ukraine</a> almost four years ago, have become increasingly vocal in demanding that Kyiv resume deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline, which was shut down after what Ukraine said was a Russian drone strike hit infrastructure in late January.</p><p>Ukraine says it is fixing the damage on the pipeline, which still carries Russian oil over Ukrainian territory to Europe, as fast as it can.</p><p>Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage and have declared emergencies over the cut in oil deliveries.</p><p>The EU imposed a ban on most oil imports from Russia in 2022, but the Druzhba pipeline was exempted to give landlocked Central European countries time to find alternative oil supplies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union failed to agree on new sanctions on Russia for the fourth anniversary of Europe’s biggest war since World War II, after Hungary vetoed the move.</p><p>Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban – the friendliest EU leader to the Kremlin – is stalling the sanctions and a 90-billion-euro ($106bn) EU loan to Ukraine until Kyiv reopens the oil pipeline.</p><p>Fico also said he has refused to “involve the Slovak Republic” in the latest EU loan due to Zelenskyy’s “unacceptable behaviour”, alluding to Ukraine’s earlier halting of <a href=\"/news/2025/1/1/russian-gas-flow-to-europe-via-ukraine-stopped-who-does-it-hurt\">Russian gas</a> supplies after a five-year-old transit agreement expired on January 1, 2025, which Fico claimed is costing Slovakia “damages of 500 million [euros; $590m] per year”.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia have accounted for 68 percent of Ukraine’s imported power this month, according to Kyiv-based consultancy ExPro. It was not immediately clear if emergency electricity supplies were included in that figure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago! They were also just reaffirmed by the ridiculous and poorly crafted supreme court decision!” Trump said in the post.</p><p>Trump does have some authority to impose other tariffs, but they are much more limited.</p><p>Following the court’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6–3 decision</a> on Friday, the president said he would introduce a 10 percent tariff, raising it to 15 percent by Saturday under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, the maximum limit under the statute that enables the White House to impose tariffs for 150 days.</p><p>The statute only requires a presidential declaration and does not require further investigation. Section 122 is only temporary; the tariffs would then expire unless Congress extends them.</p><p>Trump’s tariffs are overwhelmingly unpopular. A new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"looming-uncertainty\">Looming uncertainty</h2><p>Experts warn that Trump’s newly imposed tariffs will fuel further economic uncertainty.</p><p>“What we do know is that it would continue to require all those parties affected to continue to live in uncertainty and, as many have already pointed out, such uncertainty is not good for our economy and has negative impacts on American consumers,” Max Kulyk, partner and CEO of Chicory Wealth, a private wealth advisory firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s impossible to plan. You hear that tariffs are off, and you are considering how to get refunds. Then a few hours later, it’s 10 percent. Then it’s 15 percent the next day…. Not having that stable framework is hurtful for activity, hiring, investment,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Gold, which is considered a safe investment in times of economic uncertainty, surged by 2 percent on Monday, hitting a three-week high as tariff pressures remain unclear.</p><p>US markets are also taking a hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 1.1 percent in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 is also down by 1 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by 1.5 percent since the market opened on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"stalling-trade-deals\">Stalling trade deals</h2><p>Trump’s erratic approach has also deterred movement on looming trade deals.</p><p>On Monday, the European Parliament opted to postpone voting on a trade deal with the US. It is the second time the bloc has pushed back the vote. The first was in protest against Trump’s unsolicited attempts to acquire Greenland.</p><p>The assembly had been considering removing several European Union import duties on US goods. Committee chair Bernd Lange said the new temporary US tariff could mean increased levies for some EU exports, and no one knew what would happen after they expire in 150 days. EU lawmakers will reconvene on March 4 to assess if the US has clarified the situation and confirmed its commitment to last year’s deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

trafficking leaders, prompting a series of violent outbursts by cartels across the country.</p><p>Speaking alongside Sheinbaum during a press conference on Monday, Security Secretary Omar Garcia

another,” an anonymous resident of the town of Aguililla in Michoacan told the news service AFP, saying that cartel gunmen attacked a local outpost of soldiers on Sunday. “But they couldn’t advance

deployed there, and Sheinbaum said that all of the more than 250 roadblocks erected across 20 states in response to the raid have been removed.</p><p>Mexican officials have sought to downplay the prospect of long-term disruptions stemming from the raid, with Sheinbaum saying that flights to and from Puerto Vallarta, located in the state of Jalisco, are expected to resume on Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>“In Puerto Vallarta, flights continue to be disrupted due to availability of flight crews. The Embassy is in close contact with airlines to monitor their plans,” the US Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs said in a social media post on Monday. “All other airports in Mexico are open, and most airports are operating normally. If you are traveling via any airport other than Guadalajara or Puerto Vallarta, we have received no indication of any security-related flight disruptions.”</p><p>The Mexican Embassy to the US has shared social media posts debunking online rumours of attacks on civilians at Guadalajara airport and US tourists being held hostage.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Anger in Lebanon had boiled after decades of economic and political mismanagement by the government. Then, as the country’s economy started collapsing, the government tried to implement a series of taxes, including on WhatsApp calls.</p><p>The response was widespread protests that collapsed the government, led at the time by then-Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. But they failed to dislodge the wider sectarian system that many activists and experts say plagues Lebanon and prevents reform.</p><p>Last week’s protests were on a far smaller scale than 2019, however.</p><p>Then, protesters forced the government to walk back the taxes. But Salam, the prime minister, defended the tax hike on Friday. The government’s argument is that the taxes are necessary to pay salaries and pensions for state employees and retirees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We had to find a quick source to fund the raises,” he said. “These are exceptional measures… but the government wants to reform the tax system, not just impose new taxes.”</p><p>Salam also said that his government inherited a “very difficult” financial situation and promised that he would rebuild trust between the state and the people by working to establish a fair tax system.</p><p>Lebanon’s Finance Minister Yassine Jaber said the fuel price increase would take effect immediately, but that VAT increases would need parliament’s approval.</p><p>“More than 50 per cent of the budget today is allocated to salaries, and it was necessary to take steps to secure the funds,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"vat-is-a-regressive-tax\">VAT is a regressive tax</h2><p>But not everyone agreed with the decision, including some ministers themselves. The right-wing Lebanese Forces bloc – which is part of the government coalition – voiced objection to the tax increase, calling for a study of the impacts.</p><p>Analysts, meanwhile, were heavily critical of the tax increase. They said that the rise of petrol prices and VAT would punish the country’s most vulnerable and would further widen the gap between rich and poor in Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The people who are most affected by value-added taxes are usually the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable, given the type of their consumption, which is mostly filled of the goods and the services that are affected by taxation, and whereby the proportion of the taxation is significant,” Farah al-Shami, senior fellow and programme director for Social Protection at the Arab Reform Initiative, told Al Jazeera. “VAT is by nature the most regressive type of taxation. Studies have shown that it affects the full supply chain, meaning everything that goes into the production, for example, of a certain good is affected.”</p><p>A price increase at every step of the supply chain means that prices compound to end up being more expensive for consumers.</p><p>In 2019, decades of government mismanagement of the economy ended in the collapse of the banking sector and the depreciation of the Lebanese pound by over 90 percent. Before 2019, $1 was equivalent to 1,500 Lebanese pounds, whereas now $1 is valued at nearly 89,500 Lebanese pounds.</p><p>Many lost their life savings with the currency freefall.

Capital gains on property are minimal. Wealth held in land and assets is effectively sheltered. Similarly, luxury goods face no meaningful additional burden.”</p><p>Fouad Debs, a lawyer and member of the Depositors Union, a group founded after the 2019 banking crisis to protect the rights of depositors, said the decision went against the government’s stated goals of reform.</p><p>“All of this is to keep the [current] system intact and save the banks, instead of having them also pay the taxes that they should pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If it wasn’t Turkiye, it would be Iraq. If it wasn’t Iraq, it would be Hezbollah. If it wasn’t Hezbollah, it would be the Muslim Brotherhood. It doesn’t matter who. There just always needs to be a threat.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"worsening-relations\">Worsening relations</h2><p>Israel has existed in a heightened state of war since the attack led by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Since then, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza, invaded Lebanon, bombed Yemen, occupied parts of Syria, launched a war against regional power Iran, and most recently defied global opinion and international law by moving closer to annexing territory in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Against this background, analysts explained, talk of more threats – such as the one from Turkiye – and fresh alliances are cast from the same mould. Despite being political opponents, Netanyahu and Bennett are both right-wing Israelis who are completely opposed to a Palestinian state, and who share similar beliefs on pushing for Israeli regional hegemony.</p><p>“This has always been what Naftali Bennett has been about,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said.</p><p>“Liberal [Israelis] have been projecting their own hopes onto him for years, simply because he was an opponent of Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s to miss the point,” he said, referencing both men’s apparent contempt for Palestinians. “He isn’t even pretending now. He’s just trying to overtake Netanyahu on his right.”</p><p>But a focus on Turkiye as a threat is both complicated – the two countries have a decades-long relationship, and Turkiye is a member of NATO – while also an understandable objective for an Israeli right keen to ensure that a new bogeyman exists.</p><p>While Israel has had an antagonistic relationship with Iran since the latter’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Israel-Turkiye relations have been more pragmatic, with Israel’s continued repression of Palestinians historically often a point of negotiated dispute, rather than open threats spurring aggressively hostile rhetoric.</p><p>However, since coming to power in the early 2000s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been increasingly critical of Israel.</p><p>Israel’s attack on a flotilla travelling to Gaza in 2010, ultimately killing 10 Turkish activists, was one of the defining moments in the relationship’s downturn, with fierce political rhetoric and diplomatic downgrades following.</p><p>Subsequent Israeli military operations in Gaza and Syria have further fuelled public and government anger in Turkiye, with Ankara adopting an increasingly confrontational stance to Israel’s genocide and territorial ambitions, leaving bilateral ties strained and the suggestion of Turkiye’s involvement in Gaza’s proposed interim security force politically toxic in Israel.</p><p>But beyond their clear opposition to Israel, comparisons between Ankara and Tehran border upon the ludicrous, analysts said.</p><p>“Israel has worked alongside Turkiye numerous times,” said Pinkas. “It wasn’t all that long ago that policymakers in Israel talked of the Middle East being overseen by two superpowers, Israel and Turkiye, in opposition to Iran. And now they’re trying to supplant Iran with Turkiye? What are they talking about, armed conflict? Turkiye is a NATO power.”</p><p>Pinkas noted further points of difference. “Has the leadership in Turkiye ever denied Israel’s right to exist, or threatened to wipe it from the map?” he asked.</p><p>“No,” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hexagonal-alliances\">Hexagonal alliances</h2><p>While the alliance with the US is ultimately Israel’s biggest protection, it has also sought to broaden its network.</p><p>At the forefront of this, Netanyahu explained, would be the support of India’s Modi and what he described as a “hexagon” of allied states, including India, the aforementioned Greece and Cyprus, and various unspecified Arab, African, and Asian nations.</p><p>“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu said, without specifying the “radical” states he was referring to.</p><p>Netanyahu stressed that his proposed new hexagon of alliances was intended to complement, rather than replace, Israel’s typical reliance on the US. But <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">some believe</a> – as support for Israel is becoming more politically toxic in the US – that Tel Aviv now needs to hedge its bets.</p><p>Political analyst Goldberg called the moves by Netanyahu “desperate”.</p><p>“All of this because we’ve burnt through past alliances with Russia and now the United States, so we’re [now] claiming that India will be leading this hexagon of ‘moderate states’,” Goldberg said. “Not even people in Israel, not even the most deluded, have any belief that Israel might still be a moderate state.”</p><p>And the talk of the Turkish threat and hexagonal alliances was evidence that Israel is not as central to decision-making on any US attack on Iran, said Yossi Mekelberg, an expert with Chatham House.</p><p>“It’s all deflection; there just isn’t any honesty, and it just gets worse and worse,” Mekelberg said of Netanyahu’s framing of events. “The big issue is Iran. [That is] what they’re interested in. Turkiye is just so much noise.”</p><p>While the intention may be to distract by talking up the Turkish threat, it still carries risks, Mekelberg cautioned.</p><p>“Most leaders, at least the devious ones, can separate rhetoric and reality, so there’s no real chance of one spilling over into the other,” he said. “The risk is that as Israel ramps up its rhetoric against Turkiye, it risks making it a genuine opponent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

currency revenues yielded from selling the country’s vast oil resources, something that has worsened an ailing economy marked by rampant inflation and a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">depreciating national currency</a>.</p><p class=\"s7\">In an interview in mid-February that has since captured much attention in local media, a senior former oil executive described a major shift in how Iran’s oil money was handled as hopes faded for resurrecting the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires\">2015 nuclear deal</a> with world powers and lifting sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">Ali Akbar Pour Ebrahim, a former CEO of Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO), the arm of the Ministry of Petroleum that sells most of Iran’s crude oil, told the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) the ministry has lost its agency in handling the funds.</p><p class=\"s7\">He explained that during the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani – when US President Donald Trump started his “maximum pressure” sanctions in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the nuclear accord – the ministry directly handled oil proceeds, but it was sidelined during the administration of his successor <a href=\"/news/2024/5/20/who-is-irans-president-ebrahim-raisi\">President Ebrahim Raisi</a>.</p><p class=\"s7\">“They forced the Petroleum Ministry to shut down its own trustees and created bank trustees who operated under the purview of the country’s commercial banks, which operated under the Central Bank,” Pour Ebrahim said without identifying the people and entities responsible.</p><p class=\"s7\">The official, who is now a banking and investment executive, said “we knew from the start” the trustees would take the money for themselves, adding that as much as $11bn was not returned after being handled by them.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to Pour Ebrahim, the trustees “mushroomed” after taking the money and using nationals from neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan to open bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates and funnel the funds through shell companies.</p><p class=\"s7\">He said Raisi was following up on the issue before his death in a 2024 <a href=\"/news/2024/9/1/iran-probe-finds-bad-weather-caused-ex-president-raisis-helicopter-crash\">helicopter crash</a> and President Masoud Pezeshkian was also informed and ordered a review but no thorough investigation has been conducted.</p><p class=\"s8\">“Through the country’s oil money, these people became Rolls-Royce owners in the UAE overnight and are now living in penthouses of expensive hotels there,” Pour Ebrahim said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s7\">Hossein Samsami, a member of the parliament’s economic commission, confirmed to state-affiliated media that some of the agent banks have been colluding with the trustees to declare receipt of oil money to the Central Bank even when no funds were deposited.</p><p class=\"s7\">Mahmood Khaghani, a career oil official who formerly led the Caspian and Central Asia department of the Petroleum Ministry, was quoted as saying by state media on Saturday that if an independent audit is allowed, it would emerge that the misappropriated money amounts to much more than $11bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">He said the trustee-based system was originally created about two decades ago when a “shadow government” emerged as international pressure grew over <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/netanyahu-calls-for-dismantling-irans-nuclear-programme-in-any-us-deal\">Iran’s nuclear programme</a>, leading to the country eventually being hit with United Nations sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to the official, experts were sidelined at the Petroleum Ministry and other bodies in favour of actors affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected state bodies.</p><p class=\"s7\">“In effect, a number of people in the parliament, judiciary, government, and security and intelligence apparatuses entered oil deals,” Khaghani said. “This did not remain limited to selling oil. … The mafia is not active exclusively in oil but everywhere.”</p><h2 id=\"food-importers-become-oil-traders\" class=\"s3\">Food importers become oil traders</h2><p class=\"s7\">A Tehran-based oil expert, who spoke with Al Jazeera on background, said the nontransparent trustee model only begets corruption as

could have played a crucial role in bringing some stability to the country’s currency markets and reducing</span><a

plans to increase its reliance on the so-called trustees as authorities put in place contingencies for war.</p><p class=\"s7\">Agriculture Minister Gholamreza Nouri Ghezeljeh announced this month that importers of essential goods, including food, will now be officially given oil to sell and will be allowed to barter the oil for food.</p><p class=\"s7\">“From next year [starting in late March], it has been decreed that importers of essential goods will be introduced by the agriculture ministry to the Petroleum Ministry so they can get oil shipments,” he said, adding that the new trustees will be able to barter up to $1.5bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">This comes weeks after the Pezeshkian administration launched an initiative to eliminate a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\">preferential currency exchange rate</a> for imports of essential goods, based on the rationale it was breeding corruption.</p><p class=\"s7\">With the new scheme by the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad, the same importers who had their profits slashed with the elimination of the cheaper currency rate will now benefit on a new level after becoming oil trustees.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to state-affiliated media, the Mostazafan Foundation of Islamic Revolution could be among the new recipients of Iranian oil, but the head of the top <a href=\"/news/2018/10/16/us-sanctions-network-supporting-irans-basij-resistance-force\">state-run bonyad</a>, or charitable trust, said last week it has received no shipments so far.</p><p class=\"s7\">In late January, Pezeshkian convened the governors of Iran’s border provinces and announced on state television he is <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/iran-delegates-import-powers-as-us-war-threats-keep-economy-unstable\">delegating some authority</a> to them.</p><p class=\"s7\">The empowered governors may import “all goods that are directly linked with the livelihoods of the people and the needs of the market” in case of war, including importing without using foreign currency, bartering and allowing sailors to bring in products under simplified customs rules.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195928\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195928\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\"

So if we purchase a nonsanctioned ship costing $70m that can work for us for a year, it is undoubtedly worth it, and we can take care so it does not enter the sanctions list for a year,” he said.</p><p class=\"s7\">Iranian authorities have not publicly commented on the claim about the vessels but maintain oil sales remain strong despite Washington’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/us-slaps-new-sanctions-on-individuals-and-firms-that-help-iran-sell-its-oil\">stated efforts to drive them to zero</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has been increasingly focusing on intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil, also pressuring China through sanctions and threats to stop oil purchases from Iran, which has in turn threatened to shut down the strategic Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For many years, the global “rules-based order” was presented as a benign system of global governance established by the West. True, its origins went back to the colonial world and many of its systems reflected colonial racial inequalities, but it was held up as the harbinger of global prosperity and order. In it, the West had magically transformed from a colonial villain to a saviour.</p><p>But for much of the Global South, the era looked very different. It was experienced as genocide, plunder and displacement. Across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, colonial administrations disrupted and suppressed local systems and industries, engineered cash-crop economies vulnerable to global price shocks, and redrew political authority to prioritise imperial control.</p><p>Eventually, demands grew for a more accurate accounting of the catastrophe the West inflicted on the rest, for acknowledgment of its historic crimes from extermination to enslavement, and for recompense. That coincided with a reordering of global power that left the West increasingly unsure of itself – no longer the saviours of us, the good guys of history they had long pretended to be.</p><p>There was some mealy-mouthed acknowledgment of this. In Kenya’s case, revelations of the existence of British torture camps during the 1950s fight for independence produced expressions of regret without apology from the British government, and penny-pinching compensation.</p><p>Similarly, Germany accepted that it committed a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in Namibia in the first decade of the 20th century, but continues to refuse to pay any compensation, instead offering $1.3bn to be paid through aid programmes out over 30 years as “a gesture of reconciliation”.</p><p>These were just crumbs, but marked an important turning point. Movements around the world from Black Lives Matter in the United States to Rhodes Must Fall in South Africa pushed to reconstruct historical narratives about white supremacy and Western domination. Critical anti-colonial thought and discourse spilled from academia into popular culture.</p><p>But the backlash came soon enough. In some quarters, there was outright rejection of “white guilt”, which was picked up by politicians and included in political campaigns. Colonial revisionism proved popular and electable. It has also quickly made it to international forums.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent speech at the Munich Security Conference is a case in point. He spoke of the pre-1945 imperial order with praise. For him, it was a time when “the West had been expanding – its missionaries, its pilgrims, its soldiers, its explorers pouring out from its shores to cross oceans, settle new continents, build vast empires extending out across the globe.”</p><p>Rubio framed Western dominance as an era of prosperity and moral leadership, arguing that the West should not be ashamed of its past. Colonialism, in this telling, was not racial hierarchy and extraction but stewardship, order, and civilisation. Its decline, implicitly, is something to regret.</p><p>What Rubio and the likes of him are calling for is for the West to fully embrace its role as the villain. Not rhetorically, of course – bad guys rarely proclaim themselves as such – but practically, by rehabilitating empire and abandoning guilt and shame for historical wrongs. They see historical reckoning as weakness, even self-hatred. And rather than address the wrongs of the past, they propose to use power to suppress remembrance.</p><p>This is a clear attempt at redemption through the conquest of memory. This is not about merely debating the past. It is about shaping the moral vocabulary of the present. It is also about moving away from the current “rules-based order” and towards a reality where there are no rules for “might makes right”.</p><p>If empire is benevolent, then contemporary hierarchies can be reframed as responsible leadership. Unequal trade regimes become stability. Military pressure becomes guardianship. Interventions become stewardship. Colonialism, as we have seen in the case of US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Board of Peace”, is rebranded not as domination, but as necessary order and a prelude to prosperity. Multipolarity is framed not as structural adjustment, but as destabilising decline.</p><p>This is politically useful in a moment when Western dominance faces challenges from rising powers and shifting alliances. Nostalgia for uncontested supremacy offers clarity and replaces discomfort with pride. It transforms demands for justice into accusations of ingratitude. And its grammar mirrors the familiar pattern. Empire harms but ultimately saves. It errs but redeems itself. Its centrality remains unquestioned.</p><p>There is no need for structural reckoning or restitution. The focus shifts from the material consequences of colonial rule to the emotional burden of Western shame. The story becomes about restoring confidence rather than confronting inequality.</p><p>Rubio’s speech was meant for a Western audience, but for the rest of us, it should set off alarm bells. It is tempting to treat such rhetoric as the moral failing of a few bad men – easily caricatured and just as easily ignored. That would be a grave error.</p><p>We must recognise that they are reconstituting the architecture of colonialism: a legal, economic and epistemic system designed to privilege Western interests, its oppression codified in law, its dictates enforced through coercion, and its benefits distributed along racial lines.</p><p>Thus, the rehabilitation of empire is not nostalgia. It is preparation. It is the construction of a moral framework in which the hierarchies of the present need no justification because the hierarchies of the past have been absolved. And while the past cannot be undone, it can be misremembered.</p><p>We have been living with the terrible consequences of doing so in our economies, within our borders and in our bodies, and just as we start to discard the scales from our eyes, there is an attempt to blind us again. We must not acquiesce to the revisionism, but rather actively resist it by speaking our truth, insistently and without apology, until it cannot be drowned out.</p><p>Memory is not passive. It is a choice made every day, and the choice belongs to us as much as to anyone.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In his view, Mexico’s government had simply been “doing its job” in the “<a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">war on drugs</a>” by eliminating El Mencho, and the US had nothing substantial to do with it.</p><p>Indeed, much like her predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum has perfected the art of doing the gringos’ dirty work while purporting to act in a “<a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">sovereign</a>” fashion – and even to defy the imperial overlords to the north.</p><p>Granted, she does not have a whole lot of room to manoeuvre given the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">recent kidnapping</a> by the US of Venezuelan head of state Nicolas Maduro – and the fact that Trump has made it known that he is beholden to no law, whether domestic or international.</p><p>But while Sheinbaum may have seen no choice but to temporarily placate the Americans and satisfy Trump’s need for blood, Mexicans will pay a heavy price.</p><p>A brief review of contemporary Mexican history confirms as much. No sooner did then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon launch his “drug war” under US guidance in 2006 than homicides and enforced disappearances <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/28/in-mexico-enforced-disappearance-is-a-way-of-life\">skyrocketed</a> in the country.</p><p>Well over half a million people have since been killed and disappeared, many of them victims of militarised agents of the state who often operate in cahoots with organised crime.</p><p>Nary a dent has been put in the northward flow of drugs while the southward flow of <a href=\"/opinions/2022/2/20/us-gun-companies-are-making-a-killing-in-mexico\">US-manufactured weapons</a> continues unabated.</p><p>The state of Jalisco itself happens to have the highest number of enforced disappearances in all of Mexico and made headlines last year with the discovery of a <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/26/how-the-discovery-of-a-mass-grave-sparked-uproar-over-the-missing-in-mexico\">clandestine crematorium</a> on a ranch outside Guadalajara, one of the host cities of the upcoming World Cup.</p><p>The ranch was reportedly used by the CJNG as a recruitment and training centre as well as an extermination site.</p><p>And the removal of El Mencho from the equation will do precisely nothing in terms of pacifying the landscape – just as the respective extraditions to the US of Sinaloa cartel leaders <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman</a> and <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada</a> merely set off an <a href=\"/opinions/2024/12/4/fear-and-loathing-in-culiacan-sinaloa\">ongoing violent battle</a> for power.</p><p>Contrary to lofty soundbites from US officials, the empire is not at all interested in getting rid of either drug trafficking or violence south of the border as both phenomena provide a perennial excuse for US interference in Mexico and beyond.</p><p>Were the gringos actually serious about ridding “Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world” of the whole cartel problem, a decriminalisation of drugs would do much to nip the business in the bud by rendering the movement of drugs far less fantastically lucrative.</p><p>A moratorium on the US’s obsessive manufacture of weapons would also help.</p><p>Obviously, nothing so much as resembling those potential solutions is even on the horizon. If it were, that would be one hell of a “great development” indeed.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He described Maduro’s abduction as a “political operation disguised as a legal debate”.</p><p>Despite these events of early January, however, the foreign minister stated that Venezuela is not in a state of war with the country that he said has been attacking it for the past decade, noting the US blockade and sanctions imposed on Venezuela for years in “full view of the world”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) described Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian situation as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/imf-warns-venezuelas-economy-and-humanitarian-situation-is-quite-fragile\">“quite fragile”</a>, pointing to an estimated triple-digit inflation and a sharply depreciating currency. Sanctions have played a role – but so has government mismanagement.</p><p>Earlier this month, the US Department of the Treasury announced it was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/trump-says-planning-to-make-visit-to-venezuela-following-maduro-abduction\">easing some sanctions</a> on Venezuela’s energy sector, the largest reprieve since Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>Gil further stated that Venezuela has begun a process of reconciliation and political coexistence following recent developments in the country, and emphasised that Venezuela will resolve its issues internally, referring to the recently approved <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/venezuela-receives-more-than-1500-amnesty-requests-under-new-law\">2026 Amnesty Law for Democratic Coexistence</a>.</p><p>The law, which was signed on Thursday, could free hundreds of people jailed over protests and political unrest dating back decades.

Secondly, they are engaging in meaningful conversation, trying to understand how a potential ceasefire could work from a technical perspective, just to have that frame on the table.</p><p>But meaningful does not mean in good faith.</p><p>Putin believes he can win the war. He believes he’s making progress on the battlefield and that he can manage problems in the Russian economy. His strategy is that Ukraine is going to fall before he does.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Is the current situation something you imagined back in February 2022?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> When war breaks out, your first instinct is to believe that it’s not going to last long … and all you have to do is just to survive the first attack, and then the attacking side will realise that it failed to achieve its goals.</p><p>But while keeping this instinctive scenario on your mind, you always have to also remember that things may last longer than you expect.</p><p>Did I expect the war to last for four years? No, I didn’t. But was I preparing myself for a long war? Yes, somewhere in the back of my mind, I was keeping that option open.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What does victory mean to you now?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> It started as a nightmare, and by the end of [2022], we captured half of the territories Russia had captured in the first months of the invasion, and we were pushing them back on old fronts. [Russian troops] were struggling to stabilise the front line; a sense of euphoria dominated in Ukraine, both among the decision-makers and the population.</p><p>This was the moment when victory was defined as regaining control of the 1991 border, which had existed before Russia annexed Crimea and intervened in the east of Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>But this hope … did not pass the reality check by the end of 2023, when our big counteroffensive failed to deliver.</p><p>Since then, politicians and people in Ukraine find it more and more difficult to redefine victory and speak about it, which I think is a big problem, because if you do not define what your final goal is, you will never get it.</p><p>So I offer my understanding of victory today, which would be to cease fire along the existing front line to stop hostilities and introduce a provisional truce between Russia and Ukraine to receive a long multi-year programme of military support to Ukraine; to launch a multi-billion recovery plan for Ukraine, and to see Ukraine as a member of the European Union.</p><p>Victory should always be defined, not only against your own goals, but also against the initial goals of your enemy.</p><p>So if I look back at 2022 and assume that Russia’s main objective was the demolition of the Ukrainian statehood and the return of Ukraine under its full control, then … Russia failed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"do-you-feel-the-west-and-your-vision-are-aligned\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Do you feel the West and your vision are aligned?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> The West doesn’t really exist anymore in the form we are used to thinking about it.</p><p>Europe is aligned.

What did you learn about the appeal of some of Russia’s narratives?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> First, Russia’s influence in countries of the Global South is overestimated.</p><p>Russia is not strong on its own. It is strong because it has China behind its back, and China is extremely strong all over the world.</p><p>Secondly, it is not because people in the Global South like Russia. It’s because they don’t like the West or what has been left out of it.</p><p>The anti-Western European, anti-American sentiment is so strong that many prefer to sympathise [with the] Russian narrative simply because it’s anti-European … not because it’s a strong argument in itself.</p><p>The third lesson is that you cannot come and demand anything, because [countries in the Global South] have grown quite a thick skin against those coming to their capitals and demanding.</p><p id=\"did-you-find-that-some-aspects-of-ukraine-s-experience-actually-resonated-with-those-experiences-of-the-global-south-especially-regarding-sovereignty\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Did Ukraine’s experience resonate?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> No, because, for example, if you go to Africa, their understanding of colonialism is set in stone, and it’s a white man oppressing a Black man.</p><p>So for them, a white man oppressing another white man … is a bad thing, but it’s not colonialism.</p><p>I just dropped the argument.
