But the tight relations have also bolstered Trump’s efforts to expand US authority throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Twice over the past year, Noboa has hosted Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem: once in July and a second time before the November ballot referendum.</p><p>“Ecuador has been an excellent partner to the U.S. in our work to stop illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and smugglers on land and on the seas,” Noem <a href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1986537214294302765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> at the time.</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a hallmark of his second term in office, calling the term “the most beautiful word” in the dictionary. Since returning to the White House in January 2025, he has enacted a sweeping tariff campaign, which includes a baseline tariff of 10 percent on nearly all trading partners and additional individualised tariffs for certain countries.</p><p>Trump has argued that tariffs protect domestic industries while feeding government coffers. He has also used the economic penalty as a means of forcing trading partners to submit to policy demands.</p><p>Last year, for instance, Trump threatened the US’s neighbours, Mexico and Canada, with tariff hikes if they failed to adequately combat drug smuggling and cross-border immigration.</p><p>His administration has similarly imposed a tariff on China to incentivise the country to staunch the flow of fentanyl.</p><p>But critics have questioned the legality of Trump’s tariff campaign and its coercive nature. Economists have also warned that the tax hikes on imports could result in higher consumer prices domestically.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25349828664417-1769026036.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks to police in uniform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Gustavo Petro delivers a speech during a police ceremony in Bogota, Colombia, on December 15, 2025 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fraying-relations-with-petro\">Fraying relations with Petro</h2><p>For his part, Noboa appears to be using the threat of tariffs not only to force compliance with Ecuador’s crime crackdown but also to strike back at Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro.</p><p>A former rebel fighter, Petro was elected in 2022 as his country’s first left-wing president. But he has faced criticism, both domestically and abroad, about his efforts to combat drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia remains the world’s largest producer of cocaine. In a 2024 report, the United Nations said the country had seen 10 consecutive years of rising production potential. Nearly 253,000 hectares (645,000 acres) in the country were dedicated to the cultivation of coca leaves, the raw ingredient in cocaine.</p><p>Complicating efforts is a six-decade-long internal conflict in Colombia. The slow-simmering conflict has long pitted government forces, right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing rebels and criminal networks against each other.</p><p>Since taking office, Petro has departed from the heavy-handed crackdowns of his right-wing predecessors, instead opting for a “Total Peace” plan that involves dialogue with armed rebels and criminal groups.</p><p>His administration has also overseen a shift away from the forced eradication of coca crops, largely grown by impoverished rural farmers. Instead, it has pursued a strategy of voluntary crop substitution, while attacking the laboratories and facilities that process the leaf into drugs.</p><p>Petro has claimed his strategy has resulted in the destruction of nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1995948716440821836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18,400</a> drug-making labs. In addition, last November, his administration claimed to have made Colombia’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/colombia-hails-historic-blow-after-largest-cocaine-bust-in-a-decade\">largest drug bust</a> in a decade, seizing 14 tonnes of cocaine.</p><p>But right-wing figures like Trump have called for “<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more aggressive action</a>” from Colombia.

His election was buoyed, in part, by a pledge to tamp down on Ecuador’s burgeoning crime crisis.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Ecuador has shed its reputation as an “island of peace” in Latin America, as criminal activity spiked.</p><p>That trend coincided with a steep rise in murders. As of 2024, the think tank Insight Crime found that Ecuador had a homicide rate of 44.6 for every 100,000 people, the highest proportion of any South American country. A total of 7,062 homicides were reported that year.</p><p>Experts say the crime wave reflects, in part, Ecuador’s strategic position between Colombia and Peru, the world’s second-largest cocaine producer.</p><p>But the timing of Noboa’s tariffs has raised questions about the president’s motives — and whether he was strictly focused on crime, rather than politics.</p><p>On Tuesday, one day before the new tariffs were unveiled, Petro <a href=\"http://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2013731006914666929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media a message in support of Ecuador’s former Vice President Jorge Glas, a left-wing figure.</p><p>In 2024, Noboa had authorised a controversial raid on Mexico’s embassy in Quito to arrest Glas on bribery charges. Glas currently resides in a maximum security prison, and Petro has accused the Ecuadorian government of using “psychological torture” against the former politician.</p><p>“Just as I demanded the release of political prisoners in Venezuela and Nicaragua, I believe Jorge Glass should be released,” Petro wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>The Glas case has been a source of ongoing tension between Petro and Noboa, leading some critics to speculate whether the tariffs were, in part, a response to Tuesday’s post.</p><p>Ecuador and Colombia are among each other’s top trading partners, and the new taxes are likely to spur questions about the future of regional trade agreements.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More and more people are seeing that ICE is dangerous, violent, operating with impunity. More and more people are angry, scared, motivated, and more and more people are looking to their members of Congress for action.”</p><p>To be sure, a change of direction remains an enormous undertaking, according to observers.</p><p>Trump’s tax bill, passed last year by the Republican-controlled Congress, which the president <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/trump-claims-victory-as-he-signs-controversial-budget-and-tax-bill-into-law\">dubbed</a> his “Big Beautiful Bill”, included a gargantuan windfall of $170bn for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>About $75bn of that was allocated to ICE over the next four years – $45bn to grow detention capacity and $30bn to boost enforcement operations. That comes on top of ICE’s annual operating budget, which has hovered around $10bn in recent years and is subject to congressional approval.</p><p>The additional funding has been <a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/minority/appropriations-committees-release-remaining-funding-bills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> by critics as a “slush fund” with little oversight.</p><p>It makes ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency by miles, while feeding what the Brennan Center for Justice has <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> a new “deportation industrial complex”.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-public-opinion\">Shifting public opinion</h2><p>As Trump begins the second year of his second term, his administration controls an ICE force that has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/has-us-ice-officer-training-been-reduced-to-47-days\">doubled in size</a> in recent months, now topping 22,000 agents. They are tasked with reaching a ballooning daily detention goal of 100,000, nearly three times the typical rate, as well as a target of one million deportations a year, far beyond the 605,000 the administration reported during Trump’s first year in office.</p><p>Advocates say US residents are beginning to understand what those numbers portend.</p><p>Video recording of the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in a Minneapolis suburb on January 7 flashflooded across social media, casting doubt, if not completely contradicting, the Trump administration’s immediate claims that Good was attempting to run over an immigration officer when he opened fire.</p><p>Within minutes, Trump officials labelled Good a “domestic terrorist”, with the federal government soon dismissing local authorities from taking part in the investigation and repudiating calls for a customary <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/doj-says-wont-investigate-ice-agents-fatal-shooting-of-renee-good\">civil rights probe</a>.</p><p>The administration then sent hundreds more federal agents to the state, bringing the total to 3,000, as it portrayed protests that spread to hundreds of cities across the US as the work of “agitators” and “insurrectionists”. The Department of Justice has since <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-justice-department-probes-minnesota-officials-amid-migration-raids\">opened investigations</a> into Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Governor Tim Walz, two of the most vocal critics of the administration’s actions, for alleged conspiracy to impede immigration enforcement.</p><p>The State of Minnesota, as well as the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, have launched a lawsuit alleging ICE agents have regularly tread on the civil liberties of residents. Images and videos of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/ice-officer-shoots-venezuelan-immigrant-in-minneapolis-what-we-know\">sometimes violent</a> confrontations between immigration agents and state residents have proliferated on social media, with several instances of US citizens being harassed or detained.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During a news conference on Tuesday, local police officials in the state also said they have received a deluge of reports of ICE agents trampling on residents’ rights.</p><p>Mark Bruley, the chief of police for the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Park, said residents are regularly being stopped “with no cause and are being forced to produce paperwork to determine if they are here legally”.</p><p>“We started hearing from our police officers the same complaints as they fell victim to this while off duty,” Bruley added. “Every person who has had this happen to them is a person of colour.”</p><p>Speaking at Wednesday’s briefing, Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, said recent events have shown “ICE and border patrol agents are not using taxpayer dollars for the purpose of immigration enforcement”.</p><p>“They’re using it for the purpose of protecting and projecting the absolute power and executive branch of the president of the United States,” Altman said.</p><p>That perception appears to bear out in public opinion polling. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll conducted from January 14 to 16 found an equal split on Trump’s immigration pledges, but growing discontent with how they are being implemented. About 52 percent felt that ICE was making communities less safe, while 61 percent said the agency’s tactics were “too tough”.</p><p>Another poll conducted by the ACLU found that 55 percent of voters support ending mass ICE raids targeting immigrants, while a whopping 84 percent said they supported people’s right to “safely observe, record, and document ICE activities”.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that while Trump’s approval on immigration was largely split 50 to 49 percent among voters in March 2025, the proportion of those who disapproved rose to 61 percent as of mid-January.</p><p>For his part, Trump has blamed the shifting tides on unfair media coverage, urging DHS and ICE to better publicise the “violent criminals” targeted in the 3,000 arrests the administration says immigration agents have made in Minnesota.</p><p>“Show the Numbers, Names, and Faces of the violent criminals, and show them NOW,” Trump said in a recent post on Truth Social account.</p><p>“The people will start supporting the Patriots of ICE, instead of the highly paid troublemakers, anarchists, and agitators!”</p><h2 id=\"business-as-usual\">‘Business as usual’</h2><p>The US Congress, which controls the so-called “power of the purse” in its budgetary discretion, remains slimly controlled by Republicans, who have shown little appetite for contradicting Trump on one of his marquee policy pillars.</p><p>Democrats have introduced a slate of legislative actions to siphon funding from ICE, constrain detentions, force ICE officers to unmask, and even to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, but all have proved non-starters.</p><p>More broadly, the party has remained divided on its approach, with some political strategists warning of continued perceived weakness on immigration, which was seen as an Achilles heel in the Democrats’ rout in the 2024 election.</p><p>Advocates who spoke on Wednesday, meanwhile, said lawmakers had an immediate opportunity to send a message as they negotiate a bill to apportion annual funding to the DHS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The current bill would increase ICE’s annual detention budget by $400m from last year, while increasing its enforcement budget by over $300m. That’s on top of the billions of dollars already allocated last year, while offering little in the way of best-practice reforms or oversight, advocates said.</p><p>“It is insane to me to think that anybody would vote to give more money to an already bloated agency,” said Beatriz Lopez, the founder and director of the Democracy Power Project, who called the bill an important opportunity to “check” ICE.</p><p>Added Amy Fischer, director for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA: “Democrats and Republicans came to the table to pull together this bill as if it’s just business as usual, as if it’s just another year”.</p><p>“What we are trying to communicate here is that we can’t actually do business as usual anymore when we have a hyper-militarised agency running lawless in our country, killing US citizens,” she said. “What we’re asking members of Congress to do is actually respond in a way that will hold back this agency, will hold back the lawlessness.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Until now, no president had sought to oust a Fed official.</p><p>A Supreme Court ruling is expected by the end of June.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-fed-independence\">Pressure on Fed independence</h2><p>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that the administration had handled the case “in a very cursory manner”. Though the case involves Trump’s asserted cause to fire Cook, Alito said, “No court has ever explored those facts. Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?”</p><p>“There’s a million hard questions in this case,” Alito said.</p><p>In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions meant to insulate the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a president only “for cause,” though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal.</p><p>Clement told the justices that Trump’s position would transform tenure protections for Fed governors into “at-will employment”.</p><p>“That makes no sense,” Clement said. “There’s no rational reason to go through all the trouble of creating this unique, quasi-private entity that is exempt from everything from the [congressional] appropriations process to the civil service laws, just to give it a removal restriction that is as toothless as the president imagines.”</p><p>Roberts expressed doubts about Sauer’s arguments that the president’s assertion of a cause is not reviewable, or that judges cannot reinstate a fired officer.</p><p>Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed doubts about the real-world effects of the administration’s arguments.</p><p>“Your position,” Kavanaugh told Sauer, “that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines – I mean, that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.”</p><p>Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett also questioned why the Trump administration has denied Cook a hearing to defend herself, saying that it “would not have been that big of a deal” for Trump to sit down with Cook and lay out the alleged evidence against her.</p><p>Barrett also asked Sauer about the practical implications of allowing Trump’s firing of a Fed governor.</p><p>“We have amicus [friend-of-the-court] briefs from economists who tell us that if Governor Cook is [fired], that would trigger a recession. How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?” Barrett asked, adding: “If there is a risk [at this preliminary stage of the case], doesn’t that counsel caution on our part?”</p><p>Sauer said that Cook was notified in August of her termination, and that has not affected the markets. Sauer urged the justices to weigh the predictions of doom for the US economy by economists in briefs submitted in the case supportive of Cook with a “jaundiced eye”.</p><p>US District Judge Jia Cobb in September ruled that Trump’s attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to due process under the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment. Cobb also found that the mortgage fraud allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law, noting that the alleged conduct occurred before she served in the Fed post.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined Trump’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-fired\">‘You’re fired’</h2><p>Conservative and liberal justices alike posed sharp questions to Sauer on his contention that Cook was not entitled to formal notice and a hearing before removal by the president.</p><p>Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Sauer what such a hearing would look like and whether Cook would have a right to legal counsel.</p><p>Sauer responded that the court in the past has been very reluctant to “dictate procedures to the president” and that it would be up to Trump to decide.</p><p>“Calling Ms. Cook into the [White House] Roosevelt Room, sitting across a conference table, listening for, I don’t know how long, how much evidence is a lawyer required, and then making a decision? Could that suffice?” Gorsuch asked, adding: “Just a meeting across a conference table finished with, ‘You’re fired’?”</p><p>Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked Sauer on what basis the justices should conclude that the Fed is “an executive branch agency and hence that the president does have a removal authority”.</p><p>“There’s an academic dispute about whether or not the Federal Reserve’s Open Market operations constitute executive power or something else, essentially private conduct. However, Congress has over the years kind of packed on traditional executive powers on the Federal Reserve,” Sauer replied.</p><p>As a Fed governor, Cook helps set US monetary policy with the rest of the central bank’s seven-member board and the heads of the 12 regional Fed banks. Her term in the job runs to 2038. Cook was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former US President Joe Biden and is the first Black woman to serve in the post.</p><p>Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Sauer to reconcile two seemingly conflicting positions: his claim that the president has broad discretion to remove a Fed governor, and his recognition that Congress included tenure protections for Fed governors to shield the Fed’s independence from White House interference.</p><p>“How does that further the aims of the statute?” Jackson asked.</p><p>Alito voiced scepticism toward Clement’s argument that a Fed governor’s conduct before taking office cannot provide a basis for removal by the president, asking Cook’s attorney to address a series of increasingly egregious hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>“How about if, after the person assumes office, videos are disclosed in which the office holder is expressing deep admiration for Hitler or for the Klan?” Alito asked.</p><p>The president sought to fire Cook on August 25 by posting a termination letter on social media citing the mortgage fraud allegations disclosed by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee.</p><p>The administration ‍this month opened a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criminal investigation into Powell</a> over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move he similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining influence over monetary policy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/21/trump-live-news-us-president-in-davos-as-greenland-threats-spark-outrage\">Trump’s speech in Davos</a> the following day, the US president made clear that times had changed. He nodded to Venezuela, where his forces conducted a raid to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduct</a> the country’s President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. He criticised Europe, calling the countries there weak.</p><p>And he constantly referenced his desire to take Greenland, no matter what Greenlanders, or Denmark – the country they are part of – think.</p><p>“We want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won’t give it,” Trump said. “So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”</p><p>Trump has made clear that the old way of doing things does not interest him. The post-World War II rules-based order concepts of sovereignty, and the resolution of disputes through negotiations, no longer mattered.</p><h2 id=\"not-an-ally-but-a-predator\">Not an ally but a predator</h2><p>The actions of Trump and his administration have forced lawmakers across Europe and the West to confront their reliance upon the US and weigh the difficulties of confronting the world’s most significant superpower, which NATO’s former deputy allied commander for Europe, Richard Shirreff, described on Tuesday as having turned from “ally” to “predator”.</p><p>Limited attempts on the part of Europe to counter US ambitions in Greenland have seen the deployment of a token number of troops to the island, only to be met by American fury and the immediate threat of tariffs.</p><p>“The rules-based order is over, and its ending reflects the decades-old fallacy that European and US values and security interests were the same,” said Geoffrey Nice, a human rights lawyer and former lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of Serbia’s former president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>Over the years, the US has exempted itself from numerous international treaties, such as the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/8/which-countries-are-international-criminal-court-members\">International Criminal Court</a>, whose warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin was actively <a href=\"/news/2023/7/26/biden-administration-moves-to-assist-icc-in-russia-investigation\">pursued</a> by former US President Joe Biden, despite Washington’s refusal to accept the jurisdiction of the court itself.</p><p>Similarly, when the International Court of Justice ruled against the US in a 1986 case on Washington’s support for rebels in Nicaragua, the US simply dismissed the ruling. Other international obligations, such as those on <a href=\"/news/2020/11/4/us-formally-quits-paris-climate-deal-amid-election-uncertainty\">climate</a>, or <a href=\"/news/2018/5/8/donald-trump-declares-us-withdrawal-from-iran-nuclear-deal\">commitments</a> to Iran to ease sanctions in return for greater transparency of its nuclear programme, have been similarly shrugged off.</p><p>“The reality has been that, time and again, the US has placed its own interests and its own sovereignty first. The United States’ interest in international law, going back to the Nuremberg, has always been ad hoc rather than treaty based,” Nice told Al Jazeera, referring to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. “What’s compounded this is that, for over 80 years, Europe and others have deluded themselves that this isn’t the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4254856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4254856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4254856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-03-15T171551Z_996838961_RC2QDDAQMMC6_RTRMADP_3_GREENLAND-PROTEST-1768930265.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a a demonstration march ending in front of the U.S. consulate, under the slogan, Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, in Nuuk, Greenland, March 15, 2025.

Western leaders have largely ignored the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, raising questions about whether international law matters for some, but not for others.</p><p>“The idea of holding to a singular — and often deeply hypocritical — rules-based order is finished, to the extent it ever truly existed,” said HA Hellyer of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3780565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3780565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25167484059469-1750138929.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The deadliest day of shootings near Gaza's food distribution centres\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Critics say the hypocrisy of the global rules-based order has been exposed during Israel’s war on Gaza [Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>“The recognition of that reality by the Canadians and Europeans is landing very differently across the world. For some, similar to Europe and Canada, it feels like a shocking collapse,” Hellyer said. “For others, it’s simply the moment when a system that never protected Black and brown populations, or the ‘Global South’, is finally being named for what it was.”</p><p>“It’s telling that the supposed breaking point for the rules-based order is really the threat to Greenland, not the devastation of Gaza, or other examples before now,” Hellyer added. “The cases are not identical, and I’m not equating them — but it’s difficult to argue that talk of annexation is more offensive to international norms than the destruction of an entire people and territory. But in the case of Israel, the main underwriter of the rules-based order – i.e., the US – did not only work to ensure no accountability for the violation of international law, but actively emboldened and empowered those violations.”</p><p>There is nothing new about Western commentators claiming that events on their own doorstep define the state of the world, regardless of conditions elsewhere, said Karim Emile Bitar, a professor of international relations at the Saint Joseph University of Beirut.</p><p>“This is why we see such a stark contrast between Western attitudes toward Gaza as opposed to Western attitudes when a blue-eyed, blonde Ukrainian lady arrives as a refugee,” he said.</p><p>“When a territory that is part of the ‘European Union’ is under threat, they completely shift course and no longer try to use the usual mendacious justifications that were used for decades and decades.”</p><p>For smaller countries that have been forced to rely upon alliances rather than rules for decades, or much of the Global South, the collapse of the rules-based order will mean little. For those in the Global North and their representatives at Davos, it represents a seismic shift.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This observational documentary follows them through birthday celebrations, 4am medication, difficult medical consultations and quiet, emotional moments together. Their bond gradually goes beyond conventional parent–child roles, as Hassen works tirelessly to preserve joy, dignity and a sense of normal life for Saliha. As the cancer spreads and her chances fade, they face impossible choices: treatment versus comfort, hope versus honesty, a son’s devotion versus his mother’s exhaustion. After Saliha’s death, we see Hassen back in the studio, hosting live television while still guided by her memory, redefining his mother as “a notion of love” that continues to shape him. Raw but unsentimental, the film captures caregiving as both an act of endurance and a profound declaration of love itself.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 21 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">21 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

He played a key security role in the 1970 coup, which brought overthrew the former head of state, Salah Jadid, and brought Hafez al-Assad to power.</p><p>In the late 1970s, as the regime faced internal opposition, Rifaat advocated for extreme measures. In a 1979 speech at a Baath party congress, he reportedly suggested “Stalinist” methods to purge opposition and proposed closing mosques to curb “sectarian ideology”.</p><p>His influence peaked in the early 1980s, but tensions with his brother were mounting. In November 1983, while Hafez was ill, Rifaat attempted to seize control, deploying his own forces in Damascus. The confrontation ended in a standoff.</p><p>By 1984, Hafez had regained control. Rifaat was stripped of his command, appointed to the ceremonial post of vice president and sent into exile. Reports at the time suggested he received $200m from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of a settlement to leave the country.</p><p><strong>Exile and legal troubles</strong></p><p>Rifaat spent the next 36 years primarily in Europe, where he faced multiple legal challenges over the source of his wealth.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>France:</strong> In 2020, a French court <a href=\"/news/2021/9/9/french-jail-term-confirmed-for-uncle-of-syrias-assad\">sentenced him to four years</a> in prison for money laundering and misappropriation of Syrian public funds, confiscating real estate assets worth an estimated $100m.</li>\n<li><strong>Switzerland:</strong> In August 2023, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Rifaat for his <a href=\"/news/2024/3/12/switzerland-to-try-syrias-rifaat-al-assad-for-war-crimes\">alleged role in war crimes</a> committed in Hama in 1982.</li>\n<li><strong>Assets Frozen:</strong> Authorities in the UK and Spain also froze family assets and investigated him for illicit financial activities.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Return and death</strong></p><p>To avoid imprisonment in France, Rifaat returned to Syria in October 2021. Despite his previous calls in 2011 for Bashar al-Assad to step down, he appeared voting for his nephew in the May 2021 election at the Syrian embassy in Paris.</p><p>Following the fall of the Assad government in December 2024, Lebanese security officials reported that Rifaat had left Syria for Dubai, where he passed away in January 2026.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But others have so far been reluctant to join. Observers argued this reluctance of many invited states to make immediate commitments reflects growing concern that the Trump administration is seeking to use the BoP’s expansive charter to bypass, or even replace, the UN.</p><p>Here is what we know so far about the board, its structure and mandate, the countries that have agreed to join, those still undecided and why hesitation remains widespread.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-board-of-peace\">What is the ‘board of peace’?</h2><p>First proposed in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, the board was initially framed as a mechanism to support the administration, reconstruction and economic recovery of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2026/01/statement-on-president-trumps-comprehensive-plan-to-end-the-gaza-conflict/\">formally announced</a> the creation of the BoP last week. However, the organisation’s 11-page charter, comprising eight chapters and 13 articles, does not mention <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/scepticism-hope-gaza-reacts-trump-board-of-peace\">Gaza</a> once.</p><p>Instead, it proposes a broad mandate for a new international organisation that “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”.</p><p>The governance structure has three layers: the BoP, an executive board and a chairman with sweeping authority.</p><p>According to the White House, a “founding executive council” sits at the top. The board of peace votes on budgets, policy and senior appointments while the executive board, which consists of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">seven members</a>, is responsible for implementing the mission.</p><p>Members of the executive board include former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>The chairman is Trump himself. He serves as the final authority on the interpretation of the charter and holds veto power over key decisions, including membership removal and executive board actions.</p><p>Board members “will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success”, the White House said, including “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation”.</p><p>Below the founding council is the “Gaza executive board”, tasked with regional coordination and supported by representatives from Arab countries. Its mandate is to help “support effective governance” in Gaza.</p><p>At the bottom of the hierarchy is the “national committee for the administration of Gaza” (NCAG), which is to be led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority deputy minister.</p><p>Alongside these civilian structures is a military pillar, led by US General Jasper Jeffers as commander of the “international stabilisation force” with a mandate that includes “permanent disarmament”.</p><p>Membership in the BoP is limited to states invited by the chairman. Member states are represented by heads of state or senior government officials and must contribute to operations in line with their domestic laws.</p><p>While general membership terms last three years, this limit does not apply to states contributing more than $1bn in the first year, which would grant them a permanent seat.</p><p>Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump praised the initiative. “I wish the United Nations could do more. I wish we didn’t need a board of peace, but the United Nations – and, you know, with all the wars I settled, United Nations never helped me on one war,” he told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-been-invited-and-which-have-agreed-to-join\">Which countries have been invited and which have agreed to join?</h2><p>Soon after the announcement, invitations were sent to dozens of countries across the world.</p><p>Leaders of at least 50 nations have confirmed receiving invitations, including close US allies such as the UK, France, Canada, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Australia.</p><p>US adversaries <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-asks-putin-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-even-as-ukraine-war-rages\">China and Russia</a> were also invited.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">Israel confirmed</a> it will join the BoP after approval from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu’s office announced on Wednesday that he would participate in the initiative despite the International Criminal Court (ICC) having issued a warrant for his arrest over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>His decision comes even after earlier criticism from his office over the composition of the executive committee, which includes Turkiye, a regional rival.</p><p>Netanyahu’s participation, despite the ICC warrant issued in 2023 accusing him of overseeing crimes against humanity in Gaza, is likely to intensify concerns about the board’s objectivity, particularly given Trump’s central role in controlling its membership and direction.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pakistan also confirmed on Wednesday that it would participate, according to a <a href=\"https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-accepts-invitation-for-joining-the-board-of-peace-bop-with-the-view-to-achieving-lasting-peace-in-gaza\">statement</a> from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>“Pakistan expresses the hope that with the creation of this framework, concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire, further scaling up of humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, as well as reconstruction of Gaza,” the statement said.</p><p>Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on Wednesday that the country’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, would join the board.</p><p>Other countries that have agreed to join include the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Argentina, Hungary and Belarus.</p><p>Andreas Krieg, associate professor of security studies at King’s College London, said countries joining the BoP were motivated by “access and leverage”.</p><p>“They will want a direct line into the White House; a seat in the room where contracts, corridors, crossings and timelines are decided; and a chance to shape what ‘post-Hamas’ means before facts harden on the ground,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that participation also amounts to “buying insurance” against future exclusion.</p><p>Filippo Boni, a senior lecturer in politics and international studies at the Open University in the UK, said invited states face a stark choice.</p><p>“Either join the board and undermine the UN or refuse to join,” he said, “and potentially face tariffs from the US.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-rejected-the-bop\">Which countries have rejected the BoP?</h2><p>At least four countries – France, Denmark, Norway and Sweden – have confirmed they will not join. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed the decision to reporters in Davos on Wednesday.</p><p>Denmark is already under pressure from Washington over Greenland. Trump has repeatedly suggested the US should acquire the semiautonomous Danish territory, even threatening force if Copenhagen refuses – although in his speech to the WEF on Wednesday, Trump said he would not use force.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-countries-hesitant-to-be-part-of-the-bop\">Why are countries hesitant to be part of the BoP?</h2><p>Several other countries across the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, including India, Indonesia, Egypt, Japan and Thailand, have also been invited but have yet to make a decision.</p><p>Most of Europe – including US allies like the UK, Germany and Italy – have not said whether they will join the board.</p><p>China and Russia haven’t confirmed participation in the board either.</p><p>For many nations, including China, that reluctance isn’t surprising, Boni suggested. Several of these countries advocate for UN principles and laws as the guiding pillars of international relations. Beijing, meanwhile, “has proposed its own global governance framework through the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), so it will likely move cautiously on Trump’s proposed plan”, he said. Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2025, the GGI is a governance framework aimed at promoting multilateralism although Beijing has not outlined many specifics.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257327\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257327\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257327\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/epa_6970dc375558-1769004087.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12665085 Displaced Palestinian children play at Bilal Mosque in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza Strip, 20 January 2026, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

But he warned that the initiative’s success depends more on politics than on its structure.</p><p>“As long as President Trump’s political authority remains intact, the structure is likely to function,” he said, noting that the top tiers are filled with figures closely aligned with Trump.</p><p>Trump began his second term as president a year ago and is set to remain in office until January 2029, a year longer than the BoP’s UN mandate.</p><p>Boni said any countries willing to pay $1bn for a permanent seat would make that decision based more on “a political choice than an economic one”.</p><p>“The choice is to either challenge multilateralism and the rule-based international order with the UN at its centre or to continue abiding by it, thereby refusing to endorse US leadership under this new framework,” he said.</p><p>Krieg suggested that some wealthy states may see value in paying for influence although even they may proceed cautiously.</p><p>“Beyond the Gulf, a country like Japan could afford it, but I would expect Tokyo to be cautious about a paywall model that weakens UN norms. India can afford it too, but Delhi rarely pays to join someone else’s club unless the return is concrete and immediate,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"is-the-bop-a-replacement-for-the-un\">Is the BoP a replacement for the UN?</h2><p>Perhaps the most serious concern surrounding the BoP is its potential role as a rival to the UN, which has served as the cornerstone of global diplomacy for eight decades despite multiple failings – and repeated violations of its rules by powerful states like the US and its allies like Israel.</p><p>But Khan rejected the idea that the UN’s failure to act decisively in Gaza reflected an institutional collapse</p><p>“The UN was prevented from acting. It did not choose inaction,” he said, alluding to repeated US vetoes against Israel that paralysed the Security Council.</p><p>Trump was a vocal critic of the UN during his first term from 2017 to 2021 and has cut funding to several UN-affiliated bodies during his second stint in the Oval Office.</p><p>But Boni pointed out that while the UN Charter enshrined principles such as the equal rights of large and small states after World War II, the board of peace charter is essentially a list of rules to join the club “where no such principles seem to be present”.</p><p>Krieg said fears that the BoP could hollow out the UN are well founded.</p><p>“You do not need to abolish the UN to hollow it out. You can drain attention, drain money and create a habit where the big calls move to ad hoc bodies chaired by major powers,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s BoP poses that risk, he added.</p><p>“The UN still carries something the board cannot easily replicate – near-universal membership, legal standing and the machinery of agencies that can operate at scale. The risk is that the board turns the UN into a service provider that takes instructions rather than sets terms,” Krieg said.</p><p>“If other capitals want the UN to survive as the main stage, they will resist joining the board, fund UN channels and treat the board as a temporary tool tied to Gaza rather than a model for global conflict management.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
