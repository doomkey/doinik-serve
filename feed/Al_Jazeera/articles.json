In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p><p>She added: “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”</p><h2 id=\"abuses-at-mega-prison\">‘Abuses’ at mega-prison</h2><p>The story – circulated online on Monday after it appeared to have streamed on Canada’s Global TV app – included allegations that Venezuelan deportees sent to the mega-prison had been tortured, and raised questions about how the United States characterised them.</p><p>Located on the edge of a jungle 75km (47 miles) southeast of San Salvador, <a href=\"/gallery/2025/8/26/el-salvador-cecot-prison-and-the-uss-school-of-the-americas\">CECOT</a> is a huge, maximum-security facility touted by El Salvador’s right-wing President Nayib Bukele as the centrepiece of his attempt to tackle narcotics gangs.</p><p>The facility has been at the centre of a major US legal case since March, when the Trump administration sent <a href=\"/news/2025/3/16/venezuelan-immigrants-deported-to-el-salvador-despite-us-court-ban\">hundreds of Venezuelan and other migrants</a> there, despite a judge’s order that they be returned to the US.</p><p>Several deportees who have since been released have described repeated abuse at the facility, where human rights activists say inmates are treated brutally.</p><h2 id=\"push-for-varied-perspectives-at-network\">Push for ‘varied perspectives’ at network</h2><p>The broadcaster’s decision to postpone the story follows growing criticism that it is increasingly pivoting towards an editorial line more in step with the conservative Trump administration.</p><p>Skydance Media, run by David Ellison – the son of Larry Ellison, a key donor to President Donald Trump ahead of his election last year – acquired Paramount in August, with regulatory approval for the deal helped along by a pledge that CBS News would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of US viewers.</p><p>In October, the company <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/conservative-writer-bari-weiss-named-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news\">named conservative media figure Bari Weiss</a>, known for her pro-Israel positions and frequent criticism of “woke” politics, as the editor-in-chief of CBS News, as part of what critics said was a push to steer the network in a direction more aligned with the Trump administration.</p><p>The outcry over the pulled story comes as Paramount Skydance is in a multibillion-dollar bidding war with Netflix to buy Warner Bros Discovery – a merger Trump has signalled he is watching closely, and which will likely require regulatory approval.</p><p>In a statement to The New York Times, Weiss said the network would be “airing this important piece when it’s ready” and downplayed the significance of the decision to postpone its airing.</p><p>“Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom.”</p><p>The executive producer of 60 Minutes, Tanya Simon, told fellow employees that she had resisted Weiss’s order, but “ultimately had to comply”.</p><p>“We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes,” Simon was quoted as saying by The Washington Post, in a transcript of the producer’s private meeting with colleagues.</p><h2 id=\"a-free-press-doesn-t-kowtow\">‘A free press doesn’t kowtow’</h2><p>The network’s decision to postpone the story has drawn widespread criticism across the US political and media spheres, with many voices expressing concerns that CBS News was already forgoing its journalistic obligations by censoring to curry favour with the Trump administration.</p><p>In an X post on Monday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “and his billionaire buddies ‌are trying to shape what people see and hear to create their own alternative reality”.</p><p>“The Trump administration doesn’t have a veto on what stories get told,” he added. “A free press doesn’t kowtow to the president – it holds him accountable.”</p><p>Liberal magazine The New Republic posted that the episode showed that political censorship of the media under the Trump administration was “already happening”, while Norm Ornstein, political scientist and contributing editor to The Atlantic magazine, wrote that the incident was “beyond monstrous”.</p><p>“There goes CBS,” posted podcaster and activist Amy Suskind. “All it took was Trump posting on social media about Warner Bros takeover. Weak capitulation!”</p><p>Columnist Matthew Yglesias wrote that it was “hilarious” that the report had leaked online despite it being blocked by CBS News executives.</p><p>“Canceling a news broadcast to curry favour with the regime and then accidentally releasing it in Canada anyway is genuinely hilarious,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sands and nine others died of starvation, one on day 46 of the protest.</p><p>“As of today’s date, [the current] strike has lasted up to 51 days, nearly two months, and poses a significant risk to their life with each passing day,” the lawyers wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The detainees are being held in five prisons over their alleged involvement in break-ins at the United Kingdom’s subsidiary of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Bristol and a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire. They deny the charges against them, such as burglary and violent disorder.</p><p>Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Kamran Ahmed are on day 52, 51, 45 and 44 of their protests, respectively. Lewie Chiaramello, who is diabetic and refuses food every other day, began his protest 30 days ago.</p><p>Qesser Zuhrah, Jon Cink and Umer Khalid have ended their strike.</p><p>All eight will have spent more than a year in prison before their trials take place, well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>The hunger strikers’ five demands include immediate bail, the right to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action, which accuses the UK government of complicity in Israel’s war crimes in Gaza. The UK government banned Palestine Action in July, branding it a “terror” group, a label that applies to groups such as ISIL (ISIS). The protesters have called for an end to alleged censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books. They are also urging that all Elbit sites be closed.</p><h2 id=\"engage-with-each-one\">‘Engage with each one’</h2><p>Leading human rights barrister Michael Mansfield has backed calls for the government to intervene.</p><p>“It’s a simple proposition, engage with each one,” he told Al Jazeera. “That’s your job [as government], that’s what you’re there for. You are safeguarding people’s health, welfare and life.”</p><p>In a letter addressed to Lammy, he wrote, “Fundamental human rights in the United Kingdom are being destroyed in this quagmire of disinterest and populist politics, the most important being the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial by means of preparation and due process.</p><p>“There has to be an equality of arms which can hardly be achieved when a defendant is held in oppressive and lengthy periods of remand.”</p><p>Families of the prisoners have alleged mistreatment in prison, saying some detainees have been verbally abused and left without care in dangerous health conditions. The Ministry of Justice has denied these accusations and says it cannot comment on individual cases.</p><p>“Government takes action when it chooses to,” Mansfield wrote. “There could be no more appropriate time than now with the life-endangering protest by the hunger strikers. The delay is grotesque in some cases, up to two years with trial dates being set in 2027.”</p><p>Nida Jafri, a friend of hunger striker Amu Gib, plans to deliver Mansfield’s letter – and one of her own – in hand to the Ministry of Justice on Tuesday.</p><p>“These people are on remand – not convicted, still awaiting full legal process,” reads Jafri’s letter. “They are weak, in pain, and visibly wasting away. The absence of adequate medical observation or humane treatment under prison or hospital care is not only unacceptable; it breaches fundamental rights to health, dignity, and life.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its cisterns and terraces, first cut into the limestone centuries ago, continued to serve the farmers who depended on them for water and soil.</p><p>That continuity was violently interrupted when the war began. Fire and phosphorus erased in a few months what centuries could not.</p><p>The destruction of Hajr al-Raheb and Ayta ash Shab came in waves. First came the artillery fire and the white phosphorus shells, setting the canopy alight and leaving the undergrowth smouldering.</p><p>Air strikes followed, flattening woodland and scorching the orchards.</p><p>But the final blow came after the November 27, 2024, ceasefire, when Israeli troops crossed the frontier with bulldozers. The trees that had not previously been consumed by fire and bombs were cleared from their roots by machinery.</p><p>Many Lebanese believe this to be part of an Israeli attempt to effectively create a dead zone on the border, a <a href=\"/features/2024/12/5/israel-buffer-zone-created-by-bombing-lebanon-with-white-phosphorus\">buffer zone</a> that Israel believes will make it safe from attacks, by removing villages and vegetation that could harbour threats.</p><p>“It wasn’t enough to burn it; they wanted to erase it,” said one villager, Hani Kassem.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4185247\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4185247\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4185247\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/@Ali-Srour-1766182518.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C652&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Short-toed Snake Eagle and a Hooded Crow\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4185247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many birds use Hajr al-Raheb in south Lebanon as a migratory route [Courtesy of Ali Srour]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"natural-habitat\">Natural habitat</h2><p>For Hani and other locals, Hajr al-Raheb was never just a picturesque landscape; it was a living system that sustained their lives.</p><p>Its dense trees once held the soil together on a hill, curbing erosion and channelling seasonal floods to replenish underground reservoirs in a region where rainfall has been steadily declining and drought has become a constant threat. The hill is now bare.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The forest was also home to one of the most active predators in the region, the Syrian jackal, alongside endangered striped hyenas, red foxes, Eurasian badgers, and the short-toed snake eagle.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Egyptian mongooses, rarely seen in the Lebanese wilderness, patrolled the undergrowth, while a couple of rock hyrax colonies occupied the limestone outcrops overlooking the valley.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Many other birds and small mammals, including owls, hoopoes, the Palestine sunbird, hedgehogs and wild boars, thrived in this patchwork of woodland and stone. These species depended on this small green refuge in an increasingly arid landscape.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">After the destruction, some of the animals have moved towards the destroyed village and its edges. They now shelter in what is left of the houses, which a few families have returned to.</p><p>Some of the families feed the animals, with the sound of Israeli drones flying overhead.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“We both lost the forest, and for them, it was their home,” Hani said, referring to the animals.</p><p>For the villagers, the loss has not only been ecological, but deeply personal. The forest that once anchored their lives and shielded their land is gone.</p><p>“It is the identity of the town,” said another villager, Ali Srour. “And today, we have lost it.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_2601090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2601090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2601090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP24005737945353-1704549761.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Smoke rising from a building\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2601090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Black smoke rises from an Israeli air attack on the outskirts of Ayta ash Shab, a Lebanese border village with Israel, in south Lebanon, November 13, 2023 [Hussein Malla/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"organisational-silence\">Organisational silence</h2><p>Before Israel’s war, the hills in this area of Lebanon formed a vital link in the eastern Mediterranean migration corridor and one of the busiest bird migration routes on the planet. Every spring and autumn, flocks of storks, raptors and songbirds would pause among the olive groves and forest edges of Ayta ash Shab before continuing their journeys south or north.</p><p>In its 2025 assessment, released in November, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <a href=\"https://www.birdlife.org/news/2024/11/18/new-publication-indicates-devastating-extinction-of-the-slender-billed-curlew/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> the global extinction of the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), one of the first officially recorded extinctions of a migratory bird species.</p><p>Once a regular traveller along this very route, the curlew’s disappearance stands as a stark warning of the accelerating collapse of migratory pathways that once connected continents through shared skies. It also underscores the immense pressures migratory birds are already enduring – from habitat loss, urban expansion, pesticide use, and climate change to the harsher realities of conflict zones scarred by white phosphorus contamination and heavy-metal pollution, which usually go unnoticed.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">After two years of destruction, and despite the extensive documentation of white phosphorus use and widespread ecosystem damage in South Lebanon and Gaza, many of the major wildlife conservation organisations have not addressed these violations, or their impact on migratory routes.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The IUCN issued a general <a href=\"https://iucn.org/iucn-statement/202310/iucn-statement-situation-israel-and-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> in October 2023, at the outset of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which expressed concerns over civilian casualties and humanitarian impacts, but did not reference Lebanon or address the environmental damage, specific weapons, ecosystems or migratory pathways.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Two years later, at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, held this October in Abu Dhabi, members adopted a motion that called for the restoration of Lebanese ecosystems impacted by war.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The motion acknowledged the widespread environmental degradation in Lebanon, including soil and water contamination, vegetation loss, erosion, wildfire risk, and threats to ecological connectivity. It called for post-war recovery, restoration guidance, and international technical and financial support. However, the motion did not identify the responsible parties, nor did it address the specific causes of damage, including the use of white phosphorus.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">At the same congress, members adopted another motion recognising the crime of ecocide. The motion established a global legal framework and mandated further guidance, but it did not reference Lebanon, Gaza, or any armed conflict.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Neither appears as an example of conflict-related environmental destruction, despite the growing global debate on accountability for large-scale environmental harm.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">In correspondence, the IUCN stated that its approach is intentionally global and non-case specific. It said that the ecocide motion was designed to apply broadly, rather than to named conflicts, and that conflict-linked ecosystem destruction is addressed through general legal and policy <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/FRS-001-En.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frameworks</a> rather than through conflict-specific ecological assessments. This framing leaves the documented environmental damage in south Lebanon and Gaza outside explicit institutional attribution or case-based analysis.</p><p>Al Jazeera also reached out to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and BirdLife International to query their positions on the impact of Israel’s wars in Lebanon and Gaza on local ecosystems and wildlife.</p><p>The WWF stated that it has no office or staff presence in Lebanon or Gaza, and has not conducted any environmental assessment related to the war. It referred to its 2022 report, The Nature of Conflict and Peace, as general background on the links between the environment, security, and peace.</p><p>BirdLife International stated that it has not issued a specific public position or statement on the impact of the war in Lebanon and Gaza on migratory species. It encouraged partners to document the potential impacts when possible, but noted that documenting ecological damage during wartime is often unsafe or not possible.</p><p>BirdLife acknowledged that habitat damage affects local populations and may affect migration depending on the season, but stated that impacts in Lebanon and Gaza cannot yet be fully determined.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4185254\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4185254\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4185254\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gjackal-Ayta-1766182654.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Golden Jackal\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4185254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Golden jackals have been spotted in the Ayta ash Shab area of south Lebanon [Courtesy of Green Southerners]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"weaponisation-of-the-environment\">Weaponisation of the environment</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon, the war has revealed a darker reality: the weaponisation of the environment itself. Forests, soils and waters became targets, not collateral victims, in a campaign that blurred the line between military strategy and ecological annihilation.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Today, most of the slopes of Ayta ash Shab stand bare and lifeless, stripped of colour, sound and movement. The habitats that once sustained insects, birds and mammals have been erased, leaving behind contaminated soil and silence where life once thrived.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Last September, a few flocks of migratory white storks were seen passing overhead. But they did not stop where they once did. Those sites have been irreversibly altered.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">From October 8, 2023, to October 3, 2024, Green Southerners verified 195 cases of white phosphorus use by Israeli forces across southern Lebanon.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Residues of white phosphorus and heavy metals from repeated bombardment have contaminated the soil, posing long-term risks to agriculture and human health.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Green Southerners is calling for urgent testing and ecological assessment before any recovery effort can begin.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Yet, the main obstacle remains security: Israeli attacks have continued even after the ceasefire was declared on 27 October 2024, leaving the area unsafe for restoration work.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Called a “pearl by the sea”, Odesa is Ukraine’s third most populous city after Kyiv and Kharkiv.</p><p>Black Sea ports – including Odesa and two others close by, Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk – and Mykolaiv to the east handled more than 70 percent of Ukraine’s exports before the war.</p><p>But Odesa’s role as a trading hub has grown in recent years as ports in the Zaporizhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions have been occupied by Russia.</p><p>Since the war began in February 2022, Ukraine has continued to rank among the world’s top five exporters of wheat and corn – largely through Odesa.</p><p>By targeting Odesa’s shipping facilities with missiles and drones, Ukrainian officials said, Putin aims to destroy Ukrainian trade and business infrastructure.</p><p>Zelenskyy, who has previously accused Russia of “sowing chaos” on the people of Odesa, said: “Everyone must see that without pressure on Russia, they have no intention of genuinely ending their aggression.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-would-it-mean-for-ukraine-if-odesa-were-destroyed\">What would it mean for Ukraine if Odesa were destroyed?</h2><p>If the port of Odesa were badly damaged, the economic impact for Ukraine would be severe. The city and its surrounding areas would suffer major job losses in the shipping and logistics industries, seriously squeezing local incomes. Meanwhile, port-dependent businesses would falter and investment would fall away.</p><p>Nationally, Ukraine’s export capacity would be hit hard. As a key gateway for grain and other commodities, disruptions there would raise transport costs, slow shipments and reduce export volumes, choking foreign currency earnings and piling pressure on the hryvnia, Ukraine’s currency.</p><p>Elsewhere, farmers would suffer from lower prices for their produce as well as storage bottlenecks with knock-on effects across rural economies.

Trump then postponed a 2019 visit to the Nordic country after Danish PM Frederiksen slammed the idea.</p><p>He has refused to rule out the use of military force to seize control, noting in March that the US would “go as far as we have to”.</p><p>Geographically part of North America, Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, lies about 2,900km (1,800 miles) from New York – closer than it is to Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, which is situated roughly 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>The semi-autonomous territory has a population of 57,000 people.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570999\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greeland-1741684530.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is Greenland-1741684530\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-sent-an-envoy-to-greenland-what-does-that-signify\">Why has Trump sent an ‘envoy’ to Greenland – what does that signify?</h2><p>On Sunday, the US president appointed Louisiana Governor Landry as special envoy to Greenland, prompting anger from Copenhagen, which summoned the US ambassador to explain the decision.</p><p>Following the announcement, Landry said it would be an honour to serve in a role meant to “make Greenland a part of the US”, further amplifying Denmark’s concerns about the White House’s intentions.</p><p>Taking to his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said Landry is aware “how essential Greenland is” for US national security.</p><p>Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defence College in Denmark, said while Trump is “clearly serious” about his interest in Greenland, it is unlikely he would try to take it by force.</p><p>“But we certainly see attempts to gain influence through other channels such as strategic investments and pushing narratives that portray Denmark as a bad partner,” Jacobsen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The appointment of Jeff Landry as special envoy and Tom Dans as the leader of the US Arctic Research Commission should be seen as new elements in this strategy,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-have-greenlanders-responded-to-this-latest-move\">How have Greenlanders responded to this latest move?</h2><p>Lokke Rasmussen, the foreign minister of Denmark, said Trump’s appointment of Landry confirmed continued US interest in Greenland.</p><p>“However, we insist that everyone – including the US – must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he told the AFP news agency.</p><p>On Monday, Greenland’s Prime Minister Nielsen said Greenland is friendly towards Washington and that “they know there is no obstacle to the United States increasing security in the Arctic on Greenlandic territory if they wish to do so.</p><p>“But going from that to pressuring to take over a country that is populated and has its own sovereignty is not acceptable,” Nielsen told the daily Sermitsiaq.</p><p>People in Greenland broadly favour increased independence from Denmark – but not the transfer of sovereignty to the US.</p><p>In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland extensive self-governing powers, including the right to pursue independence from Denmark via a referendum.</p><p>In August, Denmark summoned the US charge d’affaires after at least three officials linked to former President Trump were spotted in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, gauging local sentiment on strengthening ties with the US.</p><p>In March, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, were accompanied by White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on a tour of the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/mapping-greenlands-resources-population-centres-and-us-military-base\">US’s Pituffik Space Base</a> in northwestern Greenland “to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with US service members”, according to a statement released by Vance’s office.</p><p>However, Greenland’s acting head of government, Mute Egede, wrote in an online post at the time that Greenland had not in fact extended any invitation for an official or private visit.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In response to Landry’s announcement, European Union Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ‍President Antonio Costa said Arctic ‍security ‍was and will remain a “key priority” for the EU, “one in which we seek to work with allies and partners”.</p><p>“Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. These principles ​are essential not ‌only for the European Union, but for nations around the world,” ‌they said ‌on ⁠X.</p><p>On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated France’s backing for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Denmark and Greenland.</p><p>He said Greenland “belongs to its people” and Denmark “serves as its guarantor”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-greenland-strategic-for-the-us\">Why is Greenland strategic for the US?</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly emphasised that the Arctic’s strategic geography – particularly Greenland’s position between North America and Europe – is key to US defence and global security interests.</p><p>Its location, offering the shortest route from North America to Europe, would give Washington leverage for its military and its ballistic missile early-warning system.</p><p>The US is also interested in placing radars in the waters that connect Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom. These waters are a gateway for Russian and Chinese ships, which the US wants to track.</p><p>The island also hosts the Pituffik Space Base, a major US military installation used for surveillance and missile warning operations.</p><h2 id=\"what-mineral-resources-does-greenland-have\">What mineral resources does Greenland have?</h2><p>Trump has denied that its mineral wealth is the real reason he is so interested in Greenland. However, it is rich in mineral resources critical for the production of modern technologies, including rare-earth elements for electronics and clean energy, as well as uranium, zinc and other base metals.</p><p>It also holds potential oil and gas deposits, though their extraction is restricted. Surveys indicate that Greenland contains a substantial share of the critical raw materials identified by the EU.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3570887\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570887\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Greenlands-mineral-resources-MARCH9-20250D-1741681526.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Greenlands mineral resources-MARCH9-2025-1741681526\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-scrambling-for-positions-in-the-arctic-and-why\">Which other countries are scrambling for positions in the Arctic and why?</h2><p>Several countries have become increasingly active in the Arctic in recent years.</p><p>Climate change and a rapidly melting ice sheet are the main reasons the Arctic has become a geopolitical hotspot.</p><p>The Arctic is heating at a rate four times faster than the global average, increasing its accessibility for maritime trade routes and resource exploration – including by non-Arctic countries as well as those with an Arctic presence.</p><p>China has deployed vessels capable of serving both military surveillance and research functions in the region. The purposes are to collect data and secure access to resources and shipping lanes, which are emerging as a result of melting ice.</p><p>Last year, Canada unveiled a 37-page security policy detailing plans to enhance its military and diplomatic presence in the Arctic, citing threats posed by increasing Russian and Chinese activity.</p><p>In recent years, Russia has expanded its naval presence, deploying missile systems and ramping up weapons testing in the Arctic.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has also noted Trump’s interest in the region.</p><p>During an address at the International Arctic Forum in the Russian city of Murmansk, the largest city within the Arctic circle, earlier this year, Putin said he believed Trump was serious about taking Greenland and that the US would continue its efforts to acquire it.</p><p>“It can look surprising only at first glance, and it would be wrong to believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current US administration,” said Putin, adding that he expects the US to continue to “systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic”.</p><p>Putin also expressed concerns about Russia’s neighbours, Finland and Sweden – both of which have borders inside the Arctic circle – joining NATO, the transatlantic military alliance between North America and Europe. Finland joined NATO in 2023, and Sweden joined in 2024.</p><p>“Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernising military infrastructure,” Putin said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"could-the-us-take-greenland-by-force\">Could the US take Greenland by force?</h2><p>Jacobsen said if the US were to invade Greenland, it would mean the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>Denmark and the US are founding members of NATO, a European and North American military alliance founded in 1949.</p><p>“On a personal level for Trump, it would also mean the end of any ambitions for getting a peace prize, which he has strived for so long,” Jacobsen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“All his efforts to end the wars in Ukraine, Israel-Palestine and elsewhere would have no effect to this end.”</p><p>Jacobsen added that there are still “reasonable people in the right positions” who would pull the “handbrake on such an unreasonable idea like invading Greenland”.</p><p>“I truly don’t believe it will happen,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The PKK is labelled a “terrorist” organisation by the United States, the European Union and Turkiye.</p><p>The agreement was seen as a means of avoiding a potentially explosive confrontation between Damascus and the US-trained SDF. However, 10 months on, while the agreement has helped the two sides avoid clashes, little progress has been made.</p><p>”For there to be any progress on implementing this point, one side would have to give way … as such, the status quo prevails,” McGee added.</p><p>A point of contention seems to be between the SDF’s preferred position of incorporating their existing battalions into the Syrian armed forces with a degree of autonomy, versus Damascus’s preferred position of the individual integration of SDF fighters.</p><p>Analysts told Al Jazeera that these two positions were likely untenable and that an agreement didn’t seem imminent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Turkiye has backed Damascus and even threatened unilateral military intervention should an agreement not be reached.</p><p>“We just hope that things go through dialogue, negotiations and peacefully. We don’t want to see any need to resort to military means again. But SDF should understand the patience of the relevant actors is running out,” Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan told Turkish state media.</p><p>After a decades-long armed rebellion by the PKK, Turkiye has reached a deal with the group to disarm and lay down its weapons. Despite Fidan’s strong words, analysts said it is unlikely it would want to undermine those talks by militarily confronting the SDF.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-self-administration\">Kurdish self-administration</h2><p>On December 8, the more than five-decade rule of the Assad regime ended, allowing millions of Syrians to return to their country amid hopes for a better future. This was particularly true in areas controlled by the SDF during Syria’s civil war; under Bashar al-Assad, Kurdish rights were restricted and many Kurds said they were treated as second-class citizens.</p><p>But during Syria’s revolution and the subsequent almost 14 years of civil war, the SDF controlled areas in the northeast – at times by force and against the will of Arab inhabitants – and was able to build a level of autonomy. Analysts said the group is hesitant to relinquish that power.</p><p>“In terms of Kurdish self-defence and ability of Kurds to make own decisions, they think they’ve now achieved something which they’ve never had before, and don’t want to give it up,” Robin Yassin-Kassab, a Syrian writer and co-author of the book Burning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said on Monday that the SDF ”showed no willingness” to integrate into the country’s central administration in Damascus.</p><p>Yet analysts say there is a deep mistrust between Damascus and the SDF and that the government could have taken some steps to build confidence.</p><p>“The government has failed to take advantage of certain opportunities to show good faith in implementing the agreement from its side,” McGee said.</p><p>He added that the government could have taken steps such as recognising Newroz as a national holiday or acknowledging the rife Kurdish statelessness that occurred under the Assad regime.</p><p>“Also, during my recent visit to Hasakah, many locals were commenting on the fact that services [such as civil documentation] that had been available to them through the Security Squares of Qamishli and Hasakah under the Assad regime are no longer in place since December last year,” McGee said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"little-progress\">Little progress</h2><p>Syria’s new administration has gained substantial international and regional backing, and that could have built its confidence in its dealings with the SDF.</p><p>The US, in particular, has grown closer to Damascus in recent months, with al-Sharaa making a historic visit to the White House and seemingly winning the approval of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>The US also trained and armed the SDF in its fight against ISIL (ISIS). But Trump’s special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, has said the US supports the SDF integrating into the Syrian state and that it would not like to see the SDF breaking away to form an autonomous entity or even a semi-autonomous region like Iraqi Kurdistan. Barrack also praised the ”reasonable options” presented by the government to the SDF.</p><p>“The US want the SDF to integrate into the new Syrian transitional government but don’t want the SDF – Damascus to descend into conflict because it will create more opportunities for ISIL to pop up in vacuums,” Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On Friday, Reuters news agency reported that Damascus “expressed openness to the SDF reorganising its roughly 50,000 fighters into three main divisions and smaller brigades as long as it cedes some chains of command and opens its territory to other Syrian army units”.</p><p>However, officials also told Reuters a deal didn’t appear to be imminent and more talks were needed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, analysts said the March 10 deal signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi in Damascus did have a positive impact in limiting clashes.</p><p>“It is notable that there has been extremely little direct conflict between the Syrian government and self -administration since the signing of the agreement, indicating that at least the provision relating to the ‘ceasefire’ has broadly held,” McGee said. “Other provisions have clearly, however, seen little progress.”</p><p>It’s still unclear how Monday’s clashes may affect the deal, and analysts say the prospect of SDF fighters integrating into government forces before the end of 2025 is unlikely.</p><p>“The deadline is approaching fast but some officials say it’s more important to implement the agreement than focus on the deadline, so there could be an extension,” van Wilgenburg said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

How they come back to their families after the night shift, what they tell their children and, most importantly, themselves.</p><p>But I prefer the memory of a crowd of high school graduates who walked past my house in June, at dawn, after their prom night that coincided with an especially long and loud air raid.</p><p>Their laughter and happiness about the sunrise, the clouds of blossoming trees around them, the rugs of flowers and grass under their feet, and the future ahead of them made them sound immortal. It was a sound that defied Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>In recent months, blackouts have been the most inevitable part of each air raid. It feels as though keeping millions awake and horrified during the raids is only part of Moscow’s strategy of terrorising Ukraine.</p><p>Moscow’s logic appears simple: if you do not want to surrender, you will freeze. It methodically destroys power stations, transmission and central heating lines to keep millions without electricity, light and heat.</p><p>And then there are “planned outages”. There are usually three a day, lasting between two and eight hours.</p><p>You can hear an outage because even the sounds in your ears barely register, such as the fridge’s purring or the flow of hot water in the heating system, are gone. You can see an outage because the neighbourhood lights go out, making the stars in the night sky closer and brighter.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-survive-darkness\">How to survive darkness</h2><p>What saves you from darkness and disconnection is gadgets.</p><p>Apart from smartphones with energy-saving modes, wi-fi hotspots and flashlights, there are laptops, tablets, wireless speakers and vacuum cleaners running on batteries.</p><p>There are also inexpensive rechargeable lamps – I have 10 of them. Three are pint-sized and bright enough for my mother to read. Three more are motion-activated, which means she can safely use the bathroom any time, and the cat is perpetually amazed.</p><p>There is a cap lamp that makes me look like a miner and helps me cook or find something in the basement, and two tiny lamps that can be stuck into a power bank and just glow in a corner.</p><p>And there is a Christmas garland in the kitchen that makes each outage feel festive.</p><p>But the most important device, the symbolic hearth of my powerless house, is a $1,200, 20kg (40lbs) battery that can keep us warm and energised for up to 12 hours.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>I live on the outskirts of Kyiv in a remodelled summer house that has its own pump and a natural gas-powered heating system. Both need electricity, along with the two 50-litre (13-gallon) water heaters.</p><p>But boiling water and microwaving meals is too energy-consuming, so we stick to frying pans and an old-fashioned whistling kettle that scares the cat.</p><p>And when the power is back on, there is no room for procrastination.</p><p>You need to recharge all the lamps and devices, start a washing machine, wash dishes, and go out for groceries without risking your life while crossing the road with the traffic lights off.</p><p>The electricity’s comeback may be deceptive – sometimes, it’s too weak. I recently tried to microwave a bowl of soup, twice, but it remained cold.</p><p>And for extreme emergencies, I have a gasoline-fuelled generator.  It’s loud, shaky and stinky, and you need an entire canister of gas worth $30 for it to keep it going all night.</p><p>But such generators keep Ukraine running.</p><p>You can see them next to shops, offices and apartment buildings. Some are chained to trees or walls to prevent theft, and some are too huge and heavy to be carried away.</p><p>During a recent music festival celebrating Ukrainian composers, a giant diesel generator powered the concert hall.</p><p>My internet provider turns them on seconds after an outage begins, so I am online no matter what.</p><p>You also need to be prepared when you go out.</p><p>After covering the 2008 Russian war in Georgia, I used to drive everyone around me mad with my I-have-to-be-ready-for-any-emergency obsession.</p><p>Now, all of Ukraine feels the same obsession.</p><p>The phone has to be fully charged. There has to be a power bank in my backpack – along with a basic first aid kit, a lighter (I don’t smoke), extra batteries for the Dictaphone, pens and a pencil to take notes in subzero temperatures, when ballpen ink freezes.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I used the lighter at Kyiv’s Independence Square, dotted with hundreds of tiny Ukrainian flags next to photos of fallen soldiers.</p><p>I helped a man with a toddler light a tiny candle that he wanted to place next to the photo of his younger brother.</p><p>“He’s the toddler’s father,” the man said, and all I could utter was “God rest his soul” as I walked away, hiding tears and putting the lighter back.</p></div></div></body></html>"

People here feel abandoned to their sad fate.”</p><p>Fears that the conflict will not only continue, but that it could soon take on a regional dimension, are deepening, too – a sensitive prospect in a DRC where two civil wars in the past were prompted by its neighbours.</p><p>Uvira, the newly captured city the rebels then withdrew from as a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/drc-says-m23-vow-to-pull-out-of-uvira-is-a-distraction-as-forces-remain\">“trust-building measure”</a> following US pressure last week, is a major transport and economic hub in the huge South Kivu province. It’s strategically located on the border with Rwanda and is just 30 kilometres from the Burundian capital, Bujumbura. The city was the last eastern stronghold of the Congolese army and its allies – local “Wazalendo” militias and about 3,000 Burundian soldiers. Early this year, M23 also seized control of South Kivu’s capital city, Bukavu, as well as Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.</p><p>Experts say M23’s advance on Uvira widens the group’s area of control significantly, puts it at the mouth of the mineral-rich Katanga region, and positions Rwandan proxies right at Burundi’s doorstep at a time when both governments are ramping up a war of words and accusing each other of backing rebels.</p><p>Rwanda, for its part, continues to distance itself from accusations that it backs M23.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3566952\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3566952\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3566952\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-02-24T113957Z_501805205_RC22OCAXX3LP_RTRMADP_3_CONGO-SECURITY-CHILDREN-1741531651.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: A view shows the remains of a vehicle hit by heavy and light weapons during the fighting in the town that led to the fall of Goma into the hands of the M23 rebels, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, February 5, 2025.

But they collapsed after a highly anticipated meeting between the presidents of Rwanda and DRC was called off. Both sides accused each other of foiling the talks.</p><p>“There’s a sense of deja vu,” Nicodemus Minde, East Africa analyst at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), said. “It’s symbolic because we were exactly here last year … the prospects for peace are dire.”</p><p>Conflict in the DRC has long been mired in a complex mix of ethnic grievances, poor governance and interference from its much smaller neighbours. It <a href=\"/news/2024/2/21/a-guide-to-the-decades-long-conflict-in-dr-congo\">goes back</a> to the 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda, which displaced millions into neighbouring eastern DRC, making them a minority there. Rwanda has since viewed the DRC as a hiding place for Hutu genocidaires, however, and its hot pursuit of them toppled a government in Kinshasa and led to the first and second Congo wars (1996-2003). The UN also accused the Rwandan and allied Ugandan forces of looting the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, including gold, coltan and tin, during the conflict.</p><p>Scores of militias emerged as governments armed and counter-armed civilians in the wars, many of which are still active in the DRC. The M23 itself is only the latest iteration of a Tutsi militia that fought in the Congo wars, and whose fighters integrated into the DRC army. In 2012, these fighters revolted, complaining of poor treatment by the Congolese forces. Now, the M23 claims to be fighting the marginalisation of ethnic Tutsis, some of whom say they are systematically denied citizenship, among other complaints. The M23 and its allied Congo River Alliance (AFC) have not stated goals of taking Kinshasa, even though members of the group have at times threatened to advance on the capital. Officially, the rebels claim to be “liberating” eastern DRC communities.</p><p>In 2012, M23 initially emerged with enough force to take the strategic city of Goma, but was forced back within a year by Congolese forces and a special UN intervention force of troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi. When the M23 resurfaced in late 2021, though, it was with much more ferocity, boosted by about 4,000 Rwandan troops in addition to its own 6,000 fighters, according to the UN. Lightning and intensely bloody offensives have since seen it control vast swaths of territory, including the major cities of Goma, Bukavu – and now, Uvira.</p><p>On the map, M23 appears to be eking out a slice of Congolese territory wedged between the DRC and neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. If it gains control of the two Kivus in their entirety, it would lord over a resource-rich area five times Rwanda’s size with easy access to Kigali and Kampala.</p><p>“They are trying to create some sort of buffer zone which the neighbouring countries, particularly Rwanda but also Uganda, have an interest in controlling,” analyst Paul-Simon Handy, also of the ISS, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kigali officially denies backing M23, but justifies its actions based on accusations that the DRC supports a Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The FDLR did exist for many years in the DRC, but it simply no longer poses a significant threat to Kigali, analyst Minde said.</p><p>Rwanda’s tensions with Burundi have similar historic correlations, as Hutus who perpetrated the 1994 genocide similarly fled there, and Kigali alleges the government continues to back rebels. In 2015, Burundi accused Rwanda of sponsoring an abortive coup in Bujumbura. Kigali denies this.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4150927\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4150927\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4150927\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251204__876B4DQ__v1__HighRes__UsRwandaDrcDiplomacyTrump_cropped-1764876353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"drc\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4150927\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump hosts the signing ceremony of a peace deal with the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, left, and the president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Felix Tshisekedi, right, at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, on December 4, 2025 [Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"does-the-us-deal-have-a-chance\">Does the US deal have a chance?</h2><p>Several African countries have attempted to help solve the crisis, militarily and diplomatically, but all have failed. The regional bloc, the East African Community, of which the DRC is a part, deployed about 6,500 Kenyan-led peacekeepers to stabilise eastern DRC, as Kenyan diplomats developed a Nairobi Peace Process in 2022 that was meant to see several rebel groups agree to a truce. The agreement collapsed only a year later, however, after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi grew frustrated over the force’s refusal to launch offensives against M23.</p><p>Then, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which the massive DRC is also a part, deployed troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi in May 2023. There was hope that the trio, which proved crucial in driving back the first M23 insurrection, would again record success. They appeared no match for the new M23, though, and withdrew this June.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Angola-led Luanda Peace Process collapsed after President Joao Lourenco stepped back in March, citing frustration with both sides amid constant finger-pointing.</p><p>Qatar and the US stepped in to broker peace in June this year, using a unique two-pronged approach. The Doha peace talks, on the one hand, have focused on negotiations between the DRC and M23, while the Washington talks focus on the DRC and the Rwanda governments. Some experts warned that Washington’s motivation – aside from President Donald Trump’s fixation on being a <a href=\"/video/fact-check/2025/8/27/trumps-diplomacy-peacemaker-or-political-prestige\">global peacemaker figure</a> – was a clause in the deal that guarantees US extraction of rare earth minerals from both countries. The agreement was unlikely to hold on that basis, rights groups said.</p><p>After a few no-shows and wobbles, the M23 finally agreed to the Doha framework on November 15. The agreement includes eight implementation protocols, including one on ceasefire monitoring and another on prisoner exchange. On <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/trump-hails-great-day-for-the-world-as-drc-rwanda-finalise-peace-deal\">December 4</a>, President Trump sat next to a smiling Paul Kagame and Tshisekedi as all three signed the US-peace deal in Washington, which mandated both Rwanda and DRC to stop supporting armed groups. There were pockets of fighting as the signatures were penned, but all was supposed to be largely peaceful from then on.</p><p>What happened in Uvira barely a week after was the opposite. The Congolese government said at least 400 people were killed and 200,000 others displaced as M23 fighters pressed on the city. Thousands more were displaced into Burundi, which already homes some 200,000 Congolese refugees. Fleeing Uvira residents shared accounts of bombed villages, summary killings and widespread sexual violence by both sides, according to medical group Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-there-hope-for-peace\">Is there hope for peace?</h2><p>Even though M23 began withdrawing from Uvira on Thursday, analysts are still scrambling to understand what the group was hoping to achieve by taking the city, shattering the peace agreements and angering Washington.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly scolded Rwanda after Uvira’s capture, saying Kigali had violated the deal. Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau met with DRC Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner in Washington and promised that the US “is prepared to take action to enforce adherence” from Rwanda.</p><p>What that action looks like is unclear, but what’s certain, Minde said, was that the agreement seemed to favour Kigali more than Kinshasa.</p><p>“If you look at the agreement, the consequences [of either party breaching] were not forthright, and this points to the weakness of the deal,” he said, adding that there is much more at stake for DRC if there is a breach, including escalating conflict and mass displacement within the country. But that was not taken into account, the analyst explained.</p><p>Uvira’s fall, albeit on hold, is not only a blow to Trump’s peacemaker reputation but also sharpens tensions between Burundi and Rwanda, with analysts saying it could lead to direct clashes.</p><p>Bujumbura accuses Kigali of supporting the antigovernment Red Tabara rebels – a charge Rwanda and the rebels deny – and tensions between the two governments have led to border closures since last year. Last week, M23 announced that it captured hundreds of Burundian soldiers during the Uvira offensive.</p><p>Fears of a regional spillover also prompted the UN Security Council to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/un-security-council-urges-rwanda-to-withdraw-troops-from-eastern-dr-congo\">extend </a>the mandate of the MONUSCO peacekeeping mission for a year, ahead of its December 20 expiration. The 11,000 troop force has been in place since 1999, but has a complicated relationship with the DRC government, which says it has not done enough to protect civilians. MONUSCO forces initially <a href=\"/news/2024/1/13/un-says-all-peacekeepers-will-leave-dr-congo-by-end-of-2024\">began withdrawing</a> in 2024, but then paused that move in July amid the escalating M23 offensive. Ituri, the force’s headquarters, is held by M23, meaning the troops are unable to do much.</p><p>Amid the chaos, the finger pointing, and the political games, it’s the Congolese people who are feeling the most despair at the turn of events so close to the new year, analysts say. After more than three decades of war that has turned the green, undulating hills of eastern DRC into a perpetual battlefield, Masameko in Goma said it’s locals, more than anyone else, with the most at stake.</p><p>“People have suffered enough and need to breathe, to sleep with the certainty that they will wake up tomorrow,” he said. “[They need] to live in their homes without fear of a bomb falling on them. That is all the people in this part of the republic need.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
