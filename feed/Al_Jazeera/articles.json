Months later, a senior US Navy admiral said the US had carried out what he said was the “largest air strike in the history of the world” from an aircraft carrier, marking a sharp departure from the previous administration’s approach.</p><p>The strike total this year already surpasses the combined number carried out under Presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and it puts Trump on track to potentially exceed even his own first-term record of 219 strikes.</p><p>The intensified campaign targets both al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate that has fought Somalia’s government since 2007 and controls large areas of the south-central regions, and ISIL (SIS) in Somalia, a smaller offshoot concentrated in the northeast with an estimated 1,500 fighters.</p><p>Somalia’s war with armed groups was Africa’s third-deadliest over the last year, killing 7,289 people, according to the US-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies.</p><p>The United States has been allied with Somalia’s federal government, training elite forces and conducting air strikes in support of local operations. US troops have also been based in the country.</p><p>The surge in strikes follows a directive by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that reversed Biden-era restrictions requiring White House approval for strikes outside warzones, giving AFRICOM commanders greater authority to launch attacks.</p><p>David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation, told Al Jazeera there appeared to be “a demand signal from the White House for escalation” and “a willingness to allow more clearly offensive uses of strikes with less scrutiny and regulation”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Sterman, who has monitored the strikes, identified two main drivers behind the increase.</p><p>More than half the strikes have supported a US-backed campaign by Somalia’s autonomous Puntland region against ISIL-Somalia, launched after the group attacked a military convoy in December 2024.</p><p>The strikes have shifted from occasionally targeting senior figures to sustained operations aimed at members of the group who have hemmed themselves into the caves in the mountains in northern Somalia, Sterman added.</p><p>The remainder focus on al-Shabaab’s advances against Somali government forces in the south, as US strikes support a Somali National Army that has faced setbacks on the ground this year.</p><p>The February 1 operation that opened the campaign saw 16 F/A-18 Super Hornets launch from the USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea, dropping 60 tonnes of munitions on cave complexes in the Golis Mountains. The strike killed 14 people, according to Africa Command.</p><h2 id=\"somali-civilians-under-us-fire\">Somali civilians under US fire</h2><p>However, the intensified operations have raised concerns about civilian casualties.</p><p>The investigative outlet Drop Site News reported in December that US air strikes and Somali forces killed at least 11 civilians, including seven children, during a November 15 operation in the Lower Jubba region, citing witnesses.</p><p>Africa Command confirmed conducting strikes to support Somali troops, but did not respond to Drop Site requests for comment on the civilian deaths.</p><p>The US military recently stopped providing civilian casualty assessments in its strike announcements.</p><p>According to the military publication Stars and Stripes, the pace of operations now exceeds even the US’s claimed counter-narcotics strikes in the Caribbean.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the meantime, Trump launched racist verbal attacks earlier this month on Somali immigrants in the US state of Minnesota, as federal authorities prepared to launch a major immigration crackdown targeting hundreds of undocumented Somalis in the state of Minnesota.</p><p>His comments have been <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">denounced</a> in several quarters, from Mogadishu to Minneapolis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

capitalism triggered demand for Ukrainian steel slabs and iron ore, corn and sunflower oil.</p><p>However, the most prized export items from impoverished Ukraine were the Soviet-era arsenal of weapons it did not think it needed any more.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Kyiv sold Beijing aerospace components, helicopter and tank engines, and technology transfers for the manufacturing of radars, naval gas turbines and jet engines, helping to reshape China’s defence industry.</p><p>It even admitted to illegally shipping six nuclear-capable Kh-55 cruise missiles.</p><p>The pinnacle of military-industrial exports was the 1998 sale of the Soviet-era Varyag aircraft carrier, whose construction began but never finished on the wharves of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv.</p><p>Beijing pledged to use the 306-metre (1,004-foot) long vessel for training but turned it into its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning.</p><h2 id=\"china-can-end-the-war\">‘China can end the war’</h2><p>The tables have turned during the Russia-Ukraine war, when China became the side that profits the most from the fierce competition between Russian and Ukrainian drone developers.</p><p>It is “always” a Chinese manufacturer of unmanned aircraft “who earns the most”, Andrey Pronin, one of the drone warfare pioneers in Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He was standing in the storeroom of his school for drone pilots on the outskirts of Kyiv – next to a dozen drones that ranged from what looked like a tiny replica of a World War I biplane to a jet-driven mini-missile to tiny first-person-view drones.</p><p>Each of them consisted of Chinese-made components – engines, flight controllers, batteries, thermal cameras and navigation modules.</p><p>These components have been the backbone of Ukraine’s drone industry, which churns out millions of loitering munitions annually.</p><p>They are also one of the reasons why Ukraine has not lost the war.</p><p>“China can end the war in one day by just turning off the export [of drone parts] either to us or to Russians,” Pronin said.</p><p>Ukrainian drone manufacturers work frantically to localise the production of key components, such as frames, avionics, engines and radios, according to a report by Snake Island, a military research group in Kyiv.</p><p>And yet, “the industry still depends on a narrow set of critical imports – lithium salts, neodymium magnets, navigation chips, and thermal sensors – where China holds disproportionate leverage”, it said in a report released in October.</p><h2 id=\"should-the-strategic-partnership-be-restored\">Should the strategic partnership be restored?</h2><p>What is even more important to Kyiv is how, not if, it will rebuild ties with Beijing after the war is over.</p><p>In 2011, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Kyiv and signed a strategic partnership agreement with his then-Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yanukovych, who was staunchly pro-Russian.</p><p>Before the 2013 launch of its Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth project to build transport infrastructure from China to Europe, Beijing counted on Ukraine to become its focal point.</p><p>Ukraine has a Black Sea coast and borders the delta of the Danube River, an ancient trade route that flows through or borders nine European nations.</p><p>But in early 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia after a months-long popular uprising – and weeks later, Moscow annexed Crimea and spurred a separatist revolt in southeastern Ukraine.</p><p>Seeing Beijing as Russia’s main international backer, Kyiv cooled ties with China.</p><p>“These days, our ties, political ties, are at point zero – at a moment when China is Ukraine’s main economic partner,” Kyiv-based analyst Vadym Denysenko told a news conference earlier this month.</p><p>In 2020, the China-Ukraine trade turnover reached $15.4bn, amounting to about one-seventh of Kyiv’s foreign trade.</p><p>Despite the war, China still has not lost its appetite for Ukrainian grain, steel, vegetables, oil and soya beans – and these exports help keep Ukraine’s economy afloat.</p><p>After the war, Kyiv will have to rebuild and expand ties with Beijing – at least because its geographic position between the Black Sea and the European Union is still “very interesting” to the Belt and Road Initiative, Denysenko said.</p><h2 id=\"not-beneficial-for-russia\">‘Not beneficial for Russia’</h2><p>Ukraine will need to replace its czarist-era railways with Western ones that have a narrower track gauge and expand its port on the Danube to give China better access to the EU, according to a detailed report by Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich.</p><p>Irrespective of Beijing’s post-war ties with Moscow, Kyiv will need to boost its export of steel and foodstuffs to China, allow Beijing to open plants to assemble Chinese cars and machine tools, and use Ukrainian steel, the report said.</p><p>“We need localisation with the possibility of buying out rights to certain brands,” Tyshkevich said.</p><p>Ukraine could use its Soviet-era expertise to create joint projects to develop aircraft, pharmaceuticals and nuclear energy.</p><p>“Because Ukraine’s participation not only as a recipient, but as a transit country, as a key player that also influences the development of these projects, of course, is not beneficial for Russia,” he said.</p><p>Other analysts agree that China’s sphere of interest is too large to ignore and that Ukraine should become part of it.</p><p>Kyiv’s failure to restore ties with China “will cost our nation dearly”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Essentially, our diplomacy didn’t just write off China, but the entire Global South, or more than half of the globe,” he said, referring to the nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America that were once European colonies and are opposed to Western domination.</p><p>Ukraine should become part of “the Eurasian Steppe Corridor” from northeast China via Kazakhstan, the Southern Caucasus to the Black Sea nations – Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, he said.</p><p>It implies Ukraine joining Eurasian logistical routes and a conception of Ukraine as “a hub nation, a bridge nation, a plastic link nation”, he said.</p><p>“Everything should be done so that goods move across the Eurasian Steppe Corridor, not foreign troops,” Kushch said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, he accused “radical Islamists” of “mass slaughter” and warned that the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/6/why-has-trump-threatened-to-attack-nigeria-guns-a\">guns-a-blazing</a>“.</p><p data-start=\"520\" data-end=\"668\">The claim rested on a familiar assumption: that violence in Nigeria is driven by religious ideology, with Christians targeted by Islamist militants.</p><p data-start=\"670\" data-end=\"1077\">In mid-November, a new wave of school abductions revealed how perilous parts of northern Nigeria have become for children of all faiths. On November 17, armed men raided Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, killing a vice principal and abducting 25 students. The school was state-run, and the victims were Muslim girls. One escaped, and the remaining 24 were later rescued.</p><p data-start=\"1079\" data-end=\"1533\">Days later, in the early hours of November 21, gunmen stormed St Mary’s Catholic Primary and Secondary School in Papiri, Niger State, abducting pupils and teachers. While some captives later escaped or were released, many remained missing into mid-December, leaving families in agonising uncertainty. Parents continue to wait without answers, their desperation and anguish hardening into anger as official assurances fade.</p><p data-start=\"1535\" data-end=\"1795\">Taken together, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/nigeria-school-kidnapping-whos-behind-it-why-were-children-targeted\">these attacks</a> do not reflect a campaign of religious persecution. They follow a pattern that has become increasingly familiar across northern Nigeria: mass kidnapping for ransom, striking opportunistically rather than along religious lines.</p><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"2107\">Trump’s remarks do more than misdiagnose this violence. They reimagine it. With a few lines of incendiary rhetoric, a country grappling with criminal insecurity and institutional collapse is recast as a front line in a civilisational struggle — a place where force, not reform, becomes the implied solution.</p><p data-start=\"2109\" data-end=\"2225\">Once framed that way, Nigeria is no longer a society in need of protection and repair, but a battlefield-in-waiting.</p><p data-start=\"2227\" data-end=\"2448\">That shift matters. When violence is described as religious war rather than organised crime, responsibility moves outwards, solutions become militarised, and foreign intervention begins to sound not reckless but righteous.</p><p data-start=\"2450\" data-end=\"2484\">This pattern is hardly surprising.</p><p data-start=\"2486\" data-end=\"2631\">American power has a habit of transforming complex foreign crises into apocalyptic moral dramas, and then acting on the story it has told itself.</p><p data-start=\"2633\" data-end=\"2972\">Nonetheless, Nigerian church leaders, who know the terrain and the people intimately, reject Washington’s narrative. The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, a leading figure in Nigeria’s peacebuilding efforts, for example, <a href=\"https://www.aciafrica.org/news/18981/nigerian-foundation-defends-catholic-bishop-after-remarks-on-genocide-targeting-christians?utm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cautioned</a> against interpreting the violence as religious warfare, pointing instead to criminal motives and state failure.</p><p data-start=\"2974\" data-end=\"3126\">Analysts concurred, emphasising that attacks fall on Christians and Muslims alike and often follow patterns of banditry and ransom rather than theology.</p><p data-start=\"3128\" data-end=\"3439\">In Kebbi State, the victims were Muslim schoolgirls taken from a state-run boarding school. In Niger State, the targets were pupils and teachers at a Catholic mission school. Across Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Niger and Plateau states, villages have been raided, farms abandoned and populations displaced.</p><p data-start=\"3441\" data-end=\"3539\">This violence is driven primarily by profit-driven criminal violence rather than religious belief.</p><p data-start=\"3541\" data-end=\"3726\">Chronic poverty, rural neglect and youth unemployment — with about 72 percent of rural Nigerians living in multidimensional poverty — fuel recruitment into criminal and armed networks.</p><p data-start=\"3728\" data-end=\"4067\">True to Bishop Kukah’s analysis, ideology accounts for far less of this violence than predatory criminal behaviour and opportunism. What flourishes instead is organised crime in areas where the state barely functions. The principal threat now stems from armed “bandit” networks rather than a single ideologically driven insurgent movement.</p><p data-start=\"4069\" data-end=\"4328\">These criminal militias kidnap schoolchildren and commuters for ransom, rustle cattle, extort villages, attack highways and, according to multiple reports, increasingly tap into illegal mining economies, often operating from forest bases across the northwest.</p><p data-start=\"4330\" data-end=\"4665\">At the same time, Nigeria is not confronting one armed threat but several. Across the northeast, Boko Haram and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP) remain active. In the northwest and north-central regions, armed bandit networks dominate. Further south, in the middle belt, militia violence feeds on land disputes and communal tensions.</p><p data-start=\"4667\" data-end=\"4748\">The outcome has been mass displacement and civilian death on a devastating scale.</p><p data-start=\"4750\" data-end=\"5211\">Amnesty International estimates that more than 10,000 civilians were killed in armed attacks in the two years after May 29, 2023, when President Bola Tinubu took office. Hundreds of villages have been destroyed or emptied. Thousands of children have abandoned school. In parts of the northwest, attacks are reported to occur weekly and, at times, even daily. More disturbingly, kidnapping now reaches highways and commuter routes in and around the capital, Abuja.</p><p data-start=\"5213\" data-end=\"5312\">To treat this catastrophe as religious persecution is not just inaccurate but profoundly dangerous. This false framing transforms organised crime and state collapse into a myth of religious war, one that obscures causes and invites disastrous cures.</p><p data-start=\"5465\" data-end=\"5529\">That is why language matters: it shapes intent and consequences.</p><p data-start=\"5531\" data-end=\"5731\">When Washington defines domestic collapse as moral failure, Nigeria ceases to be seen as a country in need of reconstruction and starts to look like an international threat to be managed from outside.</p><p data-start=\"5733\" data-end=\"5866\">Global attention shifts from strengthening local institutions towards employing financial leverage, coercive tools and military force.</p><p data-start=\"5868\" data-end=\"5917\">Communities become talking points in US politics.</p><p data-start=\"5919\" data-end=\"6145\">In the process, Nigerian citizens are reduced to abstractions rather than treated as living human beings with rights, and localities like Kebbi and Niger are recast as conflict zones instead of places in need of urgent repair.</p><p data-start=\"6147\" data-end=\"6216\">When powerful states define a crisis, they begin shaping the outcome.</p><p data-start=\"6218\" data-end=\"6248\">History offers no reassurance.</p><p data-start=\"6250\" data-end=\"6399\">From Iraq to Libya, US-led interventions have ushered in untold devastation, leaving in their wake public institutions in ruins and wars without end.</p><p data-start=\"6401\" data-end=\"6465\">Crucially, every military campaign promised peace and stability. Over time, every mission has killed thousands of civilians and left entire countries in ruins.</p><p data-start=\"6561\" data-end=\"6772\">If US forces entered Nigeria, even in small numbers, foreign troops would quickly become magnets for attack and targets for retaliation, turning villages and forest communities into potential battlefields.</p><p data-start=\"6774\" data-end=\"6915\">Communities would be squeezed between bandits and foreign firepower, as criminal networks splinter, rebrand and adapt to the new battlefield.</p><p data-start=\"6917\" data-end=\"7021\">This is the architecture of the US’s war cycle: an excuse first, force second, and civilian lives last.</p><p data-start=\"7023\" data-end=\"7242\">Nigeria should not assume immunity from this great power logic, as countries do not become warzones overnight. They are first described as failures, then reframed as threats, before being treated as acceptable targets.</p><p data-start=\"7244\" data-end=\"7292\">Nigeria’s institutional weakness is no accident. It is rooted in years of protecting assets instead of people, while neglecting policing, justice and basic services.</p><p data-start=\"7412\" data-end=\"7684\">Colonial and post-colonial rule built systems for natural resource extraction rather than citizen protection. For many decades, often under military rule, securing oil revenue and political control mattered more than effective governance, public welfare or human security.</p><p data-start=\"7686\" data-end=\"7847\">In the Niger Delta, this approach has meant environmental ruin, loss of livelihoods and institutional neglect — the true cost of protecting wealth before people.</p><p data-start=\"7849\" data-end=\"8008\">Today, that systemic design persists: the state still defends assets more effectively than lives, while inequality and neglect have deepened civilian exposure.</p><p data-start=\"8010\" data-end=\"8045\">Even so, Nigeria still has options.</p><p data-start=\"8047\" data-end=\"8353\">In late November, Tinubu declared a nationwide security emergency, ordered the recruitment of 20,000 additional police officers as part of a broader expansion plan, redeployed VIP escorts to front-line duties, and authorised the deployment and expansion of DSS forest guards to hunt bandits and rebels.</p><p data-start=\"8355\" data-end=\"8460\">Whether these moves produce results depends not on announcements but on enforcement and extensive reform.</p><p data-start=\"8462\" data-end=\"8627\">Police and intelligence services must be strengthened and reoriented towards community protection, with proper oversight and resourcing, not merely expanded on paper.</p><p data-start=\"8629\" data-end=\"8806\">Only about 15 percent of Nigerians say they trust the police, while many view officers as corrupt or violent, leaving communities fearful of both criminals and law enforcement.</p><p data-start=\"8808\" data-end=\"8953\">Courts and financial regulators need the capacity to dismantle ransom and extortion networks as business systems, not only to chase their gunmen.</p><p data-start=\"8955\" data-end=\"9156\">Regionally, Nigeria must push for serious cooperation on intelligence sharing, border control and joint operations, or armed groups will continue to move freely across borders with near-total impunity.</p><p data-start=\"9158\" data-end=\"9215\">From Washington, Nigeria does not need troops or threats.</p><p data-start=\"9217\" data-end=\"9429\">It requires support to rebuild the institutions that keep citizens safe: forensic capacity, actionable intelligence, training and diplomatic backing that strengthens Nigerian sovereignty instead of overriding it.</p><p data-start=\"9431\" data-end=\"9609\">With about 61 percent of Nigerians reporting that they have felt unsafe in their communities in recent years, this must be a national wake-up call for Nigeria’s political class.</p><p data-start=\"9611\" data-end=\"9712\">Only a comprehensive solution can deliver peace and protect besieged communities in northern Nigeria.</p><p data-start=\"9714\" data-end=\"9769\">Trump must de-escalate. Tinubu must act decisively.</p><p data-start=\"9771\" data-end=\"9918\">What will determine Nigeria’s future is not foreign firepower, but whether its institutions are rebuilt to protect citizens rather than assets.</p><p data-start=\"9771\" data-end=\"9918\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
