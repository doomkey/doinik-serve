She alleges that those apps fueled suicidal thoughts and depression.</p><p>Lanier alleged that Zuckerberg misled Congress about the design of its social media platforms.</p><p>Zuckerberg was questioned on his statements to the US Congress in 2024, during a hearing in which he said the company did not give its teams the goal of maximising time spent on its apps.</p><p>Lanier showed jurors emails from 2014 and 2015 in which Zuckerberg laid out aims to increase time spent on the app by double-digit percentage points. Zuckerberg said that while Meta previously had goals related to the amount of time users spent on the app, it has since changed its approach.</p><p>“If you are trying to say my testimony was not accurate, I strongly disagree with that,” Zuckerberg said.</p><h2 id=\"high-stakes\">High stakes</h2><p>The stakes are higher at the jury trial. Meta may have to pay damages if it loses the case, and the verdict could erode Big Tech’s longstanding legal defence against claims of user harm that liability is on the user and not the platform.</p><p>TikTok and Snap, who were previously named in the case, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached a settlement.</a> TikTok settled the same day the case began for undisclosed terms. Snap settled a week before, also for undisclosed terms.</p><p>The case is the first among a slew of similar ones that allege that social media platforms designed features that the companies knew would addict young consumers and affect their mental health. Families, school districts and states around the US have filed roughly 1,600 lawsuits against various social media giants, including Meta, TikTok, Google and Snap.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The outcome will help determine how to handle the remaining cases. The jury’s decisions will provide guidance,” Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based media law and entertainment lawyer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If the plaintiffs lose and the defendants successfully argue that the platforms are not products, that there is no causation, or that the algorithms had nothing to do with the alleged harm, and that the plaintiffs’ own circumstances are responsible, then Meta and Google’s YouTube will likely take a firmer stance in the remaining cases.”</p><p>Meta has denied the allegations made by KGM.</p><p>“We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most.”</p><p>Meta introduced new safety features in 2025, including, in April, blocking teens under 16 from going live on Instagram. In September, the company launched a school partnership programme that gives educators expedited review of complaints, such as cyberbullying.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s testimony follows Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who appeared in front of the court last week. He said he was unaware of an internal Meta study that showed that there is no link between parental supervision and teens’ attentiveness to their own social media use.</p><p>Teens with difficult life circumstances more often said they used Instagram habitually or unintentionally, according to the document shown at trial.</p><p>Paul Schmidt, one of Meta’s lawyers, did not dispute KGM’s mental health challenges, but argued that Instagram was not a substantial factor in her struggles. He attributed her difficulties to problems at home and said she used social media as a coping mechanism for deeper personal issues.</p><p id=\"the-question-for-the-jury-in-los-angeles-is-whether-instagram-was-a-substantial-factor-in-the-plaintiff-s-mental-health-struggles-the-evidence-will-show-she-faced-many-significant-difficult-challenges-well-before-she-ever-used-social-media-a-meta-spokesperson-added\">“The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles. The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,” a Meta spokesperson added.</p><h2 id=\"wide-ramifications\">Wide ramifications</h2><p>The case itself is seen as one that could fundamentally change social media, with legal experts likening it to lawsuits that faced the tobacco industry decades ago.</p><p>Social media platforms have largely been protected by Section 230, a provision added in 1996 to the Communications Act of 1934. The law protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But this latest case emboldens critics calling for reforms, according to Lovell.</p><p>“Lawmakers may need to carve out greater obligations and duties for internet and social media companies rather than maintain blanket immunity,” Lovell said.</p><p>“With the rise of artificial intelligence and ongoing online abuse, Section 230 has become an enabler for those who want to harm others. Guardrails are needed.”</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock ended the day up 0.61 percent, but is down in after-hours trading at the time of publishing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She shows him in to get his bloodwork done, and then they do not meet for the next few months.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Sanchez said she has been staying up late thinking of S and other patients with complex medical conditions, many of whom she has seen since their childhood. United States President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, would require S and other such patients to fill out paperwork every six months to determine their eligibility for Medi-Cal, the California version of the federally funded medical coverage programme known as Medicaid.</p><p>This is a complex task for patients like S, whose name is being withheld to protect patient privacy.</p><p>“It is hard for him to even grasp the changes,” Sanchez said.</p><p>The OBBBA sought to save $100bn in expenses by asking patients to fill out eligibility paperwork more often, increasing work requirements to maintain coverage for those who can work and eliminating those ineligible.</p><p>“He can’t understand why he has to fill forms so often,” Sanchez said about S. While he has a caretaker for now, she said, “patients like him can just fall through the cracks” in the new system.</p><p>Sanchez belongs to the California branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU-UHW) for health workers, which has proposed a billionaire tax, a one-time 5 percent tax on those who have assets of more than $1bn in the state, to make up for funds lost due to the federal retrenchment.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democrat from Vermont, will launch a campaign at a rally in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening to get 875,000 signatures so the tax can be voted on by California residents in the November midterms. If it passes, it will be applied retroactively from January 1 to anyone who had lived in the state then.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321485\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321485\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Sanchez-1-1771393750.jpeg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321485\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Sanchez-1-1771393750.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Karen Sanchez\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Healthcare worker Karen Sanchez’s union has proposed a billionaire tax to make up for funds lost due to the federal retrenchment [Courtesy SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West]</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed tax has already deeply divided the state.</p><p>Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have reportedly bought houses in Florida and moved some of their companies with a view to shifting their tax status.</p><p>“This isn’t a tax on billionaires; it’s a tax on California’s economy,” said Patrick Kallerman, vice president at the Bay Area Council, a San Francisco-based business association.</p><p>Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, issued a statement ahead of Sanders’ rally saying, “this $100 billion tax increase isn’t just a swipe at California’s most successful entrepreneurs, it’s a tax no one can afford because it weakens the entire economic ecosystem that supports jobs, investment, wages, and public services for everyday Californians.”</p><p>California would be the world’s fourth-largest economy if it were a country, in part due to the technology giants in the Bay Area. Tech billionaires moving away could make the state’s finances precarious.</p><p>Governor Gavin Newsom, who recently announced a nearly $3bn budget deficit, partly due to the federal funding cuts, has already distanced himself from the ballot measure.</p><p>Billionaires should not move out of the state due to a tax that is unlikely to be passed, he told Bloomberg News.</p><p>Bay Area Council’s Kallerman said California should avoid policies that “could unintentionally discourage investment or make it harder for employers to expand here”.</p><p>But even as Sanders launches his statewide campaign this week, Sanchez has already spent most evenings after work at a nearby brewery, collecting the signatures needed by the end of April deadline.</p><h2 id=\"extreme-wealth-masks-deep-poverty\">Extreme wealth masks deep poverty</h2><p>While the impact of the federal restrictions on Medicaid will be felt nationwide, California has 14.5 million recipients, more than any other state in the country.</p><p>More than a third of all its residents and half the children in the state are on Medi-Cal. This is not only because it is the most populous state, but also because it has not been as aggressive on performing eligibility checks as some other states, according to Marc Joffe, the president of the Contra Costa Taxpayers Association and a visiting fellow at the California Policy Center.</p><p>But others believe California’s extreme wealth masks the coexistence of deep poverty. Nearly 200,000 recipients could now lose their coverage due to the increased paperwork, said Suzanne Jiminez, chief of staff at the SEIU-UHW.</p><p>Darien Shanske, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, said it was the “moment of crisis” created by the OBBBA that had pushed him and others to draft the tax on the state’s estimated 200 billionaires. In exploring the various alternatives to make up for the lost funds due to Trump’s bill, he had thought about “the failure of income tax to reach the ultra wealthy”.</p><p>But critics of a billionaire tax, such as the California Policy Center’s Joffe, say that the estimates of those who would lose cover may be overblown.</p><p>For instance, he said, those who can work could be asked to work, get involved in the community or go to college in exchange for their coverage. New undocumented migrants will not be enrolled from this year, and they will have to pay $30 from next year onwards for their coverage.</p><p>“It’s not as big a deal as the unions say,” Joffe told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Most of all, it is the taxing of intangible assets, including equity shares, that has raised hackles. Successful startup founders often have their wealth in the form of equity in their companies, making them billionaires. But imposing a tax on this “punishes people for being innovative”, Joffe said. “There is the emotional aspect of it, the perceived injustice.”</p><p>This sentiment could be at the heart of the flurry of moves out of the state. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is in talks to buy a $200m home in Miami, possibly becoming the latest of several billionaires to move out of California as the prospect of the billionaire tax looms, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Days before the January 1, 2026, applicable date for the tax, should it come into place, Google cofounders terminated or moved 15 related companies from the state, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Billionaires are also funding opposition to the tax. Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, who has also reportedly moved out of the state, donated $3m to a political committee of the California Round Table to oppose the measure. More such donations are expected to flow in.</p><p>But Jiminez of the SEIU-UHW said the idea of a flight of capital and talent “is a scare tactic that will not play out”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A banner bearing portraits of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg with a slogan is seen during a demonstration against the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the eve of the WEF annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2026.

They are also strong sources of employment in these communities.</p><p>Sanchez spent Valentine’s Day evening and most evenings this month at a brewery near her house collecting signatures for the ballot measure from customers, while her kids did homework on a table nearby.</p><p>Daniel Schnur, a political analyst who also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Government Studies, said that “it would be surprising if [the measure] didn’t qualify” for the November ballots. “The timing of it may be very effective.”</p><p>While many voters who have aspired to be wealthy may looked up to Silicon Valley billionaires, they have become more disenchanted, he said.</p><p>A 2025 Harris poll found that 94 percent of respondents said that a wealth gap exists, with corporate tax loopholes being a top driver behind the disparity. Some 71 percent of the respondents said they supported a wealth tax.</p><p>California’s billionaire tax proposal also found support in a poll conducted in January by the Mellman Group for a Republican strategist, with 48 percent respondents saying they supported it and 38 percent saying they did not.</p><p>With opinion deeply divided between the state’s unions on one side and its top taxpayers on the other, Newsom, who is in his final term as governor, could face a difficult balancing act ahead.</p><p>“What is the governor’s plan?” Sanchez asked about the increased paperwork and possible loss of Medi-Cal coverage for many residents.</p><p>Given that the loss of taxpayers due to the proposed billionaire’s tax could have a detrimental impact on the state’s already precarious budget, getting signatures for the measure could be just the beginning of a rocky path ahead.</p><p>“It is likely that Governor Newsom will try to find a legislative solution to this. Legislators could seek to modify the bill if it is acceptable to the movers,” Schnur said.</p><p>California Policy Center’s Joffe said that if the measure gets voted on in November, it could also face legal challenges, and “will be litigated up to the Supreme Court”.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and conservative commentator, has said that with the billionaires moving their homes, the prospect of the tax has already <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/california-billionaire-tax-proposal-hemorrhages-1-trillion-billionaires-flee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led to $1 trillion</a> leaving the state. It is not clear how he arrived at that figure.</p><p>But “this is paper mobility”, said Shanske, the bill’s co-author.</p><p>“People club where there is talent and amenities, and gutting healthcare will make the state less attractive.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The segment in question involves an appearance from Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democrat who is vying for the US Senate.</p><p>The confirmation comes as Carr attempted to shut down claims that the government censored an interview between Talarico and late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert.</p><p>“There was no censorship here at all,” Carr said.</p><p>“Every single broadcaster in this country has an obligation to be responsible for the programming that they choose to air, and they’re responsible whether it complies with FCC rules or not, and it doesn’t, and those individual broadcasters are also going to have a potential liability.”</p><p>The controversy with Colbert likewise stems from the Trump administration’s decision to shift definitions under the “equal time” rule.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-equal-time-rule\">What is the ‘equal time’ rule?</h2><p>The rule is part of section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act. Under that law, if a broadcaster allows one candidate for public office to use its facilities, it is required to “afford equal opportunities” to all other candidates in the same race.</p><p>But the law includes exceptions for “bona fide newscasts” and “bona fide news interviews”.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, talk shows and late-night comedy programmes <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/us-fcc-notice-to-broadcasters-prompts-concerns-on-curtailing-free-speech\">were included</a> in those categories.</p><p>In January, however, the FCC issued new guidance (<a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-68A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) that significantly narrows how it interprets the “bona fide news” exemption. In a memo, it described daytime talk shows and late-night comedy as “entertainment programs” that fall outside the exception.</p><p>“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the memo reads.</p><p>The commission also suggested that many such programmes are “motivated by partisan purposes” and are therefore not “bona fide” news.</p><p>The new interpretation of the “equal time” rule, the FCC argued, is designed to “ensure that no legally qualified candidate for office is unfairly given less access to the public airwaves than their opponent.”</p><h2 id=\"controversy-with-colbert\">Controversy with Colbert</h2><p>That new interpretation came roaring into the spotlight on Monday, after a broadcast of the CBS comedy programme The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p>In one of his opening segments, Colbert alleged that the network lawyers barred him from airing a planned interview that night with Talarico.</p><p>“Let’s just call it what it is,” Colbert told his audience. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time.”</p><p>Trump has previously criticised both Colbert’s show and The View for what he considers a left-wing slant.</p><p>Instead of broadcasting his interview with Talarico on network television, Colbert instead posted the segment on the programme’s YouTube page, where it has gained more than 6 million views as of 3:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday.</p><p>According to Carr, Colbert’s show could have aired the Talarico interview if it had complied with the equal time rule.</p><p>That would have involved allowing other candidates in Texas vying for the Senate seat to come on the show. Carr also suggested that another solution could have been to restrict the broadcast in Texas.</p><p>But the FCC has continued to face criticisms for its actions. In Tuesday’s broadcast, Colbert addressed the issue a second time.</p><p>He read aloud a statement from his broadcast channel that read, in part, that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview” and that it was instead “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule”.</p><p>CBS added, in the statement, that Colbert could have invited onto the show Talarico’s rivals, including fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett.</p><p>“I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert responded. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents.”</p><p>Colbert has been a vocal critic of CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, particularly after it settled a lawsuit last year with the Trump administration for $16m in the run-up to a critical merger for which it needed government approval.</p><p>Talarico, meanwhile, accused the FCC of censoring his interviews. Nevertheless, on Wednesday, he noted that the uptick in media attention from the scandal has helped him gather donations.</p><p>“Our campaign raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the FCC banned our Colbert interview,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2024124888391287234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"

win in all competitions but fell behind in the 20th minute on Wednesday when midfielder Sondre Brunstad Fet netted with a neat finish.</p><p>Although burly striker Pio Esposito equalised with an opportunist finish 10 minutes later, the home side picked off Inter with two goals in quick succession in the second half.</p><p>Both were similar, with quick passing and unselfish assists.</p><p>For the second goal, forward Kasper Hogh rolled the ball for Jens Petter Hauge to launch a powerful shot into the top corner in the 61st.</p><p>The winger, who once had a brief spell in Serie A with AC Milan, jumped and kicked the corner flag in celebration.</p><p>The fans at the 8,000-capacity Aspmyra Stadion were cheering again three minutes later when Hogh scored the third goal after being teed up by Ole Didrik Blomberg.</p><p>The return leg will be next Tuesday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere, Club Brugge’s Christos ⁠Tzolis ⁠tucked away a late equaliser to secure a dramatic 3-3 ⁠draw with Atletico Madrid in their Champions League playoff ⁠first leg on Wednesday as the Belgian side avoided defeat after an agonising own goal appeared to ‌have cost them.</p><p>Tzolis slammed home an angled shot in the 89th minute to level the tie, although the goal was initially ruled out for ⁠offside, but was confirmed ⁠after a VAR check.</p><p>Brugge fought back from a 2-0 half-time deficit to level ⁠the score, but then looked to have ⁠thrown it away ⁠when Joel Ordonez turned the ball into his own net in the 79th minute.</p><p>Yet ‌they head into next Tuesday’s return leg in Madrid with ‌the ‌scores level.</p><p>Bayer Leverkusen striker Patrik ⁠Schick ⁠struck twice in three minutes to steer his team to ⁠a 2-0 victory at Olympiacos in their Champions League last-16 ⁠playoff first leg on Wednesday.</p><p>The Czech forward slipped past his marker and slotted in on the hour ‌mark before quickly bagging a second goal with a downward header from Alex Grimaldo’s corner.</p><p>In the early game on Wednesday, Anthony Gordon struck four ⁠times in ⁠the first half as Newcastle United thrashed Qarabag 6-1 away ⁠in their Champions League playoff first leg to ⁠all but book their place in the last 16.</p><p>Newcastle was 5-0 up by halftime against Qarabag as Gordon completed his hat-trick in 33 minutes at the Tofik Bakhramov Stadium in Baku and got a fourth in first-half added time.</p><p>Malick Thiaw was also on target for the Premier League team, which had 16 shots in a rampant first half.</p><p>Elvin Jafarguliyev pulled one back for Qarabag, which has been one of the surprise stories of this season’s Champions League after qualifying for the playoffs. But Jacob Murphy’s deflected strike completed the rout for Newcastle, which will be the fifth English team in the last 16 if they advance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

over the occupied West Bank and its continued restrictions on supplies of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip during a special United Nations Security Council meeting on Israel-Palestine.</p><p>Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar told the UNSC on Wednesday that “intensified diplomatic efforts are under way to consolidate the ceasefire, alleviate the suffering of Palestinians and advance implementation of the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“On the other hand, Israel’s continued ceasefire violations, annexation attempts and illegal actions across the occupied Palestinian territories continue to undermine these efforts and threaten the prospect for a just and lasting peace,” he said.</p><p>Dar added that recent steps taken by the Israeli government to deepen control over large swaths of land in the West Bank were “gravely disturbing”.</p><p>His remarks come as dozens of countries, as well as UN experts, have condemned Israel’s West Bank push as a violation of international law and an effort to unlawfully annex the occupied territory.</p><p>Wednesday’s session at UN headquarters in New York was rescheduled from Thursday to avoid coinciding with <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/trumps-board-of-peace-meets-whos-in-whos-out-whats-on-the-agenda\">a planned meeting</a> of United States President Donald Trump’s so-called Board of Peace in Washington, DC.</p><p>The UNSC changed the timing of its meeting to accommodate diplomats who planned to attend both events, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>The overlap is a sign of potential conflicting agendas between the UN’s most powerful body and the board, of which Trump has named himself the indefinite chairman.</p><p>The US president has said he envisions the board having influence “far beyond Gaza”, fuelling concerns that Trump is trying to sideline the UN and enshrine his own “imperial agenda”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"annexation-fears\">Annexation fears</h2><p>Many Arab and Muslim-majority countries had requested that the UNSC address the Gaza “ceasefire” and Israel’s new illegal settlement project, ahead of Trump’s Board of Peace meeting.</p><p>Asked what he hoped to see from the back-to-back events, <span>Palestine’s ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he expected “the international community to stop Israel and end their illegal effort against annexation, whether in Washington or in New York”.</span></p><p>Earlier this week, Mansour was joined by dozens of other UN diplomats as he read out a statement <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/over-80-un-member-states-condemn-israels-de-facto-annexation-of-west-bank\">on behalf of 80 countries</a> that called on Israel to reverse its latest actions in the West Bank and outlined their “strong opposition to any form of annexation”.</p><p>On February 8, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/palestine-urges-powerful-partner-to-stop-west-bank-annexation-by-israel\">Israel’s security cabinet greenlighted measures</a> making it easier for Israelis to seize Palestinian land and directly buy property in the West Bank, while expanding Israel’s military control in the area, home to roughly 3.4 million Palestinians.</p><p>Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the measures amount to “de facto sovereignty” that will block the establishment of a Palestinian state, while Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich pledged to also “encourage” Palestinian “emigration” out of the territory.</p><p>The push comes as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a wave of intensified attacks by Israeli troops and settlers in the shadow of the country’s genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>On Wednesday, four Palestinians were wounded – two of them with live ammunition – during a settler attack in the village of Mukhmas, near occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-gaza-plan\">Trump’s Gaza plan</h2><p>Several diplomats addressed the UNSC on Wednesday, stressing the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in Gaza, who continue to face Israeli attacks.</p><p>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since a US-brokered “ceasefire” came into effect in the enclave in October, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.</p><p>Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said during the council meeting that the “ceasefire” has reduced hostilities while “the scope and the scale of humanitarian assistance” is growing daily.</p><p>While aspects of the Trump-backed plan for Gaza have moved forward, including Hamas releasing all the Israeli captives it was holding and increased amounts of humanitarian supplies getting into the territory, the UN says the level of aid remains insufficient.</p><p>A new technocratic committee has also been appointed to administer Gaza’s daily affairs.</p><p>But the most challenging steps lie ahead, including the deployment of an international security force, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">the disarmament of Hamas</a> and rebuilding Gaza.</p><p>Trump said this week that the Board of Peace members have pledged $5bn towards Gaza reconstruction and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilisation and police forces for the territory.</p><p>Indonesia’s military says up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.</p><p>“We call on all parties to support the Board of Peace,” Waltz said at the UN meeting on Wednesday. “Tomorrow, the Board of Peace will host its inaugural meeting in Washington, with a focus on bringing peace and security.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Mourners spread flower petals, lit candles and somberly clapped in solidarity with the families.</p><p>At a ceremony on Tuesday to honour 19-year-old Sepehr Shokri, his father told gathered crowds, “Don’t talk of death, but of life and happiness”, as he said his son had laid down his life for his country.</p><p>The father had captured hearts last month after releasing an excruciating 12-minute video of himself searching for his son among numerous bodies of killed protesters laid out in the open at the courtyards and warehouses of the Kahrizak medical examiner’s office, on the outskirts of Tehran.</p><p>Some of the commemoration events took place in smaller cities and villages, like Abdanan in the western province of Ilam, where thousands had participated in protests last month. Multiple videos circulating online on Tuesday showed mourners running away in panic from the cemetery of the city as the sound of bullets rang out.</p><p>In the village of Chenar in the Asadabad area of western Hamadan province, people could be seen chanting “death to the dictator” as they marched to pay respects to a father and his 13-year-old son who were gunned down during the protests. Local reports said security forces deployed to the area with armoured vehicles, but officials have not commented.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threats-to-students-and-teachers\">‘Threats to students and teachers’</h2><p>The Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations, a non-governmental body, said on Wednesday that its call for school strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday had been backed by large numbers of teachers and students.</p><p>It said schools in the cities and towns of Shahr-e Rey, Baharestan, Pakdasht, Varamin, and Eslamshahr near Tehran were effectively shut due to the absence of students on Wednesday, while high school students in the town of Andisheh did not attend classes as a way to honour fellow students killed in the protests.</p><p>“These strikes occurred despite threats to students and teachers against striking from school principals, who themselves have been pressured by the Ministry of Education,” the group said, adding that at least 230 children and teenagers were killed last month.</p><p>Iran’s Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi confirmed to state media on Wednesday that some of the children and teenagers arrested during the protests remain incarcerated. He said “many” minors have been released without saying how many were arrested.</p><p>Ehsan Azimirad, the spokesman of the parliament’s education commission, said that 17 percent of the participants in the nationwide protests were teenagers, many of them students.</p><p>“I have even heard that in some schools, an entire class had participated in the riots,” he said, adding that in some provinces, up to 45 percent of protesters were under 20 years old. Officials have previously said that most of the protesters across the country were in their 20s.</p><p>This comes amid widespread reports, also disseminated by some local media outlets, of a heavy presence of security forces near or inside schools in the aftermath of the protests. Some families have been concerned about sending their children to school.</p><p>Universities and dormitories have also become focus points for security forces, with reports indicating that some people have had their phones searched while others have been summoned for questioning. University students have also been among the large number of people arrested from their homes since last month. Iranian authorities have not released overall arrest figures.</p><p>A number of Tehran University students peacefully demonstrated on campus on Wednesday to observe the 40th day since the height of the protest killings.</p><p>Last month, members of the Basij – an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary force – hung up a banner reading “Either death or Khamenei” at one of the entrances of the university, in support of 86-year-old Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">Ali Khamenei</a>. Iranian authorities have also displayed a vehicle burned by “rioters” near another entrance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"clashing-versions-of-events\">Clashing versions of events</h2><p>The Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">claims 3,117 people were killed</a> during the unrest, saying that “terrorists” and “rioters” were behind the violence, and were armed and funded by the United States and Israel, which organised an ultimately failed “coup”.</p><p>A list of victims published by the government last month said 690 of those killed were “terrorists”, with others either civilians or security forces. But it did not say who was classified under which category, or exactly where, how, when or by whom they were killed.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for the widespread use of lethal force against protesters, and have called for the release of those arrested, including doctors and nurses who tried to help wounded protesters. The UN Human Rights Council adopted a censure resolution against Iran’s establishment last month.</p><p>The US-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency</a> says it has verified 7,015 deaths during the unrest and is investigating more than 11,700 other cases. Mai Sato, the UN special rapporteur on Iran, said last month that more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed as information remains limited amid access constraints.</p><p>The Iranian government on Tuesday and Wednesday held its own version of the 40th day ceremonies at the Grand Mosalla of Tehran, a huge mosque in the downtown part of the capital. A number of officials, including government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, were in attendance.</p><p>On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader outlined his classification of the thousands killed during the nationwide protests, and divided them into several groups.</p><p>According to Khamenei, the first group are security forces, recognised as “the greatest of martyrs”.</p><p>The second were “passerby” civilians, he said. “Wherever this bullet [that killed them] may have come from, this incident occurred in the enemy’s sedition, and they are martyrs”.</p><p>“The third group are those who were deceived, who acted naively, who were inexperienced and went along with the seditionists,” Khamenei said, adding, “We ask forgiveness for them; they made mistakes”.</p><p>Outside of those three groups, however, were “corrupt individuals, seditionists, and coup plotters”, who Khamenei said “were consigned to hell”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The rise of Donald Trump and the surge of political rhetoric have created new dangers for the city’s new arrivals, who must navigate unprecedented challenges just to survive and find stability in a place they once believed would offer refuge.</p><p>Within this tense environment, communities of immigrants themselves are strained. New arrivals escaping conflicts in other countries now encounter friction with members of their own communities, as fear, suspicion, and competition over limited resources create divisions where solidarity once prevailed. Kelly, a woman fleeing Colombia, arrives in New York and confronts both a labyrinthine bureaucracy and the harsh realities of a city that has changed. Randall, a native-born son of immigrants, represents a contrasting vision: aligned with conservative politics, he sees New York’s evolving demographic as a challenge, embodying the tension between established residents and the newcomers.</p><p>Amid these struggles, Howard, Nuala, and Evelyn dedicate themselves to preserving the spaces that keep the city alive and accessible to everyone. Through community initiatives, mutual aid, and grassroots organising, they work to sustain what makes New York a true sanctuary, even as political and social pressures threaten to fragment the city.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 18 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">18 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"
