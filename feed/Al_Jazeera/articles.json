The protest was called over allegations of “forced” religious conversions by Christians, a claim frequently levelled against the Christian community despite scant evidence.</p><p>That same day, groups of men armed with wooden sticks <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/six-bajrang-dal-men-bail-raipur-mall-vandalism-case-hero-welcome-10453462/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stormed</a> a shopping mall in Raipur, vandalising Christmas decorations and disrupting celebrations. Police filed a case against 30 to 40 unidentified attackers, but arrested only six. They were released on bail within days and, upon their release, were greeted with public processions, garlands, and chants outside the jail, videos of which circulated widely on social media.</p><p>On Christmas morning, Modi visited a Catholic church in New Delhi to celebrate the occasion, but did not condemn the violence.</p><p>This incident was not the only one. According to a new report, religious hate speech and violence in India are escalating, with the country’s small Christian minority emerging as an increasingly visible target, alongside Muslims, in a climate of intensifying Hindu majoritarian rhetoric.</p><p>The research by India Hate Lab, a project of the Washington, DC-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), has found that the country recorded a total of 1,318 hate speech events in 2025, an average of more than three per day.</p><p>These events, organised and led largely by Hindu majoritarian groups as well as the governing BJP, targeted Muslims and Christians, marking a 97 percent increase in hate speech since 2023, and a 13 percent rise over 2024. While Muslims remained a primary target, the report found a sharp rise in anti-Christian rhetoric. Hate speech events targeting Christians rose from 115 in 2024 to 162 in 2025, a 41 percent increase.</p><p>This was borne out in the violence and intimidation unleashed by Hindu supremacists on Christmas celebrations last month. Instances were recorded across India, in the capital state of Delhi, as well as the states of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. Raipur, where the mob ravaged the mall, is the capital of Chhattisgarh.</p><p>In Madhya Pradesh, a leader from Modi’s BJP led a mob that disrupted and <a href=\"https://www.newslaundry.com/2025/12/23/she-told-me-i-am-blind-because-of-my-past-deeds-woman-recounts-abuse-at-christmas-event\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attacked</a> a Christmas lunch for visually impaired children.

In Kerala, some schools reportedly received <a href=\"https://thewire.in/communalism/govt-looking-into-schools-cancelling-christmas-celebrations-due-to-rss-pressure-kerala-edu-minister/?_gl=1*dp0h3c*_ga*NTU1NTA2MzQ0LjE3MDc5MDgzMzE.*_ga_65DW8NFTWS*MTc2NjU0Njg5Mi43NC4xLjE3NjY1NDY4OTMuMC4wLjA.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">threats</a> from officials belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) – the parent organisation of the BJP and many other Hindu majoritarian groups – warning against holding Christmas celebrations, prompting the local government to announce a probe into the matter. This came after an RSS worker <a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/in-india-christmas-is-marked-by-reports-of-sangh-linked-organisations-attacking-christians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attacked</a> teenage carollers in the same state.</p><p>Christians account for only 2.3 percent of India’s population, while Muslims account for 14.2 percent.

Historical Hindu nationalist ideologues – like Vinayak Savarkar and MS Golwalkar, who Modi has publicly honoured – insisted that religious minorities like Muslims and Christians were “unwanted” and “internal enemies” of India, and called for a “permanent war” against them.</p><p>Raqib Naik, the CSOH’s said the instances of hate speech recorded in the recent report mirror this rhetoric. They present Muslims and Christians as “dual threats”, which are “foreign, demonic forces” that want to harm Hindus.</p><p>“Central to this is the ‘forced conversion’ narrative, which portrays every act of Christian charity, education, or healthcare as a deceptive tool for converting Hindus to Christianity,” Naik said. “The most pervasive theme across [the] 2025 incidents is the allegation that Christian missionaries are converting Hindus through inducement.”</p><p>This is despite the fact that between 1951 and the last national census in 2011, the Christian community in India has never exceeded 3 percent of the total population, according to data from the Pew Research Center.</p><p>Within the country’s Christian community, the hate incidents have led to fear and a deep unease, said John Dayal, the former president of the All India Catholic Union and a former member of the National Integration Council, an Indian government advisory body on matters of religious harmony. The fear of vandalism by Hindu supremacists has led to many taking unusual and extreme steps, Dayal said.</p><p>“In Raipur, the archbishop was forced to advise all churches and Christian institutions to seek police protection during Christmas,” Dayal said. “I couldn’t believe that such a letter had to be written.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4236793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4236793\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4236793\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP21297209066614-1768361287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE- In this Thursday, Feb. 27, 2020, file photo, relatives and neighbors wail near the body of Mohammad Mudasir, 31, who was killed in communal violence in New Delhi, India.

The CSOH recorded that 1,289 of the total 1,318 hate speech events had hateful, violent references to Muslims.</p><p>In 2024, this figure was 1,147, while in 2023, it was 668. This shows a 93 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate speech between 2023 and 2025.</p><p>In these hate events, speakers – often from the BJP or affiliated Hindu supremacist groups – invoked conspiracy theories against Muslims: from claiming that Muslims were capturing Hindu land (“land jihad”), to Muslims strategically outnumbering Hindus (“population jihad”), to Muslim men seeking to lure Hindu women in a bid to convert them into Islam (“love jihad”).</p><p>Using such conspiracy theories, a vast majority of these events ended with calls to violence against the Muslim community, the report found. The calls ranged from boycotting Muslims to destroying their places of worship, to picking up arms and violently attacking them.</p><p>“These narratives were designed to paint minorities as organised aggressors, intent on eviscerating Hindu culture, demographic dominance and wealth,” said Naik from the CSOH.</p><p>“The large-scale dissemination of these conspiracies is a deliberate strategy to manufacture an environment of perpetual Hindu victimhood, and to enable the passage of anti-minority laws to ostensibly address these imagined threats,” he added.</p><p>Since the BJP came to power, several Indian states have introduced laws that criminalise coercive religious conversions, but critics have said these laws are veiled attempts to prevent interfaith marriages. Several ministers in these states have <a href=\"https://www.scobserver.in/cases/cjp-v-state-of-up-constitutionality-of-anti-conversion-laws-case-background/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly called</a> the laws attempts to curb “love jihad”.</p><p>In November 2025, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, in its <a href=\"https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025%20Issue%20Systematic%20Religious%20Persecution%20in%20India%20%28002%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual report</a>, highlighted what it called “several discriminatory pieces of legislation” in India, including on citizenship and religious conversion.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4236802\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4236802\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4236802\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-10-31T090904Z_2039488751_RC2IVAABNCX1_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-INDIA-SIKH-SEPARATISTS-1768361399.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C570&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India's Home Minister Amit Shah adjusts his turban during an inauguration ceremony of Gopalanand Swami Yatrik Bhavan at a temple premises in Salangpur, in the western state of Gujarat, India, October 31, 2024.

Almost nine out of 10 hate speech events, 88 percent in all, took place in states governed by the BJP or it allies. Among the top 10 actors involved in the most hate speech, the report found five to be associated with the BJP, including Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, widely viewed as India’s second-most powerful person after Modi.</p><p>The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, as well as of Uttarakhand, Pushkar Singh Dhami, are others named in the report as perpetrators of hate speech. In fact, Dhami topped the list of hate speech actors, with a total of 71 hate speech instances.</p><p>Al Jazeera has reached out to the BJP’s chief spokesperson, Anil Baluni, over text and email, as well as to the Ministry of Home Affairs, for comment. Neither has responded.</p><p>Ram Puniyani, an author and the president of the Centre for the Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS), a research body that works on promoting religious harmony, said the rise in hate is directly linked to the BJP’s electoral fortunes. The 2024 general elections delivered an electoral setback to Modi, whose BJP lost its parliamentary majority but returned to power with allies.</p><p>“The Hindutva foot soldiers have become more and more emboldened by the party’s return to power, and hence, attacks on religious minorities are on the rise,” Puniyani said. Hindutva is the Hindu majoritarian political movement advocated by the RSS.</p><p>Pointing to the attacks on Christian missionaries, Puniyani said it was an attempt to consolidate the BJP’s base among tribal and Dalit communities, where Christian missionaries predominantly work. Dalits, historically viewed as the community least privileged under Hinduism’s complex caste system, have faced systematic discrimination for centuries.</p><p>“All this is very dangerous”, Puniyani said, “because hate speech eventually leads to violence”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s easier,” Trump said on Sunday of his plans for the territory.</p><p>“But one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland.”</p><p>In a rebuke to Trump, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on Tuesday offered some of their most forceful comments yet in defence of Copenhagen’s sovereignty over the territory.</p><p>“If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,” Nielsen said at a joint news conference in Copenhagen.</p><p>“We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU,” he said.</p><p>Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his counterpart in Greenland, Vivian Motzfeldt, are to meet on Wednesday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance in Washington, DC, for talks on the escalating crisis.</p><p>A bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator Thom Tillis, is to arrive in Denmark on Friday for talks.</p><p>The vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 residents have expressed opposition to US control of the territory, according to polling.</p><p>In a survey commissioned by the Danish paper Berlingske last year, 85 percent of residents said they did not wish to join the US with just 6 percent in favour.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Colvin refused to move when asked, leading to her arrest.</p><p>“I remained seated because the lady could have sat in the seat opposite me,” Colvin told reporters in Paris in April 2023.</p><p>“She refused because… a white person wasn’t supposed to sit close to a negro,” Colvin said.</p><p>“People ask me why I refused to move, and I say history had me glued to the seat,” she added.</p><p>Colvin was briefly imprisoned for disturbing public order. The following year, she became one of four Black female plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit challenging segregated bus seating in Montgomery.</p><p>The case was successful, impacting public transportation throughout the US, including trains, aeroplanes and taxis.</p><p>Colvin’s arrest occurred at a time of growing frustration over how Black people were being treated on Montgomery’s bus system. The arrest of Parks in December 1955 triggered the start of the yearlong Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p><p>The boycott propelled the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr into the national limelight and is considered the start of the modern civil rights movement.</p><p>“She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,” the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation said in a statement.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"too-often-overlooked\">‘Too often overlooked’</h2><p>Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said Colvin’s action “helped lay the legal and moral foundation for the movement that would change America”.</p><p>Colvin’s role in helping to trigger the modern civil rights movement is often overshadowed by the actions of Parks, and Reed said her bravery “was too often overlooked”.</p><p>“Claudette Colvin’s life reminds us that movements are built not only by those whose names are most familiar, but by those whose courage comes early, quietly, and at great personal cost,” Reed added.</p><p>While Colvin’s arrest helped to bring an end to racial segregation in the US, there are concerns from civil rights groups that President Donald Trump is looking to roll back policies on social progress.</p><p>On Tuesday, the largest civil rights group in the US said that Trump was being deceptive in his claims that civil rights hurt white people.</p><p>In an interview from last week published by The New York Times, Trump said he believed civil rights-era protections resulted in white people being treated unfairly.</p><p>The comments came after Trump was asked whether protections that began in the 1960s with the passage of the Civil Rights Act resulted in discrimination against white men, according to the newspaper.</p><p>“It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people – people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job,” Trump was quoted as saying.</p><p>“It was a reverse discrimination,” he said.</p><p>In response, NAACP President Derrick Johnson said Trump was “lying through his teeth”.</p><p>“Trump does this all the time. He deliberately invents a false reality to lay the groundwork for policies that further benefit the top one percent by privatising government services and stripping resources away from underserved communities,” said Johnson.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

With 35 international goals in 51 appearances for Nigeria, Osimhen is now just two goals away from equalling the national team record of 37 goals held by the late Rashidi Yekini, a member of the Nigerian side that won the 1994 AFCON and also played at two World Cups.</p><p>Striker Akor Adams has emerged as an unsung hero, contributing two goals and two assists in the last two matches, while Alex Iwobi has been pulling the strings in midfield, and captain Wilfried Ndidi has been equally influential in anchoring the middle of the park.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4229228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229228\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4229228\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_69627c3fdea2-1768062015.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria's forward #09 Victor Osimhen during the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) quarter-final football match between Algeria and Nigeria at the Grand stadium in Marrakesh on January 10, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4229228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nigeria’s star forward Victor Osimhen has found his goal-scoring touch after a slow start to the tournament [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-morocco-s-best-players\">Who are Morocco’s best players?</h2><p>Diaz has arguably been the standout performer of AFCON 2025, scoring in each of his five appearances.
