forces of firing mortar rounds into Ubon Ratchathani province, with one soldier wounded by shrapnel and evacuated for medical treatment.</p><p>“The Thai military unit in the area issued a warning to

National Defence spokeswoman Maly Socheata declined to comment on the alleged strike on Tuesday.</p><p>The nations’ longstanding conflict stems from a dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800km (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.</p><p>Under the December truce, Cambodia and Thailand pledged to ceasefire, freeze troop movements and cooperate on demining efforts along their border.</p><p>Bangkok also released 18 Cambodian soldiers held since July, when deadly border clashes that month killed dozens of people.</p><p><a

release was “a demonstration of goodwill and confidence-building”.</p><p>Phnom Penh said last week it remained “hopeful” that their release would “significantly contribute to building mutual trust”.</p><p>The United States, China and Malaysia had brokered a truce to end the fighting between Cambodia and Thailand in July, but that ceasefire was short-lived.</p><p>In October, US President Donald Trump jetted to Malaysia to oversee the signing of a follow-on declaration, touting new trade deals after the neighbours agreed to prolong their truce.</p><p>But Bangkok suspended the agreement the following month, after Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines while on patrol at the border.</p><p>On Saturday, one week after the December truce went into effect, Cambodia called on Thailand to pull out its forces from several border areas Phnom Penh claims as its own.</p><p>The Thai military has rejected claims it had used force to seize Cambodian territory, insisting its forces were present in areas that had always belonged to Thailand.</p><p>While the two nations agreed late last month to stop fighting, they still need to resolve the demarcation of their disputed border.</p><p>Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement Tuesday morning that Phnom Penh had proposed a bilateral border committee meeting with Thai counterparts to be held in Cambodia’s Siem Reap province this month.</p><p>Bangkok has said previously that meetings to discuss border surveying and demarcation may need to be held by Thailand’s next government, following elections scheduled for February 8.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then, in a post on X alongside photos of their meeting, Jaishankar wrote words that demonstrate a dramatic break with New Delhi’s past relationship with the BNP: “Conveyed deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India. Expressed confidence that Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership.”</p><p>For decades, India had been – at times, publicly, on other occasions, privately – opposed to Khaleda’s “vision and values”.</p><p>Where for millions of her supporters in Bangladesh, she represented a heroic struggle against military rule in the 1980s that first brought her to power in 1991, India viewed her with suspicion and distrust. For decades, the BNP had an alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist group that advocates for stronger ties with Pakistan, India’s arch-enemy. Meanwhile, India treated Khaleda’s rival, Sheikh Hasina, and her avowedly secular Awami League party as its natural partners.</p><p>But as Bangladesh prepares for national elections in February, Jaishankar’s comments underscore how India and the BNP appear to be pivoting from their animus towards a closer working relationship.</p><p>Jaishankar’s “very cordial” meeting with Rahman and his team of confidantes in Dhaka presented the “potential of a new phase in the bilateral relationship”, Humayun Kabir, foreign affairs adviser to Rahman, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It’s a shift that circumstances have forced on both India and the Rahman-led BNP, say analysts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212601\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212601\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212601\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20251231__89CL9WF__v2__MidRes__TopshotBangladeshPoliticsZia-1767466712.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"rahman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212601\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BNP’s acting Chairman Tarique Rahman (C) standing alongside chief adviser of the country’s interim government, Muhammad Yunus (2L), during the burial ceremony, on December 31, of Rahman’s mother and the nation’s former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, a day after her death in Dhaka [Photo by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Media Cell/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-new-start\">A new start?</h2><p>Since the student-led July 2024 uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, New Delhi’s decades-long support for the ousted leader has prompted strong anti-India sentiments on Bangladeshi streets.</p><p>Hasina now lives in exile in New Delhi, and India has so far refused to return her to Bangladesh to face the death penalty, after being convicted in absentia by a tribunal on charges related to the brutal crackdown by her security forces on protesters last year. The United Nations estimates that about 1,400 people died in the crackdown.</p><p>Bilateral relations have continued to slide further: After a 2024 protest leader who was vocally anti-India was murdered, protests against India picked up again in Bangladesh. A Hindu Bangladeshi man was lynched. Both countries had to temporarily suspend visa services at their respective high commissions.</p><p>But Hasina’s Awami League is banned from participating in the February elections. And some analysts believe that the BNP is trying to occupy the liberal and centrist political space vacated by the Awami League. It has also broken up with the Jamaat – the Islamist group has since partnered with a party formed by leaders of the 2024 student protest movement, in a formidable alliance.</p><p>The BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are seen as the frontrunners competing to form the next government after the February elections. And while India can’t reconcile with the Jamaat’s politics – and its pro-Pakistan tilt – Rahman has in recent days made statements that are far more palatable to New Delhi.</p><p>Since returning to Dhaka in late December after 17 years in exile, Rahman told supporters that he wanted an inclusive Bangladesh, where minorities are safe.</p><p>His words suggest that Rahman has “matured during his years in exile”, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian foreign secretary who has also served as high commissioner in Dhaka, told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212605\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212605\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212605\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20040214__HKG2004010662380__v2__MidRes__PakistanSaarcClosingVajpayeeZia-1767466879.jpg?w=768&amp;resize=768%2C552&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"khaleda zia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (R) and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia (L) share a light moment during the closing ceremony of the 12th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, in Islamabad, January 6, 2004.

At the time, India’s prime minister was Atal Bihari Vajpayee.</p><p>Areas of contention between the BJP-ruled India and BNP-ruled Bangladesh ranged from trade disputes, border disputes, river water sharing, migration, armed rebellion, and violence against minorities. New Delhi accused Bangladesh of allowing several anti-India armed fighters shelter on its terrain, and the issue became a major irritant in bilateral relations.</p><p>India also accused the BNP of pandering to Pakistani intelligence agencies. Dhaka denied these accusations.</p><p>“Essentially, the background has been one of mutual mistrust and animosity that is historic,” said Shringla, who is now a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, nominated by Modi’s BJP.</p><p>“Under the BNP years [2001-2006], Bangladesh supported an anti-India line and became very close to Pakistan,” Shringla told Al Jazeera. “And [Tarique] Rahman was a prime mover in that government and had disproportionate influence.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212603\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212603\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212603\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20251224__88TP4KE__v1__MidRes__FilesBangladeshPoliticsRahman-1767466736.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C520&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"rahman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212603\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(FILE) Acting chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Tarique Rahman, poses for a portrait in a park in southwest London on December 30, 2023.

The BNP responded, thanking him for the wishes.</p><p>“Rahman seems to understand that for him to be a successful prime minister, he needs India’s support – or, at the least, he doesn’t want India’s antagonism,” said Shringla. “Now, we have to see whether his actions match rhetoric.”</p><p>From India’s perspective, Rahman is now “saying all the correct things”, said Sreeradha Datta, a professor specialising in South Asian studies at India’s OP Jindal Global University.</p><p>Rahman’s apparent popularity – hundreds of thousands gathered on the streets of Dhaka to greet him when he arrived from London – suggests that he could bring a sense of stability in the neighbourhood, Datta told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Analysts say Rahman also represents the “safest bet” for New Delhi going forward, compared with the Jamaat-led alliance and other political actors in Bangladesh.</p><p>“India sees the student revolutionaries and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami as the biggest threats to Indian interests,” said Jon Danilowicz, a former US diplomat who spent eight years working in Bangladesh.</p><p>Rahman’s public statements on returning to Dhaka “have shown great maturity”, Danilowicz said.</p><p>The pre-poll break between the Jamaat and the BNP also gives New Delhi more confidence in dealing with Rahman, said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia political analyst.</p><p>“There is a lot of baggage from the past, in addition to the BNP’s longstanding alliance with Jamaat,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. “For India, memories of that alliance die hard.</p><p>“[Reaching out to Rahman is] not something that India will do happily, but something that it feels that it will need to do simply by necessity,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212596\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212596\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20251225__88ZV6NH__v1__MidRes__BangladeshPoliticsRahman-1767466707.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"rahman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212596\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarique Rahman (4R), son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)’s acting chairman, waves to supporters during a rally after his arrival in Dhaka on December 25, 2025.

Rahman, if he comes to power, would keep Bangladesh equidistant from regional powers, like India and China, and keep “Bangladesh first”, Kabir added.</p><p>“Hasina used India in a bad way to legitimise her own crimes in Bangladesh, so people have a very bitter distaste for India,” Kabir said. He added that the “new Bangladesh” after the July 2024 revolution sees Hasina as a “terrorist”.</p><p>Kabir said Dhaka would continue to press India for Hasina’s extradition if Rahman is elected to power in February. “The onus to maintain this [bilateral] relationship lies on New Delhi, for keeping Hasina there,” he said.</p><p>Hasina has publicly criticised Bangladesh’s direction under the Yunus government, angering Dhaka. “India needs to move on from Hasina’s era and should not be seen complicit with her rogue activities to destabilise Bangladesh, while she sits in India,” Kabir said. Otherwise, he cautioned, “widespread anti-India distaste among people makes it difficult for the next elected government to engage [with New Delhi] against the popular sentiment.”</p><p>Persistent tensions have also played out beyond the worlds of politics and diplomacy in recent days.</p><p>On Saturday, India’s cricketing body, which governs the popular Indian Premier League, asked the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise to drop Bangladeshi pacer Mustafizur Rahman after BJP leaders protested the player’s participation.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-s-next\">So what’s next?</h2><p>Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who served in Bangladesh for five years, told Al Jazeera that if Rahman returns to power in Dhaka, “India’s biggest challenge would be to keep a check on Pakistan and other anti-India militant groups being embedded in Bangladesh.”</p><p>Danilowicz said he agreed that India would harbour those concerns – given the BNP’s past leanings towards Pakistan, when the Jamaat was its ally.</p><p>But Kabir, Rahman’s adviser, said the BNP leader was focused on “improving and pushing cooperation” with India and other neighbours.</p><p>“The relationship never existed between India and Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina; it was just limited to Hasina,” said Kabir. “Now, we need confidence that India means a change of direction and is setting its policy to actually rekindle the relationship between the people of Bangladesh and India.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Parents are asking about medical access they haven’t been able to obtain over the past two years. Students think of this as an opportunity to continue their education,” he said.</p><p>“And for many families, this is an opportunity to reunite with family members who have been separated for too long.

Achieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.</p><p>It is unclear what executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.</p><p>The White House did not comment on the meetings, but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to flood into Venezuela.</p><p>“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.</p><p>Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.</p><p>One oil industry executive told Reuters the companies would be reluctant to talk about potential Venezuela operations in group settings with the White House, citing antitrust concerns that limit collective discussions among competitors about investment plans, timing and production levels.</p><h2 id=\"political-risks-low-oil-prices\">Political risks, low oil prices</h2><p>US forces on Saturday conducted a raid on Venezuela’s capital, arresting Maduro in the dead of night and sending him back to the US to face narcoterrorism charges.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hours after Maduro’s abduction, Trump said he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars boosting Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades due to underinvestment and sanctions.</p><p>But those plans will be hindered by a lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.</p><p>“While the Trump administration has suggested large US oil companies will go into Venezuela and spend billions to fix infrastructure, we believe political and other risks, along with current relatively low oil prices, could prevent this from happening anytime soon,” wrote Neal Dingmann of William Blair in a note.</p><p>Material change to Venezuelan production will take a lot of time and millions of dollars of infrastructure improvement, he said.</p><p>And any investment in Venezuelan infrastructure right now would take place in a weakened global energy market. Crude prices in the US are down by 20 percent compared with last year. The price for a barrel of benchmark US crude has not been above $70 since June, and has not touched $80 per barrel since June of 2024.</p><p>A barrel of oil cost more than $130 in the leadup to the US housing crisis in 2008.</p><p>Chevron is the only US major currently operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.</p><p>Exxon and ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalised nearly two decades ago by former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Conoco has been seeking billions of dollars in restitution for the takeover of three oil projects in Venezuela under Chavez.

Explosions were reported before dawn on Saturday in the capital, Caracas, as well as at nearby Venezuelan military bases and some civilian areas.</p><p>Monday’s swearing-in ceremony was overseen by Rodriguez’s brother – the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez – and Maduro’s son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, who held a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution.</p><p>Other members of Maduro’s inner circle, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino, were also in attendance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The ceremony took place as Maduro, her predecessor and former boss, faced an arraignment proceeding in a New York City courthouse.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in the US have charged Maduro with four counts related to allegations he leveraged government powers to export thousands of tonnes of cocaine to North America.</p><p>The charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, the illegal possession of machine guns and other destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such guns and devices.</p><p>Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their allies, including Rodriguez, have denounced the pair’s abduction as a violation of international law, as well as Venezuelan sovereignty.</p><p>In court on Monday, Maduro maintained he remained the rightful leader of Venezuela, saying, “I am still president.”</p><p>The administration of US President Donald Trump, however, has signalled that it plans to work with Rodriguez for the time being, though Trump himself warned that her tenure as president could be cut short, should she fail to abide by US demands.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine in a Sunday morning interview.</p><p>A day earlier, in a televised address announcing the attack, Trump had said his administration plans “to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition”.</p><p>On Air Force One on Sunday, as he flew back to Washington, DC, Trump doubled down on that statement.</p><p>“Don’t ask me who’s in charge, because I’ll give you an answer that will be very controversial. We’re in charge,” he told reporters.</p><p>He added that Rodriguez is “cooperating” and that, while he personally has not spoken to her, “we’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration’s seeming willingness to allow Rodriguez, a former labour lawyer, to remain in charge has raised eyebrows.</p><p>Rodriguez, who served as vice president since 2018, is known to be a stalwart “chavista”: an adherent of the left-wing political movement founded by Maduro’s mentor, the late Hugo Chavez. She has held various ministerial roles under Maduro, including leading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>But Trump’s allies in the Republican Party have argued that keeping Rodriguez in place is simply a practical reality.</p><p>“We don’t recognise Delcy Rodriguez as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela. We didn’t recognise Nicolas Maduro as a legitimate ruler,” Republican Senator Tom Cotton told CNN on Sunday.</p><p>“It is a fact that she and other indicted and sanctioned officials are in Venezuela. They have control over the military and security services. We have to deal with that fact. That does not make them a legitimate leader.”</p><p>While on Air Force One, Trump largely avoided committing to new elections in Venezuela, indicating he would instead focus on “fixing” the country and allowing US oil companies access to its vast petroleum reserves.</p><p>One reporter on the aeroplane asked, “How soon can an election take place?”</p><p>“Well, I think we’re looking more at getting it fixed, getting it ready first, because it’s a mess. The country is a mess,” Trump replied. “It’s been horribly run. The oil is just flowing at a very low level.”</p><p>He later added, “We’re going to run everything. We’re going to run it, fix it. We’ll have elections at the right time. But the main thing you have to fix: It’s a broken country. There’s no money.”</p><p>Recent presidential elections in Venezuela have been widely denounced as fraudulent, with Maduro claiming victory in each one.</p><p>The contested 2018 election, for example, led to the US briefly recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as president, instead of Maduro.</p><p>Later, Maduro also claimed victory for a third term in office during the 2024 presidential race, despite election regularities.</p><p>The official vote tally was not released, and the opposition published documents that appeared to show that Maduro’s rival, Edmundo Gonzalez, had won. Protests erupted on Venezuela’s streets, and the nonprofit Human Rights Watch reported that more than 2,000 protesters were unlawfully detained, with at least 25 dead in apparent extrajudicial killings.</p><p>The opposition has largely boycotted legislative elections in Venezuela, denouncing them as rigged in favour of “chavistas”.</p><p>Monday’s swearing-in ceremony included the 283 members of the National Assembly elected last May. Few opposition candidates were among them.</p></div></div></body></html>"
