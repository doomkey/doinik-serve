In September, he also <span><a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/trump-to-meet-netanyahu-as-ending-israels-gaza-war-reaches-pressure-point\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">met with Trump</a> in Washington, DC, after</span> the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-relationship-between-trump-and-netanyahu-been-like-so-far\">What has the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu been like so far?</h2><p>Netanyahu often says Trump is the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House.</p><p>During his first term, Trump pushed US policy further in favour of Israel’s right-wing government. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied <a href=\"/news/2022/3/25/three-years-on-us-still-views-syrias-golan-as-israeli-territory\">Golan Heights</a> and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).</p><p>Since returning to the White House this year, Trump has shown a greater willingness to publicly disagree with Netanyahu. Still, his administration has provided unflinching support for Israel, including the decision to renew the genocidal war on Gaza in March after a brief ceasefire.</p><p>Trump joined the Israeli attack on Iran in June to the dismay of some segments of his base. And he pushed to secure the current truce in Gaza.</p><p>The US president also opposed the Israeli <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/9/13/how-will-israels-attack-on-doha-affect-the-us-and-gulf-states\">attack on Doha</a> in September. And he swiftly lifted sanctions against Syria despite some apparent Israeli reservations.</p><p>The ties between the two leaders have seen some peaks and valleys. In 2020, Trump was irked when Netanyahu rushed to congratulate Joe Biden on his election victory against Trump, who has falsely insisted the election was fraudulent.</p><p>“I haven’t spoken to him [Netanyahu] since,” Trump told the Axios news site in 2021. “F*** him.”</p><p>The strong ties between the two leaders were rekindled after Trump won the presidency again in 2024 and unleashed a crackdown on Palestinian rights activists in the US.</p><p>In November, Trump formally asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/trump-formally-asks-israeli-president-to-pardon-netanyahu-after-gaza-truce\">pardon Netanyahu</a>, who is facing corruption charges at home.</p><p>The two leaders, however, are not in complete alignment, and cracks in their positions are showing up over issues that include Gaza, Syria and the US partnerships with Turkiye and the Gulf states.</p><p>During his US visit, Netanyahu may seek to flatter Trump and project a warm relationship with the US president to advance his agenda and signal to his political rivals in Israel that he still enjoys support from Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-netanyahu-dealt-with-the-us-since-october-7-2023\">How has Netanyahu dealt with the US since October 7, 2023?</h2><p>Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has asked for unchecked US diplomatic and military support.</p><p>Then-President Biden travelled to Israel 11 days after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, and he declared that support for the US ally is “vital for America’s national security”.</p><p>His “bear hug” of Netanyahu on arrival at the airport in Tel Aviv would set the stage for the US backing of Israel as it unleashed horror and destruction on Gaza, which has translated into more than $21bn in military aid and multiple vetoes at the UN Security Council over the past two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has seized on the notion that Israel is an extension of US interests and security structure. In a speech to the US Congress last year, the prime minister argued that Israel is fighting Iran indirectly in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>“We’re not only protecting ourselves. We’re protecting you,” he told US lawmakers.</p><p>Throughout the war, there have been countless reports that Biden and Trump have been displeased or angry with Netanyahu. But US weapons and political backing for Israel have continued to flow uninterrupted. And Netanyahu makes a point of always expressing gratitude to US presidents, even when there may be apparent tensions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"where-does-the-us-stand-on-the-gaza-truce\">Where does the US stand on the Gaza truce?</h2><p><span>US Secretary of State <a href=\"/features/2025/2/20/marco-rubio-a-traditionalist-hawk-in-the-age-of-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marco Rubio</a> said last week that the top priority for the Trump administration is to complete the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire and move from mere cessation of hostilities to long-term governance, stabilisation and reconstruction of the Palestinian enclave.</span></p><p>Israel has been violating the ceasefire in Gaza regularly, recently killing at least six Palestinians in an attack that targeted a wedding.</p><p>But Trump, who claims to have brought peace to the Middle East for the first time <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-nation-address\">in 3,000 years</a>, has focused on broadly moving the truce forward rather than on Israel’s daily conduct.</p><p>“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion,” Rubio said last week.</p><p>The top US diplomat has also suggested that there could be some flexibility when it comes to disarming Hamas under the agreement, saying the “baseline” should be ensuring that the group does not pose a threat to Israel rather than removing the guns of every fighter.</p><p>But Israel appears to be operating with a different set of priorities. Defence Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-will-never-fully-withdraw-from-gaza-defence-minister-says\">Israel Katz</a> said on Tuesday that the country is looking to re-establish settlements in Gaza, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>He later walked back those comments but stressed that Israel would maintain a permanent military presence in the territory, which would violate the Trump plan.</p><p>Expect Gaza to be a key topic of discussion between Netanyahu and Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-a-syria-agreement-be-reached\">Can a Syria agreement be reached?</h2><p><span>Trump has literally and figuratively embraced Syrian President <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> over the past year, lifting sanctions against the country and beginning security cooperation with his government’s security forces.</span></p><p>But Israel is pursuing its own agenda in Syria. Hours after the collapse of the government of former President Bashar al-Assad a year ago, Israel began expanding its occupation of Syria beyond the Golan Heights.</p><p>Although the new Syrian authorities stressed early on that they did not seek confrontation with Israel, the Israeli military launched a bombardment campaign against Syria’s state and military institutions.</p><p>Israeli forces have also been conducting raids in southern Syria and abducting and disappearing residents.</p><p>After the Israeli military killed 13 Syrians in an air raid last month, Trump issued a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/trump-says-israel-must-seek-strong-and-true-dialogue-with-syria\">veiled criticism</a> of Israel.</p><p>“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous state,” he said.</p><p>Syria and Israel were in talks earlier this year to establish a security agreement short of full diplomatic normalisation.

It was Israel. That’s no longer true,” Trump said.</p><p>“You have to be very careful. You have a Congress in particular which is becoming anti-Semitic.”</p><p>Despite Trump’s position, analysts said the gap between the strategic priorities of the US and Israel is growing.</p><p>While Washington is pushing for economic cooperation in the Middle East, Israel is seeking “total dominance” over the region, including US partners in the Gulf, Toossi said.</p><p>“Israel is pushing this uncompromising posture and strategic objective that I think is going to come to a head more with core US interests,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-the-us-israel-alliance\">What’s next for the US-Israel alliance?</h2><p>If you drive down Independence Avenue in Washington, DC, you will likely see more Israeli than American flags displayed on the windows of congressional offices.</p><p>Despite the shifting public opinion, Israel still has overwhelming support in Congress and the White House. And although criticism of Israel is growing within the Republican base, Israel’s detractors have been pushed to the margins of the movement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> is leaving Congress; commentator Tucker Carlson is facing constant attacks and accusations of anti-Semitism; and Congressman Tom Massie is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is filled with staunch Israel supporters, including Rubio, megadonor <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/who-is-miriam-adelson-the-pro-israel-donor-trump-lauded-at-the-knesset\">Miriam Adelson</a> and radio show host Mark Levin.</p><p>But amid the erosion of public support, especially among young people, Israel may face a reckoning in American politics in the long term.</p><p>On the Democratic side, some of Israel’s strongest supporters in Congress are facing primary challenges from progressive candidates who are centring Palestinian rights.</p><p>The most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), is increasingly becoming <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/centrist-us-democrat-says-he-returned-aipac-donations-cites-netanyahu-ties\">a toxic brand</a> for Democrats.</p><p>On the right, the faultlines in the consensus in support of Israel are growing wider. That trend was put on display at the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/turning-point-usa-held-its-americafest-conference-heres-what-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right-wing AmericaFest</a> conference this month when debates raged around support for Israel, a topic that was a foregone conclusion for conservatives a few years ago.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has been pushing to codify opposition to Zionism as anti-Semitism to punish Palestinian rights supporters, Vice President JD Vance has presented a more nuanced view on the issue.</p><p>“What is actually happening is that there is a real backlash to a consensus view in American foreign policy,” Vance recently told the UnHerd website.</p><p>“I think we ought to have that conversation and not try to shut it down. Most Americans are not anti-Semitic – they’re never going to be anti-Semitic – and I think we should focus on the real debate.”</p><p>Bottom line, the currents are changing, but the US commitment to Israel remains solid – for now.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Presidential Council appointed his deputy, General Salah al-Namroush, temporarily.</p><p class=\"p1\">During his eulogy, al-Namroush “bid farewell to the men of the nation who carried the nation’s burdens and made discipline a way of life and leadership a responsibility”.</p><p class=\"p1\">He said he would follow in the footsteps of al-Haddad, and pledged “to continue unifying the army”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Although it will be difficult, political analyst Mohamed Mahfoudh told Al Jazeera: “Discussions are already under way; given the importance of the position, I expect a decision to be made within the next 10 days.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Libya has seen widespread frustration and recent protests against the government over the economic situation, prompting officials to announce a plan to reshuffle the cabinet earlier this month.</p><p class=\"p1\">The shuffle was scheduled to be announced on December 24, but al-Haddad’s death postponed that.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4193508\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193508\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4193508\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_694ba5a05aca8-1766565280.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Libya's army chief of staff Gen.

That means Haddad’s replacement could be a political decision to appease certain stakeholders, rather than someone who is qualified for the position.</p><p class=\"p1\">“That’s a fear many of us have,” Mahfoudh said.</p><h2 id=\"a-tale-of-two-airports\" class=\"p1\">A tale of two airports</h2><p class=\"p1\">In an illustration of Libya’s split, the government in Tripoli had to receive the bodies of al-Haddad and other military officials at the city’s international airport, which was destroyed in fighting in 2014.</p><p class=\"p1\">It is currently under renovation and now serves only government and emergency medical evacuation planes.</p><p>However, normally the bodies would have been received at Mitiga international airport, which is now Tripoli’s main commercial airport, but since it is under SDF control, PM Dbeibah could not be there.</p><p class=\"p1\">He is not welcome.</p><p class=\"p1\">So, Dbeibah, members of the Presidential Council, and senior government and military officials waited for the bodies at Tripoli international airport.</p><p class=\"p1\">They were taken to an army base in southern Tripoli for a military ceremony in their honour, where Presidential Council head, Mohamed al-Menfi, declared “the promotion of each martyr to the next rank”, making al-Haddad a field marshal posthumously.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">“Field Marshal Mohamed al-Haddad was a cornerstone to protecting the state and maintaining stability,” said Dbeibah at the ceremony.</p><p class=\"p1\">He assured people that investigations into the crash “are continuing with full accuracy and credibility in coordination with Turkiye”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Al-Haddad, al-Essawi, and al-Mahjoub’s bodies were flown to their hometowns in Misrata on Saturday evening.</p><p class=\"p1\">On Sunday morning, people came from all over the country to lay them to rest.</p><p class=\"p1\">Thousands of people gathered in the Misrata football stadium for a farewell prayer for the departed. Misrata city officials announced the day as an official holiday to give people time off to attend the funeral.</p><p class=\"p1\">Abdullah Allafi, a tribal leader from al-Rajban in the Nafusa Mountains of western Libya, left home at 3am to drive hundreds of kilometres to pay his respects.</p><p class=\"p1\">When asked about al-Haddad’s death, he said: “It’s a huge loss. Mohamed al-Haddad’s death is a loss for all of us and for Libya. He was a true patriot. May Allah rest his soul.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Our presence here is a symbol of unity. Enough divisions, it’s time to come together and build a nation and a united military.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-23T111019Z_1158108692_RC2MHHAJR471_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-POLITICS-STARMER-1766910917.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In February, the United Kingdom government appointed a working group to provide a definition of “anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia”, which should have completed its work by the end of August. In the summer, Conservative MP Nick Timothy and a phalanx of like-minded groups waged a campaign against any such definition, which they argued would stymie free speech for those who wish to criticise Islam.</p><p>Since then, the government has been cowed into silence and delay. Last week, the BBC published a report suggesting that the definition will not use the word Islamophobia at all, opting instead for “anti-Muslim hostility”.</p><p>This is a mistake; hatred of Islam lies at the very heart of racism towards Muslims. And while the British state fails to even name Islamophobia, Muslims face an unprecedented level of danger. The unwillingness of the British government to name and confront Islamophobia is a scandal, one that is barely noticed by mainstream media.</p><p>Before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, the number of reported attacks on Muslims in England and Wales was already high and stood at 3,432. In the year up to March 2024, it went up by 13 percent, and a further 19 percent by March 2025. These most recent figures exclude London, due to changes in crime recording by the Metropolitan Police, so the increase is probably higher.</p><p>According to the most recent data, without London, 24 percent of religious hate crimes targeted Jews, and 44 percent were committed against Muslims. In addition, Muslims are consistently more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2025/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2025\">victims of assault, stalking and harassment</a>.</p><p>It is somewhat miraculous that Islamophobic attacks in the UK over the last two years have not resulted in anyone being killed. Mob violence in the summer of 2024, which followed the murder of three girls in Southport by a non-Muslim attacker, was marked by the targeting of mosques from the start. This year, there have been multiple attacks on mosques, including arson. In December, police in Northern Ireland arrested several members of the so-called “Irish Defence Army” over a plot to attack a mosque and migrant housing in Galway, the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>In the face of the rise in hate crime, the UK government doggedly campaigns against anti-Semitism – as it should – but is not investing anywhere close to the same political capital in protecting Muslims. The state’s approach to defining both forms of racism make this unevenness very clear.</p><p>In December 2016, the UK adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism, which is highly controversial due to its conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. By contrast, the UK government has dragged its feet on adopting any definition of Islamophobia.</p><p>The draft definition that the BBC published on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrjzp42v4zo\">December 15</a>, which does not mention Islamophobia, is deeply inadequate, and indeed dangerous because it gives a blank cheque to those who want to attack Islam. This lack of protection was inevitable. In the working group’s terms of reference, the government insisted on “the unchanging right of British citizens … to criticise, express dislike of, or insult religions and/or the beliefs and practices of adherents”.</p><p>Imagine, for a moment, that the government specified that a definition of anti-Semitism should allow people to insult Judaism. Even a cursory historical understanding of anti-Semitism clearly shows that hostility to Jews and Judaism have been inseparable across millennia: From the medieval Blood Libel, which accused Jews of killing Christian children for ritual purposes, to today’s “replacement theory” that Jews are orchestrating the corruption of the so-called “white race”.</p><p>Similarly, Western persecution of Muslims has been intrinsically connected with, and driven by, opposition to Islam, from medieval times until the present. Whether during the Reformation of the 16th century in Europe or the colonialisation of North Africa and Asia in the 19th century, Western thinkers and political leaders commonly saw Islam as an inherently imperialist and violent religion, dedicated to world domination, either through holy war or conspiratorial methods.</p><p>In the 16th century, German theologian Martin Luther labelled both Jews and Muslims as “fanatics”, that is to say, religion-inspired violent revolutionaries. In the 18th century, the French scholar Alexandre Deleyre wrote that when “government is absolutely founded upon religion, as among the Muslims; then fanaticism directs itself chiefly outwards, and makes this people an enemy of humanity”.</p><p>The leaders of the French and British empires were obsessed with the notion that Islam bred an inherent potential for revolutionary violence, which had to be guarded against through surveillance, censorship, and a politics of “moderation”.</p><p>The persisting influence of this conception of Islam as a source of violent conspiracy is easily traced through the 20th and 21st centuries in the West, most obviously since the start of the “war on terror” in the early 2000s. These ideas cut across the political spectrum and sit at the centre of the UK’s migration panics since 2015, when war and the rise of ISIL (ISIS) prompted an exodus of refugees from the Middle East.</p><p>The hatred of Islam, based on centuries of Western thought about that religion as an existential threat to Christian civilisation, is the root of a panoply of Islamophobic ideas: That Muslims are all potential terrorists, oppressors of women, sex predators, and obsessive theocrats.</p><p>In this context, to claim that Islam is not a target of Muslim-hating vitriol actually facilitates racism. It gives carte blanche to those who attack Islam with a searing passion – a hostility that fuels to verbal and physical violence against Muslims. To celebrate such attacks as the expression of “free speech” is to glorify hatred.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
