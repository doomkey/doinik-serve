The streets of Aden appeared normal, and people were going about their jobs as usual.</p><p>And then there was the electricity. In a country that has now officially been at war for longer than a decade with multiple groups vying for territory, a utility that is taken for granted in much of the world is a sign of hope.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The sudden availability of electricity is partly the result of a multimillion-dollar fuel grant provided by Saudi Arabia to supply power stations. Observers consider it to be an effort to show that the presence of Yemen’s internationally recognised government can improve people’s lives.</p><p>Badea Sultan, an Aden-based independent journalist, told Al Jazeera that the “positive change” in services in Aden is palpable for residents and the city has entered a completely new stage.</p><p>Citing electricity as a key example, he said, “Power supply has largely stabilised. Today, we enjoy approximately 20 hours of continuous, uninterrupted service per day. This was a distant dream just two months ago.”</p><p>Sultan said the ongoing progress in Aden cannot be attributed solely to the United Nations-recognised government. He highlighted the role of Falah al-Shahrani, who arrived in Aden early this year as part of a high-level delegation from the Joint Forces Command of the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen to follow up on security and military arrangements in the wake of the STC’s military collapse.</p><p>An adviser to the commander of the forces, al-Shahrani has worked with local and military leaders to reposition military camps outside Aden and has played a critical role in managing what Sultan described as a sensitive phase in the city.</p><p>“Al-Shahrani is effectively the de facto ruler of Aden now,” Sultan added.</p><h2 id=\"saudi-uae-tensions\">Saudi-UAE tensions</h2><p>In late December, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen surfaced publicly, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/saudi-says-it-will-militarily-back-yemens-government-against-separatists\">prompting</a> Riyadh to adopt a sharper narrative and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/uae-welcomes-saudi-efforts-to-support-security-in-yemen-amid-stc-advance\">launch</a> military operations aimed at pushing back the UAE-backed STC, which had crossed a Saudi red line by trying to take control of eastern Yemeni regions that bordered Saudi Arabia.</p><p>On December 30, the UAE <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/30/live-yemens-presidential-council-cancels-uae-defence-deal\">announced</a> its withdrawal from Yemen “of its own volition” after the Yemeni government demanded it do so. The UAE has been arming and funding the STC since its <a href=\"/news/2020/4/26/yemen-what-is-the-southern-transitional-council\">establishment</a> in 2017.</p><p>At a news conference in Warsaw on Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said, “The UAE has now decided to leave Yemen, and I think if that indeed is the case and the UAE has completely left the issue of Yemen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take responsibility.”</p><p>Some STC leaders travelled to Riyadh after the Saudi attacks on the STC and announced the dissolution of the group. But other STC leaders have rejected that statement and continue to try to rally support on the ground in southern Yemen.</p><h2 id=\"mass-demoralisation\">Mass demoralisation</h2><p>Saleh Qasim, a 45-year-old resident of Aden’s Sheikh Othman district, told Al Jazeera that “the Saudi era” has begun in Aden.</p><p>“Aden is recovering today, and that could be the path to Yemen’s recovery,” he said.</p><p>But he added that while the early signs are promising, it is still a bleak time for pro-independence southerners like himself.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The STC and its supporters want the restoration of the former South Yemen, an independent state that existed from 1967 to 1990 before uniting with North Yemen to form the united Republic of Yemen.</p><p>Supporters of secession feel that the south was disenfranchised in the united Yemen. They took their opportunity after the Houthi takeover of Sanaa and northwestern Yemen in 2014 and 2015, taking de facto control over Aden and other parts of southern Yemen.</p><p>It had finally seemed like the dream of an independent state was on the horizon, particularly with the backing of the UAE. But then came the Saudi-backed counterattack by the Yemeni government, and now, in the space of weeks, the dream of secession has been shattered, in the short term at least.</p><p>“This is the most frustrating moment for the secessionists,” Qasim said. “They have lost land, weapons and fighters. I can see the mass demoralisation among the independence seekers in Aden.”</p><p>He added: “I also aspire to see the south independent but through dialogue, not force.”</p><p>The STC has been trying to showcase its support in Aden with rallies every Friday that are attended by thousands of people in al-Aroudh Square.</p><p>There, the protesters raise the southern flag and the image of the STC’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/saudi-led-coalition-says-stcs-al-zubaidi-fled-to-uae-via-somaliland\">on-the-run leader</a>, Aidarous al-Zubaidi. They also chant for independence, pledge to continue their struggle and voice their anger at the Saudi role. However, Sultan, the journalist, views these mass rallies as an emotional outlet for STC supporters that ultimately will not be able to restore the group’s lost leverage.</p><p>Sultan believes that local authorities are turning a blind eye to the demonstrations as a way of allowing STC supporters to blow off some steam.</p><p>“In my opinion, there is a deliberate effort to allow separatist demonstrators to vent their frustrations regarding recent developments, which have been quite shocking to them,” Sultan said.</p><h2 id=\"three-challenges\">Three challenges</h2><p>On January 15, President Rashad al-Alimi, the head of the Presidential Leadership Council, Yemen’s UN-recognised authority, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/yemens-saudi-backed-government-appoints-new-prime-minister-2\">appointed</a> Foreign Minister Shaya Mohsin al-Zindani as the ⁠country’s prime minister.</p><p>Consultations on the selection of cabinet members have been under way in Riyadh. Once finalised, the cabinet is expected to return to Aden to govern – a major move that would signal that the government is truly in control of the city for the first time in years.</p><p>However, challenges lie ahead as “the internal and external architects of chaos” have not abandoned their agenda in the south, Yemeni political analyst Sadam al-Huraibi told Al Jazeera, referring to the UAE and armed separatists.</p><p>Al-Huraibi identified three challenges that the new cabinet will potentially face in Aden. “One major threat is the terrorist or politically motivated bombings in Aden, which could quickly turn the city into a place of mourning.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On January 21, an explosives-laden car <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/five-killed-in-treacherous-attack-on-military-convoy-in-yemen\">detonated</a> as a pro-government military commander’s convoy was moving in Aden. Five soldiers were killed, and three were wounded. No party has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p><p>“The other challenge is the risk of planned riots. Protesters may exploit the right to assembly and turn to violence in Aden. Such incidents can erupt sporadically and rob the city’s calm, affecting the government’s ability to function,” al-Huraibi said.</p><p>Al-Huraibi added that the third challenge is the UAE’s alleged covert coordination with separatists in southern cities to undermine Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government. “The UAE said it withdrew from Yemen, but there is no guarantee it will be completely disengaged,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-the-focus-to-the-north\">Shifting the focus to the north</h2><p>Yemeni officials today believe that a stable Aden and Saudi support are decisive success factors for shifting the focus to the north, where the Houthis have dominated for a decade.</p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman said in a recent interview that Saudi Arabia “has committed to pay the salaries of all the national army and the brigades, … the salaries of the government staff, including the diplomats”.</p><p>“And this is the first step,” he said. “First, we have to secure the capital in Aden, and then when the capital is stable and the services are functioning to a certain extent, the government starts operating from Aden.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>With the unified political and military bloc in the south, he said, the focus must shift to the peace process and confronting the Iran-backed Houthis.</p><p>Noman believes the Houthis are not ready for a peace process but they will change their minds when they see the new government operating in Aden and playing a governing role in the south.</p><p>For their part, the Houthis have downplayed the importance of the recent Saudi moves in the south, arguing that Saudi Arabia puts its interests first, not Yemen’s.</p><p>In a speech broadcast on January 23, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi movement, said: “The Saudi – even at this stage – is not concerned with either unity or separation [in Yemen]. What concerns him is complete control, occupation and domination over the Yemeni people.”</p><p>The Houthis took control of Sanaa in 2014 and then <a href=\"/news/2015/1/21/houthis-take-over-yemen-presidential-palace\">toppled</a> the Yemeni government in Sanaa in 2015, sparking a conflict that remains unresolved to date. They have been able to continue in power despite years of Saudi-led coalition air strikes, followed by air attacks since 2023 by the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.</p><p>Mohammed, a Houthi field commander, told Al Jazeera that he does not see a difference between the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Aden.</p><p>“Both are occupiers,” he said. “The good services that they offer to the people are not sustainable, so it is naive to celebrate gifts given by your occupier.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was one of the biggest and most brazen attacks carried out by Baloch separatists, whose claim, however, of killing 84 Pakistani security personnel was dismissed by the authorities.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the provincial capital, Quetta, where the scars of the decades-old conflict could be seen over the city’s police academy, the courts and the bazaars, the official message is once again of unwavering control.</p><p>“Our security forces, personnel and officers have fought bravely,” said Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, framing the BLA attacks as the “last gasp of a cornered enemy”.</p><p>Yet, this narrative of dominance is punctuated by the sobering death toll: more than a dozen security personnel killed and civilian families caught in the crossfire. The power move – of trying to project more power than actually wielding it – feels true for both sides.</p><h2 id=\"terrorism-a-foreign-plot\">‘Terrorism’ a foreign plot</h2><p>Islamabad’s response to separatist attacks, once meticulously framed, is now a routine occurrence. The fighters are cadres of “Fitna-al-Hindustan”, which in Urdu translates to “India’s incitement”, it alleged. New Delhi has not yet responded to the charge.</p><p>The nomenclature of a “foreign hand” is now the cornerstone of Pakistan’s national security narrative, linking every attack to the hand of Islamabad’s historical rival. The complex, locally-rooted Baloch grievances are subsumed into a simpler, catchier, blame-shifting story of foreign subterfuge. It echoes past government statements, which blamed “neighbouring countries” for trying to derail its key economic projects.</p><p>The narrative of blaming the neighbours also positions the Pakistani military not as a party to an internal dispute, but as a defender of Pakistan’s territorial sanctity. But it is more than a narrative.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2020/8/21/jadhav-case-new-delhi-wants-indian-lawyer-to-help-convicted-spy\">Kulbhushan Jadhav</a>, an Indian national arrested and sentenced to death for espionage by a Pakistani court in 2016, is a living exhibit of Pakistan’s case against external interference.</p><p>Pakistan had released a video that appeared to show Jadhav confessing to facilitating attacks in Balochistan. While India denied involvement, Jadhav’s testimony fits the strategic nationalisation of a provincial conflict.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4279274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4279274\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4279274\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260131__94N73G4__v1__HighRes__PakistanUnrestSouthwest-1769936460.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan Balochistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4279274\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Security personnel shift an injured man at a hospital in Quetta [Adnan Ahmed/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"grievances-fuelling-rebellion\">Grievances fuelling rebellion</h2><p>On the ground, the official Pakistani script reads differently.</p><p>In the hushed conversations at Quetta’s tea shops, a different, more intimate story of political marginalisation and economic injustice unfolds, as residents wonder how poverty remains entrenched despite the province’s immense mineral wealth.</p><p>The promise of the $46bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), centred on the port of Gwadar in Balochistan, is viewed by locals not as a boon, but as one that might benefit Beijing and Islamabad, not the Baloch fishermen or shepherds.</p><p>“Sir, are you crazy!” exclaimed a security official at a coal mine in Spin Karez, where Al Jazeera had reached to document the plight of miners dying due to a lack of proper equipment.</p><p>“The insurgents [rebels] come in their hundreds and pick up everything, including [paramilitary] checkpoints. Who said it’s safe for you to be in this area?” he went on.</p><p>Baloch separatists have often raided mines and killed workers from other provinces who came looking for a livelihood. The encounter is one of many incidents in Balochistan as the province feels like the “Wild West” – no rules, no one really in charge.</p><p>This discontent is the oxygen that keeps the separatist movement alive.</p><p>As a security source told Al Jazeera: “A military can neutralise a militant, but it cannot neutralise a grievance. The state sees them as a terrorist network; many here see their sons and brothers who took up arms.”</p><p>The death of 18 civilians in the latest conflict is a tragic footnote that underscores this divide as the rebellion consumes the very people it claims to fight for.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"human-cost-of-conflict\">Human cost of conflict</h2><p>Balochistan is a land of haunting dualities. It is home to Gwadar, the gleaming linchpin of CPEC on the Arabian Sea, and to remote valleys where communication lines are the first casualty during any flare-up. Its porous borders with Iran and Afghanistan provide fighters with strategic depth. For Pakistan, the province is a source of strategic anxiety.</p><p>The human cost of the conflict is reflected in the region’s landscape and memory. As one recalls the raw testimony from a resident after a 2013 attack in Hazara town: “The wounded were lying here and there … we didn’t know who was who.”</p><p>Or the haunting question of a cadet after the 2016 Quetta <a href=\"/news/2016/10/26/pakistan-lej-behind-police-academy-attack-in-quetta\">police academy massacre</a>: “Why were we called back in and told to stay here with no weapons?”</p><p>These statements are indictments of a persistent security failure and eroding social contract. They explain why the official claims of “unity behind security forces” sometimes feel less like a lived reality and more like an aspirational slogan.</p><p>“Everyone here is corrupt” was a startling statement from a former chief minister of Balochistan who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.</p><p>People in Balochistan speak of widespread corruption plaguing the impoverished province, endemic and consuming every sphere of public services. Very little money, in that case, is actually left to provide basic services such as healthcare and education. Security is a luxury many do not even believe in any more.</p><p>The recent military operations in Balochistan demonstrate Pakistan’s formidable capacity for kinetic response. Drones monitor from above, forces patrol in strength, and rebels are cleared from strongholds.</p><p>Yet, like clockwork, the “national action plan” is dusted off and reviewed after every crisis. Vows are made, and the violence eventually returns. Despite multiple “surrender of weapons” ceremonies seen in recent years, the rate of nationalistic propaganda producing more recruits is probably much higher.</p><p>True stability in Balochistan requires a calculus that transcends body counts. It requires recognising that separatism draws from a well of genuine discontent, that development must be seen as inclusion rather than just extraction, and that political dialogue is not appeasement, but necessity.</p><h2 id=\"regional-implications\">Regional implications</h2><p>Balochistan – bigger than Germany in area – is critical in the power play of regional influence, which involves China’s economic ambitions, Iran’s sectarian politics, the United States’ “containment” strategies, India’s enemy-of-my-enemy strategy, and Afghanistan’s alleged role in the province.</p><p>Pakistan’s challenge is to navigate these external currents while finally addressing the internal fissures that make its largest province so perilously vulnerable. The last 48 hours have again challenged the country’s domestic security architecture.</p><p>As it always does, the dust will settle again. Most of the Pakistani establishment and its media will forget Balochistan, again. And armchair analysts will continue with their punditry.</p><p>But whether the dust settles over a landscape moving towards durable peace or if it is just a quiet interlude before the next storm depends on who gets to write the next chapter.</p><p>Balochistan needs political accommodation, economic inclusion, and effective regional diplomacy if, at all, there is a genuine push to change its status from a perpetual flashpoint.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>When details of the Gaza peace plan were made clear in recent days, it was difficult not to see the parallels with the agreement that ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina 30 years ago.</p><p>The Gaza plan promises an end to attacks, but it institutionalises endless external control. The designers of this plan promise Palestinians governance based on the “best international standards”. Bosnians have been hearing this phrase for the past three decades. To this day, we still do not know what these standards actually are.</p><p>What we do know is that after the implantation of our foreign-negotiated peace plan, Bosnia became a semi-protectorate, a territory governed from the outside in the name of stability and without democratic sovereignty in which those who hold decision-making power cannot be held accountable.</p><p>The Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian War, were negotiated at a US military base, mediated by foreign diplomats and agreed upon by leaders of the warring parties, including representatives of neighbouring states that had supported the war. Ordinary Bosnian citizens were excluded from the process. The same logic underpins the Gaza plan: peace negotiated about a people, not with them.</p><p>The peace agreement reached without us legitimised wartime territorial divisions and created the basis for a highly fragmented political system resembling a confederation: two entities (Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and a weak central state with limited authority alongside a separate district (Brcko).</p><p>Nominally, power is exercised by a Council of Ministers and a rotating Presidency composed of three members, each from one of the three dominant ethnic groups. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Constitution, which should be the basis of governance, was not written by its citizens. It was drafted in English by the same international mediators that brokered the peace and was included in the accords as an annex. Until today, there is no official translation of the document into the local languages.</p><p>The Council of Ministers and the Presidency do not hold real power. The international community does. It controls state decision-making through two bodies: the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and the Peace Implementation Council (PIC).</p><p>The high representative, which per the rule has to be a European politician, has the authority to impose or annul laws and sack elected officials without them having legal recourse. To this day, Bosnians still do not know what qualifications are required to appoint someone to this position and give them ultimate authority with no accountability.</p><p>The PIC, which is made up of 55 representatives of various governments and international organisations, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, NATO and the European Union, probably resembles the Gaza Strip’s Board of Peace the most. It oversees the work of the high representative, whose appointments it approves through a process that the citizens of Bosnia still do not really know. Decisions the body makes are driven by the interests of its individual members and communicated to the public through media statements. Nobody has the opportunity to question these decisions and journalists cannot discuss them with PIC members.</p><p>The governing bodies being set up for Gaza are similarly detached from accountability. There is the Board of Peace, headed by United States President Donald Trump, where states can buy membership for $1bn. Then there are two executive boards, one composed of US officials and businessmen and another composed of Western and regional officials. They are to supervise local governance, operating above domestic authority while claiming neutrality and expertise. And finally, there is a technocratic administration composed of “qualified Palestinians and international experts” to govern the Strip.</p><p>In Bosnia, the system of foreign control is built upon not just the domination of foreign powers but also upon the compliance of local elites. The international community has consistently relied on political actors willing to preserve the status quo in exchange for access to power. This arrangement rewards stagnation and punishes systemic change. It produces a donor-dependent civil society – one that is active and visible, but ultimately manageable from the outside.</p><p>It is no wonder that criticism of the international community in Bosnia and its bodies has been framed as a threat to peace. In the past, the OHR has gone as far as silencing certain media organisations that have been openly critical. In 1997, for example, NATO forces were asked to intervene against the public broadcaster of Republika Srpska and cut off its broadcast. The justification was that the OHR wanted to ensure “international norms of professional media conduct” were observed.</p><p>This logic persists today. In a video address in December marking the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Accords, the current high representative, Christian Schmidt of Germany, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUBXM9kmnYs\">warned that</a> “some today point the finger at the international community and its representatives, refusing to remember that without international intervention, as late as it came, Bosnia and Herzegovina would have descended into chaos and despair.”</p><p>He described Dayton as “the basis for the future” although “not the future itself” and concluded with a vague call for “action” rather than “complaining” without clarifying who should act or how.</p><p>Yet Bosnia has not fully succumbed to complacency. There has also been resistance. In <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/new-balkan-revolts-from-protests-to-plenums-and-beyond/\">2014, public discontent poured into the streets</a> across the country, beginning in Tuzla and spreading to more than 20 cities within days. Workers led the demonstrations. Citizens occupied public spaces, organised open assemblies and articulated political demands. For a brief moment, people experienced democracy outside the imposed foreign-controlled framework.</p><p>The response was repression, silence and disregard. The international community observed but did not engage. When the protests collapsed under political pressure and exhaustion, no institutional change followed.</p><p>The protests ceased, but visible traces of them remained in the form of graffiti on government buildings. Probably the most well-known one appears on the facade of the Sarajevo Canton building, and it reads: “Those who sow hunger reap wrath.”</p><p>What followed was a mass exodus. Close to <a href=\"https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/bih-odlazak-porodice/31629794.html\">500,000 people</a> have left the country since 2014. Many others are waiting for a chance to go. Meanwhile, nationalism, once a wartime ideology, has become a governing tool – used by local elites and tolerated, even stabilised, by the international community.</p><p>As feminist authors from Sarajevo Gorana Mlinarević and Nela Porobić wrote in their publication <a href=\"https://bosnia-peace.wilpf.org/\">Peace That Is Not</a>, peace “neither starts nor ends with the signing of a peace agreement”. They argued that the imposed peace in Bosnia has burdened its political, economic and social life for decades. The same burden now looms over Gaza.</p><p>If asked whether the Bosnian peace agreement was a success, most people in Bosnia would answer that it put an end to the war. That is true. But peace that merely stops violence without enabling freedom and dignity is not peace.</p><p>Peace imposed from above creates stability without justice and governance without democracy. The Bosnian semi-protectorate stands as a warning, not a model. Peace and democracy cannot exist without the participation of the people or if their will is ignored. Yet this is precisely what the “best international standards” continue to do.</p><p>Bosnia cannot be undone. Gaza has to be approached differently and can be if its people and other Palestinians are involved in the process and have the power to decide.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He required surgery and spent days in hospital. “I stood in front of the mob believing they knew me and would not attack me,” he said. “They broke my hand – but more than that, they broke my heart and my trust. I had never experienced anything like this before.”</p><h2 id=\"no-proper-justice\">‘No proper justice’</h2><p>Hindus form about 8 percent of the population in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, with Christians, Buddhists and other minorities present in much smaller numbers.</p><p>Through Bangladesh’s history, say experts and minority leaders, political actors and their supporters have at times exploited religious identities to intimidate voters or settle local disputes, leading to targeted attacks on minority homes, places of worship and individuals.</p><p>“If you look at elections in the past – even during the Awami League’s tenure – oppression and persecution of minorities never truly stopped,” Manindra Kumar Nath, acting general secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), an umbrella group representing these minority communities, told Al Jazeera. “It happened before elections and after elections.” But what made things worse, he said, was that “there has been no proper justice”.</p><p>Not after Hindus were attacked following the 2001 election that former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won, and not after later attacks against Hindus in subsequent years.</p><p>Now, sporadic attacks in recent months ahead of the election have revived those fears. According to the BHBCUC, at least 522 communal attacks were recorded in 2025, including 61 killings. The group says 2,184 incidents took place in 2024 following Hasina’s removal in August that year.</p><p>Minorities are now “deeply insecure” ahead of the election, Nath said. “There is fear among everyone,” he added.</p><p>The Bangladesh government disputes claims of widespread communal violence. According to official <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17sKwyFY7i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data</a>, in 2025, authorities recorded 645 incidents involving members of minority communities. Of these, the government says, only 71 had “communal elements”, while the remainder were classified as general criminal acts. Officials argue the figures show that most incidents involving minorities were not driven by religious hostility, stressing the need to distinguish communal violence from broader law-and-order crimes.</p><p>At a national level, Bangladesh faces persistent law-and-order challenges, with an average of 3,000 to 3,500 violent crime deaths each year, according to official figures.</p><p>The government has also suggested that the issue has been politicised internationally, particularly by the Indian media and officials, since the fall of Hasina’s government.</p><p>Rights groups, however, present different data. Ain o Salish Kendra, a prominent human rights organisation, documented 221 incidents of communal violence in 2025, including one death and 17 injuries — lower than the BHBCUC’s count, but higher than the government’s data.</p><p>And the differing numbers notwithstanding, interviews with minority communities point to deep anxiety shaped by recent lived experience.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"not-another-mental-trauma\">‘Not another mental trauma’</h2><p>Shefali Sarkar, a homemaker in Bidyadharpur in Rajshahi, saw her life turn upside down on the afternoon of August 5, 2024 — the day Hasina fled, seeking exile in India.</p><p>As fears of an attack spread, most men in the community fled, leaving the women behind in their homes. Mobs primarily targeted men in the aftermath of Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>“They started vandalising our house. I thought this was it – that we were going to die,” Shefali said, still visibly shaken when recalling the day. “It left a deep scar in my mind, and I have needed mental health treatment after this.”</p><p>With elections approaching, Shefali said her anxiety has returned, fearing that any fresh unrest could once again make her community a target. “I cannot go through another mental trauma,” she said.</p><p>Her husband, Narayan Sarkar, said the area has remained calm since the attack and that local Muslim residents and political leaders have assured them of protection. “But the fear always remains – peace can be taken away at any time,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"unrest-might-spread\">‘Unrest might spread’</h2><p>Not everyone is as worried.</p><p>Shaymol Karmokar, from central Bangladesh’s Faridpur district, is the secretary of the local Durga Puja celebration committee. Durga Puja is a major Hindu Bengali festival, celebrated in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.</p><p>“We have traditionally maintained strong communal harmony here over the years,” Karmokar said. “Many areas reported attacks during the uprising, but nothing happened in our locality.”</p><p>He added that political leaders had actively sought minority votes and promised to ensure their safety. “We will vote and expect a peaceful election,” he said.</p><p>Indeed, BNP leader Tarique Rahman — former PM Khaleda Zia’s son — has spoken of his desire to build an inclusive Bangladesh where all communities, irrespective of faith, feel safe and secure.</p><p>And the Jamaat-e-Islami, the BNP’s principal challenger in the elections, has for the first time nominated a Hindu candidate, from the city of Khulna, as part of its outreach to the community.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, in Gopalganj, where about a quarter of voters are Hindu, worries about election violence are high.</p><p>In one heavily Hindu-populated constituency of the district — which is also Hasina’s birthplace — Govinda Pramanik, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote [Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance] and an independent candidate, said he was scared that “unrest might spread around this election”, he said.</p><p>BHBCUC’s Nath said the government and election authorities could have done more to assuage concerns of minorities. “Even now, as the Election Commission operates, it has not once asked religious minorities what problems they are facing or what support they need,” he said.</p><p>Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh’s interim government, however, said authorities have taken steps to protect minorities and ensure a safe election. “We have taken adequate measures so that people of all communities – minorities and majorities, followers of all faiths and identities – can vote in a festive atmosphere,” Alam told Al Jazeera. “They could not vote freely under Sheikh Hasina over the last 15 years, as the elections were rigged.”</p><p>“Our priority is to ensure that everyone can vote this time,” he added, insisting that the government had consulted minority communities and addressed their concerns.</p><p>Back in Bidyadharpur village in Rajshahi, Sukumar Pramanik said he was weighing these assurances carefully. “If we come under attack again,” he said, “this will be the last time I place my trust in them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it is an acknowledgement they also admit has come quite late.</p><p>“The family is happy about it. And we’re excited that he’s finally being recognised,” Yeni Kuti, Fela’s daughter, told Al Jazeera before the ceremony. “But Fela was never nominated [for a Grammy] in his lifetime,” she lamented.</p><p>The recognition is “better late than never”, she said, but “we still have a way to go” in fairly recognising musicians and artists from across the African continent.</p><p>Lemi Ghariokwu, a renowned Nigerian artist and the designer behind 26 of Fela’s iconic album covers, says the fact that this is the first time an African musician gets this honour “just shows that whatever we as Africans need to do, we need to do it five times more.”</p><p>Ghariokwu said he feels “privileged” to witness this moment for Fela. “It’s good to have one of us represented in that category, at that level. So, I’m excited. I’m happy about it,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But he admits he was also “surprised” when he first heard the news.</p><p>“Fela was totally <a href=\"/opinions/2018/7/15/how-fela-kuti-came-to-be-celebrated-by-those-he-sang-against\">anti-establishment</a>.

He didn’t even think about it,” she said. “He played music because he loved music. It was to be acknowledged by his people – by human beings, by fellow artists – that made him happy.”</p><p>Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela’s cousin and head of the Kuti family, agrees. “Knowing him, he might have said, you know, thanks but no thanks or something like that.” She laughs.</p><p>“He really wasn’t interested in the popular view. He wasn’t driven by what others thought of him or his music. He was more focused on his own understanding of how he should impact his profession, his community, his continent.”</p><p>Though she believes the award may not have meant much to him personally, she told Al Jazeera that he would have recognised its overall value.</p><p>“He would recognise the fact that it’s a good thing for such establishments to begin the process of giving honour where it’s due across the continent,” Ransome-Kuti said.</p><p>“There are many great philosophers, musicians, historians – African ones – that haven’t been brought into the forefront, into the limelight as they should be. So I think he would have said, ‘OK, good, but what happens next?’”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275569\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275569\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP8103161140-1769761121.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela Kuti\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275569\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fela Kuti performs on March 16, 1981, with his band “Africa 70” at the Hippodrome in Paris, France [File: Herve Merliac/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fela-s-influence-spans-generations\">‘Fela’s influence spans generations’</h2><p>Fela was born in Nigeria’s Ogun State in 1938 as Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti (later renaming himself to Fela Anikulapo Kuti), to an Anglican minister and school principal father and an <a href=\"/features/2020/10/1/the-lioness-of-lisabi-who-ended-unfair-taxes-for-nigerian-women\">activist mother</a>.</p><p>In 1958, he went to London to study medicine, but instead enrolled at Trinity College of Music, where he formed a band that played a blend of jazz and highlife.</p><p>After returning to Nigeria in the 1960s, he went on to create the Afrobeat genre that fused highlife and Yoruba music with American jazz, funk, and soul. That has laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop.</p><p>“Fela’s influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats,” reads the <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/news/special-merit-awards-2026-grammys-honorees-recording-academy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">citation</a> on the Grammys list of this year’s Special Merit Award Honorees.</p><p>But beyond music, he was also a “political radical [and] outlaw”, the citation adds.</p><p>By the 1970s, Fela’s music had become a vehicle for fierce criticism of military rule, corruption, and social injustice in Nigeria. He declared his Lagos commune, the Kalakuta Republic, independent from the state – symbolically rejecting Nigerian authority – and in 1977 released the scathing album, Zombie, with lyrics that painted soldiers as mindless zombies with no free will. In the aftermath, troops raided Kalakuta, brutally assaulting its residents and causing injuries that led to Fela’s mother’s death.</p><p>Frequently arrested and harassed during his life, Fela became an international symbol of artistic resistance, with Amnesty International later recognising him as a prisoner of conscience after a politically motivated imprisonment. When he died in 1997 at age 58 from an illness, an estimated one million people attended his funeral in Lagos.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4275575\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4275575\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP179924952246-1769761145.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fela\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4275575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portraits of Late Afrobeat Legend Fela Kuti, on display at Kalakuta Museum in Lagos, Nigeria [File: Sunday Alamba/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Yeni – together with her siblings – is now custodian of her father’s work and legacy. She runs Afrobeat hub,</p><p>the New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja, Lagos and hosts an annual celebration in Fela’s honour called “Felabration”.</p><p>She remembers growing up with her larger-than-life father as something that felt “normal”, as it was all she knew. But “I was in awe of him”, she also says – as an artist and a thinker.</p><p>“I really, really admired his ideologies. The most important one for me was African unity … He totally worshipped and admired [former Ghanaian President] Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who was fighting for African unity. And I always think to myself, can you imagine if Africa was united? How far we would be; how progressive we would be.”</p><p>Reflecting on Fela’s legacy, artist Ghariokwu says most big Afrobeats musicians today have been influenced and inspired by Fela’s music and fashion.</p><p>But he laments that most have “never really sat down with the ideological part of Fela – the pan-Africanism – they never really checked it out”.</p><p>For him, Fela’s Grammy recognition should say to young artists, “If someone [like Fela] who was totally anti-establishment can be recognised this way, maybe I can express myself too without too much fear.”</p><p>Yeni says that through Fela’s work and life philosophy, he wanted to pass a message of African unity and political consciousness on to young people.</p><p>“So maybe with this award, more young people will be drawn to talk more about that,” she said. “Hopefully, they will be more exposed to Fela and want to talk about the progress of Africa.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

off diplomatic relations in February 2019, in a decision by Maduro after Trump gave public support to Venezuelan lawmaker Juan Guaido, who claimed to be the nation’s interim president in January that year.</p><p>Minister of the Popular Power for Interior Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela’s most powerful politicians and a Maduro loyalist, said earlier in January that reopening the US embassy in Caracas would give the Venezuelan government a way to oversee the treatment of the deposed president.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/rubio-testifies-before-us-senate-on-abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro\">claimed</a> that Maduro’s abduction was necessary for security reasons, officials have also <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/8/us-says-it-wants-to-control-venezuelan-oil-indefinitely-can-it\">repeatedly framed</a> their interests in Venezuela around controlling its vast oil reserves, which are the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/what-resources-does-venezuela-have-apart-from-the-worlds-most\">largest</a> in the world.</p><p>Since the abduction, Trump has pressured Interim President Delcy Rodriguez to open the country’s nationalised oil sector to US firms.</p><p>The two countries have reached ‌a deal to export up ⁠to $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the US, and on Thursday, Rodriguez <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/venezuelas-rodriguez-signs-oil-reform-law-while-the-us-eases-sanctions\">signed into law</a> a reform bill that will pave the way for increased privatisation.</p><p>The legislation gives private firms control over the sale and production of Venezuelan oil, and requires legal disputes to be resolved outside of Venezuelan courts, a change long sought by foreign companies, which argue that the judicial system in the country is dominated by the governing socialist party.</p><p>The bill would also cap royalties collected by the government at 30 percent.</p><p>The Trump administration said on the same day that it would loosen some sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector, and allow limited transactions by the country’s government and the state oil company PDVSA that were necessary for a laundry list of export-related activities involving an “established US entity”.</p><p>Trump has announced that he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/trump-says-that-he-will-allow-reopening-of-venezuelan-airspace\">ordered the reopening</a> of Venezuela’s commercial airspace and “informed” Rodriguez that US oil companies would soon arrive to explore potential projects in the country.</p><p>On Friday, Rodriguez <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/venezuelas-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez-announces-prisoner-amnesty\">announced</a> an amnesty bill aimed at releasing hundreds of prisoners in the country, and said she would shut down El Helicoide, an infamous secret service prison in Caracas, to be replaced with a sports and cultural centre.</p><p>That move was one of the key demands of the Venezuelan opposition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But that result should occur through a more orderly ‌and humane policy than currently in place.”</p><p>The judge did not specify the deportation quota he was referring to, but Stephen Miller, the White House chief of staff for policy, has previously said there was a target of 3,000 immigration arrests a day.</p><p>The ongoing crackdown in the state of Minnesota is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to federal officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The surge has prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-governor\">led to the killings</a> of two American citizens by federal agents.</p><p>The deadly operation has sparked <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-protesters-begin-nationwide-strike-as-doj-launches-pretti-killing-probe\">nationwide protests</a> as well as mass <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/29/the-take-they-picked-the-wrong-state-how-minneapolis-is-fighting-back\">mobilisation efforts</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/thousands-in-minneapolis-brave-bitter-cold-to-protest-ice-crackdown\">demonstrations</a> in Minnesota.</p><p>According to the Columbia Heights Public School District in Minneapolis, Liam was one of at least four students detained by immigration officials in the suburb this month.</p><p>Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik said ICE agents took the child from a running car in the family’s driveway on January 20, and told him to knock on the door of his home, a tactic that she said amounted to using him as “bait” for other family members.</p><p>The government has denied that account, with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claiming that an ICE officer remained with Liam “for the child’s safety” while other officers apprehended his father.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance, who has vigorously defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, told a news conference that although such arrests were “traumatic” for children, “just because you’re a parent, doesn’t mean that you get complete immunity from law enforcement”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has said that Conejo Arias arrived in the US illegally in December 2024 from Ecuador, but the family’s lawyer says they have an active asylum claim that allows them to remain in the country legally.</p><p>Following their detention, the boy and his father were sent to a facility in Dilley in Texas, where advocacy groups and politicians have reported deplorable conditions, including illnesses, malnourishment and a fast-growing number of detained children.</p><p>Texas Representatives Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett visited the site earlier this week. Liam slept throughout the 30-minute visit, Castro said, and his father reported that he was “depressed and sad”.</p><p>Biery’s ruling on Saturday included a photo of the boy, as well as several Bible quotes: “Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these’,” and “Jesus wept”.</p><p>The episode, Biery wrote, made apparent “the government’s ignorance of an American historical document called the Declaration of Independence”. Biery drew a comparison between Trump’s administration and the wrongdoings that then-author, future President Thomas Jefferson, mounted against England’s King George, including sending “Swarms of Officers to harass our People” and creating “domestic Insurrection”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Department of Justice and DHS.</p><p>The Law Firm of Jennifer Scarborough, which is representing Liam and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, said in a statement that the pair will soon be able to reunite with the rest of their family.</p><p>“We are pleased that the family will now be able to focus on being together and finding some peace after this traumatic ordeal,” the statement said.</p><p>Minnesota officials have been calling on the Trump administration to end its immigration ‍crackdown in the state. But a federal judge on Saturday <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">denied a request</a> from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and other officials to issue a preliminary injunction that would have halted the federal operation.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/trump-orders-federal-agents-to-stay-away-from-protests-in-democrat-cities\">ordered DHS</a> to, “under no circumstances”, get involved with protests in Democratic-led cities unless they ask for federal help, or federal property is threatened.</p></div></div></body></html>"
