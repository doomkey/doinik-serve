The White House has said it will be concerned with the day-to-day rebuilding and stabilisation of the enclave, “while laying the foundation for long-term, self-sustaining governance”.</p><p>Under Trump’s plan, the reconstruction of Gaza would be broadly overseen by a “board of peace” and more closely guided by a “Gaza executive board”.</p><p>The NGAC faces enormous challenges. Gaza has been physically destroyed after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war, and there is <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/scepticism-hope-gaza-reacts-trump-board-of-peace\">widespread scepticism</a> from Palestinians over how much autonomy the body will have.</p><p>Those concerns have been compounded by the presence of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">firm supporters</a> of Israel, and a lack of Palestinians, so far, on the board of peace and the Gaza executive board.</p><p>In his statement, Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister, said the body would focus on establishing security control of the Strip, more than half of which remains under direct Israeli control, and restoring basic services destroyed throughout the war.</p><p>“We are committed to establishing security, restoring the essential services that form the bedrock of human dignity such as electricity, water, healthcare, and education, as well as cultivating a society rooted in peace, democracy, and justice,” he said.</p><p>“Operating with the highest standards of integrity and transparency, the NCAG will forge a productive economy capable of replacing unemployment with opportunity for all.”</p><p>In defiance of an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/us-declares-phase-two-of-gaza-ceasefire-but-what-did-phase-one-deliver\">existing ceasefire</a> agreement between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas, Israel has maintained severe restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, which UN agencies and humanitarian groups have said is necessary to deliver services to Palestinians.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians have also been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza during that period, bringing the death toll to 71,548 since October 7, 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/trumps-board-of-peace-appears-to-seek-wider-mandate-beyond-gaza\">board of peace</a> was announced as part of phase two of the ceasefire agreement, but letters from Trump inviting foreign leaders to join the body have suggested the US president may see it as a model for bypassing traditional international forums, such as the UN.</p><p>In mid-December, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/which-aid-groups-is-israel-banning-from-gaza-now-and-what-will-it-mean\">Israel announced</a> it was banning more than three dozen international aid organisations from operating in Gaza.</p><p>Some Palestinians also worry that the NGAC’s technocratic approach may circumvent key political questions, such as the creation of a future Palestinian state and an end to Israel’s decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territory, in favour of a focus on economic development and outside investment opportunities.</p><p>In his statement, Shaath said the committee will “embrace peace, through which we strive to secure the path to true Palestinian rights and self determination”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A so-called “charter” that accompanied the letter also pointed to loftier goals, according to several reports.</p><p>In Trump’s letter to Milei, the US president said the board would seek to “solidify Peace in the Middle East”, adding that it would “embark on a bold new approach to resolving Global Conflict” at the same time.</p><p>The Financial Times, meanwhile, quoted the accompanying “charter” as saying that “the Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed,” said the charter, which did not directly reference Gaza, according to the newspaper.</p><p>Two diplomatic sources also told the Reuters news agency that the invitations included a “charter” that outlined a wider mandate for the body.</p><p>“It’s a ‘Trump United Nations’ that ignores the fundamentals of the UN charter,” one diplomat aware of the ‌letter told the news agency,</p><p>A senior US official, meanwhile, told The Associated Press news agency that an expanded role for the board of peace remains “aspirational”.</p><p>The official added that Trump and his advisers believe such a role is possible, particularly as Washington and other UN members have repeatedly expressed frustration with the international organisation.</p><p>However, the official said the board of peace was not intended to replace the UN.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-focus\">Gaza focus</h2><p>To be sure, the Trump administration has so far publicly said that the board of peace will initially focus on Gaza.</p><p>On Friday, Trump announced that Tony Blair, the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, would be among the board’s founding executive members, alongside Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Also initially announced were Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, World Bank Group President Ajay Banga, and Robert Gabriel, a US deputy national security adviser.</p><p>Many of those figures were also named to a separate “Gaza executive board”, which is set to oversee a technocratic committee of Palestinians, named the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). The committee is expected to handle day-to-day governance in Gaza in lieu of Hamas.</p><p>The 11-member executive board includes Blair, Kushner and Witkoff, as well as Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan, Qatari diplomat Ali Al Thawadi, UN Middle East peace coordinator Sigrid Kaag, United Arab Emirates Minister of State for International Cooperation Reem Al-Hashimy, and Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay.</p><p>Beyond Argentina’s Milei and Pena, Turkiye and Egypt have confirmed their respective leaders, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, have been invited to join the wider board of peace. A European Union official said that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also been invited to represent the EU.</p><p>Four sources told Reuters that the leaders of France, Germany, ⁠Australia and Canada were also invited to sit on the board, although there was no official confirmation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The White House said it would announce more members in the coming weeks.</p><p>Still, the initial announcement of board members sparked outrage among many in the Middle East for not including any Palestinians, but instead elevating staunch supporters of Israel.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, raised opposition to the Gaza executive board on Saturday, saying its composition “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy”.</p><p>A statement from Netanyahu’s office did not specify what exactly it opposed about the board’s makeup.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg news reported on Saturday that the Trump administration is asking countries for $1 billion to say on the board of peace.</p><p>The White House responded to the report, calling it “misleading”. It said there was no minimum membership ​fee to join the board, but appeared to confirm the $1 billion fee for “permanent membership”.</p><p>“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the ‌White House said on X.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukrainian authorities have characterised the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/russian-attacks-cause-energy-emergency-in-freezing-ukraine-says-zelenskyy\">Russian attacks</a> as an effort to weaponise the current cold weather, degrading the country’s energy system.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said in a post on the messaging app Telegram that more than 20 settlements in the Kyiv area were left without power as a result of the strikes.</li>\n<li>The mayor of the city of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said that constant <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/as-russian-attacks-worsen-ukraines-energy-woes-trump-rebukes-kyiv\">Russian attacks</a> were straining the energy system of Ukraine’s second-largest city, stating the system that provides residents with essentials, such as heating and electricity, was “constantly operating at its limits”. He said that three people were injured in overnight strikes.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during an energy coordination meeting that the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia are facing the most acute energy challenges. He added that the country must <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/zelenskyy-demands-faster-energy-imports-as-ukraine-reels-from-power-outages\">increase energy imports</a> and seek additional equipment from allies.</li>\n<li>The Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Independent reported that foreign embassies plan to stay in Kyiv despite the power outages, infrastructure issues, and predictions of extreme cold, with weather forecasts predicting temperatures as low as –20 degrees Celsius (–4 degrees Fahrenheit) later this month. The outlet reported that about 80 foreign diplomatic missions are based in Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s HUR military intelligence body has said that Moscow is planning attacks meant to disconnect Ukraine from three nuclear power plants in the coming days. The intelligence agency said those efforts seek to degrade the country’s energy infrastructure and “force Ukraine to accept unacceptable capitulation demands to end the war”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peace-talks\">Peace talks</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>A Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for peace talks, with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov, saying he was set to meet with US special envoy Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of the US Army Dan Driscoll.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian negotiators Rustem Umerov and Davyd Arakhamia will also take part in the talks in Miami, Florida, on Sunday.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said on Friday that the weekend talks would focus on finalising proposals for a future peace agreement on issues such as post-war security guarantees and economic rebuilding.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said the delegation would also emphasise the destructive role of continued Russian strikes on Ukraine, adding that the attacks are “constantly worsening” the already strained possibilities of reaching a peaceful settlement to end the war.</li>\n<li>If the Trump administration reaches an agreement with Ukraine on a proposal, the two countries could sign a document at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. Any such proposal would also have to gain Russian support.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"diplomacy\">Diplomacy</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the Trump administration’s threats to seize control of Greenland and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/trump-pledges-to-slap-tariffs-on-european-allies-over-greenland\">slap tariffs</a> on European allies that defy him should not be allowed to undermine the focus on bringing an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine, which she called the bloc’s “core task”.</li>\n<li>Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev ridiculed European leaders for deploying military members to Greenland as Trump continues to threaten the self-governing Danish territory and NATO member, saying in a social media post targeted at EU chief Ursula von der Leyen that European countries should not “provoke the daddy”.</li>\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron expressed support for Denmark and Greenland, saying that the concept of sovereignty motivates France’s support for Ukraine and that Europe must take steps to ensure that the continent’s “sovereignty is upheld”.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy announced Ukrainian sanctions targeting individuals and organisations tied to Russian athletics ahead of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, saying that Moscow uses “sports venues to spread anti-Ukrainian narratives and Russian propaganda”. The Russian national team is banned from competing, but Russian athletes may participate as “neutral athletes”.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld,” Macron <a href=\"https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2012599888412877147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on the social media platform X.</p><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was unusually blunt in condemning Trump’s threat, saying on X that his country would raise the issue directly with Washington. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,” he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said tariffs would undermine prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, making both Europe and the US poorer. ”China ‍and ⁠Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,” she said in a post on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump indicated in his lengthy social media post that the tariffs were being imposed in retaliation for trips the countries’ representatives took to Greenland “for purposes unknown”. He accused all eight of playing a “very dangerous game” in opposing US control over the territory.</p><p>The US had been trying to buy Greenland “for over 150 years”, he said, adding that the “need to AQUIRE” the territory had become all the more essential for the planned US missile defence shield known as the Golden Dome, which would include the “possible protection of Canada”.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said that Trump’s move was “an unprecedented step”.</p><p>“Clearly, President Trump is taking this very seriously, imposing tariffs against the US’s closest allies,” he said, noting the US president’s characteristically capitalised warnings on the “safety, security and survival of our planet”.</p><h2 id=\"protests-in-denmark-and-greenland\">Protests in Denmark and Greenland</h2><p>Trump’s announcement came as <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/thousands-join-hands-off-greenland-protests-amid-trumps-takeover-threats\">thousands of people rallied</a> in cities across Denmark to reject the Republican president’s repeated threats to take control of Greenland.</p><p>In the capital, Copenhagen, protesters waved the flags of Denmark and Copenhagen, and chanted slogans such as “Kalaallit Nunaat”, the Arctic island’s name in Greenlandic.</p><p>And in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk<strong>, </strong>hundreds of people braved near-freezing temperatures, rain and icy streets to march in a rally in support of their own self-governance.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands, who reported live from the Nuuk demonstration, said that for people returning from today’s protests, news of Trump “upping the ante” with his tariffs would be “very worrying indeed”.</p><p>“They know that there is nothing that they could do if Donald Trump really did want to send in the troops,” he said.</p><p>“Denmark knows there is nothing, really, that they could do if Donald Trump really wants to send the troops. What they have been trying to do over the last weeks is to reassure him that they can take Arctic security seriously,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"internal-nato-spat\">Internal NATO spat</h2><p>The threat of tariffs takes what Challands described as “an internal NATO” spat to a new level, marking a potentially dangerous escalation of tensions that will place further strain on an alliance that dates to 1949 and provides a collective degree of security to Europe and North America.</p><p>Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has for months insisted that the US should control Greenland. Earlier this week, he said that anything less than the Arctic island being in US hands would be “unacceptable”.</p><p>According to the latest poll, published in January last year, 85 percent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the US, while only 6 percent are in favour.</p><p>While Greenland and Denmark have rejected the idea of the island being “owned” by the US, efforts to get the US administration to change its stance have so far appeared to have failed.</p><p>“It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland,” Denmark’s foreign minister, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/greenland-and-denmark-say-trump-set-on-conquering-territory-after-meeting\">Lars Lokke Rasmussen</a>, told reporters this week after a meeting in Washington, DC, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the pressure is immense.</p><p>Senegal, the 2021 winner, is also going for its second title, but the build-up has been overshadowed by complaints about their treatment going into the final.</p><p>It’s a duel of lions, between the Atlas Lions of Morocco and Teranga Lions of Senegal.</p><p>Al Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at the final of the 35th edition:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-senegal-s-complaint-against-morocco-before-the-afcon-final\">What is Senegal’s complaint against Morocco before the AFCON final?</h2><p>The Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) called on the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the local organising committee to “immediately take every corrective measure to guarantee respect for the principles of fair play, equal treatment, and security indispensable for the success of this celebration of African football”.</p><p>Senegal’s players travelled by train from Tangier to Rabat on Friday, but found what the federation said was a “clear lack of adequate security measures” upon their arrival.</p><p>FSF <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/17/afcon-final-senegal-criticizes-lack-of-fair-play-ahead-of-morocco-clash\">issued a statement</a> in the early hours of Saturday morning in which it criticised an alleged lack of security arrangements for the team’s arrival in Rabat, problems with the team’s accommodation, issues with the training facilities, and difficulties getting a fair ticket allocation for its supporters.</p><p>“This deficiency exposed the players and technical staff to overcrowding and risks incompatible with the standards of a competition of this magnitude and the prestige of a continental final,” the federation said.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-morocco-and-senegal-shape-up-for-the-afcon-final\">How do Morocco and Senegal shape up for the AFCON final?</h2><p>It has been a tournament of few surprises, and no one will be shocked to see the two top-ranked African teams contest the final – world No 11 Morocco vs No 19 Senegal. Both are likely to climb in the FIFA rankings when the next update is issued on Monday.</p><p>Both teams have played all their six games so far in the same stadium, with Morocco buoyed by vociferous home support in the 69,500-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, which is also hosting the final.</p><p>For Senegal, which played every game in Tangier, it will be its first match of the tournament in another stadium, potentially a further complaint of fairness for the Teranga Lions should the final not go in their favour.</p><h2 id=\"who-have-been-senegal-s-key-players-at-afcon-2025\">Who have been Senegal’s key players at AFCON 2025?</h2><p>Senegal’s Sadio Mane has created 18 chances, the most in the tournament. The two-time African Footballer of the Year (2019, 2022) scored against Egypt in the semifinal – his 11th Africa Cup goal.</p><p>Mane led Senegal to victory in 2021 and will want to sign off with another win in what is likely his last game in the competition.</p><p>Edouard Mendy has been a rock in goal, while midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye brings a wealth of experience to the centre of the park, but the rumour is that this could also be the last AFCON for both of those players.</p><p>The pressure on Mane in attack has been eased by Iliman Ndiaye’s growing importance, as well as Paris Saint-Germain teenager Ibrahim Mbaye, who has also been an emerging talent at this tournament.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-have-been-morocco-s-key-players-at-afcon-2025\">Who have been Morocco’s key players at AFCON 2025?</h2><p>Forget Achraf Hakimi, the 2025 African Footballer of the Year – the undisputed star of the tournament so far has been Morocco’s No 10, Brahim Diaz, who scored in each of the team’s first five games.</p><p>If Diaz scores again in the final, he would join Ahmed Faras as Morocco’s joint-top scorer at an Africa Cup. Faras, the 1975 African Footballer of the Year, is the country’s top scorer altogether, with 36 goals.</p><p>To be fair to Hakimi, he missed the team’s first two games as he recovered from an ankle injury, going on as a substitute in the third. He has since played every game in the knockout stage and created 10 chances, the most for a Moroccan player.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-senegal-win-afcon\">When did Senegal win AFCON?</h2><p>Senegal’s only AFCON title came in 2022, and Mane was the main man for the Lions of Teranga as they beat Egypt on penalties in the Cup of Nations final in Yaounde.</p><p>Having missed a penalty during normal time that night, Mane stepped up to score the decisive kick in the shootout, and Senegal – World Cup quarterfinalists in 2002 – were African champions for the first time.</p><p>In that moment, a huge weight was lifted off the shoulders of the boy from a small town on the banks of the Casamance River in southern Senegal.</p><p>There have also been plenty of lows for the two-time African footballer of the year, including the defeat in the final against Algeria in Cairo at the 2019 edition and missing the 2022 World Cup with injury.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-morocco-win-afcon\">When did Morocco win AFCON?</h2><p>Much has been written about Morocco’s wait for their second AFCON crown. This edition marks the 50th anniversary of the Atlas Lions’ solitary continental title.</p><p>It is undoubtedly a huge underachievement by the north African nation, but the pressure is now greater than ever.</p><p>Morocco became only the fourth African nation to reach a World Cup quarterfinal at Qatar 2022 and went on to become the first nation from the continent to reach the semifinals.</p><p>Success did not follow at the 2023 AFCON, so – in front of their own fans – the expectation is that the wait, since that solitary title in 1976 in Ethiopia, must now come to an end.</p><h2 id=\"stat-attack-senegal\">Stat attack – Senegal</h2><p>Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has conceded only twice at this edition – against Congo and Sudan – and the Teranga Lions have not let in more than one goal in a game since a 2-2 draw with Algeria in 2017. In its last 22 Africa Cup games, Senegal has kept a clean sheet in 15 of those matches.</p><h2 id=\"stat-attack-morocco\">Stat attack – Morocco</h2><p>Morocco has conceded only one goal in the tournament so far – a penalty scored by Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko in the group stage.</p><p>They are also unbeaten in two years, since going out of the last AFCON in Ivory Coast in the last 16 to South Africa.</p><h2 id=\"are-morocco-and-senegal-going-to-the-fifa-world-cup-2026\">Are Morocco and Senegal going to the FIFA World Cup 2026?</h2><p>Both teams have qualified for the World Cup this year. However, Senegal supporters are unsure whether they can attend the team’s first two games in the United States because of a travel ban imposed by the Trump administration.</p><p>The Teranga Lions play their first match against France in New Jersey on June 16, four days before facing Norway in the same stadium. Senegal will face a playoff winner between Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq in Toronto for its final group game on June 26.</p><p>Morocco is in Group C with Brazil, Haiti and Scotland. Moroccan fans will not be affected by the travel ban.</p><h2 id=\"will-morocco-host-the-2028-afcon\">Will Morocco host the 2028 AFCON?</h2><p>Morocco will hope that it provided the best playing facilities, stadiums and infrastructure in the history of the tournament on the continent as it continues its preparations to be a 2030 World Cup co-host.</p><p>It’s likely it will get another dry run before the global showpiece as host of the 2028 Africa Cup of Nations, brought forward a year from 2029 to allow the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to switch the competition to a four-year cycle that brings it in line with FIFA’s calendar.</p><p>Few countries in Africa would be able to host the event at such short notice. Morocco, which has invested heavily in football and transport infrastructure, is also hosting three Women’s Africa Cup tournaments in succession, with the third beginning March 17.</p><p>The next AFCON is due to take place in 2027 in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>The nations have played each other 31 times, with Morocco winning 18 of the encounters and Senegal winning six.</p><p>A number of their encounters, including the last, have come at the African Nations Championship (CHAN) – a tournament where only players that play their club football on the continent can compete.</p><p>This, incredibly, will be their first meeting at an AFCON.</p><h2 id=\"senegal-team-news\">Senegal team news</h2><p>Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly is out because of an accumulation of yellow cards. It’s his second suspension of the tournament after a red card in the group stage, and it will be the second final he misses through suspension after the 2019 final, which Senegal lost to Algeria. Koulibaly’s semifinal was cut short by injury, so it’s uncertain if he could have played.</p><p>Senegal midfielder Habib Diarra is also suspended because of yellow cards. He was booked in the semifinal win over Egypt for arguing.</p><h2 id=\"senegal-predicted-starting-lineup\">Senegal predicted starting lineup</h2><p>Mendy; Diatta, Sarr, Niakhate, Diouf; Diarra, I. Gueye, P. Gueye; Ndiaye, Jackson, Mane</p><h2 id=\"morocco-team-news\">Morocco team news</h2><p>Azzedine Ounahi has missed the entirety of the competition with a calf injury, and the midfielder is expected to be absent once again for the final.</p><p>Romain Saiss picked up a muscle injury in Morocco’s opening match against Comoros and remains absent.</p><h2 id=\"morocco-s-predicted-starting-lineup\">Morocco’s predicted starting lineup</h2><p>Bono; Hakimi, Aguerd, Masina, Mazraoui; El Aynaoui; Diaz, El Khannouss, Saibari, Ezzalzouli; El Kaabi</p></div></div></body></html>"
