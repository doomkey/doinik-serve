It’s not like dropping a bomb… Starvation can take 60 to 80 days.

It’s about dismantling a society and reducing its people to desperate, starving victims,” de Waal added. “It also encourages the abuser to think of the sufferer as dehumanised, so it becomes self-justifying.”</p>\n<h3>A strategy of annihilation</h3>\n<p>Through its 21-month war, Israel’s leaders have repeatedly claimed their war on Gaza was to “defeat Hamas” and rescue the captives held in the territory.</p>\n<p>However, with every new offensive, its critics around the world have accused it of either turning a blind eye to the humanitarian consequences of its actions or actively seeking to punish Palestinians and force starvation upon them.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you can call this a strategy,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how much is planned, how much is tactical, cynical, opportunistic or just incompetence. It all depends where you look.”</p>\n<p>Mekelberg broke down the factions competing for final say in Israeli policy, from the messianic ambitions of ultranationalist government ministers, such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who would like to see the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank expelled, to a security establishment that Mekelberg described as divided over whether it should continue or end the war.</p>\n<p>“Lastly, you have the cynical and the opportunistic,” he continued, “which is essentially Benjamin Netanyahu and his adherents. To them, this is all about politics and surviving for another day,” Mekelberg said of the prime minister, who is on trial on multiple corruption charges.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3835332\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3835332\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3835332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-09T185432Z_1911545309_RC26JFARLUUE_RTRMADP_3_USA-ISRAEL-1752418834.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Netanyahu\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3835332\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Netanyahu has been on trial on corruption charges throughout much of the war on Gaza [File: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>The legacy of destruction</h3>\n<p>The consequences of Israel’s actions in Gaza will last generations, analysts said.</p>\n<p>Those who survive Israel’s current war will carry its scars, as will their descendants, while those who leave are unlikely to be allowed to return.</p>\n<p>“Israel has adopted a formula in the last few weeks where it is making conditions in Gaza intolerable and unable to support human life,” said Mouin Rabbani, co-editor of Jadaliyya.</p>\n<p>“If it can reduce life to such a level and at the same time increase the level of chaos and anarchy [across Gaza], the thinking is that people will leave.”</p>\n<p>Once they have been forced from their homeland, either through the conditions that Israel has imposed, or via the one-way entrance into what Israeli government ministers call a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/lapid-olmert-slam-israels-plans-for-concentration-camps-in-gazas-rafah\">“humanitarian city”</a>, while many critics call it a concentration camp, it intends to construct along the border with Egypt, they won’t be allowed back, Rabbani said.</p>\n<p>Hardly a day has gone by since Israel’s assault upon Gaza began in October 2023 that its war has not dominated headlines.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, as starvation and the extent of the near-total destruction that Israel has visited upon the enclave have grown, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/is-the-international-community-finally-speaking-up-about-israel\">so too has the disquiet </a>among the international community.</p>\n<p>However, in the face of the protests, and with ceasefire negotiations supposedly ongoing, Israel’s war has shown few signs of slowing.</p>\n<p>That has left Gaza’s population, in the words of Summerfield, left to “wander Gaza; starving, alone and hunted”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

There have been skirmishes before, but this is the first time fighter jets have been involved, marking a significant escalation.</p>\n<p>The border areas are replete with centuries-old historical temples, some of which are claimed by both sides.</p>\n<p>Although the establishment of a demilitarised zone has been discussed in the past, there are no formal zones in place now.</p>\n<p>Troops from both sides clashed in 2011 near the Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, killing 15-20 people and causing the displacement of thousands.</p>\n<p>Cambodia first took the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1963. In 2011, Cambodia again went to the ICJ in relation to the Preah Vihear Temple. The ICJ ruled in Cambodia’s favour and handed it control of the immediate area around the temple in 2013.</p>\n<p>However, the court did not address any of the other disputed areas, especially those within the “Emerald Triangle”, a shared border region between Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, where troops also frequently clash.</p>\n<p>Thailand has refused to acknowledge the ICJ’s jurisdiction in this issue. Tensions have simmered until this year’s escalation.</p>\n<p>“The whole situation has been spiralling downwards for weeks, with Cambodia laying landmines that injured Thai soldiers, and Bangkok’s expulsion of the Cambodian ambassador was apparently the last straw,” Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates Consultancy, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“So now the question is really how long will both sides continue fighting, and how many civilians will get killed in the indiscriminate crossfire that is already apparent,” he added.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-have-tensions-escalated-between-thailand-and-cambodia-this-year\">How have tensions escalated between Thailand and Cambodia this year?</h2>\n<ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>On February 13, Cambodian soldiers escorted 25 civilians to the Prasat Ta Moan Thon Temple, where they reportedly sang the Cambodian national anthem. Thai military officials said they stopped the tourists from singing, on the basis that it violated mutual agreements about tourist protocols.</li>\n<li>On February 17, the Thai army sent a warning letter to the Cambodian military, accusing it of “inappropriate behaviour” and instructing it not to repeat the incident of February 13. In a statement, the Thai Ministry of National Defence said the temple was officially in Thai territory and that while Cambodian citizens could visit, singing the country’s national anthem “raises concerns”.</li>\n<li>On May 28, both sides clashed in the disputed border area of the Emerald Triangle, leaving one Cambodian soldier dead. The tri-border area connects Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. Again, each side blamed the other for starting the violence.</li>\n<li>On June 12, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announced that Cambodia would stop relying on Thai electricity and internet infrastructure due to “threats”. Cambodian TV stations stopped broadcasting Thai movies, and Cambodia also blocked imports of fuel and gas, as well as fruit and vegetables, from Thailand.</li>\n<li>On June 14, officials from both countries met in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for talks. However, no concrete agreement for peace was reached. Both countries instead boosted border security and tightened checks at crossings.</li>\n<li>On June 15, Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2024/8/16/who-is-paetongtarn-shinawatra-thailands-new-youngest-prime-minister\">Paetongtarn Shinawatra</a>, who is the country’s youngest premier at 38, held a call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen and discussed the tensions. Hun Sen is the father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet.</li>\n<li>On June 26, Thailand ordered operators to stop providing broadband and mobile internet connections to Cambodia.</li>\n<li>On July 1, Shinawatra was suspended after her phone call with Hun Sen was leaked to the public. In it, Shinawatra appeared to criticise the Thai military’s actions, signalling discord between the government and the army. Pro-military protesters have since called for her resignation.</li>\n<li>On July 16, a Thai soldier lost a leg in a landmine explosion while on patrol in First was in the Chong Bok area of Nam Zuen district, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, escalating tensions.</li>\n<li>On July 23, a second blast injured five Thai soldiers near Chong An Ma point, in Ubon Ratchathani province, causing a second soldier to lose a leg. Thailand immediately recalled its ambassador to Cambodia and shut border checkpoints at Chong An Ma, Chong Sa-ngam, Chong Chom and Chong Sai Takoo. Ta Moan Thom and Ta Kwai temples were also closed.</li>\n<li>On July 24, violence erupted between the two sides, involving heavy weapons and air attacks.

We may have to take actions we have tried to avoid in the past,” she said.</p>\n<p>For his part, Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Manet, has urged an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to stop “Thailand’s aggression”. Manet said Thai forces launched “unprovoked, premeditated and deliberate attacks” on the Cambodian border, violating international law.</p>\n<p>“Facing this flagrant aggression, Cambodian troops had no option but to respond in self-defence in order to safeguard Cambodia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Manet wrote in a letter to UNSC President Asin Iftikhar Ahmad.</p>\n<p>“It is profoundly reprehensible that this act of aggression occurs while Cambodia is actively pursuing peaceful and impartial legal avenues to resolve outstanding border issues with Thailand through both bilateral and international mechanisms,” he added.</p>\n<p>Both countries have closed borders and announced evacuations of their citizens from the border zones. The Thai embassy in Phnom Penh urged citizens to leave Cambodia.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-reactions-have-there-been-from-other-nations-and-international-bodies\">What reactions have there been from other nations and international bodies?</h2>\n<p>The United States and China issued warnings to their citizens to be vigilant in the border areas.</p>\n<p>The US embassy in Thailand urged Americans to heed advice from Thai authorities, who commenced evacuation from the worst-hit areas on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters at a news conference on Thursday that China is “deeply concerned” about escalating tensions between its neighbours, and stressed the importance of “maintaining friendly relations” with “long-term interests on both sides”.</p>\n<p>China will “continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace and dialogue to help ease tensions”, the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia and current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Thailand and Cambodia are members, said he would engage both sides in negotiations.</p>\n<p>“I have sent messages to both prime ministers and look forward to speaking with them later today or tonight,” he told reporters.</p>\n<p>“The least we can expect is for them to stand down and hopefully try to enter into negotiation,” Ibrahim said, calling the situation “worrying” and describing Thailand and Cambodia as key ASEAN members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-this-situation-escalate-further\">Will this situation escalate further?</h2>\n<p>Robertson of AHRLA said the situation would likely “get worse before it gets better”.</p>\n<p>Bad blood between Cambodian PM Hun Sen and former Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra, respectively the fathers of both countries’ current leaders, could add to the political will to continue fighting, Robertson said.</p>\n<p>Although Thaksin and Hun Sen were longtime allies, Robertson said Hun Sen’s leaking of the recording of  the damaging <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/court-suspends-thailands-pm-pending-case-over-leaked-phone-call\">phone call</a> between him and Thaksin’s daughter, suspended PM Shinawatra, means “the gloves are now off between the two sides.</p>\n<p>“Right now, neither side wants to be seen as conceding any ground to the other, so the fighting is likely to continue for some time, primarily in the form of firing across the border with artillery and firefights across the border in disputed areas,” he said.</p>\n<p>Robertson added: “We’re not going to see either side invade the other, but the damage will be lasting and it’s hard to see how this will be mediated towards peace, at least in the short-to-medium term.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

This is going to make America stronger,” he said.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p>But the maths falls short.</p>\n<p>Multiplying the most recent month of US tariff collections by a full decade would not cover the 10-year costs of President Donald Trump’s new <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/trump-claims-victory-as-he-signs-controversial-budget-and-tax-bill-into-law\">tax-and-spending legislation</a>, much less all federal deficits during that decade. The current tariffs are slated to increase on August 1, including levies ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent for 21 countries,  based on what the Trump administration has said.</p>\n<p>An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) – Congress’s nonpartisan number-crunching arm – also projects that 10 years of tariff revenue increases under Trump will not pay for the added deficits from his bill or the cumulative deficits over the next decade. The projected added deficit from the bill is $3.4 trillion, on top of the existing projected deficit over the next decade of $21.8 trillion.</p>\n<p>“I can’t envision a scenario where the tariff revenues eliminate the deficit,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks the federal budget.</p>\n<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-is-the-us-collecting-from-trump-tariffs\">How much is the US collecting from Trump tariffs?</h2>\n<p>The federal government has been taking in higher tariff revenues under Trump’s more aggressive tariff policies. Currently, the tariffs are a baseline 10 percent for all countries, plus additional tariffs on some products such as steel. Economists say consumers will ultimately swallow much of the tariff increases.</p>\n<p>Federal tariff revenue tracked by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model shows that, up to July 11, the federal government had collected about $100bn in tariffs so far this year. During the same period in 2024, before Trump took office, the federal government had collected less than $48bn in tariff revenue.</p>\n<p>In June 2025, the most recent monthly data available, the federal government took in $27bn in tariffs, according to the Treasury Department. A year earlier, that figure was $6bn. That’s an increase of $21bn a month because of Trump’s trade policies.</p>\n<p>If the government were to continue collecting tariff revenue at the June 2025 pace for a full decade – 120 months – that would produce $2.52 trillion in tariff revenue.</p>\n<p>That is in the ballpark of what the CBO published in June. Taking into account the potential economic shrinkage from higher tariffs, such as higher consumer prices, CBO projected that the boost in tariff revenue would reduce total federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-this-tariff-revenue-compare-with-the-federal-deficit\">How does this tariff revenue compare with the federal deficit?</h2>\n<p>Without adding in the deficits from the bill Trump just signed, CBO’s baseline projection for the cumulative deficits over the next 10 years is almost $21.8 trillion. That is about seven times the size of the CBO’s projected tariff revenues over the same period.</p>\n<p>And the projected tariff revenue under Trump would not fully cover the added deficits just from the “megabill” Trump signed. According to CBO estimates, the law Trump signed on July 4 will raise deficits by $3.4 trillion beyond their previous trajectory over the next 10 years, which exceeds CBO’s tariff revenue projection.</p>\n<p>There is uncertainty about how much tariff revenue Trump’s policies will generate, because he has frequently announced and then <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/10/how-trump-flip-flopped-on-pausing-tariffs\">paused</a> higher tariffs.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to know what the end game is,” Ellis said. “Is it high tariffs to generate revenue, which would reduce economic activity, or is it to rebalance the trade and eventually lower tariffs”, and thus their revenue?</p>\n<p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group, has noted that Trump’s tariff policies have been challenged in court, and the <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/29/us-trade-court-rules-trumps-sweeping-global-tariffs-are-unlawful\">initial ruling</a> by the Court of International Trade went against the administration.</p>\n<p>If the initial ruling is upheld on <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/29/federal-appeals-court-temporarily-reinstates-trump-tariffs\">appeal</a>, then Trump would lose his power to unilaterally enact many of the tariffs he has been imposing, and the new tariff revenues now being generated would largely dry up.</p>\n<p>And even if Trump’s tariff powers are upheld on appeal, Trump’s successor could reverse them by executive order, meaning any tariff revenues would cover the next four years, not the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2>\n<p>Lutnick said tariffs are “going to pay off our deficit”.</p>\n<p>Trump’s on-again, off-again pattern for implementing tariffs makes estimates tricky. But two projections show that the Trump administration’s tariff revenues would not cover the next 10 years of projected deficits.</p>\n<p>The CBO said it expects tariff revenues to reach $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, while a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the tariffs collected in June 2025 would reach $2.52 trillion.</p>\n<p>Both sums are only a fraction of the nearly $22 trillion in cumulative deficits projected over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We rate the statement <strong>False</strong>.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It has begun. Some [protesters] have moved.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>At the time, Bangladeshi security forces had denied firing on protesters from the air, but Shabir Sharif, an accident and emergency doctor at the Popular Medical College Hospital in Dhaka, told the I-Unit that shots were fired from a helicopter “targeting our hospital entrance”.</p>\n<p>He added that doctors attended to student protesters with unusual bullet wounds.</p>\n<p>“The bullets entered either the shoulder or the chest, and they all remained inside the body. We were receiving more of these types of patients at that time,” he said. “When we looked at the X-rays, we were surprised because there were huge bullets.” Al Jazeera has not been able to verify what type of bullets were used.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852383\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852383\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DrSharif-1753272179.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dr. Shabir Sharif\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr Shabir Sharif [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The calls may be presented by prosecutors as evidence before the ICT, which has charged Hasina, her ministers and security officials with crimes against humanity. Hasina and two other officials were indicted on July 10, and the trial is scheduled to begin in August.</p>\n<p>Hasina’s surveillance network, the NTMC, recorded these conversations. The NTMC has previously been accused of spying on not just opposition figures but even Hasina’s political allies.</p>\n<p>Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor for the ICT, said the former prime minister knew she was being recorded.</p>\n<p>“In some cases, the other side [would say we] … ‘should not discuss this over telephone’. And the reply was from the prime minister, ‘Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know, it is being recorded, no problem.’”</p>\n<p>“She has dug a very deep ditch for others. Now she’s in the ditch,” Islam said.</p>\n<p>Student protests started peacefully in June 2024 after the high court reintroduced an unpopular quota system that reserved state jobs for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. Many students felt the system favoured supporters of the ruling Awami League party, which had led the freedom movement, and that many jobs in the civil service were not awarded on merit.</p>\n<p>On July 16, student protester Abu Sayed was shot dead by police in the northern city of Rangpur. His death was a turning point in the July uprising, leading to a national outcry and intensifying the protests.</p>\n<p>In one secret phone recording of Hasina’s ally and economics adviser, Salman F Rahman, he is heard trying to get hold of Sayed’s postmortem report. During the call, Rahman quizzes inspector general of police, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, wanting to know what had happened to the report.</p>\n<p>“Why is it taking so long to get the postmortem report? Who’s playing hide and seek? Rangpur Medical?” he asked, referring to Rangpur Medical College and Hospital, which was carrying out the autopsy on Sayed.</p>\n<p>Rangpur Medical College Hospital’s Dr Rajibul Islam told Al Jazeera that police forced him to change Sayed’s postmortem report five times to remove any reference to multiple bullet wounds.</p>\n<p>“They wanted to write a report stating that Abu Sayed Bhai died due to injuries from stone-throwing … [whereas] he died from police bullets.”</p>\n<p>Twelve days after Sayed’s death, his family were flown to Dhaka for a televised event with the prime minister. In all, about 40 families were gathered – all of them had relatives killed in the protests.</p>\n<p>“Hasina forced us to come to Ganabhaban,” said Sayed’s father, Maqbul Hossain, referring to the PM’s residence. “They forced us to come; otherwise, they might have tortured us in another way.”</p>\n<p>As the cameras recorded the event, Hasina handed out money to each family. She told Sayed’s sister, Sumi Khatun: “We will deliver justice to your family.”</p>\n<p>Khatun replied to the PM: “It was shown in the video that the police shot him. What is there to investigate here? Coming here was a mistake.”</p>\n<p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, an Awami League spokesperson said Hasina had never used the phrase “lethal weapons”, and did not specifically authorise the security forces to use lethal force.</p>\n<p>“This [Hasina’s phone] recording is either cherry-picked, doctored or both.”</p>\n<p>The statement added that government efforts to investigate Abu Sayed’s death were “genuine”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Settlers have been rampaging with impunity, attacking and killing Palestinian civilians and burning their properties and olive groves.</p>\n<p>According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 948 Palestinians have been killed in the territory by Israeli soldiers since October 7, 2023. Of that figure, at least 204 are children.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, from the beginning of 2024 until the end of June 2025, more than 2,200 Israeli settler attacks were <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/palestinian-child-shot-dead-in-west-bank-by-israeli-forces-amid-land-grabs\">reported</a>, resulting in more than 5,200 Palestinian injuries, according to OCHA figures. In that same period, nearly 36,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced across the occupied West Bank due to Israeli military operations, settler violence or home demolitions carried out by the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>The Israeli settler violence in the occupied West Bank is part of the Israeli government’s strategy for preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state, according to Amjad Abu El Ezz, a lecturer of international relations at the Arab American University.</p>\n<p>The increased number of killings, and the destruction of Palestinian homes and vehicles by Israeli settlers in coordination with the Israeli army, aim to encourage Palestinians to leave their land, Abu El Ezz told Al Jazeera from Ramallah.</p>\n<p>Israel is weakening the governing Palestinian Authority, “making Palestinian lives impossible”, while at the same time “building Israeli facts on the ground” to prevent the Palestinians from building their own state, he added.</p>\n<p>“We are talking about more than 700,000 Israeli settlers. They have weapons, they are acting as an army in parallel to the Israeli army,” Abu El Ezz said.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Israel’s parliament approved a symbolic measure calling for the annexation of the occupied West Bank.</p>\n<p>Knesset lawmakers <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/israeli-parliament-approves-symbolic-motion-on-west-bank-annexation\">voted</a> 71-13 in favour of the motion on Wednesday, a non-binding vote which calls for “applying Israeli sovereignty to Judea, Samaria and the Jordan Valley” – the Israeli terms for the area.</p>\n<p>The motion, advanced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, is declarative and has no direct legal implications, though it could place the issue of annexation on the agenda of future debates in the parliament.</p>\n<p>The Palestinian Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned the Israeli parliament’s vote on the annexation of the occupied West Bank, calling it “colonial and racist”.</p>\n<p>The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement called it a “dangerous escalation”.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Telegram, the group said the move was a “clear disregard for the international community” and a way for Israel to implement “its criminal plans targeting the land of Palestine and its people”.</p>\n<p>The West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Since then, Israeli settlements have expanded exponentially, despite being illegal under international law and, in the case of settlement outposts, Israeli law.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

I spent most of 2023 preparing for my graduation and getting ready to move from lecture halls to practical training fields, rotating between the laboratories of the Islamic University in Gaza and the eye hospitals spread across the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p data-start=\"473\" data-end=\"1043\">On the evening of October 6, I was organising my books, tools and white coat, getting ready for a long training day at Al-Nasr Eye Hospital in Gaza. My feelings were a mix of excitement and nervousness, but I had no idea that night would mark the end of my peaceful life. At 6am the next morning, October 7, it wasn’t the sound of my alarm that woke me, but the sound of rockets. I opened my eyes, wondering, “Is this a dream or a nightmare?” But the truth was impossible to deny. A war had begun, turning our once-bright lives into a never-ending nightmare.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1045\" data-end=\"1497\">On October 8, I received the devastating news that my university had been destroyed – its laboratories, its classrooms and every place where I had learned how to help patients. Even the graduation hall, where I had pictured myself celebrating at the end of the year, had turned to rubble. I felt a sharp pain in my chest, as if a part of my soul had collapsed. Everything fell apart so suddenly. Overnight, all that I had dreamed of was reduced to ashes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1499\" data-end=\"1760\">On December 27, 2023, the bombing in our neighbourhood intensified, and we were forced to leave our home and flee to the so-called humanitarian zones in Rafah. There, we took shelter in one of the hundreds of tents that had become the only refuge for survivors.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1762\" data-end=\"2216\">There was one thing I still held on to: my knowledge and modest experience in the field of eye care. I began to notice children and women suffering from persistent eye infections, caused by inhaling smoke and dust and constant exposure to dirt. Even I developed an infection in my own eyes. I looked at them, then at myself, and I knew I couldn’t just stand by and watch. I wanted to be a reason someone healed, a reason the light returned to their eyes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2218\" data-end=\"2610\">In December 2024, I volunteered at Al-Razi Health Center, working in the eye clinic under the supervision of a remarkably compassionate doctor. At first, I was afraid and hesitant. The war had taken a toll on my memory and shaken my confidence. But the doctor told me words I will never forget: “You are hardworking. You’ll remember everything. And you will become a tool for healing others.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2612\" data-end=\"2808\">Patients started arriving from everywhere: north, central and southern Gaza. The clinic wasn’t equipped for such numbers, but we did everything we could. I witnessed cases I had never seen before:</p>\n<p data-start=\"2810\" data-end=\"3111\">A four-year-old girl lost her vision completely due to severe corneal burns caused by an explosion near her home. She screamed in pain. She was far too young to endure such suffering. Despite the lack of resources, she underwent surgery to remove her damaged eye and replace it with an artificial one.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3113\" data-end=\"3423\">A man in his late 30s was struck by shrapnel in the face and suffered skull fractures. He had a torn upper eyelid and a deep corneal injury. He needed delicate surgery, but it was postponed multiple times because it required repeated general anaesthesia, which was impossible under the current conditions.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3425\" data-end=\"3697\">A young woman in her 20s had taken a direct hit that caused an orbital fracture and muscle tears around the eye, leading to hypotropia and facial asymmetry. She broke down emotionally at every visit. As a young woman like her, I felt her wound as if it were my own.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3699\" data-end=\"4118\">There was also an elderly man suffering from eye cancer. The disease was eating away at his eye, and there was a strong possibility it would spread to the other one. But we couldn’t help him. Resources were unavailable, and he couldn’t travel for treatment due to the closure of the borders. At every visit, I did my best to lift his spirits, hoping that maybe, just maybe, I could ease his pain, even if only a little.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4120\" data-end=\"4315\">Most children were suffering from chronic conjunctivitis and the appearance of chalazion (fatty cysts on the eyelid), due to dust, touching their eyes with their hands, and a lack of hygiene in the camps.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4317\" data-end=\"4606\">The elderly, most of whom suffered from cataracts, a condition that leads to gradual loss of vision, needed lens removal surgery and intraocular lens implantation, but all such operations were postponed due to the disruption of communication with northern Gaza, the only place in the Strip where the necessary equipment was available.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4608\" data-end=\"5056\">During those months, the operating rooms turned into real teaching labs for me after the occupation destroyed the university’s lab. I accompanied the doctor to every surgery, performing them by the light of hope and the sounds of bombing. One time, a rocket hit a house next to the centre while we were inside the operating room. Despite the panic, we held ourselves together. We didn’t break down. Instead, we completed the operation successfully.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5058\" data-end=\"5285\">In the few moments of spare time, there wasn’t only room to talk about medicine. We spoke about the pain, about our lost homes, about our missing relatives, about postponed dreams. The war spoke from every corner of the clinic.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5287\" data-end=\"5540\">We faced severe difficulties due to the shortage of medicines. We had to prescribe alternatives whose side effects we didn’t fully know, but what else could we do? There was no other choice. The crossings were closed, and the medicines were unavailable.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5542\" data-end=\"5821\">One day, during a surgery, I felt dizzy and had severe chest pain. I couldn’t bear it, and fainted from extreme exhaustion, malnutrition and psychological pressure. I was just a person trying to hold on. But I didn’t give up. I returned the same day to continue my work at the clinic.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5823\" data-end=\"6312\">In January 2025, with the announcement of a temporary ceasefire, the university resumed sessions at the European Hospital. I went only four times. The road was long, and the place was desolate, filled with the remnants of war. Just one kilometre (two-thirds of a mile) from the clinic’s window, tanks were stationed. I wondered: Should I flee or stay? The ceasefire was no guarantee. Indeed, days didn’t pass before the war returned and the sessions were cancelled, after the occupation took control of the area.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6314\" data-end=\"6340\">We returned to square one.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6342\" data-end=\"6679\">I am still here, moving between health centres, healing, listening and trying to bring light back into people’s lives, literally. My purpose is not forgotten. My spirit is not broken. I was made to help. And I will continue, even through smoke and rubble, with steady hands and an unshakable heart, until the light returns for all of us.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6342\" data-end=\"6679\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Brussels says China’s deepening political and economic relations with Russia since the 2022 invasion represent tacit support for Moscow that has helped its economy weather sweeping Western sanctions.</p>\n<p>Meeting Xi on Thursday, Costa urged China to “use its influence” to help end Russia’s “war of aggression”.</p>\n<p>Last week, the bloc adopted a new package of sanctions on Russia – including on two Chinese banks, leading Beijing’s commerce minister to issue “solemn representations” to his EU counterpart.</p>\n<p>“This is a core issue for Europe,” the senior EU official said.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"joint-statement-on-climate\">Joint statement on Climate</h2>\n<p>While expectations for any concrete deals were low heading into the summit, Brussels and Beijing have signed an agreement on climate change and carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>According to the joint statement, China and the EU have agreed to uphold the goals of Paris agreement and enhance “bilateral cooperation” in areas such as  “energy transition, adaptation, methane emissions management and control, carbon markets and green and low-carbon technologies.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-summit-mean-for-the-us\">What does this Summit mean for the US?</h2>\n<p>Chinese state media and officials have billed the EU-China summit as a chance for Beijing and the EU to normalise relations at a time of global uncertainty, stirred by United States President Donald Trump and others.</p>\n<p>The EU is likely to seal a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/eu-and-us-edge-closer-to-trade-deal-as-tariff-deadline-looms\">trade deal</a> with the US for a broad tariff of 15 percent on its exports after intense negotiations, avoiding a harsher 30 percent figure threatened by Trump.</p>\n<p>China and the US are also negotiating trade after the two sides agreed to slash tit-for-tat heavy tariffs for 90 days in May. That suspension expires on August 12. In June, the US said it would impose 55 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, down from the 145 percent Trump had imposed in April. In return, Beijing said, it will impose a 10 percent tariff on goods it imports from the US, down from 125 percent.</p>\n<p>Gunnar Wiegand, the former managing director for Asia and the Pacific at the European External Action Service (EEAS) and currently a distinguished fellow at the Indo-Pacific Program of the German Marshall Fund’s Brussels Office, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/eu-china-summit-who-is-attending-and-whats-on-the-agenda\">told</a> Al Jazeera that Europe’s economic relationship with the US is stronger than that with China since they are also NATO allies.</p>\n<p>“With Russia’s war in Ukraine threatening Europe, Brussels will not be pushed closer to Beijing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But as Brussels negotiates tariffs with Washington, certainly there will be an important China dimension in the finalisation of a deal with the US administration.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
