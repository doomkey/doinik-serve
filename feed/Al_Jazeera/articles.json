We never thought about it.”</p><p>But Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.</p><p>Zohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">Israel’s abuses against Palestinians</a>, long considered a taboo subject in US politics.</p><p>He is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.</p><p>“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”</p><p>“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-mamdani-family\">Inside the Mamdani family</h2><p>The son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.</p><p>He earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>When Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.</p><p>Mahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”</p><p>He traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.</p><p>Living with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.</p><p>“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122211\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122211\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-05T050247Z_1026356933_RC24QHAXIBXO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR-1-1763758816.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani and his family\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani stands with his wife Rama Duwaji, mother Mira Nair and father Mahmood Mamdani after winning the 2025 New York City mayoral race [Jeenah Moon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-mood-of-change\">A ‘mood of change’</h2><p>Mahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.</p><p>“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”</p><p>Local media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.</p><p>Mahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.</p><p>“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”</p><p>Mahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor. He described politics as a sphere dominated by the influence of moneyed powers.</p><p>“ I am not sure he knows that world well,” Mahmood said of his son. “He’s a fast learner, and he will learn it.”</p><p>He noted that significant resources were mobilised during the mayoral election to blunt <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/30/zohran-mamdani-supporters-make-final-campaign-push-why-him-why-now\">Zohran’s campaign</a>.</p><p>“ He’s taking on powerful forces. He’s being opposed by powerful forces. They failed during the campaign,” Mahmood said. That defeat, he added, “exposed the failure of money” as a defining force in the race.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122195\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122195\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122195\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25325081535841-1763757989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122195\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be sworn in on January 1 [File: Seth Wenig/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-focus-on-palestine\">A focus on Palestine</h2><p>Mahmood also addressed the role of Zohran’s advocacy on the campaign trail.</p><p>Though faced with criticism from his mayoral rivals, Mamdani has refused to retreat from his stance that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.</p><p>That position, though widely affirmed by <a href=\"/news/2024/12/5/amnesty-international-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">rights groups</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/9/1/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-scholars-group-says\">experts</a>, including at <a href=\"/news/2024/11/14/israels-warfare-methods-in-gaza-consistent-with-genocide-un-committee\">the United Nations</a>, is relatively rare in mainstream US politics, where opposition to Israel is a political third rail.</p><p>Still, voters appear to be shifting on the question of US support for Israel.</p><p>A March poll from the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of US respondents with an unfavourable view of Israel has increased from 42 percent in 2022 to 53 percent in 2025.</p><p>While <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/new-poll-shows-plunging-us-public-support-for-israels-war-on-gaza\">unfavourable views</a> were most pronounced among Democratic voters, they have also increased among conservatives, especially those under the age of 50.</p><p>Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 69,500 Palestinians since its start in October 2023, and there has been continued outrage over <a href=\"/news/2025/10/14/mapping-the-rise-in-israeli-settler-attacks-across-the-occupied-west-bank\">widespread Israeli violence</a> in the occupied West Bank as well.</p><p>Mahmood said the undeniable human rights abuses are causing a shift in public perception – and not just in the US.</p><p>“The real consequence of Gaza is not limited to Gaza. It is global,” said Mahmood. “Gaza has brought us a new phase in world history.”</p><p>“There will never be a return to a period when the world believes that what Israel is doing is defending itself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Democrats had baulked at the prospect, arguing that recent restrictions to government programmes had put healthcare out of reach for some US citizens.</p><p>They also warned that insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire by the end of the year. Without an extension to those subsidies, they said that insurance premiums for many Americans will spike.</p><p>Republicans rejected the prospect of negotiating the issue until after their continuing resolution was passed. Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.</p><p>The two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.</p><p>Only on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge. Late that night, seven Democrats and one independent broke from their caucus to side with Republicans and pass a budget bill to fund the government through January 30.</p><p>The bill was then approved by the House of Representatives on November 12, by a vote of 222 to 209. President Donald Trump signed the legislation into law that very same day.</p><p>Trump had openly sought to leverage the shutdown to eliminate federal programmes he saw as benefitting Democratic strongholds.</p><p>He also attempted to blame the political left for the lapse in government services, though he acknowledged public frustration with Republicans after Democrats won key elections in November.</p><p>“If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” he told a breakfast for Republican senators on November 5. “That was a big factor.”</p><p>The Trump administration had warned as early as October that the month’s consumer price data would be negatively affected as a result of the shutdown.</p><p>In a White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/inflation-remains-low-as-democrat-shutdown-threatens-progress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Trump officials touted Trump’s economic record while slamming a potential lapse in the government’s collection of data. Once again, they angled the blame for any slowed economic growth at the Democrats.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the Democrat Shutdown risks grinding that progress to a halt,” the statement said.</p><p>“Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history — depriving policymakers and markets of critical data and risking economic calamity.”</p><p>September’s Consumer Price Index, the most recent available, showed that inflation across all retail items rose about 3 percent over the previous 12-month period.</p><p>For food alone, inflation for that period was estimated at 3.1 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

has visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), days after the government and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group signed a framework agreement for a peace deal aimed at ending fighting in the country’s east.</p><p>On his first trip to the African country, the Qatari leader was welcomed in the capital Kinshasa on Friday by DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and other officials.</p><section

href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">The frameworkd agreement</a> was the latest in a series of documents signed in recent months as part of efforts, backed by the United States and Qatar, to end decades of fighting in eastern DRC that has been an enduring threat to regional stability.</p><p>The framework was described by the US and Qatari officials as an important step towards peace, but one of many that lie ahead.</p><p>Sheikh Tamim arrived in the DRC a day after visiting Rwanda, where he met President Paul Kagame.</p><p>Rwanda has long denied allegations that it has helped M23, which has seized more territory in the DRC than it has ever previously held.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, reporting from Kinshasa, said the emir wrapped his brief state visit to the country after meeting the Congolese president at the airport and then at the presidential palace.</p><p>Vall said that Qatar signed a number of protocols on economic and political cooperation with the DRC.</p><p>He also said, “The emir of Qatar has made his first stop in Kigali overnight, before he arrived here this morning, and the understanding is that that’s a symbolic move to link the two capitals and show that there is no alternative to rapprochement between the two countries.”</p><p>Qatar’s acting charge d’affaires in the capital Kinshasa, Shafi bin Newaimi al-Hajri, said Sheikh Tamim’s visit to the DRC was of special importance for bilateral relations.</p><p>Al-Hajri said diplomatic ties between the sides expanded in recent years, noting that a DRC embassy was opened in Doha in 2022 and Qatar opened its mission in Kinshasa in May 2025.</p><p>Al-Hajri also stressed that Qatar’s mediation efforts aimed at stabilising eastern DRC played a key role in strengthening dialogue between the two governments.</p><h2 id=\"trade-of-barbs\">Trade of barbs</h2><p>In eastern DRC, violence has continued despite the various diplomatic processes in Washington and Doha, with Congolese authorities and M23 trading blame for violating the principles of earlier agreements and deliberately delaying <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/dr-congo-m23-rebels-resume-talks-in-qatar-after-renewed-violence-in-east\">talks</a>.</p><p>And the prolonged negotiations do not address the threat from a multitude of other armed groups operating in the volatile east.</p><p>M23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.</p><p>The two sides <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\">agreed</a> in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.</p><p>The July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier, separate peace agreement between the Congolese and Rwandan governments made in Washington in June.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sometimes, many of them wear [army] uniforms. Sometimes these are soldiers on reserve duty that are on a break,” she said.</p><p>Some Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, have condemned settler violence, but Novak dismissed the move as a ploy to blame Israel’s policies on a “small group of crazy settlers”.</p><p>Novak also highlighted that most of the killing and destruction in the West Bank is carried out by official Israeli forces, not settlers. “So this is another arm of the violence that Israel inflicts on Palestinians,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-us-lawmakers\">Meeting US lawmakers</h2><p>Novak and her B’Tselem colleague Kareem Jubran have been in Washington, DC, this week, where they met with US lawmakers, including Democratic Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley and <a href=\"/video/the-bottom-line/2025/6/19/senator-van-hollen-netanyahu-outsmarted-trump-on-iran\">Chris Van Hollen,</a> as well as Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.</p><p>Novak said the group wants to stress the need for accountability for the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>“We are talking about a governing system, the Israeli system, that conducted genocide for two years — war crimes on a daily basis — and got away with it with no accountability,” she said.</p><p>“The current situation is probably the most dangerous that we’ve ever been in because not only this violence and this criminality took place, it was also normalised, and in any moment, it can start again, go back to the same scale.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that there is peace in the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years because of the truce he helped broker in Gaza.</p><p>And earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution backing the US president’s 20-point <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza\">plan for Gaza</a>, which calls for an end to the fighting, gradual Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of an international force to the territory.</p><p>The plan would also see Hamas disarm and Gaza’s governance handed over to an international commission, dubbed “the Board of Peace”.</p><p>It has no accountability or compensation mechanism for the horrors that Israel unleashed on Gaza for two years.</p><p>Novak said Trump’s plan is disconnected from the reality on the ground.</p><p>“It just allows everybody to move on, instead of dealing with the situation and demanding Israel not only to be held accountable but also stop this kind of systematic oppression over the Palestinians,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-plan\">Trump’s plan</h2><p>Since the Security Council embraced the ceasefire deal, Israel has faced less international pressure. Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">Eurovision </a><a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">singing contest</a> and European football have lost momentum.</p><p>On Monday, Germany announced it was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/germany-lifts-curbs-on-arms-exports-to-israel-citing-gaza-ceasefire\">lifting restrictions</a> on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.</p><p>“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.</p><p>Jubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza <a href=\"/news/2019/3/30/gazas-great-march-of-return-protests-explained\">from 2006 onwards</a> enabled the genocide.</p><p>“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Despite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.</p><p>“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.</p><p>“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly all of the fishermen, along with their families and descendants, have now returned to European shores, but the statue of the Virgin remained – and, every year on August 15, it is carried in procession out of the church.</p><p>“It’s a unique event,” Hatem Bourial, a Tunisian journalist and radio presenter, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He went on to describe how, in the procession’s heyday in the early 20th century, native Tunisians, Muslims and Jews alike, would join Tunisian-Sicilian Catholics in carrying the statue of the Virgin Mary from the church down to the sea.</p><p>There, participants would ask Mary to bless the fishermen’s boats. Many residents would shout “Long live the Virgin of Trapani!”, Bourial said, while others threw their chechia, a traditional red cap worn in the Maghreb, in the air.</p><p>As well as its religious significance – for Catholics, August 15 marks the day that Mary was taken up into heaven – the feast also coincides with the Italian mid-August holiday of Ferragosto, which traditionally signals the high point of the summer.</p><p>Silvia Finzi, born in Tunis in the 1950s to Italian parents, described how, after the statue had been brought down to the sea, many of La Goulette’s residents would declare that the worst of the punishingly hot Tunisian summer was over.</p><p>“Once the Virgin had been taken down to the water, it was as if the sea had changed”, Finzi, a professor of Italian at the University of Tunis, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“People would say ‘the sea has changed, the summer’s over’, and you wouldn’t need to go swimming to cool down any more”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1763692311.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Canal port of La Goulette, late 19th century\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The canal port of La Goulette, in the late 19th century [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"european-exodus\">European exodus</h2><p>The first European immigrants began to arrive in La Goulette in the early 19th century. Their numbers rapidly increased after 1881, when Tunisia became a French protectorate. At its height in the early 1900s, the number of Italian immigrants – who were largely Sicilians – across the whole of Tunisia is estimated to have been more than 100,000.</p><p>In the decade after 1956, when Tunisia gained its independence from France, the vast majority of its European residents left the country, as the new government pivoted towards nationalism.</p><p>In 1964, the Vatican signed an agreement with Tunisia, transferring control of the majority of the country’s churches – now largely empty – to the government for use as public buildings. The agreement also put an end to all public Christian celebrations, including the procession in La Goulette.</p><p>For more than half a century, August 15 was marked only with a Mass inside the church building, and the statue of Our Lady of Trapani remained immobile in its niche. The date remained important for La Goulette’s much-reduced Catholic population, but it largely ceased to be an important event for the wider community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120855\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120855\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3419-1763692569.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Catholic Church Saint Augustine-and Saint-Fidèle\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Catholic Church of Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele [Joseph Tulloch/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nostalgia\">Nostalgia</h2><p>In 2017, the Catholic Church received permission to restart the procession, initially just inside the church compound. This year, when Al Jazeera visited, the procession left the church property but only travelled as far as the square outside.</p><p>Many attendees were young Tunisian Muslims, with little connection to La Goulette’s historic Sicilian population.</p><p>A major reason for this is undoubtedly the high status accorded to the Virgin Mary in Islam – an entire chapter of the Quran is dedicated to her.</p><p>Other participants seemed to be drawn by a feeling of nostalgia for La Goulette’s multiethnic, multireligious past.</p><p>“I love the procession”, Rania, 26, told Al Jazeera. “Lots of people have forgotten about it now, but European immigration is such an important part of Tunisia’s history”.</p><p>Rania, a student, told Al Jazeera of her love for the 1996 film, Un ete a La Goulette (A Summer in La Goulette).</p><p>Featuring dialogue in three languages, and evocative shots of sunlit courtyards and shimmering beaches, the film is an ode to La Goulette’s past.</p><p>Directed by the renowned Tunisian filmmaker Ferid Boughedir, it follows the lives of three teenage girls – Gigi, a Sicilian, Meriem, a Muslim, and Tina, a Jew – over the course of a summer in the 1960s.</p><p>The film ends, however, on a bleak note, with the outbreak of the 1967 War between Israel and several Arab states, and the subsequent departure of almost all of Tunisia’s remaining Jewish and European residents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120861\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120861\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-1763692837.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C506&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette, 1950s\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette in the 1950s [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"new-migrations\">New migrations</h2><p>As Tunisia’s European population declined, the country has seen an influx of new migrant communities from sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The majority of these new migrants, who number in the tens of thousands, hail from Francophone West Africa. Many come to Tunisia in search of work; others hope to find passage across the Mediterranean to Europe.</p><p>Many of the sub-Saharan migrants – who face <a href=\"/news/2023/7/14/black-tunisians-lie-low-violence-against-black-people-worsens\">widespread discrimination in Tunisia</a> – are Christian, and as a result, they now make up the vast majority of Tunisia’s churchgoing population.</p><p>This fact is reflected in a mural in the church in La Goulette, inspired by the feast of Our Lady of Trapani. Painted in 2017, it depicts the Virgin Mary sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.</p><p>The air around the Virgin in the mural is full of passports. The church’s priest, Father Narcisse, who hails from Chad, told Al Jazeera that these represent the documents that immigrants throw into the sea while making the journey from North Africa to Europe in the hope of evading deportation.</p><p>The mural highlights the fact that the Madonna of Trapani, once considered the protector of Sicilian fishermen, is today called upon by immigrants of far more varied backgrounds.</p><p>“This celebration, in its original form, marked the deep bonds between the two shores of the Mediterranean,” Archbishop of Tunis Nicolas Lhernould told Al Jazeera. “Today, it brings together a more diverse group – Tunisians, Africans, Europeans; locals, migrants, and tourists.”</p><p>“Mary herself was a migrant,” Archbishop Lhernould said, referring to the New Testament story which narrates Mary’s flight, together with the child Jesus and her husband Joseph, from Palestine to Egypt.</p><p>From a Christian perspective, he suggested, “we are all migrants, just passing through, citizens of a kingdom which is not of this world”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120866\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120866\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3658-1763692934.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A mural of the Virgin Mary with migrants and passports around her\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A mural of the Virgin Mary in the Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele church sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians, and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.

The vast majority of these structures – modest buildings built by the newly-arrived fishermen – have been torn down and replaced, and little more than the church remains to testify to the area’s once significant Sicilian presence.</p><p>As of 2019, there were only 800 Italians descended from the original immigrant community left in the whole of Tunisia.</p><p>“There are so few of us left”, said Rita Strazzera, who was born in Tunis to Sicilian parents. The Tunisian-Sicilian community meets very rarely, she explained, with some members coming together for the celebration on the 15th August, and holding occasional meetings in a small bookshop opposite the church.</p><p>Still, the spirit of Little Sicily has not entirely vanished. Traces of the old La Goulette linger – in memory, in film, and, Strazzera told Al Jazeera, in other, more surprising ways as well.</p><p>“Every year, on All Saints’ Day, I go to the graveyard”, said Strazzera, referring to the annual celebration when Catholics remember their deceased loved ones.</p><p>“And there are Tunisians there, Muslims, people who maybe had a Sicilian parent, or a Sicilian grandparent, and have come to visit their graves, because they know it’s what Catholics do.”</p><p>“There have been lots of mixed marriages”, Strazzera added, “and so, every year, there are more of them visiting the graves. When I see them, it’s like a reminder that Little Sicily is still with us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120872\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120872\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120872\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-1763693203.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C471&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sicilian peasants in Tunisia, 1906\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sicilian peasants in Tunisia in 1906 [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Americans trust their military, but that trust is at risk.”</p><p>“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders,” they added.</p><p>“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”</p><p>The Democratic congresspeople, however, did not specify which orders or policies from Trump’s administration might violate the US Constitution.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-responded\">How has Trump responded?</h2><p>In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump lambasted the lawmakers and said their behaviour was “seditious”, seeking to incite people to rebel against his authority.</p><p>“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” he wrote.</p><p>“Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand – We won’t have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,” he added.</p><p>In another post the same day, Trump shared a report by the Washington Examiner on the Democrats’ video and suggested arresting them.</p><p>“This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???”</p><p>An hour later, Trump appeared to suggest sentencing the Democrat lawmakers to death because of their behaviour and wrote on Truth Social: SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Asked by White House reporters if the president would actually sentence the congresspeople to death, press secretary Leavitt said, “No.”</p><p>However, she insisted that none of the President’s orders or policies so far had been against the law.</p><p>“Every single order that is given to this United States military by this commander-in-chief and through this chain of command – through the secretary of war – is lawful,” she told a news briefing on Thursday.</p><p>“We do things by the books. And to suggest and encourage that active-duty service members defy the chain of command is a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do,” she said, adding that the Democrats “should be held accountable” for “their dangerous rhetoric”.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-mean-by-illegal-orders\">What do Democrats mean by ‘illegal orders’?</h2><p>The six Democrats did not specify which orders they were referring to as being “illegal” or against the Constitution.</p><p>Before Trump responded to the video, Republican Representative of Arizona Eli Crane <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385324906112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Fox News that if the Democrats could not “name the unlawful orders”, it would be cowardly.</p><p>“If you can’t name the unlawful orders that these guys are bringing up in their video, you know, that just shows me that you don’t have the courage to even call out what you’re talking about,” he said.</p><p>In a separate segment of Fox News, also on Thursday, anchor Martha MacCallum grilled Colorado Democratic Representative Crow about what orders they considered illegal.</p><p>Referring to the unrest which took place after the killing of Black man George Floyd by a police officer in 2020 during Trump’s first term as president, Crow responded, “The protests at Lafayette Square, where he said, ‘Can’t you just shoot them in the legs or something’, that’s his direct quote.”</p><p>MacCallum said it was not an order, but “a comment”.</p><p>Crow replied: “That’s coming from the president of the US to your generals … he’s also threatened to send the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/chicago-braces-for-possible-national-guard-deployment-what-we-know\">military into Chicago</a> and other cities and go to war with those cities. That is a very disturbing thing.”</p><p>Crow added that Trump had also alluded to sending troops to polling stations during elections and said that would be a violation of US law.</p><p>“US criminal law prohibits troops from going to polling stations,” he added.</p><p></p><p>In a separate post on X on Wednesday, Crow pointed out that the recent <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">US bombing campaign</a> of alleged Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/can-us-strikes-on-suspected-drug-boats-off-venezuela-be-legally-justified\">drug trafficking boats</a> in the Caribbean Sea also violates US law.</p><p>“The President is trampling on the Constitution,” Crow wrote. “Stop politicizing our troops. Stop illegal military strikes. Stop pitting our servicemembers against the American people.”</p><p></p><p>More than 60 people have been killed in US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said: “These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.”</p><p>The Trump administration has argued that the strikes are necessary for anti-drug and counterterrorism operations, but Volker added that operations to counter illicit drug trafficking must adhere to international law.</p><p>“Under international human rights law, the intentional use of lethal force is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life,” he said and called on the US to stop what he said were “extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats”.</p><p>In a joint statement late on Thursday, the Democrats in the video <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1991568438804763103?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>: “No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.”</p><p>“What’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” they said and added that Americans should unite and “condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence”.</p><p>“This is a time for moral clarity.

Don’t Give Up the Ship!”</p><p></p><p>Referring to Trump’s threats against them, Pennsylvania Representative Deluzio told US broadcaster NBC News on Thursday: “It’s a dark day in the country for any president to say such a thing.”</p><p>“We have to end this scourge. And yet Donald Trump is the person with the most power who can bring the temperature down, and instead, he threatens to have us killed,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the Senate on Thursday that what the president wrote “is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious”.</p><p>“When Donald Trump uses the language of execution and treason, some of his supporters may very well listen,” Schumer added. “He is lighting a match in a country soaked with political gasoline.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-us-military-oath-of-enlistment-say-about-following-legal-and-illegal-orders\">What does the US military oath of enlistment say about following legal and illegal orders?</h2><p>Article 92 of the US Uniform Code of Military Justice states that any person who “violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation” or has “knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the armed forces” and fails to obey it, or “is derelict in the performance of his duties”, shall be punished.</p><p>The US Code of Military Justice is a federal law enacted in 1951 and applies to all active armed forces members, armed forces students, as well as active National Guard members.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ucmjlaw.com/courts-martial/military-crimes/failure-to-obey-order-or-regulation/#:~:text=An%20experienced%20military%20defense%20lawyer,for%20up%20to%206%20months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to</a> the office of US Attorney Peter Kageleiry Jr, who specialises in military law, failure to obey lawful orders can lead to punishments like “dishonourable discharge (from duty) and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.”</p><p>However, an order is considered unlawful if it violates the US Constitution.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-given-any-illegal-orders\">Has Trump given any illegal orders?</h2><p>It is debatable.

That ruling was upheld by the Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit later in the month.</p><p>In response, Trump threatened to use the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority\">Insurrection Act</a> to send soldiers to US cities, as the states of Illinois and Oregon continue to fight federal military deployments in court.</p><p>“We have an Insurrection Act for a reason.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For far too long, African youth have been told that democracy is something imported, something borrowed, something foreign to their identity. But history gives us a very different truth. Democracy is not an idea that arrived from the West. It is a human idea. And Africa practised it long before modern states existed.</p><p>Africa’s democratic inheritance is older than the colonial borders that sliced the continent into fragments. In the Somali shir, every man could stand, argue, and vote in open councils that decided collective affairs. The Oromo Gadaa system developed rotating leadership and fixed term limits centuries before they became fashionable anywhere else. Igbo communities governed through village assemblies that rejected kings and insisted on consensus. The Ashanti used councils of elders to check the power of chiefs and remove them when they broke trust. In Botswana, the Tswana kgotla provided public debate forums where leaders listened more than they spoke. These systems did not look identical to modern democracies, but the principle was unmistakable: power must serve the community, and the community must hold power accountable.</p><p>Democratic ideas are not confined to any one civilisation. Ancient Athens developed its own form of citizen rule. Islamic governance emphasised shura, consultation. Confucian models in East Asia built a meritocratic civil service long before Europe did. And when modern democracy regained momentum in the 18th century, America made a historic contribution by not only establishing it but sustaining it through institutions that could survive war, crisis, and political division. That legacy is real and should never be dismissed. But democracy’s story is not Western. It is human. And Africa’s contribution to it is undeniable.</p><p>Today, young Africans face a new challenge. They are living in the attention economy, where anger spreads faster than reason and where misinformation travels in seconds. This environment creates enormous pressure on leaders to react rather than reflect. It rewards the strongman’s sprint instead of the institution’s marathon. But democracies win marathons, not sprints. The short-term appeal of authoritarian certainty can never match the long-term stability of accountable institutions. Africa cannot afford to trade long-term freedom for short-term frustration.</p><p>Modern African societies are not starting from zero. Botswana’s democratic resilience, Senegal’s peaceful transfers of power, Ghana’s strengthening institutions, and Kenya’s judicial independence show that African democracies can adapt, evolve, and correct themselves. At the same time, other countries face real challenges: contested elections, corruption, political exclusion, and the weaponisation of identity. Naming these problems honestly is not a weakness. It is how democracies grow.</p><p>Reclaiming democracy today must also mean expanding it. The systems of the past often excluded women and marginalised groups. A modern African democracy must belong equally to women, young people, minorities, and all those whose voices were historically silenced. Reclaiming an inheritance does not mean returning to the past. It means carrying it forward with greater justice.</p><p>Technology is Africa’s new multiplier. Artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and open learning resources can give young Africans something no previous generation ever had: the ability to learn globally and compete globally without asking permission from any gatekeeper. Connectivity is still uneven. Infrastructure is still expensive. Policies lag behind innovation. But the potential is unmistakable. Every major leap in human history rewarded the adopters: the printing press, steam power, electricity, the green revolution, the internet, and now AI. Africa has a young population. If it embraces AI early, with strong civic values and clear safeguards, the continent can achieve a leap no region has ever achieved.</p><p>Democracy is not protected by slogans. It is protected by habits. Young Africans can strengthen democracy not only in elections but in everyday practice. Reviving local consultative forums. Creating student parliaments. Running community debates. Challenging misinformation. Defending independent journalism. Building digital literacy campaigns. These small habits create big cultures. And perhaps most importantly, Africans must reject the narrative that democracy belongs to somebody else. Authoritarianism is not African. Silence is not African. The continent’s heritage is debate, dialogue, consensus, accountability, and community decision-making. To reclaim democracy is to reclaim what Africa has always known: that power must be held in trust, not taken by force.</p><p>The future belongs to the young. If African youth defend their voice, their freedom, their diversity, their truth, and their dignity, they will build institutions stronger than any individual. They will build a continent where unity does not erase nations and where sovereignty does not silence citizens. A continent where Africa rises not as a copy of another model but as itself. Democracy is not something Africa must borrow. It is something Africa is ready to lead.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Europe will add $100bn to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">15.

Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-ukraine-reacted-to-these-proposals\">How has Ukraine reacted to these proposals?</h2><p>Zelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.</p><p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan\">said</a> in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”</p><p>Zelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”</p><p>The Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mean-ukraine-and-its-allies-will-accept-the-proposal\">Does this mean Ukraine and its allies will accept the proposal?</h2><p>No.</p><p>“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.</p><p>While European leaders have not reacted to the 28-point plan, they have indicated that they would not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such concessions.</p><p>“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”</p><p>For now, Ukraine’s allies are not commenting. European Council President Antonio Costa said that the EU has not yet been officially informed about the US plan, so “it makes no sense to comment” on it.</p><p>More reactions from Europe might come starting from Saturday, when Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak at the G20 summit.</p><p>“A 28-point plan was made public. We will discuss the situation both with European leaders and with leaders here on the sidelines of the G20,” von der Leyen said, according to UK media.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-russia-and-the-us-saying-about-this-plan-now\">What are Russia and the US saying about this plan now?</h2><p>The US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.</p><p>Russia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.</p><p>“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.</p><p>In an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.</p><p>“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-do-analysts-say-about-these-proposals\">What do analysts say about these proposals?</h2><p>Experts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.</p><p>“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.</p><p>For instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.</p><p>Giles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-us-be-compensated-for-security-guarantees\">How would the US be ‘compensated’ for security guarantees?</h2><p>It is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.</p><p>Point 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.</p><p>Point 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.</p><p>The plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.</p><p>The plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.</p><p>Giles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>In October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.</p><p>Giles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.</p><p>Giles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.</p><p>However, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.</p><h2 id=\"would-the-proposal-give-russia-amnesty-for-war-crimes\">Would the proposal give Russia amnesty for war crimes?</h2><p>Point 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.</p><p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href=\"/news/2023/3/17/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-russias-putin-over-ukraine-crimes\">issued an arrest warrant</a> for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.</p><p>The US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.</p><p>“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.</p><p>He added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.</p><p>“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.</p><h2 id=\"what-territory-would-ukraine-have-to-concede\">What territory would Ukraine have to concede?</h2><p>The plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.</p><p>Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.</p><p>Crimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.</p><p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Russia also controls 75 percent of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/russia-gains-ground-in-zaporizhzhia-in-southeastern-ukraine\">Zaporizhia</a> and <a href=\"/features/2025/9/15/russian-occupiers-brought-death-and-intimidation-to-kherson-ukrainian-teen\">Kherson</a> in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea.
