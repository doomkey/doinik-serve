Some have now been living in the basement for nearly two months.</p>\n<p>Most of these men – along with a handful of women – are former prisoners in Russia who have been deported after serving their sentences, but some have been expelled for other reasons, such as problems with their immigration documents.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, July 20, they mounted a protest.</p>\n<p>“We’re not allowed outside!” one of the men shouted as they were surrounded by security personnel on the premises.</p>\n<p>“We’re being tortured here,” called another.</p>\n<p>“It’s damp, there’s [disabled people] here without medical attention, there’s nothing here at all,” he added.</p>\n<p>A video sent by the deportees to Al Jazeera shows one man very seriously harming himself during the Sunday night protest.</p>\n<p>“He’s been here more than a month,” 45-year-old Nikolai Lopata, one of the other detainees, told Al Jazeera by phone.</p>\n<p>“He was promised twice [that] he would be taken away. He bought [travel] tickets twice, and both times no one returned the money,” Lopata said, noting that the man, who suffers from anxiety, has repeatedly been denied permission to travel through Georgia to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>An ambulance arrived after more than an hour, and paramedics bandaged his wounds, then left without him. The man, who appeared in the video to be in his late 30s or early 40s, was not hospitalised and remains at the checkpoint,<strong> </strong>volunteers at the scene who are in contact with Al Jazeera said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852445\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852445\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852445\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_20250722_031512_451-1753274206.jpg?w=720&amp;resize=720%2C1280&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia-Georgia border\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian detainees wait in an underground holding area at the Russia-Georgia border, where men sleep in shifts due to the lack of beds [Courtesy of Nikolai Lopata]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"they-won-t-let-us-in-or-out\">‘They won’t let us in or out’</h2>\n<p>The detainees, who have arrived from Russia or territories occupied by Russia and have been released from prison in recent months, are now stuck in limbo in this buffer zone, Lopata explained. In total, approximately 800 deportees are thought to be stuck in Russia or at Russian-Georgian border points, experts say.</p>\n<p>“They [Georgian border officials] took our documents. They won’t let us in or out of Georgia. They keep telling us ‘tomorrow, tomorrow’. Some people have been here for more than a month and a half in terrible, unbearable conditions,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Originally from Dnipro in central Ukraine, Lopata said he had been living in Russia, where he has a Russian wife, two children and a sister, since 2005. But in 2010, he was convicted of murder. When he completed his sentence in 2024, he was sent to a deportation centre for another year. By then, the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine was raging, so getting a one-way flight to Kyiv was impossible.</p>\n<p>“Last summer, they [the Russian authorities] promised to send me to Georgia. Then, in winter, they promised to send me to Ukraine through Belarus. Then, we were taken to the border of Georgia, which supposedly accepts us, but Georgia is not accepting,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Instead, when he reached the border on July 4, Lopata said, he was photographed, fingerprinted and had his documents confiscated by Georgian border officials before being taken to a cellar.</p>\n<p>“We don’t do anything. We sit in the basement,” Lopata continued, explaining that the men sleep in shifts because there are only 40 beds.</p>\n<p>The men are provided with very little and lack reliable medical assistance, instead having to rely on emergency care.</p>\n<p>“An ambulance comes almost every day, sometimes twice a day, because there are disabled people, there are sick people,” Lopata said, adding that there is someone with epilepsy, a person with HIV, and another with tuberculosis. “But they don’t offer anything besides immediate help. Yesterday, for example, they made an injection of painkiller, then said, ‘That’s it, we can’t help with anything else.’”</p>\n<p>Activists and volunteers try to bring essentials to the detainees each week.</p>\n<p>Food, household items and personal hygiene products are delivered by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMKVq3qIVHm/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volunteers Tbilisi</a>, an organisation helping Ukrainian refugees in Georgia.</p>\n<p>“There is no access to fresh air, there is a lot of heat and the cellars are closed,” organiser Maria Belkina told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“These are not conditions you can live in at all.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_20250722_031524_459-1753274221.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia deportees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian deportees held at the Russia-Georgia borders are not allowed to cross the red barrier except under supervision [Courtesy of Nikolai Lopata]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"route-through-moldova-cancelled\">Route through Moldova cancelled</h2>\n<p>Anna Skripka, a lawyer for the NGO, Protection of Prisoners of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera that this problem has been mounting for the past two years of the war in Ukraine: “This humanitarian disaster started in 2023.”</p>\n<p>Skripka said some people have become so desperate they have tried to kill themselves. “They didn’t understand what was going on,” she said.</p>\n<p>“The conditions there are terrible.”</p>\n<p>According to Skripka, there are 84 men and seven women currently being detained, and while the women are held in a separate room, their conditions are also poor.</p>\n<p>“The women complain to me that they’re not being taken to the toilet,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>“They asked us to buy them a bucket with a lid to go to the toilet.”</p>\n<p>Previously, deportees at this border crossing were transferred by bus to Tbilisi Airport to fly to Moldova and then on to Ukraine. That’s how Ukrainian activist Andriy Kolomiyets, considered a political prisoner by the Russian human rights group Memorial, returned home earlier this month after serving 10 years on drug and attempted murder charges.</p>\n<p>Skripka explained that 43 detainees managed to leave between early June and July, landing in Moldova and then getting a bus to Ukraine. But four of them got off the bus and stayed in Moldova, prompting the landlocked Eastern European country to halt cooperation.</p>\n<p>“They’re already back in Ukraine,” Skripka said about the missing four, which Al Jazeera could not confirm, “but Moldova said, ‘Stop, we do not want to risk it.’”</p>\n<p>As a result, since mid-July, Moldova has refused passage for Ukrainian deportees from Russia.</p>\n<p>While Georgia was cooperative at first, it has also begun refusing to allow deportees through on the basis that many are ex-convicts who have served prison time in Russia, seriously limiting the options for Ukrainians trying to return.</p>\n<p>“Most of these individuals have a serious criminal past and have been convicted numerous times for grave or particularly grave crimes,” the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>\n<p>But Skripka said that it is unfair to smear them all as hardened criminals. Some were expelled from Russia for lacking proper paperwork. Others have had their Russian citizenship revoked.</p>\n<p>Their treatment, Skripka argues, goes beyond bureaucratic injustice; it raises serious legal and moral questions.</p>\n<p>“They were beaten, pushed from another country by the barrel of a machinegun … they are victims of war crimes,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>Further complicating things, many of the deportees lack the proper documentation.</p>\n<p>Ukraine has been issuing “white passports” – emergency documents to allow citizens to travel home – but these only last for 30 days<b>.</b></p>\n<p>Some Ukrainian politicians have spoken out.</p>\n<p>Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha <a href=\"https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1946526214425813071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> Russia of “weaponizing the deportation of Ukrainian citizens through Georgia”.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>“We are actively working with the Georgian and Moldovan sides to get the rest of our people transited to Ukraine,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“To avoid further complications, we publicly offer Russia to send these categories of Ukrainian citizens directly to the Ukrainian border. We will be prepared to take them on from there. There are relevant parts of the border where this can be done.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-matter-of-national-security\">A matter of national security</h2>\n<p>Once detainees have returned to Ukraine, they must undergo a thorough security check.</p>\n<p>“They were in Russia for a long time. Everything is possible. They could have been recruited [by Russian intelligence]. This is a matter of national security for Ukraine,” Skripka explained.</p>\n<p>There are also fears that the number of deportees will soar in the coming months as there are hundreds of Ukrainians who are still waiting in Russian deportation camps.</p>\n<p>“According to our calculations, there are about 800 people. And if they are all brought to Georgia, it will be a disaster,” Skripka warned.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in March, an edict issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin demands that Ukrainians living in the territories claimed by Moscow must either <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/06/19/a-false-semblance-of-choice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leave or accept</a> Russian citizenship by September 10. This could potentially lead to mass deportations.</p>\n<p>Lopata, meanwhile, can’t wait to leave, although not necessarily home.</p>\n<p>“My house in Ukraine has been bombed. My parents have been killed, and I don’t know where to go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I just really want to get out of here any way I can.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

No response had been received by the time of publication.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the war is a coalition of armed groups that have, de facto, divided Sudan in half after more than two years of civil war.</p>\n<p>The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, which is battling the army, has formed an alliance with smaller armed factions and declared its intention to form a parallel government that will ostensibly represent all of Sudan.</p>\n<p>The RSF-backed coalition has already unveiled its leadership council, on which the leaders of armed groups feature in prominent positions.</p>\n<p>Analysts told Al Jazeera that SAF and the RSF are trying to meet the demands of powerful militias in a bid to keep their respective battlefield alliances intact.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3>A future parallel government</h3>\n<p>In February, the RSF announced that it had formed an alliance with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), an armed group from the Nuba Mountains led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the war, it had remained neutral, shocking observers when it allied with the RSF to form a new alliance and parallel government, which they named Tasis (foundation).</p>\n<p>The SPLM-N governs large swaths of South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, and has been at war with the army – as well as the RSF, which used to be the army’s ally before they turned their guns on each other – for 40 years.</p>\n<p>SPLM-N was born out of the SPLM, which emerged in the early 1980s to fight for southern independence and to end its marginalisation by the elites of northern and central Sudan.</p>\n<p>The Nuba – a group of about 50 communities from what was then central Sudan – was part of the SPLM.</p>\n<p>But when South Sudan seceded in 2011, Nuba fighters rebranded as SPLM-N and continued their rebellion against Khartoum, fighting and defeating the RSF, which was deployed to fight them by former President Omar al-Bashir in 2016.</p>\n<p>Nearly a decade later, on July 2, Tasis announced a 31-member senior leadership council, with Hemedti as its head and SPLM-N’s al-Hilu as deputy.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1366637\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1366637\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1366637\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-28T133327Z_956261064_RC2DKM9TIHC6_RTRMADP_3_SUDAN-POLITICS.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C482&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Abdelaziz al-Hilu\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1366637\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SPLM-N’s Abdelaziz al-Hilu speaks in Juba, South Sudan, March 28, 2021 [Jok Solomun/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the full list of the 31-member council is not yet public, it also includes Tahir al-Hajar, the head of the Darfur-based Sudan Liberation Gathering Forces (SLGF), according to an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10KaiM4VHa0&amp;t=540s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a> he gave Al Jazeera Mubasher.</p>\n<p>Tasis will soon roll out a government to help the RSF and its allies in their fight against the army, Kholood Khair, Sudan expert and founder of Confluence Advisory think tank, believes.</p>\n<p>The RSF wants to exploit the guise of a formal government to better profit from aid groups, buy sophisticated weapons such as fighter jets that can only be sold to states, and boost its stance in any future negotiations with the army, she explained.</p>\n<p>“They do not want to go into any kind of mediation as a rebel group. They want to be seen as a government [to boost their legitimacy],” Khair said.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera asked Tasis spokesman, Alaa Nugud, to respond to accusations that the alliance was simply formed to garner international legitimacy for armed groups on the ground.</p>\n<p>While he did not respond before publication, Tasis portrays itself as the cornerstone of a “New Sudan” seeking to protect historically neglected and persecuted communities, even as the RSF stands accused of committing ethnic killings and genocide against sedentary communities known as “non-Arabs” in Darfur.</p>\n<p>However, “this is just a group formed out of war dynamics despite their entire narrative of it being a coalition of the marginalised,” said Hamid Khalafallah, an expert on Sudan and PhD candidate at the University of Manchester.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3>‘Poster children’</h3>\n<p>On the Port Sudan government’s side, Gebreil Ibrahim and Mini Arko Minawi lead the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Army – Mini Minawi (SLA-MM), respectively.</p>\n<p>The two armed groups mainly comprised sedentary farming “non-Arab” communities from the vast western region of Darfur who came together to fight a rebellion against the central government in 2003.</p>\n<p>Their stated aim was to end the persecution and neglect of their communities, but like most of Sudan’s armed groups, they ended up using their weapons to negotiate access to state coffers and prominent posts in government instead.</p>\n<p>“What this whole war has shown is if you pick up a gun, then you can get power,” Khair said.</p>\n<p>“The RSF are really the poster children for this model,” she added.</p>\n<p>The RSF in its current form was born during the Darfur war, which started in 2003, when al-Bashir tapped Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo and his feared “Arab” Popular Defence Forces (Janjaweed) militia to crush the rebellion there.</p>\n<p>Al-Bashir rewarded Hemedti, who took part in countless atrocities against “non-Arabs”, by repackaging the Janjaweed into the RSF in 2013, with Hemedti at its head and a place with the army.</p>\n<p>As part of the state, Hemedti was able to consolidate control over lucrative gold mines, expand recruitment and lease out fighters to partake in regional wars for tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3838234\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3838234\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24162280843036-1752557353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sudanese soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces unit.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soldiers from the RSF in the East Nile province on June 22, 2019 [Hussein Malla/AP]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When al-Bashir was deposed by a popular uprising in April 2019, a wealthy, powerful Hemedti became al-Burhan’s deputy in the Transitional Military Council.</p>\n<h3>A militia state with a war economy?</h3>\n<p>Tasis, as well as the army-backed government in Port Sudan, are beholden to armed actors, which means more local commanders could expand recruitment and acquire weapons, hoping to get strong enough to gain political power, analysts warn.</p>\n<p>Mohamed “al-Jakomi” Seid Ahmed, an army-aligned commander from northern Sudan, made a statement a few weeks ago that hinted at his aspirations, Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker’s Baldo said.</p>\n<p>Al-Jakomi said that he would be training a whopping 50,000 men in Eritrea to protect Sudan’s Northern State from possible incursion by the RSF.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The Israelis certainly owe Bret Stephens a favour.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, The New York Times opinion columnist took to the pages of the United States newspaper of record to promote his latest deranged argument, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/opinion/no-israel-is-not-committing-genocide-in-gaza.html\">headlined</a>: “No, Israel Is Not Committing Genocide in Gaza”.</p>\n<p>Never mind that numerous global institutions, ranging from various United Nations bodies to Amnesty International, have determined that Israel is committing just that. These are organisations that hardly throw the G-word around lightly, but Stephens knows better. And he will tell us why.</p>\n<p>In the very first paragraph of his Times intervention – which should perhaps come accompanied by a trigger warning for readers prone to aneurysms – Stephens demands defiantly: “If the Israeli government’s intentions and actions are truly genocidal – if it is so malevolent that it is committed to the annihilation of Gazans – why hasn’t it been more methodical and vastly more deadly?”</p>\n<p>It would seem, of course, that the Israeli military’s near-comprehensive conversion of much of the Gaza Strip into rubble – via the bombardment of homes, hospitals, schools, and everything else that can be bombed – would be rather “methodical”. As for the perceived insufficient deadliness of Israel’s ongoing “actions”, Stephens cites the official Palestinian death count of “nearly 60,000” in less than two years, and wonders why there are “not, say, hundreds of thousands of deaths”.</p>\n<p>He goes on to proclaim that “the first question the anti-Israel genocide chorus needs to answer is: Why isn’t the death count higher?”</p>\n<p>Among the many questions that Stephens himself needs to answer, meanwhile, is why he thinks slaughtering 60,000 people is no big deal. As of November 2024, Israel had killed <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2024/11/21/an-a-to-z-of-the-children-killed-by-israel-in-gaza\">at least 17,400 children</a> in Gaza – but even this is apparently not “malevolent” enough. Furthermore, according to a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says\">study</a> published in the Lancet medical journal more than one year ago, the true death toll in Gaza was already potentially set to exceed 186,000. How’s that for “hundreds of thousands”?</p>\n<p>In lieu of waiting for an answer from the “anti-Israel genocide chorus”, Stephens presents his own, which is that “Israel is manifestly not committing genocide.” Citing the UN genocide convention’s definition of the term as the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”, Stephens proceeds to announce that “I am aware of no evidence of an Israeli plan to deliberately target and kill Gazan civilians.”</p>\n<p>Objectively speaking, this is the equivalent in terms of ludicrousness of claiming that there is no evidence of a plan by the operators of a chicken slaughterhouse to deliberately end the lives of the poultry therein. You don’t kill 17,400 children in 13 months by accident; nor do you repeatedly bomb hospitals and ambulances if you aren’t, you know, deliberately aiming to kill civilians.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about bombs. <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/7/22/is-israel-implementing-a-strategy-of-genocide-by-starvation-in-gaza\">Forced starvation</a> is genocide, too. And on that note, another question Stephens might answer is how intentionally depriving a population of two million people of the food and water that is necessary for human survival does not constitute an “intent to destroy” that group. Yesterday alone, Gaza health officials <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/at-least-15-starve-to-death-in-24-hours-in-gaza-as-israel-continues-attacks\">reported</a> that at least 15 Palestinians had starved to death, including four children.</p>\n<p>Since the end of May, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">more than 1,000 Palestinians</a> have also been killed while trying to procure food from the so-called <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/2/in-gaza-aid-kills\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF). This diabolical outfit, backed by Israel and the US, not only concentrates large numbers of starving Palestinians in a single location for easier mowing down by the Israeli army, but also furthers Israel’s US-backed vision of forcibly expelling the surviving Palestinian population.</p>\n<p>While Stephens does deign to mention the “chaotic food distribution system” in Gaza, he insists that “bungled humanitarian schemes or trigger-happy soldiers or strikes that hit the wrong target or [Israeli] politicians reaching for vengeful sound bites do not come close to adding up to a genocide.”</p>\n<p>And yet in his war on the use of the G-word in the Gaza context, Stephens refuses to acknowledge that Israel itself has been a genocidal endeavour from the get-go. Zionists were well aware of the need to dispense with the majority of the Indigenous population of Palestine even before the formal creation of the state of Israel on Palestinian land in 1948, a process that entailed mass killing and the destruction of hundreds of villages. Some three-quarters of a million people were made refugees.</p>\n<p>Since then, Israel has continued on what is fundamentally genocidal footing, working to disappear the Palestinians both physically and conceptually – as exemplified in the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir’s famous <a href=\"/features/2019/3/18/the-mixed-legacy-of-golda-meir-israels-first-female-pm\">assertion</a> that the Palestinians “did not exist”. Indeed, Israel’s existence as a Jewish settler-colonial state is predicated on the very “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”.</p>\n<p>Anyway, forget history and reality. Stephens warns us that, if the word genocide “is to retain its status as a uniquely horrific crime, then the term can’t be promiscuously applied to any military situation we don’t like”.</p>\n<p>Speaking of promiscuity, the Israeli military has long been in bed with <a href=\"/opinions/2024/2/17/thomas-friedman-dehumanisation-par-excellence-amid-a-genocide\">The New York Times</a> and a host of other US corporate media outlets, which do their best to sanitise Israeli atrocities as self-defence. But as Israel now continues to carry out a uniquely horrific crime in Gaza with the firm backing of the global superpower, Stephens’s genocidal journalism is also uniquely horrific.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Seijiro Takeshita, dean at the University of Shizuoka’s Graduate School of Management, Informatics and Innovation, told Al Jazeera that people should look beyond the numbers in assessing whether the trade deal is good for Japan.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s election, voters frustrated with price increases exceeding the pace of wage hikes, especially younger people who have long felt ignored by the government’s focus on senior voters, rapidly turned to emerging conservative and right-wing populist parties, like the Democratic Party for the People and the “Japanese First” Sanseito far-right group which surged in Sunday’s vote.</p>\n<p>Ishiba’s potential departure less than a year after taking office would trigger a succession battle within the ruling LDP as it contends with these challenges from new political parties, particularly on the right, that are chipping away at its support.</p>\n<p>Resentment has also lingered over an LDP funding scandal.</p>\n<p>“I really hope things will get better in Japan, but the population is declining, and I think living in Japan will get tougher and tougher,” Naomi Omura, an 80-year-old from Hiroshima, told the AFP news agency.</p>\n<p>“It is disappointing that Japan cannot act more strongly” towards the US, but “I think it was good that they agreed on a lower tariff”, she said.</p>\n<p>None of the opposition parties has shown interest in forming a full-fledged alliance with the governing coalition, but they have said they are open to cooperating on policy.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Four years later, he named his company after that dream.</p>\n<p>“When I first came to Tanzania at 28, no one imagined why I would head south,” Ginah, who is lightheartedly called the “Mayor of Egyptians in Dar-es-Salaam”, told Al Jazeera, saying that in the minds of many of his friends and family back home, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are tainted by stereotypes of famine, poverty and disease.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p>But when Ginah arrived, what he found were opportunities – and a chance to build something new.</p>\n<p>“In 2021, I established my company, Dream [Trading],” he said, in recognition of his “dream” to be a success. He set it up with savings of $3,000, tapping into a growing market importing and exporting aluminium household goods. As the years progressed, he expanded into the steel business.</p>\n<p>But beyond work, the 36-year-old is also somewhat of a benevolent godfather figure for other North African migrants making the journey southward.</p>\n<p>Ginah has a standard daily routine. Every morning, his driver, Hamed, drops him off at the household goods warehouses attached to Dream Trading. A while later, he drives him to City Mall, the most popular shopping centre in Dar es Salam’s Kariakoo neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Ginah is a regular at the Somali cafe there, where he sits until about noon, meeting other Egyptians and Tanzanians, often over a breakfast of mandazi – deep-fried dough fritters dusted with powdered sugar – or a chipsi mayai, a popular street food omelette with French fries, tomato sauce and vegetables.</p>\n<p>Typically, Egyptians who move to Tanzania already have a relative or friend living there. For those who don’t, Ginah helps them find a place to stay, sometimes offering them a job at Dream and helping cover their rent if they’re an employee. He also introduces them to the work system in Tanzania, and gives them a lay of the land about cities where they can potentially work.</p>\n<p>“However, the most important thing I provide,” said Ginah, “is a trusted, guaranteed translator.” In urban centres in Tanzania, people speak English. But many village residents only speak Swahili. This could lead to misunderstandings and expose newcomers to “fraud or scams”, Ginah said, so he lends a helping hand.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851757\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851757\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-4-1753249837-e1753252133318.jpeg?w=590&amp;resize=590%2C838&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egyptians in Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ahmed Ginah, right, and two Egyptians recently arrived in Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But Ginah is determined to help only those who want to help themselves.</p>\n<p>“I help those who come to work, not those who lie on their laurels and delegate the work to the translator or others,” he said. “In such cases, I advise the person that this country has a lot to offer, but it doesn’t give to the lazy or dependent.”</p>\n<p>Ginah has gained a lot in eight years. Today, his company distributes products throughout Africa, and he has helped dozens of young men from his home village relocate and establish themselves in Tanzania, where an estimated 70,000 Arabs live – including 1,200 Egyptians, according to figures provided by Egypt’s ambassador to the country, Sherif Ismail, in 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-south-migration\">South-south migration</h2>\n<p>While Europe fortifies its borders against North African migrants, ambitious young Egyptians in a struggling economy are looking for alternatives to emigrating to the West, according to Ayman Zohry, a demographer and expert on migration studies at the American University in Cairo.</p>\n<p>This south-bound migration has accelerated significantly in recent years.</p>\n<p>Official statistics show the number of Egyptians in non-Arab African countries increased from 46,000 in 2017 to 54,000 by 2021.</p>\n<p>This trend stands in stark contrast to the perilous journeys many Egyptians still make across the Mediterranean. In 2023, Egyptians represented more than 7 percent of all arrivals in Italy along the Central Mediterranean route, making them the fifth most common nationality, according to a report by the Mixed Migration Centre.</p>\n<p>The European Union recently responded with a new 7.4 billion euro ($8.7bn) agreement with Egypt, partly aimed at boosting border controls to reduce irregular migration to Europe.</p>\n<p>Zohry explained that Egypt’s youth migration trends are undergoing a notable transformation.</p>\n<p>“While traditional destinations were the Gulf and Europe, there is a new trend towards the south, specifically some African countries,” Zohry told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“Economic migration” sees young people seeking investment opportunities in emerging and promising markets. “This trend has grown in tandem with the expansion of the Egyptian government’s diplomatic and commercial relations with several African countries.”</p>\n<p>However, Zohry said, migration to Africa is often circular or temporary. “This means that the migrant returns to Egypt after a short period, or moves between several countries according to available opportunities.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851894\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851894\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2013-07-12T000000Z_813075216_GM1E97D004201_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-ECONOMY-1753254714.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C476&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania [File: Andrew Emmanuel/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The back-and-forth flow is evident every Friday night in Dar-es-Salaam, as an aeroplane takes off from Julius Nyerere airport, heading to Cairo.</p>\n<p>During high seasons like Eid al-Adha or Eid al-Fitr, whole families fill the departure gates, as Egyptians take their earnings home to visit family, contribute to building a new home, prepare a family member for marriage, or help their parents fulfil a dream of performing the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-to-egyptian-skills\">‘Open to Egyptian skills’</h2>\n<p>Across the African continent, diaspora communities of Arabs and North Africans are growing.</p>\n<p>South Africa accounts for the highest percentage of Egyptian residents in Africa, accounting for 85 percent, followed by Nigeria, Kenya and Senegal.</p>\n<p>Ginah recounts a story from the late 1990s which has since become an urban legend among youth seeking greener pastures in Africa.</p>\n<p>“A young man went to South Africa on vacation to visit a friend. Bizarrely, he was arrested in Cape Town for a visa irregularity,” said Ginah. “When he was released, he was broke. All he had were some aluminium utensils, so he sold them to make enough money to buy a ticket home.”</p>\n<p>That’s when the word got out, he says, and people discovered the huge demand for Egyptian aluminium household goods. Young people realised they could make money – and that’s how the home appliance and home goods trade between Egypt and other African countries picked up. Since then, Egyptian business interests across the continent have diversified to include manufacturing, agricultural processing, and mining.</p>\n<p>Although North Africans have long travelled south, the trend surged following the 2011 mass uprisings in Egypt and the ensuing political, economic and social change, Ginah says.</p>\n<p>“There was a new wave of emigration within Africa – both [to] South Africa and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa – as the Gulf and Libya were greatly affected by the political turmoil.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851767\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851767\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2017-08-14T000000Z_1779850285_RC1BF3CDACC0_RTRMADP_3_TANZANIA-EGYPT-1753250634.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Egypt Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851767\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi walks past a guard of honour at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar-es-Salaam [File: Emmanuel Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Locally, migrants have also found a more friendly working environment, many say.</p>\n<p>The government of Tanzania has made strides to support entrepreneurship and foreign investment. According to Lloyds Bank country profile, foreign investors can benefit from many fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.</p>\n<p>“Tanzania has natural resources and significant investment opportunities,” said Makame Iddi Makame, the commissioner general and chief of staff at the Tanzanian embassy in Cairo.</p>\n<p>He said the country established the Tanzania Investment Centre to manage investment affairs. This includes reducing customs duties to 5 percent in priority sectors and 0 percent in leading sectors; providing tax exemption on mining, agricultural, and industrial inputs; facilitating the issuance of residence, work and business permits, and the repatriation of capital gains abroad; and deferring taxes and VAT for loss-making projects for up to five years.</p>\n<p>The country’s political stability also provides a high degree of investment security, as there is low inflation (4.2 percent) and stable exchange rates, he added.</p>\n<p>“Given the limited opportunities within Egypt, some African countries may appear less competitive but are more open to Egyptian skills in sectors like construction, agriculture, education, and information technology,” according to migration expert Zohry.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the potential opportunities and generally more welcoming atmosphere, migration to African countries is still limited, compared with the Gulf and Europe, he added, due to a stigmatised mental image many North Africans have about the rest of the continent.</p>\n<p>However, there are signs the continent may become a gradual alternative for some youth seeking opportunities beyond traditional borders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-opportunities-shared-friendships\">Business opportunities, shared friendships</h2>\n<p>Some 550km (340 miles) southeast of Dar-es-Salaam is Mayan village.</p>\n<p>There, Mohamed el-Shafie, 34, another Egyptian, built two cashew-processing factories in the Mtwara region in 2018, tapping into a strategic crop that accounts for 10-15 percent of Tanzania’s foreign exchange earnings.</p>\n<p>“Cashew sales are built purely on trust,” el-Shafei told Al Jazeera. “The cashew growing and harvesting operation is meticulous and requires sensitive handling by farm workers to produce a pure cashew nut. This is followed by the ‘processing’ stage to prepare it for export in good condition.”</p>\n<p>Tanzania is one of Africa’s leading producers and exporters of cashew nuts, ranking among the top three on the continent and eighth globally.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3851751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3851751\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Photo-3-1753249819.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tanzania\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3851751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers at Mohamad El-Shafei’s cashew processing factory, Mayan Village, Mtwara region, Tanzania [Egab]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>El-Shafei’s company has customers across the Arab world and Turkiye, and employs some 400 Egyptian, Chinese and Tanzanian workers, besides the seasonal labourers hired during the cashew harvest season in October.</p>\n<p>His foray into the cashew industry was accidental, said el-Shafei, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Cairo University, before moving to Beijing to continue his education.</p>\n<p>“At the time, I had a lot of Vietnamese friends who worked in the cashew industry. That was when I learned that Tanzania had a promising business opportunity and that Chinese equipment specialised in cashew crop processing was a gap that I could fill,” he said.</p>\n<p>With a little help from his friends, he connected with cashew farmers in Tanzania in late 2017, and with a small capital investment of  200,000 Egyptian pounds (about $11,000 back then), el-Shafei set up shop and imported two cashew processing machines from China to start the business. In 2023-2024, Elshafei Investment Limited had made 13 export shipments with a total value of approximately $719,700.</p>\n<p>El-Shafei decided to relocate his small family to Dar-es-Salaam so his young children would not be far from him. Today, they all live amid the Arab and Egyptian community, as well as Tanzanians of Yemeni, Omani, and Iranian origin who moved there during the Arab rule before the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution.</p>\n<p>Egyptians in Tanzania are not isolated from the local population, el-Shafei says.</p>\n<p>“We share celebrations and holidays such as the July 7 Saba Saba Day, which marks the founding of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954, a significant step towards independence and nation-building. We also celebrate Swahili Language Day and Eid al-Adha through communal meals held in cashew farm villages,” he says.</p>\n<p>For Ginah, living in Dar-es-Salaam with his wife and children, Egyptians are part of the fabric of their new community.</p>\n<p>“We maintain good relationships with Tanzanians, and we share friendships,” he said, including meeting at work, mosques and social clubs.</p>\n<p>But amid the successes, there are also difficult moments in living far from home, he said.</p>\n<p>“The pain of alienation hits hardest when someone dies. We [Egyptian immigrants] know each other well, whether in East or West African countries, so it’s very difficult. We immediately band together to make arrangements for the body to be repatriated, and we support the family financially and emotionally, whether they remain in Tanzania or return home to Egypt.”</p>\n<p>But when there is family by your side, “the feeling of alienation disappears,” Ginah said. And thanks to technology, “we can see family and friends on a daily basis on mobile phone calls.”</p>\n<p>Ginah feels Tanzania is the country where he was destined to make his living.</p>\n<p>“It has certainly become a second home for me, where my children are growing up,” he said. “When will I return to my homeland, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Egab</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

However, they now find themselves fighting for their own survival.</p>\n<p>On July 19, Al Jazeera journalists began posting heart-wrenching messages on social media, signalling that their capacity to continue was waning.</p>\n<p>One powerful post by Anas al-Shariff, Al Jazeera Arabic channel correspondent in Gaza, stated, “I haven’t stopped covering for a moment in 21 months, and today, I say it outright … And with indescribable pain. I am drowning in hunger, trembling in exhaustion, and resisting the fainting that follows me every moment … Gaza is dying.

If we fail to act now, we risk a future where there may be no one left to tell our stories. Our inaction will be recorded in history as a monumental failure to protect our fellow journalists and a betrayal of the principles that every journalist strives to uphold,” he added.</p>\n<p>Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed five Al Jazeera journalists – Samer Abudaqa, Hamza Dahdouh, Ismail al-Ghoul, Ahmed al-Louh, and Hossam Shabat – and many of the family members of Al Jazeera and other journalists.
