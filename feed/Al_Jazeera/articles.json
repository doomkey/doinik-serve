Washington has not provided any proof for its claims. Cartel de los Soles is actually a term Venezuelans use to refer to officials engaged in corruption, ands is not an organised cartel.</p><p>Several airlines have cancelled flights to Venezuela following a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration about a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace.</p><p>The advisory came after months of military buildup in the Caribbean Sea as part of what the US said were efforts to counter narcotics. Meanwhile, the top US military officer, Dan Caine, has been visiting the Caribbean region.</p><p>Last month, US President Donald Trump said he had authorised the CIA spy agency to carry out secret operations in Venezuela, bringing into the spotlight the history of US intervention in Latin America.</p><p>A strike on Venezuelan territory would constitute a major escalation of the months-long US operation in the region, which has seen more than 80 people killed in a series of strikes on boats accused of trafficking drugs.</p><p>President Maduro has denounced the US actions. On Monday, the Venezuelan government dubbed the “terror” designation of the alleged drug cartel as a “ridiculous lie” aimed at justifying “an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>Since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he has escalated attacks on Venezuela, reversing his predecessor Joe Biden’s policy of engaging with Maduro.</p><p>But the roots of distrust and tension between Washington and Caracas go back a quarter of a century, following leftist former President Hugo Chavez’s ascension to power in 1999. Maduro took over as president following Chavez’s death in 2013.</p><p>Here is a timeline of the deteriorating relations between Venezuela and the US since Trump started his second term in January 2025 – and how Washington’s approach towards the South American nation since the late 1990s has led to this moment.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>January 10, 2025</strong> – Maduro is <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-sworn-in-for-third-term-after-disputed-election\">sworn</a> in for a third term after disputed elections. The US rejects the outcome, reiterating allegations of election fraud.</li>\n<li><strong>January, 2025</strong> – Trump returns to power in the US, and revokes the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/21/us-supreme-court-clears-way-to-end-tps-for-venezuelans-what-it-means\">temporary protected status (TPS) </a>that had shielded about 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States from deportation.</li>\n<li><strong>February 20, 2025: </strong>The Trump administration designates Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as a “foreign terrorist organisation”. Trump would go on to claim that Tren de Aragua is a front for Maduro, even though US intelligence agencies have themselves said that they have no evidence of any link between the group and the Venezuelan leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>February 21, 2025</strong> – Venezuela agrees on coordinating with Washington over Trump’s mass deportation push; <a href=\"/news/2025/2/21/us-deports-dozens-of-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-bay\">the first batch of migrants reach Venezuela</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>February 26, 2025</strong> – Trump nixes Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/2/26/trump-nixes-venezuelan-oil-concessions-granted-by-predecessor-joe-biden\">oil concessions</a> granted by predecessor Joe Biden.</li>\n<li><strong>March 24, 2025</strong> – Trump imposes <a href=\"/news/2025/3/24/trump-to-impose-25-percent-tariffs-on-countries-that-buy-oil-from-venezuela\">25-percent tariffs </a>on countries that buy oil from Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>August 8, 2025</strong> – <a href=\"/news/2025/8/8/us-doubles-reward-for-arrest-of-venezuelas-president-maduro-to-50m\">US doubles reward for arrest</a> of Venezuela’s President Maduro to $50m, ​​ designating him the “global terrorist leader” of the Cartel de los Soles.</li>\n<li><strong>September-November 2025</strong> – Washington launches a maritime “anti-narcotics” campaign in the Caribbean and Pacific on September 2. At least 21 attacks on alleged “drug boats” have killed more than 83 people.</li>\n<li><strong>October 15, 2025</strong> -Trump confirmed that he has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela\">authorised</a> the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>October 28, 2025</strong> – Venezuela suspends a gas accord with <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/venezuela-suspends-trinidad-and-tobago-gas-accord-over-us-warship-visit\">Trinidad and Tobago</a> over a visit by a US warship.</li>\n<li><strong>November 12, 2025</strong> –  Venezuela launches<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/12/venezuela-launches-nationwide-military-drills-amid-us-troop-build-up\"> nationwide military drills</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14, 2025</strong> – US announces <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america\">“Southern Spear” mission</a> as forces deploy near South America.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14-16, 2025</strong> – US deploys the world’s largest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, warships, thousands of troops, and F-35 stealth jets to the Caribbean.</li>\n<li><strong>November 22, 2025</strong> – The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/airlines-cancel-flights-to-venezuela-amid-us-military-buildup\">US Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) issues a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) warning airlines of hazards in Venezuelan airspace due to “heightened military activity”, including GPS interference.

US companies invested in the oil sector in the early 20th century, and, by the 1920s, the US became the biggest market for Venezuela’s oil exports.</p><p>But Chavez’s nationalisation of the oil industry and vocal stance against US imperial interests in Latin America soured the ties. In 2007, Chavez pushed out US oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, as part of his efforts to make the state oil company gain a majority stake in all new oil projects. Chevron, another US oil major, however, continues to operate.</p><h2 id=\"here-s-a-snapshot-of-venezuela-us-ties-over-the-past-25-years\">Here’s a snapshot of Venezuela-US ties over the past 25 years:</h2><h2 id=\"1999-chavez-takes-office\">1999 – Chavez takes office</h2><p>Campaigning on an anti-establishment, anti-US platform, <a href=\"/features/2013/3/6/timeline-venezuela-during-the-chavez-era\">Hugo Chavez</a> is elected president and launches the so-called Bolivarian Revolution. His early moves to rewrite the constitution and later to nationalise the oil sector set Venezuela and the US on a collision course.</p><h2 id=\"2000s-escalation-and-hostility\">2000s – Escalation and hostility</h2><p>US-Venezuela ties deteriorate as Chavez strengthens ties with Russia, China and Iran.</p><p>Venezuela expels US-backed NGOs and diplomats, and accuses Washington of destabilisation efforts. The US criticises Venezuela over authoritarianism and restrictions on the media.</p><p>Domestically, Chavez’s government expands social programmes, funded by high oil prices, but economic mismanagement and corruption begin to undermine growth.</p><h2 id=\"2002-the-coup-attempt\">2002 – The coup attempt</h2><p>A <a href=\"/video/the-big-picture/2018/2/8/hugo-chavez-and-the-coup-that-never-happened\">short-lived coup</a> removes Chavez for 48 hours. Venezuela accuses the US of supporting the plot – a charge Washington denies. This event lays the foundation for two decades of distrust.</p><h2 id=\"2013-maduro-s-rise\">2013 – Maduro’s rise</h2><p>Following the death of Hugo Chavez, Maduro — his long-time deputy — narrowly wins the presidency in elections. His tenure is immediately marked by economic decline, corruption scandals and worsening relations with the US.</p><h2 id=\"2014-2015-first-major-us-sanctions\">2014 – 2015 – First major US sanctions</h2><p>Amid growing protests and allegations of human rights abuses, the US imposes visa restrictions and sanctions on Venezuelan officials.</p><p>This is a turning point: Sanctions exacerbate the economic crisis, and Venezuela begins to experience severe shortages of food and medicine. Inflation skyrockets, and migration out of the country surges.</p><h2 id=\"2017-2019-economic-crisis\">2017-2019 – Economic crisis</h2><p>​​The US blocks Venezuela’s access to its financial markets and bans the purchase of Venezuelan debt. Sanctions on oil imports intensify as Venezuela’s economy collapses under hyperinflation and years of mismanagement. In 2019, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi\">inflation</a> peaks at 345 percent. In April 2025, it stands at 172 percent.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925526\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-US-oil-imports-from-Venezuela-1756989572.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - US oil imports from Venezuela-1756989572\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"2018-maduro-s-disputed-re-election\">2018 – Maduro’s disputed re-election</h2><p>Maduro’s controversial 2018 <a href=\"/news/2019/1/11/venezuela-maduro-begins-second-term-amid-increasing-isolation\">re-election</a> leads to a political crisis. Key opposition candidates were barred from running, prompting a boycott of the elections by most of the opposition.</p><p>Opposition figure Juan Guaido declares himself interim president, winning recognition from the US and dozens of allies. Washington expands sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s oil, gold, mining and banking sectors.</p><h2 id=\"2024-a-rerun-of-2018\">2024 — A rerun of 2018</h2><p>Six years later, Maduro again won a disputed election, against independent opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. The opposition showed vote tallies from several booths that appeared to suggest a comfortable win for Gonzales, disputing the result announced by election authorities in Maduro’s favour. The United Nations criticised the conduct of the election.</p><p>The then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Gonzalez had won. Several leftist Latin American governments, including, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia also questioned the official results and called for a recount.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The next hearings are scheduled for Thursday and December 2.</p><p>If Ammori succeeds, the ban could potentially be lifted, bringing an end to a months-long campaign of civil disobedience that has resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for showing support for the organisation since it was outlawed in July, mostly for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>Being a member of or showing support for the direct action group is currently a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned the group after two of its members broke into the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">RAF Brize Norton military base</a> in Oxfordshire in June and sprayed red paint on Voyager planes that activists said were used in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In a separate incident in August 2024, members of the group broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm <a href=\"/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab\">Elbit Systems</a> in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians. A total of 24 activists linked to the group remain under arrest.</p><p>Ammori told Al Jazeera that the ban against Palestine Action is “absurd and authoritarian”.</p><p>“Proscribing Palestine Action wasn’t done to protect the public, it was done to crush dissent and defend the Israeli weapons industry,” she said.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for the courts to right the wrongs that the government has done, and reinstate a bit of sanity. If we are not successful, we will continue to fight the ban, and I am sure that ultimately, we will win.”</p><h2 id=\"political-battle\">Political battle</h2><p>Defend Our Juries, a campaign group coordinating protests across the United Kingdom during which sign-wielding demonstrators are routinely arrested, argued the ban is “political”.</p><p>“The reason there are protest groups is because our government isn’t listening to what the continuous protests are about,” Lex Korte, the group’s legal coordinator and cofounder, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent months, thousands of protesters at mass rallies, experts of international law and human rights groups have called on the UK to end its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/corbyn-led-tribunal-accuses-uk-of-complicity-in-gaza-genocide\">alleged complicity</a> in Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. The UK provides vital components of F-35 jets and operates Shadow R1 surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The ban on Palestine Action marked the first time in British history that a direct action group has been branded as a terrorist organisation. It is also the first time that a proscribed group has been granted a judicial review.</p><p>Korte said the term “terrorism” has always had a strong political connotation.</p><p>“The UK definition of terrorism, particularly in the Terrorism Act 2000, has been criticised as being way too vague and [of including] acts that aren’t acts of terrorism, namely the inclusion of criminal damage that doesn’t require any acts of violence towards humans,” he said.</p><p>“Inviting arrest with your behaviour and with that kind of method, we’re highlighting the unjust nature of the proscription of Palestine Action,” Korte said.</p><h2 id=\"direct-action-challenges-uk-complicity-in-gaza\">Direct action challenges UK complicity in Gaza</h2><p>London-based human rights advocacy organisation Cage International highlighted the “draconian use of terrorism legislation to shut down direct action” in a report issued on Tuesday.</p><p>“Direct action has been neither random nor gratuitous. It has been focused on the specific nodes that make war possible: manufacturers, insurers, logistics providers, financiers, universities, lobbyists, and government infrastructure,” it said.</p><p>“When ordinary channels fail to restrain state-sanctioned harm, principled disruption becomes not only legitimate but necessary.”</p><p>The report argues that the UK continues to support the war in Gaza with military, trade and diplomatic ties, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) having concluded in July 2024 that Israel’s prolonged presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, constitutes a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">breach of international law</a>.</p><p>The ICJ also found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/what-has-the-icj-ordered-israel-to-do-on-gaza-war-and-whats-next\">provisional measures</a> to mitigate the risk of such acts.</p><p>Cage found Palestine Action has spurred a wave of civil disobedience between 2020 and 2025, leading to a “significant shift in the landscape of activism in the UK”. This resulted in the shutdown of operations at sites connected to the production or facilitation of weapons used by Israeli forces, such as  Elbit’s site in Bristol that was the subject of dozens of protests by Palestine Action, including days before the group was proscribed.</p><p>“Over the last two years of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the UK has steadily expanded its authoritarian counter-terrorism powers to suppress dissent and insulate itself from public accountability,”  Anas Mustapha, Cage’s Head of Public Advocacy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the proscription of Palestine Action went beyond the bounds of what the public would tolerate. It backfired precisely because the greater community consciousness has shifted. People could see with their own eyes what is happening in Gaza, and they recognise those acting to stop British participation in such acts.”</p><p>Korte, of Defend Our Juries, said judges at London’s High Court would have to understand “the gravitas that [their] decision has, both to everyday people and their lives and to the international community and the people of Palestine”.</p><p>Israel has pummelled Gaza since October 2023, killing at least 69,733 Palestinians and wounding 170,863. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel and about 200 were taken captive.</p><p>Since a ceasefire came into effect last month, two years after the war began, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">has killed</a> more than 300 people in Gaza and violated the terms of the truce hundreds of times.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The administration’s maritime strikes on vessels it says were engaged in drug trafficking have killed at least 83 people on 21 boats.

Until this year, the FTO label was largely limited to groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) with political motives.</p><p>On Monday, Washington formally designated the Cartel de los Soles for allegedly shipping narcotics into the US. The administration says the network includes Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials, though it has provided no evidence. Venezuela denounced the move, calling it a “ridiculous” effort to sanction a “non-existent” group.</p><p>The designation follows earlier measures against eight Latin American criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. US officials claim the Cartel de los Soles has collaborated with Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang – itself designated an FTO – to move drugs northward.</p><p>Officials have rarely identified which groups they believe are behind the boats targeted by US strikes. Hegseth said last week the new designation would provide a “whole bunch of new options to the United States” in dealing with Maduro. Asked whether such options might include land strikes inside Venezuela, he said “nothing is off the table, but nothing’s automatically on the table.” Sanctions experts have noted that the FTO statute does not authorise military action.</p><h2 id=\"caracas-pushes-back\">Caracas pushes back</h2><p>Maduro’s government denies involvement in criminal operations and accuses Washington of seeking regime change to control Venezuela’s resources.</p><p>“They want Venezuela’s oil and gas reserves. For nothing, without paying. They want Venezuela’s gold. They want Venezuela’s diamonds, iron, bauxite. They want Venezuela’s natural resources,” said Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez on state television.</p><p>Foreign Minister Yvan Gil echoed that view, saying the US designation revives “an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organised crime, has described the cartel narrative as an “oversimplification”, saying it “is more accurately described as a system of corruption wherein military and political officials profit by working with drug traffickers”.</p><p>The US campaign has also drawn sharp domestic debate within the country. A Reuters poll suggested that only 29 percent of Americans support killing suspected traffickers without judicial oversight. A former senior Treasury official said FTO designations were never intended to justify military operations. “Never had it been suggested that by designating an entity as an FTO it would … meet the standard for military action,” the official said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.</p><p>At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.</p><p>The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.</p><p>These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.</p><p>Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.</p><p>He pointed to the <a href=\"/news/2021/4/13/elite-privilege-consumes-17-4bn-of-pakistans-economy-undp\">2021 UNDP report</a> and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”</p><p>“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p><p>It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).</p><p>The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.</p><p>The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.</p><p>Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.</p><p>“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"judiciary-and-rule-of-law\">Judiciary and rule of law</h2><p>The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.</p><p>The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.</p><p>Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.</p><p>The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.</p><p>While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.</p><p>The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.</p><h2 id=\"was-the-report-necessary\">Was the report necessary?</h2><p>The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.</p><p>Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.</p><p>Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.</p><p>He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.</p><p>“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.</p><p>Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.</p><p>“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120683\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120683\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP22154336836269-1763683560.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani rickshaw drivers chant slogans during a protest against the recent increasing in petrol prices, Friday, June 3, 2022.

The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.</p><p>Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.</p><p>“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.</p><p>Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.</p><p>“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.</p><p>For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.</p><p>He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.</p><p>“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.</p><p>For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.</p><p>“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”</p><p>“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it was not clear what the White House was referring to. The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.</p><p>“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.</p><p>Trump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.</p><p>A formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner. The decree also opens the door to blacklisting other Muslim Brotherhood branches.</p><p>The White House is also pushing to label the groups as “designated global terrorists”.</p><p>The designations would make it illegal to provide material support to the group.

The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”</p><p>But he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.</p><p>Recently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.</p><p>CAIR has sued <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation\">the governor’s office</a> in response.</p><p>Analysts say Trump’s order was aimed at pandering to domestic audiences, and the threat of a terrorism designation means very little to the Middle East.</p><p>“It’s very amateurish foreign policy, but it appeals to the right-wing zealots in the US and Israel,” said Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut.</p><p>He noted that the order comes as the US tries “desperately to make progress” on the ceasefire in Gaza, which “the Israelis largely ignore, and Hamas largely adheres to”.</p><p>The White House wants to “keep showing that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to fight terrorism and bring peace and a happy, good life for all. This is, of course, fantasy,” Khouri said from the US city of Boston.</p><p>“I don’t think many people take it seriously. It’s not aimed at the Middle East. It’s aimed at domestic television audiences in the US and donors who provide the Republican Party with support, and the Republican Party is haemorrhaging support now because of its various and ineffective policies,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US is set to assume the G20 presidency on December 1.</p><h2 id=\"debt-vulnerabilities\">Debt ‘vulnerabilities’</h2><p>The G20 – which consists of 19 advanced and emerging economies, the European Union and the African Union – represents 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and roughly two-thirds of the world’s population.</p><p>In October, G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs met in Washington and agreed to a consensus statement on debt.</p><p>“We recognise that a high level of debt is one of the obstacles to inclusive growth in many developing economies, which limits their ability to invest in infrastructure, disaster resilience, healthcare, education and other development needs,” the statement said.</p><p>It also pledged to “reaffirm our commitment to support efforts by low- and middle-income countries to address debt vulnerabilities in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner”.</p><p>The communique committed to improving the <a href=\"/opinions/2020/12/2/in-the-time-of-pandemic-debt-relief-efforts-need-to-go-further\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">much-criticised</a> Common Framework, a mechanism launched by the G20 five years ago to accelerate and simplify debt restructuring – when countries have to <a href=\"/news/2023/4/11/yellen-to-push-for-speedy-action-on-zambia-ghana-debt-relief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reprofile debts</a> they can no longer afford to repay.</p><p>Elsewhere, the statement advocated for greater transparency around debt reporting and more lending from regional development banks.</p><h2 id=\"record-high-debt-levels\">Record-high debt levels</h2><p>According to the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry association, total debt in developing countries rose to a record high of $109 trillion by mid-2025.</p><p>In recent years, COVID-19, climate shocks and rising food prices have forced many poor countries to rely on debt to stabilise their economies, crowding out other investments. For instance, the United Nations recently calculated that more than 40 percent of African governments spend more on servicing debt than they do on healthcare.</p><p>Africa also faces high borrowing costs. In 2023, bond yields – the interest on government debt – averaged 6.8 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 9.8 percent in Africa.</p><p>Meanwhile, Africa collectively needs $143bn every year in climate finance to meet its Paris Agreement goals. In 2022, it received approximately $44bn.</p><p>At the same time, countries on the continent spent almost $90bn servicing external debt in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-progress\">No progress</h2><p>Shortly before the release of the G20’s final communique, 165 charities condemned the group’s slow progress on debt sustainability and urged President Ramaphosa to implement reforms before transferring the G20 presidency over to the US in December.</p><p>“While this year’s G20 has been put forward as an ‘African G20’, there is no evidence that any progress has been made on the debt crisis facing Africa and many other countries worldwide during the South African presidency,” the group said in a letter.</p><p>The missive called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell its gold reserves and set up a debt relief fund for distressed governments. It also backed the creation of a ‘<a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/8/why-the-global-south-needs-a-borrowers-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">borrowers club</a>’ to facilitate cooperation among low-income countries.</p><p>The call for a unified debtor body reflects growing frustration with existing frameworks, notably the Paris Club, in which mostly Western governments, but not China, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies of debtor nations.</p><p>In May 2020, the G20 launched a multibillion-dollar repayment pause to help poor countries cope with the COVID‑19 crisis. Known as the <a href=\"/news/2020/10/12/world-bank-g20-may-agree-to-only-6-month-debt-relief-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debt Service Suspension Initiative</a>, the programme is continuing to provide relief to some participating countries.</p><p>The launch of the Common Framework, soon afterwards, was designed to coordinate debt relief among all creditors. At the time, the initiative was hailed as a breakthrough, bringing together the Paris Club, China and private creditors to help prevent a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries.</p><p>But coordinating equal treatment, including government lenders, commercial banks, and bondholders, has made the process slow and prone to setbacks.</p><p>To date, none of the countries that joined the Common Framework – Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, and Chad – have completed their debt restructuring deals.</p><p>And even then, the programme has relieved just 7 percent of the debt costs for the four participating nations, according to ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.</p><h2 id=\"outmanoeuvred\">‘Outmanoeuvred’</h2><p>In March, South Africa convened an expert panel – headed by a former finance minister and a former Kenyan central banker – to explore how to assist heavily indebted low-income countries, particularly in Africa.</p><p>In a report released earlier this month, the panel echoed many of the ideas put forward by the 165 charities that wrote to Ramaphosa in October, calling for measures like an IMF-backed special debt fund and the formation of a debtors’ club.</p><p>But the experts’ proposals “weren’t even acknowledged at the leaders’ summit”, Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, told Al Jazeera. He said that the G20 presidency “failed to address the scale of the global debt problem”.</p><p>“Ultimately,” Gallagher added, “South Africa was outmanoeuvred by larger, more economically important members of the G20 who saw little benefit to themselves in reforming the international financial architecture on debt.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"double-whammy-of-debt\">‘Double whammy’ of debt</h2><p>In the early 2000s, the IMF, World Bank and some Paris Club creditors cancelled more than $75bn of debt – roughly 40 percent of external obligations – under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.</p><p>Since then, however, many developing countries have slipped back into the red. After the 2008 financial crisis, private creditors poured money into low-income economies, steadily replacing the cheaper loans once offered by institutions like the World Bank.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, almost 40 percent of external public debt repayments from lower-income countries went to commercial lenders. Just one-third went to multilateral institutions, according to <a href=\"https://debtjustice.org.uk/press-release/debt-payments-to-private-lenders-three-times-higher-than-to-china?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Debt Justice</a>, a United Kingdom-based charity.</p><p>China has also emerged as the world’s largest single creditor, especially in the Global South, committing more than $472bn through its policy banks – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank – between 2008 and 2024.</p><p>“On top of debt becoming more expensive over the past 10 or 15 years, there is now a wider universe of lenders that developing countries have turned to,” says Iolanda Fresnillo, a policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad, a civil society organisation.</p><p>“It’s been a double whammy. Debt is now costlier and harder to resolve,” she said, noting the difficulty of coordinating creditors in a restructuring. Protracted debt crises slow growth by squeezing public investment.</p><p>Overcoming these hurdles is made harder when creditors pursue competing commercial interests. Fresnillo says an independent debt-restructuring body, designed to shorten negotiation times and limit economic costs, could help.</p><p>In September, the head of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan, said, “There is no permanent institution or system that is there all the time dealing with debt restructuring … maybe we can create new momentum.”</p><p>However, talk of an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism isn’t new. The IMF spearheaded a push for a neutral body – which would be akin to a US bankruptcy court – in the late 1990s.</p><p>The Fund’s proposed restructuring mechanism faced swift pushback. Major creditor countries, particularly the US, opposed ceding power to an international body that could override its legal system and weaken protections for US investors.</p><p>Still, “the need for this type of international solution is obvious”, says Fresnillo. “Having a basic set of rules, as opposed to an ad hoc negotiation for every new debt crisis, should be a bare minimum.”</p><p>She added that “adopting a global standard on <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taxing transnational corporations</a> could also guarantee a baseline of revenues for low-income countries. But with multilateral cooperation so weak right now, I wouldn’t hold my breath.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
