Eritrea separately called on China to take action at the UN Security Council, drawing parallels to the Taiwan issue.</p><p>The European Union issued a statement calling for respect for Somalia’s sovereignty but stopped short of condemning the move. It urged authorities in Mogadishu and Hargeisa to engage in dialogue.</p><p>Israel’s move to recognise Somaliland came during a more than two-year genocidal war in Gaza, in which more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p><p>Israel is currently being investigated by the International Court of Justice over allegations of genocide, and Netanyahu is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court on accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 after a civil war under military ruler Siad Barre.

It did not give details about when or where she died.</p><p data-start=\"781\" data-end=\"1034\">Bardot rose to international fame in 1956 with her role in And God Created Woman, a film that sought to project female sexuality on screen. She went on to appear in about 50 films, becoming one of the most recognisable faces of post-war French cinema.</p><p data-start=\"1036\" data-end=\"1341\">In the early 1970s, Bardot quit acting at the height of her fame, turning her attention to animal protection.

Over the years, French courts convicted Bardot multiple times for inciting racial hatred.</p><p data-start=\"1552\" data-end=\"1844\">In 2022, a court fined her 40,000 euros ($47,000) after she described people from Reunion, a French overseas territory, as “degenerates” who had “kept their savage genes”. It marked the sixth time authorities had sanctioned her for racist and hate speech. Muslims and immigrants were among her frequent targets.</p><p data-start=\"1846\" data-end=\"2129\">Born in Paris in 1934, Bardot grew up in a conservative Catholic household and trained as a ballet dancer at the Conservatoire de Paris. She began modelling as a teenager, appearing on the cover of Elle at 15, which led to early film roles and her marriage to director Roger Vadim.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">Despite later being hailed by some as a trailblazer for women in cinema, Bardot dismissed complaints about sexual harassment in the film industry.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">“Many actresses flirt with producers to get a role. Then when they tell the story afterwards, they say they have been harassed. … In actual fact, rather than benefit them, it only harms them,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">“I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a pretty little a**.

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-23T111019Z_1158108692_RC2MHHAJR471_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-POLITICS-STARMER-1766910917.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In February, the United Kingdom government appointed a working group to provide a definition of “anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia”, which should have completed its work by the end of August. In the summer, Conservative MP Nick Timothy and a phalanx of like-minded groups waged a campaign against any such definition, which they argued would stymie free speech for those who wish to criticise Islam.</p><p>Since then, the government has been cowed into silence and delay. Last week, the BBC published a report suggesting that the definition will not use the word Islamophobia at all, opting instead for “anti-Muslim hostility”.</p><p>This is a mistake; hatred of Islam lies at the very heart of racism towards Muslims. And while the British state fails to even name Islamophobia, Muslims face an unprecedented level of danger. The unwillingness of the British government to name and confront Islamophobia is a scandal, one that is barely noticed by mainstream media.</p><p>Before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, the number of reported attacks on Muslims in England and Wales was already high and stood at 3,432. In the year up to March 2024, it went up by 13 percent, and a further 19 percent by March 2025. These most recent figures exclude London, due to changes in crime recording by the Metropolitan Police, so the increase is probably higher.</p><p>According to the most recent data, without London, 24 percent of religious hate crimes targeted Jews, and 44 percent were committed against Muslims. In addition, Muslims are consistently more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2025/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2025\">victims of assault, stalking and harassment</a>.</p><p>It is somewhat miraculous that Islamophobic attacks in the UK over the last two years have not resulted in anyone being killed. Mob violence in the summer of 2024, which followed the murder of three girls in Southport by a non-Muslim attacker, was marked by the targeting of mosques from the start. This year, there have been multiple attacks on mosques, including arson. In December, police in Northern Ireland arrested several members of the so-called “Irish Defence Army” over a plot to attack a mosque and migrant housing in Galway, the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>In the face of the rise in hate crime, the UK government doggedly campaigns against anti-Semitism – as it should – but is not investing anywhere close to the same political capital in protecting Muslims. The state’s approach to defining both forms of racism make this unevenness very clear.</p><p>In December 2016, the UK adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism, which is highly controversial due to its conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. By contrast, the UK government has dragged its feet on adopting any definition of Islamophobia.</p><p>The draft definition that the BBC published on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrjzp42v4zo\">December 15</a>, which does not mention Islamophobia, is deeply inadequate, and indeed dangerous because it gives a blank cheque to those who want to attack Islam. This lack of protection was inevitable. In the working group’s terms of reference, the government insisted on “the unchanging right of British citizens … to criticise, express dislike of, or insult religions and/or the beliefs and practices of adherents”.</p><p>Imagine, for a moment, that the government specified that a definition of anti-Semitism should allow people to insult Judaism. Even a cursory historical understanding of anti-Semitism clearly shows that hostility to Jews and Judaism have been inseparable across millennia: From the medieval Blood Libel, which accused Jews of killing Christian children for ritual purposes, to today’s “replacement theory” that Jews are orchestrating the corruption of the so-called “white race”.</p><p>Similarly, Western persecution of Muslims has been intrinsically connected with, and driven by, opposition to Islam, from medieval times until the present. Whether during the Reformation of the 16th century in Europe or the colonialisation of North Africa and Asia in the 19th century, Western thinkers and political leaders commonly saw Islam as an inherently imperialist and violent religion, dedicated to world domination, either through holy war or conspiratorial methods.</p><p>In the 16th century, German theologian Martin Luther labelled both Jews and Muslims as “fanatics”, that is to say, religion-inspired violent revolutionaries. In the 18th century, the French scholar Alexandre Deleyre wrote that when “government is absolutely founded upon religion, as among the Muslims; then fanaticism directs itself chiefly outwards, and makes this people an enemy of humanity”.</p><p>The leaders of the French and British empires were obsessed with the notion that Islam bred an inherent potential for revolutionary violence, which had to be guarded against through surveillance, censorship, and a politics of “moderation”.</p><p>The persisting influence of this conception of Islam as a source of violent conspiracy is easily traced through the 20th and 21st centuries in the West, most obviously since the start of the “war on terror” in the early 2000s. These ideas cut across the political spectrum and sit at the centre of the UK’s migration panics since 2015, when war and the rise of ISIL (ISIS) prompted an exodus of refugees from the Middle East.</p><p>The hatred of Islam, based on centuries of Western thought about that religion as an existential threat to Christian civilisation, is the root of a panoply of Islamophobic ideas: That Muslims are all potential terrorists, oppressors of women, sex predators, and obsessive theocrats.</p><p>In this context, to claim that Islam is not a target of Muslim-hating vitriol actually facilitates racism. It gives carte blanche to those who attack Islam with a searing passion – a hostility that fuels to verbal and physical violence against Muslims. To celebrate such attacks as the expression of “free speech” is to glorify hatred.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Shortly before their scheduled 3:50pm departure on the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority’s (TAZARA) Mukuba Express train, an update crackled over the tannoy: the train would be leaving two hours late.</p><p>A collective groan rippled through the crowd, and under the soaring roof of the station, pigeons darted back and forth, disappearing into holes left from rotted-out ceiling tiles. But nobody was really surprised. Given the train’s reputation for unreliable service, the passengers knew a two-hour delay for the TAZARA was practically on time.</p><p>The railway runs from Tanzania’s largest city through the country’s southern highlands and across the border into Zambia’s copper provinces, finally pulling into the town of Kapiri Mposhi some 1,860 kilometres (1,156 miles) away. It’s a journey that, according to official timetables, should take about 40 hours.</p><p>For regular passengers, it’s a cheap way to reach parts of the country that are not located near main highways. For foreign tourists, it’s a unique way to see Tanzania’s landscapes far from the bustling cities and overcrowded safari parks, provided they are not in a hurry. A first-class sleeper car all the way to Mbeya, a travel hub and border town just to the east of Zambia, surrounded by lush mountains and coffee farms, is just over $20.</p><p>This year, the railroad celebrated its 50th anniversary, but it has struggled for most of its existence, requiring foreign investment for basic upkeep and failing to haul the amount of freight it was built to carry. Inconsistent maintenance and limited investment have seen its infrastructure and cars deteriorate from decades of use.</p><p>It’s hard to determine exactly where a trip on the TAZARA will be at any given time, due to the myriad delays and breakdowns that randomise each journey. Simple derailments from poorly loaded cars and deteriorating tracks are common, and then there’s the occasional unfortunate brush with nature — in August, service was cancelled after a passenger train struck an African buffalo while passing through Tanzania’s Mwalimu Julius Nyerere National Park.</p><p>But since the beginning of 2025, the TAZARA has been plagued by more serious incidents — and fatalities — that reveal the desperate need for an overhaul of both ageing infrastructure and poor safety management. In April, two locomotives being moved from Zambia to a workshop in Mbeya for repairs derailed at a bridge in southern Tanzania, killing both drivers.</p><p>Two months later, in June, a train derailed in Zambia and was then struck by the “rescue train” dispatched to assist it. The collision killed one TAZARA employee and injured 10 staff and 19 passengers, according to a media release from the railway.</p><p>Citing “unexpected operational challenges,” passenger service was briefly suspended in early September. As it turned out, the few operational locomotives the TAZARA could field were stuck in Tanzania, after a fire damaged one of the hundreds of bridges along the track.</p><p>But big improvements for TAZARA are on the horizon, thanks to a major investment by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which has pledged $1.4bn to refurbish the ageing rail line over the next three years. Though the continuation of passenger service is mentioned in the agreement, construction work will necessitate some pauses to regular service as the project is completed.</p><p>Most of the money will be spent on rehabilitating the tracks, but $400m will go toward 32 new locomotives and 762 wagons, “significantly increasing freight and passenger transport capacity,” according to a TAZARA statement. In return, the Chinese state-owned corporation will receive a 30-year concession to run the TAZARA railway and recoup its investment before turning day-to-day management back over to Tanzanian and Zambian authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Refugees will be forced to return to their home countries once those are deemed safe.</p><p>They will also need to wait for 20 years, instead of the current five, before they can apply for permanent residency.</p><p>The government has also said it will legislate to make it harder for irregular migrants and foreign criminals to use the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to stop deportation.</p><p>Since July last year, the UK has “removed more than 50,000 people with no right to remain”, a 23 percent increase on the previous period, and instructed diplomats to make returns a top priority, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Yvette Cooper said.</p><p>The policy has been facing criticism, however, with Mark Davies, a former adviser to the Foreign Office, calling it “shameful” and a departure from “Britain’s historic commitment to support refugees”.</p><p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also described the policy as “draconian”, adding that it tries to “appease the most ghastly, racist right-wing forces all across Europe”, while undermining the UN Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, urged the government to reconsider, warning the plans “will not deter” crossings, and that refugees who work hard should be able to build “secure, settled lives”.</p><p>Official figures cited by the AFP news agency showed that asylum claims in the UK are at a record high, with about 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025.</p><p>But the number of initial positive decisions the UK authorities granted fell from 2023 to 2024.</p><p>Most asylum seekers and refugees arrive in the UK legally.

DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said the attack had left more than a million households in and around Kyiv without power.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said that more than 40 percent of residential buildings in Kyiv were left without heat, as temperatures hovered around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) following the attack.</li>\n<li>Poland’s Air Navigation Services Agency said in a statement on X that the Rzeszow and Lublin airports in the country’s southeastern region were temporarily shut following Russia’s strikes on Ukraine. The Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces said that Polish and allied jets were deployed during the attack, but no violations of Polish airspace were reported.</li>\n<li>In Russia, air defence forces shot down 11 drones headed for the capital, Moscow, according to the city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.</li>\n<li>Russia’s aviation watchdog, Rosaviatsia, said that Moscow’s Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo airports imposed temporary restrictions on airspace due to security reasons.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence also said that its air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed more than 100 Ukrainian drones in three hours over six other Russian regions.</li>\n<li>Russian commanders told President Vladimir Putin that Moscow’s forces had captured the Ukrainian towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhia region, the Kremlin and Russian news agencies said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>But Ukraine’s military said in its daily battlefield update that its forces had beaten back Russian attempts to advance in the vicinity of Myrnohrad and Huliaipole.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Zelenskyy announced in a Telegram message that he would hold talks with European leaders <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/zelenskyy-to-meet-trump-in-florida-amid-diplomatic-push-to-end-war\">after his meeting with Trump</a> on Sunday, as Kyiv pushes for a stronger position in the ongoing ceasefire negotiations to prevent Russia from prolonging the war in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he wants to discuss with Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/russia-claims-to-have-seized-more-than-5100-square-km-of-ukraine-in-2025\">territorial issues</a>, the main stumbling block in talks to end the war, as a 20-point peace framework and a security guarantee deal near completion.</li>\n<li>On the way to the meeting in Florida, Zelenskyy stopped in Canada’s Halifax to meet Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister said in a statement after the meeting.</li>\n<li>Carney denounced the latest Russian attack as “barbarism”, stressing that it is important for allies to “stand with Ukraine in this difficult time”. He also announced $1.83bn in additional economic aid to Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy spoke to European leaders following the meeting with Carney. In a statement posted on X, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “We welcome all efforts leading to our shared objective – a just and lasting peace that preserves Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And that strengthens the country’s security and defence capabilities.”</li>\n<li>Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council, which represents the bloc’s 27 member states, echoed von der Leyen’s promise to continue backing Ukraine, saying on X: “The EU’s support for Ukraine will not falter. In war, in peace, in reconstruction.”</li>\n<li>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Zelenskyy had “the full support” of European leaders ahead of his talks with Trump. The leaders of NATO and the European Union said they would work “in close coordination” with the US “for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine”, Merz added in a statement.</li>\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron said in a call with Zelenskyy that the latest Russian strikes on Kyiv showed that Moscow was not interested in ending the war, the AFP news agency reported, citing officials from Macron’s office. During the call, Macron highlighted what he called the “contrast” between “the willingness of Ukraine to build a lasting peace and Russia’s determination to prolong the war that it started”, the report said.</li>\n<li>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia could see Kyiv was in no hurry to end the war by peaceful means, according to the Interfax news agency. Putin said that if Ukraine did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, then Russia would accomplish all goals of its “special military operation” by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported.</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_4199371\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4199371\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4199371 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251227__894U7CT__v1__MidRes__UkraineCanadaRussiaConflictWarDiplomacy-1766879959.jpg?resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"HANDOUT / UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE / AFPCopy Photo by HANDOUT / UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE / AFP This handout photograph taken on December 27, 2025 and released by the Ukrainian Presidential Office shows Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (R) and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney speaking to the press as they meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Across the last three seasons, Villa have won more points from matches in ​which they were losing than any other Premier League team, according to data firm Opta.</p><p>In ‍the 58th minute on Saturday, with Chelsea 1-0 up and looking in control, Emery gambled on a triple substitution, bringing on Ollie Watkins and more attacking firepower in the form of winger Jadon Sancho, along with midfielder Amadou Onana.</p><p>Five minutes later, Watkins ‍pounced on a ⁠through ball by Morgan Rogers to beat Robert Sanchez in the Chelsea goal.</p><p>Buoyed by their equaliser and their change of personnel, Villa looked transformed from the side that was pinned back by their hosts for most of the first hour.</p><p>In the 84th minute, Watkins – hoping for a place in the England World Cup squad next summer – met a Youri Tielemans corner with an angled header that left Sanchez with no chance.</p><p>“He’s a tactical genius,” Watkins said when asked by Sky ​Sports about Emery’s ability to change the momentum of matches.</p><p>The coach himself tried ‌to sound a bit less effusive. “It’s something, of course, that makes us proud of everything we are doing,” Emery said when asked about Villa’s ability to turn losing situations into victories.</p><p>He sought to play down his side’s chances of winning the title, despite ‌their blistering form.</p><p>“I am not feeling it,” Emery said. “I am feeling we competing very well, and we are now the third in the league with two ‌teams, Manchester City and Arsenal, wow.”</p><p>But with the season only halfway ⁠through, Villa, who struggled badly at the start of the campaign, need to show more consistency, he said.</p><p>Villa face league leaders Arsenal in London on Tuesday.</p><p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca had to face questions about much less impressive statistics for his young side, who have ‌dropped 11 points from winning positions in home Premier League matches this season – four more than any other side.</p><p>“We need to understand why when we concede a goal, we struggle a bit to manage the game,” ‍the Italian told reporters.</p><p>He was left to rue Chelsea’s failure to build a bigger lead before Villa’s fightback.</p><p>“By the time they scored the goal, I think we should have scored two to three goals,” Maresca said.</p><h2 id=\"arsenal-man-city-and-liverpool-maintain-form\">Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool maintain form</h2><p>Manchester City threw down the gauntlet for the ‍second successive weekend, and Arsenal proved undaunted ‍as they kicked off their festive fixtures with a narrow 2-1 defeat of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion to stay as Premier League leaders on Saturday.</p><p>City won 2-1 at Nottingham Forest, with Rayan Cherki grabbing a goal and an assist to briefly move to the top of the pile.</p><p>But Arsenal, just as they had done last week by beating Everton after City’s earlier win over West Ham United, were unwavering as captain Martin Odegaard scored his first goal of the season for Mikel Arteta’s side.</p><p>Arsenal also needed an own goal and ⁠a spectacular save by keeper David Raya to preserve their lead, as the halfway point in the Premier League season looms.</p><p>The London side have 42 points from 18 games, with City on 40.</p><p>When Odegaard drilled in a 14th-minute opener for the Gunners, and Georginio Rutter’s own goal from a Declan Rice corner made it 2-0 shortly after the break, it should have been ​a routine three points for the hosts.</p><p>But Diego Gomez’s reply for Brighton changed the complexion of the contest, and there was relief at the final ‌whistle as Arsenal cleared another obstacle in the title chase.</p><p>“The knock-on effect of winning is incredibly powerful,” Arteta said of a victory that should have been easier.</p><p>“It should never be 2-1, but that’s the Premier League. What I like is that we have a lot of issues [but] we’re dealing with it in an incredible way. Yesterday, we lost Jurrien [Timber]; today, we lost [Riccardo] Calafiori in the warm-up; Declan [Rice] has to play as a full-back, and you see the performance that ‌he put in. So, that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”</p><p>Florian Wirtz scored his first Liverpool goal as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 on an emotional Anfield afternoon, when both sets of fans remembered the late Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash in July.</p><p>Wirtz doubled Liverpool’s lead shortly after Ryan Gravenberch had put them in front, although Wolves rallied in the second half and Santiago Bueno pulled a goal back.</p><p>Reigning champions Liverpool moved fourth on 32 ‍points, while the misery for the ⁠bottom club Wolves continues.</p><p>They have now broken the Premier League record for winless starts to a season and have two points from 18 games, and are 16 points behind the fourth-from-bottom Nottingham Forest.</p></div></div></body></html>"
