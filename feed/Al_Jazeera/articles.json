But the reactor remains “stable”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The No 6 reactor at the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/japan-to-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant-after-15-year-shutdown\">Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant</a> in north-central Japan – closed since the 2011 Fukushima disaster – reactivated on Wednesday as plant workers started removing neutron-absorbing control rods from the core to start stable nuclear fission.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">But the process had to be suspended hours later due to a malfunction related to control rods, which are essential to safely starting up and shutting down reactors, the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) said. The duration of the shutdown was still unknown.</p><p class=\"p1\">TEPCO said there was no safety issue from the glitch and it was checking the situation while suspending the restart operation. The utility later said it was putting the reactor back into shutdown for a fuller examination.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We were investigating the malfunctioning electrical equipment,” spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi told the AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"p1\">The reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside”, he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.</p><p class=\"p1\">The restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after another technical issue related to the rods’ removal was detected last weekend – a problem that was resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.</p><p class=\"p1\">The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"p1\">Fourteen other nuclear reactors have restarted across Japan since 2011, but the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, about 220 kilometres (135 miles) northwest of Tokyo, is the first TEPCO-run unit to resume production.</p><p>The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.</p><p class=\"p1\">A restart of the No 6 reactor could generate an additional 1.35 million kilowatts of electricity, enough to power more than 1 million households in the capital region.</p><p class=\"p1\">Public opinion in Niigata is deeply divided: about 60 percent of residents oppose the restart, while 37 percent support it, according to a survey conducted in September.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP this week during a protest in front of the plant.</p><p class=\"p1\">Earlier this month, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority, saying that the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noting it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The base is leased to the US but operates as a joint UK-US base.</p><p>The UK also has three Crown Dependencies, which, unlike the British Overseas Territories, have never been colonies and are not part of the United Kingdom. They have their own tax systems and courts. The UK is only responsible for their defence and foreign affairs. Crown Dependencies are possessions of the British Crown, owing allegiance to the monarch rather than the UK government.</p><p>They include the self-governing Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey near the French Normandy coast.

The 1959 Antarctic Treaty System is an international agreement which preserves Antarctica for peaceful purposes and scientific research, while freezing all territorial claims.

It was originally part of the UK’s claim.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-BmBsn-new-zealand-4-territories-1769067243.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - BmBsn-new-zealand-4-territories--1769067243\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"denmark-2-territories\">Denmark – 2 territories</h2><p>The Kingdom of Denmark has two self-ruling territories, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/greenlands-strategic-position-in-seven-maps-why-trump-wants-the-island\">Greenland</a> is at the centre of a transatlantic dispute as US President Donald Trump insists on buying the resource-rich island, which is located in the region of North America, despite it having its own parliament and leader.

It has two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) – Hong Kong and Macau. These are generally autonomous in terms of political, economic and legal systems, operating under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems”.</p><p>Hong Kong, located on the South China Sea, is a former British colony but was returned to China in 1997. It has a population of about 7.5 million and is one of the world’s most important financial centres. According to Hong Kong’s Department of Justice, its legal system is different from China’s and is based on common law.</p><p>Nearby Macau is a former Portuguese colony which was returned to China in 1999. It has a population of about 680,000 and is known for its financial services industry as well as casinos. The legal system is based on Portuguese civil law, rather than China’s.</p><p>China also has five autonomous regions within mainland China, which have a degree of political and cultural autonomy.</p><p>Taiwan, which China considers a province, operates as a self-governing territory with its own government, economy and legal system, but China insists it is part of its sovereign territory and has not ruled out using force to bring it under Beijing’s control.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259307\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-beel9-china-2-territories-1769067252.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - beel9-china-2-territories--1769067252\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"portugal-2-territories\">Portugal – 2 territories</h2><p>Portugal has two autonomous regions: The Azores and Madeira, both in the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>The Azores are an archipelago of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, roughly 1,400 to 1,600km (870-1,000 miles) west of mainland Portugal. The islands were claimed by Portugal in 1439, but today are autonomous with their own regional government and a population of about 245,000.</p><p>In 2025, Portugal’s aviation regulator granted a five-year licence to the Atlantic Spaceport Consortium (ASC) to operate a spaceport in the Azores on Santa Maria Island. The facility is Portugal’s first licensed spaceport. Its location in the mid-Atlantic is seen as advantageous for the launch of satellite activities.</p><p>Madeira is roughly 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of mainland Portugal, with a population of about 260,000. Madeira was officially discovered in July 1419 by two sailors who had veered off course due to a storm.

He is currently receiving fluids with electrolytes, sugars and salts but said he will stop drinking altogether from Saturday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While the body can survive for weeks without food, dehydration is certain to have fatal consequences in a far shorter time.</p><p>The escalation comes days after three other hunger-striking remand prisoners affiliated with Palestine Action <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/prison-rights-elbits-loss-how-the-palestine-action-hunger-strike-won\">ended their protests</a>, claiming victory.</p><p>“The only thing that seems to have any impact, whether that is positive or negative, is drastic action,” Khalid, 22, told Al Jazeera from prison via an intermediary. “The strike reflects the severity of this imprisonment. Being in this prison is not living life. Our lives have been paused. The world spins, and we sit in a concrete room. This strike reflects the severity of my demands.”</p><p>Khalid is calling for immediate bail; an end to alleged censorship in prison – authorities have been accused of withholding mail, calls and books and denying visitation rights; an inquiry into alleged British involvement in Israeli military operations in Gaza; and the release of surveillance footage from Royal Air Force (RAF) spy flights that flew over Gaza on April 1, 2024, when British aid workers were killed in an Israeli attack.</p><h2 id=\"brize-norton-break-in\">Brize Norton break-in</h2><p>Khalid is among five activists accused of breaking into the United Kingdom’s largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire in June and spray-painting two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. The incident, which was claimed by Palestine Action, caused millions of pounds worth of damage, according to the British government, which later proscribed the protest group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Critics have condemned the ban as illiberal overreach, given that Palestine Action’s <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/7/10/is-direct-action-for-palestine-terrorism-the-uk-says-it-is\">stated objective</a> is to use nonviolent means to counter Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians and what it says is British complicity in it.</p><p>Khalid denies the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/five-pro-palestinian-activists-plead-not-guilty-over-uk-air-base-break-in\">charges</a> against him of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and conspiracy to enter a prohibited place for purposes prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK.</p><p>He is part of a collective of eight remand prisoners linked to Palestine Action that began a rolling hunger strike in November. Last week, three of them – <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uk-hunger-striker-heba-muraisi-i-think-about-how-or-when-i-could-die\">two of whom</a> were on the brink of death – ended their protests.

The UK’s reported denial of a defence contract to Elbit, Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, is also being interpreted by them as a win.</p><p>Throughout the hunger strike, the British government said it has no power over the issue of bail because it is a matter for the judiciary to decide. The government also insisted that prison welfare procedures are being followed.</p><p>As for Khalid’s other demands, last year, the opposition Labour Party blocked a bill tabled by the left-wing lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn backing an official inquiry into Britain’s involvement in the war on Gaza.</p><p>And in April, the Ministry of Defence told The Times newspaper that it had video footage from an RAF surveillance plane that had flown over Gaza on the day of the Israeli strike that killed the aid workers but could not disclose any further details, citing national security.</p><p>Britain has said it flew spy planes over Gaza during Israel’s onslaught to locate missing captives, but critics have raised questions about possible intelligence sharing with Israel.</p><p>Asim Qureshi, research director at the campaign group Cage, told Al Jazeera that the government’s refusal to meet with Khalid to negotiate on his demands “indicates their lack of concern for the life of this man, who is acting based on his principles within the context of a genocide”.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice has not commented on Khalid’s imprisonment or demands.</p><h2 id=\"i-cry-myself-to-sleep\">‘I cry myself to sleep’</h2><p>Khalid’s family and friends told Al Jazeera that they are particularly concerned because he suffers with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes muscle weakness and wasting.</p><p>“I miss him,” his mother, Shabana Khalid, said, fighting back tears. “He’s starting to feel tired.</p><p>“My first thoughts when I wake up are with Umer. Some nights, I cry myself to sleep.”</p><p>As she herself recovers from cancer and takes care of her disabled sister, travelling to Prison Wormwood Scrubs in London, 320km (200 miles) from the family home in Manchester, is fraught with logistical challenges. She last saw her son on December 26 and does not know when she will be able to visit him next.</p><p>She accused Wormwood Scrubs of denying visiting rights, saying she and his friends have applied to the prison to see him but are told there are no appointments for weeks.</p><p>“My worries are that he’s going to decline very, very quickly,” she said.</p><p>At the time of publication, Wormwood Scrubs had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>Umer’s brother Usman, a mechanical engineering graduate, told Al Jazeera: “When Umer says he’s going to do something, he means it with his full sincerity. And as morbid and sad as it might be to say, I think in his own mind he’s prepared to put his life on the line for this cause.”</p><p>Usman said that while he supports his brother’s protest demands, “from a slightly selfish and sort of personal perspective, I hope he doesn’t [start refusing water].”</p><p>According to the Prisoners for Palestine group, which advocates for the protesters, Umer has asked prison staff “not to intervene in the event he becomes unconscious”.</p><p>In December, he ended a 12-day hunger strike due to his declining health.</p><p>His mother said that before entering prison, he managed his rare condition carefully with a balanced diet and plenty of exercise.</p><p>“Alhamdulillah [Thank God], I am well. I feel very strong both mentally and physically,” Umer said. “I can usually use the prison gym once a week, but I’m not using it during my strike.”</p><p>He said he passes the time by praying and reading books.</p><p>His trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he will have spent a year and a half in prison – far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>His friend Danyal Osman, 29, told Al Jazeera that he feels “very anxious” but “completely” supports Umer “because we all want him to be free”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared before the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/world-economic-forum-at-davos-2026-dates-location-and-what-to-expect\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland – the annual Alpine gathering of the global elite – to declare that now is “not a time for new imperialism or new colonialism”.</p><p>This, of course, was a reference to the current ambitions of Macron’s counterpart in the United States, Donald Trump, who, in addition to recently <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">kidnapping the president of Venezuela</a> and repeatedly threatening to seize the Panama Canal, has <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/21/trump-says-he-wants-ownership-of-greenland-but-wont-use\">made a great deal of noise</a> about taking over the self-governing Danish territory of Greenland.</p><p>Trump himself took to the podium in Davos on Wednesday for a typically rambling speech, during which he alternately babbled about windmills, snidely complimented Macron on his “beautiful” reflective sunglasses, and declared that he would not “use force” in the acquisition of Greenland – which he also accidentally referred to as Iceland.</p><p>Indeed, Trump’s designs on the island have got Europe’s panties in a bunch, and the European Parliament has announced its unequivocal condemnation of “the statements made by the Trump administration regarding Greenland, which constitute a blatant challenge to international law, to the principles of the United Nations Charter and to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a NATO ally”.</p><p>Following Macron’s intervention at Davos, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reported that European leaders had “lined up” in opposition to the “new colonialism” denounced by the French leader.</p><p>Now, it goes without saying that the categorically demented Trump should by no means be encouraged in his predatory international endeavours. But it bears pointing out that, when it comes to colonialism and imperialism, Europe is hardly one to talk.</p><p>Let’s start with France, which continues to rule a dozen territories scattered across the globe – many of them marketed as exotic holiday destinations – including the Guadeloupe islands in the Caribbean Sea and the <a href=\"/gallery/2024/12/19/its-chaos-aftermath-of-cyclone-chido-in-mayotte\">archipelago of Mayotte</a> in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>While these territories have officially moved beyond lowly colonial status to bona fide departments of the French Republic and thereby part of the European Union, France can’t seem to shake the old patronising imperial mindset and attendant superiority complex.</p><p>When in December 2024, residents of cyclone-ravaged Mayotte – France’s poorest overseas territory – criticised the ineffective government response to the disaster, Macron charmingly snapped: “If it wasn’t for France, you would be in way deeper s***, 10,000 times more.”</p><p>How’s that for some “new colonialism”?</p><p>As for the tried-and-true “old” colonialism, France has a particularly appalling track record on that front, as well. Recall the case of Algeria, where some 1.5 million Algerians were killed during the 1954-62 war for independence from French rule.</p><p>Although Macron previously acknowledged that French colonisation of the North African country was a “crime against humanity” that was characterised by rampant torture and other brutality, he has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/algeria-declares-frances-colonial-rule-a-crime-in-new-law\">consistently refused</a> to offer a formal French apology.</p><p>But it’s not just France. Plenty of other European powers who are suddenly against colonialism also possess impressively savage legacies worldwide.</p><p>Indeed, from Africa to Asia to the Middle East and beyond, it’s difficult to find so much as a speck of land that has not been affected in some way or other by past centuries of European plunder, enslavement, mass killing, and similar atrocities.</p><p>The Spaniards decimated Indigenous populations across the Americas, Britain wreaked <a href=\"/opinions/2019/3/2/britains-belated-reckoning-with-imperial-crimes\">imperial havoc</a> wherever it possibly could, and King Leopold II of Belgium presided over the deaths of 10 million or so Congolese starting in 1885, when he established the “Congo Free State” as his own personal property.</p><p>In 2022, Belgian King Philippe offered his “deepest regrets” for the abuses that transpired during the colonial era but withheld an official apology. As one <a href=\"/news/2022/6/8/belgian-king-returns-mask-in-visit-to-dr-congo-alongside-pm\">article</a> on the occasion of the non-apology noted, life in the Congo Free State was such that “villages that missed rubber collection quotas were notoriously made to provide severed hands instead”.</p><p>Over in Ethiopia, meanwhile, British historian Ian Campbell estimates that 19-20 percent of the Ethiopian population of Addis Ababa was wiped out over a mere three days during the Italian military occupation of East Africa in 1937.</p><p>The list of European atrocities goes on.</p><p>This is not, of course, meant as a suggestion that Trump should therefore have free rein to commit whatever crimes or plunder he pleases. It is simply a friendly reminder that you can’t be selectively opposed to colonialism. (Greenland, by the way, was a full-out colony of Denmark until not so long ago.)</p><p>Speaking of colonial atrocities, Europe has not, over the course of more than two years of <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/17/ceasefire-in-palestine-what-ceasefire\">Israel’s ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip</a>, managed to be sufficiently up in arms over the mass slaughter, preferring to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/18/statements-of-condemnation-wont-stop-the-genocide-in-gaza\">go the route of superficial criticism</a> and de facto complicity.</p><p>As the killing continues under the guise of a US-brokered ceasefire, Gaza is now, per the Trumpian vision, set to be administered by a so-called <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">“Board of Peace”</a> chaired by – who else? – Trump himself.</p><p>Also participating on the board will be Israeli prime minister and genocidaire extraordinaire Benjamin Netanyahu, which no doubt heralds a “new colonialism” of the most sinister variety.</p><p>Unfortunately for the world, however, blood-soaked hypocrisy is nothing new.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Because the electricity market was growing as a whole, there was room for coal and gas use to grow as well. That has now changed, said Ember.</p><p>Last October, it was assessed that in 2025, solar and wind power outgrew the electricity market for the first time, and began to take market share away from fossil fuels worldwide.</p><p>This global transition away from fossil fuels manifested itself as a large, simultaneous drop in coal use in China and India last year, two of the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.</p><p>In China, coal-fired power fell by 1 percent, the first drop in a decade.</p><h2 id=\"so-much-capacity-being-added\">‘So much capacity being added’</h2><p>Ember said solar power has grown in 14 of the EU’s 27 member states, but some industry insiders warned that too much ambition could backfire.</p><p>“In Greece, in 2025, we reached an installed capacity [of solar photovoltaics] of 12GW, up from 9.5GW in 2024, a 25 percent leap,” said Stelios Loumakis, president of the Association of Photovoltaic Energy Producers in Greece. “As a result, a quarter of the power we generated was cut out by the grid,” he told Al Jazeera, because supply exceeded demand.</p><p>“We expect that to rise to 40 percent this year. So what we’re doing is furiously adding capacity while producers lose income,” he said.</p><p>“There is now so much capacity being added that a lot of these investors are going to go bankrupt,” Loumakis told Al Jazeera. “The only way to avoid that is to install a lot of electricity storage, but what is currently under construction is still much too little.”</p><p>There was also bad news in the United States, where emissions rose by 2.4 percent last year after two years of declines, due to a rise in coal-fired generation, Axios reported, citing research by the Rhodium Group.</p><p>The administration of US President Donald Trump has pledged not to shut down any coal-fired electricity plants, and has been cancelling licences for offshore wind and onshore solar parks. The US also plans to pull back $24bn in federal subsidies to climate projects awarded by the previous Biden administration.</p><p>In March, Ember said the US “remains far behind the European Union”, as wind and solar power generated 17 percent of its electricity in 2024.</p><p>Some of Trump’s reversals are being struck down in the courts.</p><p>Federal judges ordered the resumption of construction of large wind parks offshore New York and Virginia this month, and more Trump administration injunctions were being fought in the courts.</p><p>Legislation and litigation are key tools in making the clean energy transition irreversible, recent research has shown.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Among the so-called partisan groups, Atesh – whose name means “fire” in Crimean Tatar – has emerged as the most prolific, claiming responsibility for more than half of the sabotage attacks on Russian-controlled territory last year.</p><p>“We are currently in a war of attrition, and the role of internal resistance is becoming decisive,” the organisation’s coordinator told Al Jazeera over Telegram.</p><p>“The occupiers cannot guard every truck or every metre of rail in their rear.”</p><p>Atesh was founded in September 2022, seven months after the Russian military mounted a full-scale invasion of its western neighbour. While its core consists of Crimean Tatars, an ethnic minority with long-held <a href=\"/news/2022/3/12/russia-ukraine-crimean-tatars-dissent-repression\">grievances</a> against Moscow’s rule, members also include Ukrainians and even a handful of Russians and Belarusians, according to the representative.</p><p>“We realised that Crimea and other captured territories would not simply wait for liberation; they must become a thorn in the occupier’s side from within,” said the representative, who cannot be named for safety reasons.</p><p>“We are working for the systemic collapse of the Russian military machine from within. We are ensuring that every Russian soldier on our soil feels unsafe, and their logistics, equipment and headquarters are reduced to ashes.”</p><h2 id=\"sabotage-operations\">‘Sabotage operations’</h2><p>Acts of sabotage have been taking place on Russian territory since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, starting with a wave of <a href=\"/news/2022/7/15/what-happened-to-russias-anti-war-movement\">arson attacks</a> on army draft offices.</p><p>Since then, railroad infrastructure and supply trains for Russian troops have become the preferred targets for saboteurs seeking to slow down the Kremlin’s war machine. Among them are antiwar Russians and Belarusians, including underground networks such as <a href=\"/news/2023/1/25/russian-saboteurs-seek-to-hamper-putins-war-machine\">BOAK</a> (the Combat Organisation of Anarcho-Communists) as well as saboteurs-for-hire that Ukrainian agents have recruited online.</p><p>“Sabotage operations are often coordinated by the Ukrainian intelligence and the SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] and conducted by either people supporting Ukraine or other persons recruited under the promise of a financial reward, threats or deceit,” Olha Polishchuk, research manager for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) conflict monitor, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It may be difficult to decouple Ukraine-led operations from partisan-led ones. There is often coordination between the two. Sometimes, we cannot establish a direct link to the Ukrainian government, but we know that persons involved in sabotage were recruited online by unidentified actors.”</p><p>Russian intelligence has deployed <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/exiled-russian-accused-of-spying-on-opposition-including-navalny-movement\">similar tactics</a>, reportedly paying local criminals to target logistics both in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>According to an ACLED report, Atesh was responsible for more than 50 percent of the acts of sabotage in Russian-occupied Ukraine in 2025.</p><p>Dozens of its operations were reportedly within Russia, including setting fire to a locomotive in Rostov and destroying an air defence factory’s communications tower in Tula, south of Moscow.</p><p>“The impact is difficult to estimate,” Polishchuk said.</p><p>“A lot of sabotage activities have a limited effect and may cause inconveniences and resupply delays. This effect, however, can accumulate and force Russia to spend additional resources on repairs, security measures and policing the local population.”</p><p>Although Atesh’s claims of responsibility cannot be independently confirmed, the group routinely broadcasts the coordinates and purported video evidence of their actions over Telegram.</p><p>“We strike at the enemy’s most vulnerable points,” the Atesh representative said.</p><p>“We select targets that are critical for logistics or troop command, such as headquarters, bridges and ammunition depots. Planning is based on intel from our agents directly on the ground. If we receive information about an important echelon or ammunition column, we focus all our efforts on that target while always prioritising the safety of our people.”</p><p>The group said it minimises infiltration from Russian security services by adopting a decentralised command structure, communicating strictly through encrypted apps.</p><p>“Individual agents don’t know each other, and cells operate autonomously,” the source said.</p><p>“We use advanced encryption methods and train everyone in digital hygiene. Even when the FSB [Russia’s Federal Security Service] tries to infiltrate its provocateurs, our data verification and cross-checking system allows us to quickly mitigate the threat.”</p><p>Russian sympathisers also support Atesh’s operations, the group claims.</p><p>“We have active agents among the Russian armed forces, the national guard and even intelligence agencies,” the representative said.</p><p>“Some do this for ideological reasons, having recognised the criminality of war, while others do so for the sake of their families’ futures, realising the inevitable collapse of the regime. Their inside information allows us to know in advance about the movement of combat vehicles and what is happening in closed command bunkers.”</p><p>By 2023, Atesh said it had taught 4,000 Russian soldiers how to “survive” the war by damaging their own equipment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Aside from sabotage, Atesh’s activities range from what it describes as “propaganda” – plastering stickers with its messages over Russian and Russian-occupied cities – to reconnaissance of bases, depots and supply trains, which it shares with Ukrainian intelligence. Atesh claimed its information led directly to a successful wave of Ukrainian strikes in 2023 that forced Russia to relocate its Black Sea Fleet.</p><p>Polischuk pointed to Ukraine’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/18/ukraines-spiderweb-drone-assault-forces-russia-to-shelter-move-aircraft\">Spiderweb</a> operation last year, a mass drone strike on Russian airfields, as an example of an effective Ukrainian operation coordinated with partisan groups.</p><p>If needed, Atesh agents do not hesitate to deploy lethal force. For example, in July, the group said it killed several Russian servicemen by setting fire to their truck in southeastern Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region.</p><p>“Our targets are those who came to our land to kill and traitors who actively participate in repressions against the civilian population,” the partisans’ coordinator stated.</p><p>“Collaborators who betray their neighbours and officers who order strikes on cities are priority targets.”</p><p>The partisans put themselves at high risk.</p><p>“Russia has implemented brutal policies since the beginning, so sabotage activity was born in these conditions and had to adjust to them immediately,” Polishchuk explained.</p><p>“Expressing any support for Ukraine is dangerous both in occupied Ukraine and in Russia,” she added. “Those suspected of any cooperation with the Ukrainian military can be arrested or disappeared without due process, even if no evidence is found against them.”</p><p>Resistance and sabotage activity “persists nonetheless”, she said.</p><p>For many Atesh operatives, the mission to rid their land of Russian occupation is personal.</p><p>“For our people, it’s one endless tragedy, broken only occasionally by brief periods of peace,” Al Jazeera’s source reflected.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-crimean-tatars\">Who are the Crimean Tatars?</h2><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2016/3/19/russia-continues-to-oppress-crimeas-tatars\">Crimean Tatars</a> are a Turkic ethnic group indigenous to the Crimean Peninsula who have endured repression since the Russian Empire conquered their homeland in the 18th century. The most painful memory was from 1944 when Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, suspecting Tatars of disloyalty during World War II, ordered the entire population to be <a href=\"/features/2016/5/19/for-crimean-tatars-it-is-about-much-more-than-1944\">deported</a> to Central Asia even though thousands of Tatars faithfully served in the Red Army and helped defeat the Nazis.</p><p>Herded onto trains with little time to prepare, perhaps as many as a third did not survive the journey.</p><p>Modern Ukraine <a href=\"/news/2015/11/13/ukraine-calls-soviet-deportation-of-muslims-genocide\">considers</a> the Tatars’ removal a genocide. The deportees and their descendants were allowed to return only decades later, provoking tensions with the ethnic Russians and Ukrainians who had settled the land in between.</p><p>Since the Russian takeover and annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Crimean Tatars have seen their Mejlis, the traditional Tatar parliament, <a href=\"/news/2025/1/28/crimean-tatars-jailed-by-russia-hailed-by-ukraine\">outlawed</a> as a “terrorist” organisation while civil rights activists have gone missing. Some were later found dead. Tens of thousands of Crimean Tatars <a href=\"/features/2022/8/4/the-ukrainian-muslims-fighting-against-russia\">left</a> their homes for the Ukrainian mainland after Russia took control.</p><p>“Our flame will burn until the last invader remains on our soil,” the Atesh operative promised.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The night is chilly, and for the first time in weeks, everything is still for a moment – the Israeli settlers’ celebrations have finished for the day.</p><p>But the village of Ras Ein al-Auja, situated in the eastern West Bank’s Jericho governorate, has been all but wiped out.</p><p>The village was one of the last Palestinian herding communities in this part of the Jordan Valley, but now, the herders’ sheep have gone – most of them stolen or poisoned by settlers or sold off by villagers under pressure. Their water has been cut off – the Ras Ein spring declared off-limits by the neighbouring settlers for the past year.</p><p>And for the past two weeks, most of the community’s homes have been dismantled. Many of the families forced out have burned their furniture before they have left, not wanting to leave it for the invading settlers to use.</p><p>“By God, it’s a difficult feeling,” Ghawanmeh says. He is at a loss for words, fidgeting by the fire and at times rubbing his face in misery and exhaustion. “Everyone left. Not one of them [remains]. They all left.”</p><p>Since the start of this year, about 450 of the 650 Palestinian inhabitants of Ras Ein al-Auja have fled their homes – for many the only place they have ever lived – because of violence by Israeli settlers.</p><p>Other than the 14 Ghawanmeh families, including a large number of children, who say they have nowhere else to go, the rest are packing up and leaving in the coming days.</p><p>This rapid displacement of hundreds of people marks the largest expulsion from a single Bedouin community as a result of Israeli settler violence in modern times – a feat that has elicited taunting celebrations by the encroaching settlers and left lives in ruins for Bedouin families now deprived of shelter, livelihoods and community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-Dismantling-buildings-PC-Looking-1-1768996609.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians dismantle their homes as settler violence forces them out of Ras Ein al-Auja [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-land-no-sheep-no-water-no-safety\">No land, no sheep, no water, no safety</h2><p>Until the New Year, the people of Ras Ein al-Auja had held out on their lands despite an onslaught of physical attacks, thefts, threats, movement restrictions and destruction of property by settlers – a state of being that is now all too common for rural Palestinian communities across the West Bank.</p><p>Settlers have been enabled by rapid growth in the number of settlement outposts springing up across the West Bank. Settlements and these outposts are illegal under international law. They are also built without the legal permission of Israeli authorities but in practice are largely tolerated and offered protection by Israeli forces, especially in recent years under the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>International law stipulates that occupying powers like Israel must not move their own civilian populations into occupied territories, such as the West Bank, where about 700,000 settlers now reside.</p><p>In December, another 19 settler outposts built without government approval were retroactively <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/illegal-settlement-expansion-how-israel-is-redrawing-occupied-west-bank\">approved</a> by Israel’s government as official settlements. In all, the number of settlements and outposts in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem has risen by nearly 50 percent since 2022 – from 141 to 210 now.</p><p>This recent explosion of settler outposts has given way to a more recent yet even more dangerous phenomenon: <a href=\"/news/2023/6/4/better-to-die-there-palestinians-mourn-ein-samiya-eviction\">shepherding outposts</a>.</p><p>Each of these outposts mimics the Bedouins’ way of life but with settlers’ own grazing flocks. They are typically run by a single armed Israeli settler supported by several armed teenagers often funnelled in by government-funded programmes intended to support “at-risk” troubled youth.</p><p>Using animal grazing as a means to overrun Palestinian shepherds and seize their lands, such settlers had managed by April 2024 to take over about 14 percent of the West Bank, according to the Israeli NGO Kerem Navot. That figure has increased since then by at least tens of thousands of dunums (1 dunum equals 0.1 hectares and a quarter of an acre), according to Kerem Navot’s founder, Dror Etkes.</p><p>The outposts serve as a launching pad for attacks, controls on Palestinian movement and army-coordinated arrests, which have unfolded in places like Ras Ein al-Auja.</p><p>Routinely, settlers steal and poison the livestock that Palestinian shepherds, who largely inhabit these remote areas, rely on for their livelihoods. On top of this, settlers are preventing Palestinian shepherds who still have flocks from accessing the grazing lands they’ve always used. Settlers have built fences and engage in intimidation and violence, forcing Palestinians to buy expensive animal fodder to sustain their flocks instead.</p><p>Settlers also target the basic resources that Bedouin Palestinians rely on for themselves. Like most other Palestinian communities in the West Bank’s Area C, which Israel fully controls, the people of Ras Ein al-Auja are denied access to electricity by Israeli authorities. The Israeli Civil Administration, which controls zoning and planning in Area C, rarely grants permits for Palestinians to build infrastructure, including connecting to the grid or installing solar energy systems. The solar panels the villagers have put up have frequently been destroyed by settlers.</p><p>In addition, these Palestinian shepherding communities, often located in dry regions, are now <a href=\"/features/2026/1/5/israeli-settlers-consume-water-seven-times-more-than-palestinians\">denied</a> sufficient access to water, including from the lush springs found in Ras Ein al-Auja which once made this village one of the most prosperous of the shepherding communities.</p><p>“They prevented us from getting water,” Ghawanmeh says. “They prevented us from bringing the sheep to the water and getting water from the spring.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256915\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256915\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-Home-dismantled-except-floor-PC-Looking-1-1768996268.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Palestinian home is dismantled except for the floor in Ras Ein al-Auja, nearly all of whose inhabitants have been forced out by violent Israeli settlers [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"near-total-impunity\">Near-total impunity</h2><p>Israeli settlers have also been emboldened by a wide-scale armament programme spearheaded at the start of Israel’s genocidal war in the Gaza Strip by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and the near-total impunity they enjoy when they carry out attacks. While <a href=\"/features/2025/12/24/victory-against-israeli-west-bank-settlement-offers-palestinians-some-hope\">court rulings in favour of Palestinians</a> and against settlers have occurred, they are rare.</p><p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 1,800 settler attacks – about five per day – were documented in 2025, resulting in casualties or property damage in about 280 communities across the West Bank, and besting the previous year’s record of settler attacks by more than 350. A total of 240 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 55 children, were killed by Israeli forces or settlers in 2025.</p><p>These unprecedented levels of settler and soldier violence alongside the wholesale deprivation of basic resources that rural Palestinians need to survive have led to the erasure of dozens of rural Palestinian communities.</p><p>In January and February 2025, the Israeli military forcibly displaced about 40,000 people from refugee camps in <a href=\"/features/2025/10/15/israeli-arson-bulldozers-and-forced-labour-in-the-west-banks-tulkarem\">Tulkarem</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/deadly-israeli-raid-in-jenin-leads-to-mass-displacement-destruction\">Jenin</a>, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. Since the Gaza war began in October 2023, settler violence has forced out 44 Palestinian communities in the West Bank consisting of 2,701 people, nearly half of whom are minors. Thirteen more communities comprising 452 people have been partially transferred. These people end up wherever they can find a place to stay, resulting in fractured communities and families.</p><p>Such figures of displacement have not been seen in the West Bank in decades.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256943\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256943\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4256943 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-dismantling-building-frame-PC-Looking-1-1768996744.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256943\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians take their houses apart before fleeing the village of Ras Ein al-Auja in the eastern West Bank [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"two-years-of-psychological-pressure\">‘Two years of psychological pressure’</h2><p>For 27 months, Ras Ein al-Auja has been subjected to all of these types of attacks and restrictions. In the past year, multiple Israeli shepherding outposts have sprung up at different corners of the village, which extends for 20,000 dunums (20sq km or 7.7sq miles), and have come increasingly closer to Palestinian homes.</p><p>“Two years of psychological pressure at night,” remarks an exhausted Ghawanmeh, who explains the haphazard shifts the men of his village have been taking to keep watch. “If you sleep, the settlers will burn your house.”</p><p>Under the pressure of settler attacks, poisonings and thefts, the number of sheep belonging to the community has dwindled from 24,000 to fewer than 3,000. Settler attacks and invasions have become so constant that nine solidarity activists – some progressives from Israel and others from other countries – were required to keep an around-the-clock protective presence.</p><p>Without anywhere else to go – and knowing from both settler threats and accounts from displaced relatives elsewhere that settlers would likely follow them anyway – the people of Ras Ein al-Auja had hung on by a thread.</p><p id=\"that-is-until-the-latest-settler-outpost\">That is, until the latest settler outpost.</p><p>Following a pattern seen in other now-displaced Bedouin communities like nearby Mu’arrajat, some of whose inhabitants fled to Ras Ein al-Auja, settlers began erecting outposts directly next to people’s homes at the beginning of the year – right in the middle of the community.</p><p>“Life has completely stopped ever since,” Ghawanmeh says. Families have barricaded themselves inside their houses, terrified of the settlers who now routinely graze their flocks just outside Palestinian homes.</p><p>Then, the spate of attacks this month compelled far more families to flee and take their remaining sheep with them. Almost three-quarters of the community has now gone. These families are now scattered across the West Bank although most are now in the cramped towns and cities of Area A, which makes up 18 percent of the West Bank and is administered by the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>As a result, these communities’ centuries-old traditions as Bedouins are coming to an end.</p><p>“There’s a saying among the Bedouins: ‘Upbringing outweighs origins,’” Ghawanmeh says. “It means you were raised here, you eat from the land, you drink from the land, you sleep on the land. You are from it, and it is from you.”</p><p>“To leave your house and leave your village”, he adds, “it is very, very, very difficult. But we are forced to.”</p><p>The children who remain have been left rudderless and afraid at night as they look at empty, scarred patches of land where once their friends and family lived. “Children are scared, scared that the settlers, the [settler security guards], will come,” Ghawanmeh says.</p><p>Al Jazeera requested comment from the Israeli military about the accusations made in this article and to ask for details about what action is being taken to prevent settler attacks on Palestinian communities, including Ras Ein al-Auja. We received no response.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256954\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256954\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256954\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-several-men-dismantling-home-PC-Looking-1-1768996809.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256954\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Residents of Ras Ein al-Auja prepare to leave as Israeli settler attacks have intensified on their community, property and livestock this year [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"even-if-you-sing-for-me-until-tomorrow-i-won-t-be-happy\">‘Even if you sing for me until tomorrow, I won’t be happy’</h2><p>As the swell of violence and land thefts gives way to a steady exodus of the last remaining villagers, a couple of musicians come to provide some relief from another day of traumatic separation and displacement.</p><p>“I hope they’ll feel seen, and I hope they’ll feel happy for at least a few moments and that they can feel like children, even if it’s just for a few minutes,” says Kai Jack, a Norwegian solidarity activist and professional contrabass player.</p><p>About a dozen children huddle in plastic chairs in a tin shack that once served as the meeting place for the community’s many families to hear this rare performance. As they listen to a handful of Palestinian folk songs, the children, at first timid, relax and begin to clap and sing to staples like Wein a Ramallah (Where? To Ramallah).</p><p>For the first time in weeks, the children even manage to crack a few smiles.</p><p>And then, Jack and the accompanying violinist, Amalia Kelter Zeitlin, settle into playing the Palestinian lullaby Yamma Mawil al-Hawa (Mother, What’s with the Wind?). The children’s mothers, looking on from the sidelines, begin to softly sing along:</p><p>“My life will continue through sacrifice – for freedom.”</p><p>As the song ends, the mothers join the children in rounds of applause. “Beautiful?” Jack asks.</p><p>“Very,” replies one of the mothers who explains how she helps her child fall to sleep with this very song. “And it has been so long since they were able to [sleep well].”</p><p>As the performance ends and the children crowd around Jack’s enormous bass, a few of the remaining Ghawanmeh brothers retreat outside, their minds unable to rest as they contemplate their inevitable expulsion.</p><p>“These songs are for the children,” Naif Ghawanmeh says. “We are tired inside. Very tired.”</p><p>One of his small nephews, Ahmed, just 2 years old, begins to sing the chorus of Wein a Ramallah. For one brief moment, the atmosphere is almost festive. But while he is happy the children are relaxing, Ghawanmeh shrugs it off himself.</p><p>“By God, look at me,” he says over the fire, which is burning whatever supplies they didn’t want to leave for the settlers to take. “Even if you sing for me until tomorrow, I won’t be happy. You see, I’m tired inside. For two years, I’ve been suffering from oppression, hardship and problems day and night from the settlers.</p><p>“I’m tired inside.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
