Israel has also increased the ferocity of its raids on Bethlehem and the occupied West Bank, where more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the past two years.</p><p>Attacks from the Israeli military and settlers alike have not spared Palestinian Christians, with attacks on Gaza’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/israel-bombs-gazas-only-catholic-church-sheltering-elderly-and-children\">only Catholic church</a> killing three in July, and a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/church-leaders-diplomats-condemn-israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank\">predominantly Christian town</a> in the West Bank in the same month.</p><p>A ceasefire in Gaza that began in October has brought some respite, even as Israel continues its violations and attacks on the Strip, killing hundreds of people. The Israeli army also continued its military raids in <span>the occupied West Bank.</span></p><p>And even as the festive atmosphere lightened the mood in Manger Square, the reality of the war was not absent. Israeli military raids and checkpoints continued, with Israeli forces arresting three young men from the nearby refugee camps of Dheisheh and Aida just hours before the celebrations began.</p><p>Pizzaballa, who has just returned from Gaza, was quick to reference the suffering of Palestinians.</p><p>“In Gaza … I witnessed total destruction,” he said. “But amid Gaza’s destruction, I felt a passion for life. In the midst of nothingness, people created reasons for joy and celebration. They reminded us that we can return and rebuild again despite human destruction.”</p><p>“We will be able to celebrate in Gaza and Bethlehem,” Pizzaballa continued. “We will return to rebuild everything anew.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194655\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00010-1766614086.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24, on the occasion of Christmas.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24 [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tough-journey\">Tough journey</h2><p>About 1,500 people – both Palestinians and foreign visitors – attended the Christmas celebrations, which have become one of the biggest symbols of Christian life in the region, even as the percentage of Palestinian Christians living in the West Bank gets smaller as a result of the Israeli occupation, among other factors.</p><p>George Zalloum, from occupied East Jerusalem, was one of the Palestinian Christians who had made the journey to Bethlehem.</p><p>He told Al Jazeera that he was enjoying the atmosphere, but that it was tinged with sorrow.</p><p>“Today’s atmosphere is half joy and half sadness, because we have brothers who are still dying in Gaza due to the ongoing bombardment and killing there,” Zalloum told Al Jazeera. “We hope the war will end, the killing will stop, peace will prevail in the Holy Land, and that these holidays … will continue.”</p><p>Other Palestinians travelled to Bethlehem from cities and villages across the West Bank, but their journeys highlighted the difficulties placed on them by Israel.</p><p>Many waited for hours at checkpoints surrounding Bethlehem, even as the physical distance between their homes and the city was not long.</p><p>“It is true that the atmosphere of joy, love and peace has returned to us, but the road to Bethlehem was difficult,” said Hussam Zraiqat, who travelled to Manger Square from Birzeit, near Ramallah. “We spent a long time at an Israeli military checkpoint, but thank God, we arrived.”</p><p>That was echoed by another Palestinian attendee, Ghassan Rizqallah, from the village of Jifna, also near Ramallah.</p><p>“We faced the military checkpoint, where we waited for at least an hour and a half before we were able to enter the city,” Rizqallah said. “The journey was very difficult.”</p><p>But once he arrived, Rizqallah was overjoyed to experience the Christmas atmosphere. “Watching the scout bands and hearing the music takes us back to the beautiful past of our country, our land, and our heritage – and we deserve to live in safety and peace.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194659\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00003-1766614156.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian young women play drums\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christmas celebrations had been suspended in Bethlehem for the past two years because of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and raids in the occupied West Bank [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"vital-tourism\">Vital tourism</h2><p>Bethlehem’s mayor, Maher Canawati, said that the Manger Square celebrations carried a meaning that went beyond Bethlehem.</p><p>“Bethlehem’s message today is one of steadfastness and hope for the people of the city, for Gaza, and for all of Palestine,” Canawati told Al Jazeera. “Today, we send a message to the entire world that the Palestinian people love life and peace, and that they cannot be uprooted from their land and their roots because they are the rightful owners.”</p><p>Canawati pointed to tentative signs of economic revival in the city, whose Church of the Nativity is a major site of Christian pilgrimage, after a prolonged collapse in tourism.</p><p>“All the Bethlehem hotels are reopening their doors to receive local and foreign visitors after nearly two years of almost complete shutdown,” Canawati said. “God willing, the wheel of tourism has started turning again.”</p><p>Bethlehem’s economy, heavily dependent on tourism, has been badly hit. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, hotel occupancy rates since the beginning of the year stood at only 25 percent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194667\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194667\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00017-1766614496.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Women gathered at a barrier\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians travelled from across the West Bank and Israel to attend the celebrations in Bethlehem [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Elias al-Arja, the head of the Palestinian Hotel Association, said that hotels in Bethlehem had suffered $300m in losses this year. However, the renewal of the Christmas celebrations has been a huge boon.</p><p>“Hotel occupancy rates over the past two days have risen to 80 percent, with around 8,000 visitors – 6,000 of them Palestinian citizens of Israel, and 2,000 from various nationalities from Europe and the United States,” al-Arja said.</p><p>Some of those visitors took the opportunity to watch the Christmas celebrations in Manger Square.</p><p>“It is good to see these celebrations returning,” said Dwayne Jefferson, who travelled from the US state of North Carolina. “It is a positive experience and opens the door to the possibility that this entire region can return to a state of normal life. I am very happy to be here.”</p><p>Jean Charles, a tourist from Italy, said that it was his first visit to Bethlehem, and that he was happy to see so much joy after two years of war.</p><p>“I see this feast as a celebration for every Palestinian, not only Christians,” said Charles. “I see Muslims here as well, and this is very important and interesting for the future of this people.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I noticed the low number of tourists … But honestly, the situation is very calm.

The losses I suffered cannot be counted,” he said. “We hope there will be more activity at the beginning of the year.”</p><p>Souvenir shop owner Jack Jaqman struck a similar note. “The activity we saw today is not enough … Those who visited Bethlehem were [mainly] foreign workers in Israel from the Philippines, India and Romania, or our own people [living in Israel],” Jaqman said. “Still, it is important in showing the city’s reality and its readiness to receive pilgrims and tourists again.”</p><p>“I have been in my souvenir shop for 10 days and have not felt the presence of real tourist groups that could improve the economic situation,” he said. “On this day, we pray for the end of the siege that has turned Bethlehem into a large prison.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

research centre, said on Wednesday that its annual survey of sentiment around the outgoing year and expectations for the coming year found Russians are viewing 2026 with “growing optimism”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

likely to accept (or believe, hope?) future improvements this year, but they still do so with caution,” the organisation said in a review of its survey findings released online.</p><p>In a year-end presentation, VTsIOM deputy head Mikhail Mamonov said 70 percent of 1,600 people surveyed ​viewed 2026 as being a more “successful” year for Russia than this year, with 55 percent of respondents linking hope for a better year ‍to a possible end to what Russia officially calls its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1400\">“special military operation” in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>“The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president,” Mamonov ‍said at the ⁠presentation.</p><p>Mamonov pointed to the Russian military’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/why-is-russia-escalating-attacks-on-ukraines-odesa\">ongoing offensive in Ukraine</a>, Washington’s reluctance to finance the Ukraine war and the European Union’s inability to fully replace the ‌United States’ role in Ukraine – financially and militarily – as key factors behind the prospects for an eventual deal to end the fighting.</p><p>At the conclusion of the conflict, reintegration of Russian military veterans into society and the reconstruction of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine, as well as Russian border areas, will be the main priorities, Mamonov added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the actual level of Russian public fatigue with the war is difficult to measure due to strict state controls on the media, expressions of public dissent as well as the prosecution of those who criticise Moscow’s war on its neighbour, approximately two-thirds of Russians support peace talks, according to independent pollster Levada, the highest number since the start of the war in 2022.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in comments released on Wednesday that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Moscow reciprocated by also pulling back its forces and allowed the area to become a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.</p><p>In comments to reporters about an overarching 20-point plan that negotiators from Ukraine and the US had hammered out in Florida in recent days, Zelenskyy also said that a similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control.</p><p></p><p>Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized in Ukraine and has long insisted that Kyiv must give up the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas industrial area before any discussions on the cessation of fighting.</p><p>Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 percent of Donetsk – the two regions that make up the Donbas.</p><p>Zelenskyy also said that figuring out the future control of the Donbas as part of the plan was “the most difficult point”, and creating a demilitarised economic zone in the region would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed.</p><p>Such discussions should be held at the leaders’ level, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Packed with protein, calcium, antioxidants and vitamins, the nuts have rapidly gained a reputation as major immunity boosters.</p><p>But they haven’t been immune to the effects of Trump’s tariffs: The US president first hit Indian goods with a 25 percent levy, then doubled that <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/27/trumps-india-tariffs-take-effect-which-sector-will-be-hit-whats-exempt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to 50 percent</a> on account of Indian imports of Russian oil, which he said were helping fuel Russia’s war on Ukraine. The tariffs have hit businesses across several sectors in India for whom the US has been a major export market, including those dealing with <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/8/india-is-worlds-second-largest-shrimp-producer-that-is-now-under-threat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shrimp</a>, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/9/us-tariffs-ruin-education-dreams-for-children-in-indias-diamond-hub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diamonds</a> and textiles.</p><p>Exporters of fox nuts have seen sales to the US slump by as much as 40 percent.</p><p>Still, amid the crisis, some are also spotting a ray of hope – Indian fox nuts are finding new, alternative markets and a growing appetite for the superfood in India.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181657\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181657\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-seeds-are-collected-from-the-marshy-water-bodies-1766045627.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181657\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-seeds-are-collected-from-the-marshy-water-bodies-1766045627.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fox nuts India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181657\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fox nuts are grown in low-lying areas in India [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nascent-stage\">‘Nascent stage’</h2><p>In India, fox nuts are grown in low-lying areas, particularly in the eastern Bihar state, and are a source of income to about 150,000 farmers. The country dominates 90 percent of the global production.</p><p>The state produces 120,000 metric tonnes of seeds and 40,000 tonnes of popped fox nuts annually across 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of land.</p><p>The cultivation is done in shallow agricultural fields with a depth of about 1.3 to 1.8 metres (4 to 6 feet). It is not expensive, as new plants easily germinate from older seeds.</p><p>The harvesting season starts from mid-July and continues until the end of November, during which labourers sweep the entire body of water collected on fields for seeds with traditional tools like horn-shaped split bamboo and nets, depending on the seeds’ size.</p><p>The collected seeds are first sun-dried, and then heated in a clay or iron pan to make the outer shells brittle. The seeds are finally hammered to release the whiter edible makhana puff, which is again roasted for a final crunch.</p><p>In 2024-25, India exported approximately 800 metric tonnes of fox nuts to countries like Germany, China, the US and the Middle East. But the US – where 50 percent of India’s exported fox nuts go – dominates the market, said Satyajit Singh, whose company, Shakti Sudha Agro Ventures, controls half of India’s total exports of the health food.</p><p>The total industry turnover – including the domestic market – is about 3.6 billion rupees ($40m), Singh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the sector has huge opportunities, as it is still in a nascent stage and limited to [the] Indian diaspora in [the] international market, and we need to spread more awareness about it both domestically and abroad,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181653\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181653\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0067-1766045618.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181653\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0067-1766045618.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fox nuts India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sector is still in the nascent stage [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>He is already seeing demand from new markets, like Spain and South Africa, driven by the Indian diaspora and awareness of the health benefits of fox nuts, he said.</p><p>Ketan Bengani, 28, a Kolkata-based fox nut exporter, told Al Jazeera that the domestic demand for fox nuts has also been doubling each year since the COVID-19 pandemic, when people became aware of the nuts’ health benefits.</p><p>His exports to the US of about 46 metric tonnes have dropped by 40 percent due to the tariffs. But he is not too worried, and expects to make that up with the rising demand in India, he said.</p><p>In fact, the high demand has attracted several budding entrepreneurs.</p><p>Among them is Md Gulfaraz, 27, a fox nut producer and exporter based in Charkhi village in the Purnea district of Bihar.</p><p>Gulfaraz told Al Jazeera that this company’s sales have jumped from 5.4 million rupees ($60,000) in 2019 to 45 million rupees ($500,00) in the financial year ending March 2025, thanks to burgeoning domestic demand.</p><h2 id=\"strong-domestic-market\">Strong domestic market</h2><p>Makhanas, as fox nuts are popularly known in India, used to be common in Indian kitchens historically, but like many traditional foods, lost out to the slick marketing campaigns, branding and flavours of Western and more modern Indian snacks.</p><p>The pandemic served as a blessing in disguise, bringing fox nuts back in favour because of their immunity benefits. Now, makhanas line Indian supermarket shelves, with flavours ranging from peri peri to tangy tomato, cheese to onion and cream.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181647\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181647\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0060-1766045608.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181647\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0060-1766045608.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fox nuts India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181647\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Indian government has announced a makhana board to help the sector grow [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Sujay Verma, 43, a software engineer in Kolkata, who is a native of Bihar and grew up eating fox nuts, told Al Jazeera that he gives a plate to his two daughters every day at breakfast.</p><p>“We were rushing after the packed food items that were expensive and creating a hole in my pocket. But fox nuts are not only cheap, but also good for health,” he said.</p><p>The Indian government has also seen the business potential of fox nuts. Earlier this year, it announced the formation of a makhana board at an initial outlay of one billion rupees ($11m) to institutionalise the value chain and provide training, technical support, quality regulation and export facilitation to businesses.</p><p>The drive from the Indian government comes from the top: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a rally earlier this year that he eats fox nuts most days, and that it was time that India took the super food to the world.</p><p>Farmers and labourers are also switching to fox nut production from other crops due to higher returns.</p><p>Anil Kumar, assistant professor at Bhola Paswan Shastri Agricultural College in Purnia in Bihar, told Al Jazeera that the labourers who collect seeds earn about 2,000 rupees ($22) per day for every 50kg (110lbs) collected. This is more than double the 700 to 900 rupees ($8-$10) paid normally to unskilled labourers in India.</p><p>The production of fox nuts was limited to 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) of land in 2010, and farmers were paid 81 rupees ($0.90) per kilogramme, he said. Now, about 40,000 (99,000 acres) hectares of land are being used to cultivate fox nuts, while farmers get 450 rupees ($5) per kilogramme.</p><p>“The tariffs won’t hurt us, as the demand is increasing globally,” said Satyajit, from Shakti Sudha Agro Ventures.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands of French soldiers were stationed in several African nations, including the three Sahel countries, while Niger hosted nearly 1,000 US soldiers and was the site of the largest drone base in Africa. US forces withdrew from Niger last year.</p><p>After snapping ties with their Western partners, the military leaders from the Sahel countries turned to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/25/the-us-and-russias-proxy-war-is-bleeding-africa\">Russia</a> amid an increasingly vulnerable security situation.</p><p>Bamako is now collaborating with Russian forces, with about 1,500 personnel from the Wagner mercenary group initially, and since June, roughly 1,000 fighters from the Kremlin-controlled paramilitary group Africa Corps.</p><p>Russian soldiers are also present, though in smaller numbers, in Burkina Faso and Niger.</p><p>On the apparent contradiction of allowing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/is-mali-about-to-fall-to-al-qaeda-affiliate-jnim\">Russian mercenaries</a> to operate on their soil while claiming independence from foreign influence, analyst Ulf Laessing says it is a message from the military-run nations to the West with whom they would like to “work less”.</p><p>“They don’t mind working with Russia, and all three countries have bought drones from Turkey,” Laessing, Sahel analyst at Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung, noted.</p><p>“China also delivers weapons to some countries, so that’s a message against the West.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, says Russia is less likely to interfere in their “domestic politics”.</p><p>“On the other hand, Western partners often condition interventions with what they see as democratic practices aligning with the Western world,” he said.</p><p>Several Western nations, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union, imposed targeted sanctions, aid suspensions, and visa restrictions on the three Sahel nations in response to their respective military coups.</p><p>But the reliance on Russian forces has not helped improve the security situation, analyst Laessing says.</p><p>“Since the Russians arrived in Mali, the security situation has worsened because they don’t distinguish between fighters and civilians,” he said, pointing to human rights reports which have accused Russian forces of grave abuses.</p><p>Analyst Lyammouri says while Russian mercenaries might have helped the military recapture the city of Kidal and parts of northern Mali from Tuareg rebels, they have struggled to make any improvements when it comes to fighting against “violent extremist groups”.</p><p>“They don’t only continue to pose a real threat and carry [out] almost daily attacks but also expanded into new geographical areas in southern and western parts of Mali.”</p><h2 id=\"which-armed-groups-are-operating-in-burkina-faso-mali-and-niger\">Which armed groups are operating in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger?</h2><p>The three countries have for more than a decade battled armed groups, including some linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL, as well as separatists.</p><p>The most influential group is Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda-linked coalition formed in 2017. The JNIM is deeply entrenched in central and northern Mali, has expanded across much of Burkina Faso, and now operates in western Niger as well.</p><p>Another leading group is the ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), also known as the ISIL affiliate in the Sahel Province (ISSP).</p><p>ISGS is particularly active in eastern Mali, western Niger and parts of northern and eastern Burkina Faso, especially in the tri-border zone. It has carried out large-scale assaults on military bases and villages.</p><p>Among other actors is the Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), a Tuareg-led separatist movement operating in northern Mali. Formed in 2024 after a merger with other groups such as the Tuareg National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), it has launched attacks against both Malian and Russian forces.</p><p>The roots of the conflict date back to 2012, when the MNLA group – fighting for an independent state of Azawad – captured parts of northern Mali, but their control over the territory was short-lived.</p><p>The security chaos of 2012 coincided with a coup in Bamako, creating a power vacuum in the north. This vacuum enabled al-Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine to seize territory from Tuareg rebels, triggering military intervention from France in 2013.</p><p>Ansar Dine, along with several other armed groups, merged to form the JNIM.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-main-challenges-facing-all-three-states\">What are the main challenges facing all three states?</h2><p>According to analyst Lyammouri, all three countries face “major security challenges”. He said, “The dynamics of the overall conflict might differ from one country to another.”</p><p>Moreover, the conflict has led to economic challenges for the landlocked nations, Lyammouri added, noting, for example, that JNIM has put up blockades around the main roads since September.</p><p>JNIM has been targeting fuel tankers, particularly those coming from Senegal and the Ivory Coast, through which the majority of Mali’s imported goods transit.</p><p>“This demonstrates the vulnerabilities of Mali’s economy relying solely on traffic from coastal states without any other alternatives,” he said, adding that it remains diplomatically isolated from the West and regional bloc Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p><p>“Tensions with these countries have isolated AES states further and put them under social pressure as the prices of goods increase and access to basic goods becomes a struggle for the local population,” he added.</p><p>On whether the joint battalion is likely to succeed, Laessing said the security challenges are “so complex”. “Anyone would struggle to contain this threat,” he said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, you need negotiations, you need a political solution … a military force alone might help a bit, but it won’t solve the conflict.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This film explores how assimilation became a method of rule and a source of resistance.</p><p>At the heart of French colonial rule was the mission “civilisatrice”, a doctrine that claimed to lift up colonised societies through education, administration and the French language. In practice, this system sought to reshape colonised people’s identities, loyalties and cultures, replacing local traditions with French norms while maintaining strict political and economic control. Schools, legal systems and bureaucracies became tools of empire as powerful as armies.</p><p>Through case studies in Algeria, Indochina and West Africa, the documentary shows how colonial administrations operated on the ground. In Algeria, settler colonialism and mass repression led to war. In Indochina, education and bureaucracy coexisted with exploitation and nationalist resistance. In West Africa, language policy and indirect rule reshaped social hierarchies and governance.</p><p>This episode examines how resistance movements challenged the promise of civilisation, forcing France to confront the contradictions at the heart of its empire. Anticolonial struggles, intellectual movements and armed uprisings not only weakened imperial rule but reshaped French politics, culture and identity itself.</p><p>The documentary also places French colonial strategies in a broader modern context. In the contemporary world, the United States projects influence less through formal empire and more through soft power. Hollywood cinema, television and digital platforms circulate American values, lifestyles and narratives globally, shaping cultural imagination in ways that echo earlier imperial projects. At the same time, US dominance in higher education, academic publishing and institutional standards helps define what knowledge is valued, taught and legitimised worldwide.</p><p>It also draws direct connections between French colonialism and the modern world. Contemporary debates over language, immigration, secularism and inequality are deeply rooted in colonial systems designed to classify, discipline and extract. Many modern state institutions, education models and economic relationships reflect structures first imposed under empire.</p><p>By tracing how cultural control, education and administration functioned as instruments of power, the documentary reveals how the legacy of French colonialism continues to shape modern capitalism, global inequality and postcolonial relations today.</p><p> </p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 24 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">24 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

It says Washington is seeking to overthrow its president, Nicolas Maduro, to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves, the largest in the world.</p><p class=\"p1\">Since September, US forces have launched dozens of air strikes on boats that Washington alleges were transporting drugs. It has yet to provide evidence for those accusations. More than 100 people have been killed.</p><h2 id=\"us-congress-should-intervene\" class=\"p1\">‘US Congress should intervene’</h2><p class=\"p1\">“These killings amount to violations of the right to life. They must be investigated and those responsible held accountable,” the experts said.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Meanwhile, the US Congress should intervene to prevent further attacks and lift the blockade,” they added.</p><p class=\"p1\">They called on countries to take measures to stop the blockade and illegal killings and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p><p class=\"p1\">The four who signed the joint statement are: Ben Saul, special rapporteur on protecting human rights while countering “terrorism”; George Katrougalos, an expert on promoting a democratic and equitable international order; development expert Surya Deva; and Gina Romero, special rapporteur on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p></div></div></body></html>"
