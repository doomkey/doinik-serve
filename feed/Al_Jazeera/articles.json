Overwhelmed by the war, the serviceman craves intimacy, and within days, the woman persuades him to get married.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Elated after a short honeymoon, he gets back to his military unit, but instead of congratulating him, the officer sends him on a mission he never returns from.</p><p>The nascent widow promptly cashes “the coffin money”, between 5 and 10 million rubles ($64,000-127,000) – and splits it with the officer, who has already found her another “fiance”.</p><p>“It’s a real business,” a Donetsk resident told Al Jazeera, explaining an alleged scheme that has also been reported by Ukrainian and exiled Russian media last year.</p><p>The resident spoke on condition of anonymity because anyone interviewed by foreign media risks reprisal.</p><h2 id=\"drugs-and-stolen-arms\">Drugs and stolen arms</h2><p>But this is just one of the ways fast money can be made in the Russia-occupied part of Donetsk – about four-fifths of the rustbelt region the size of Albania, dotted with dozens of mines and factories.</p><p>The presence of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers creates a bonanza for some locals.</p><p>Undersupplied Russian servicemen spend part of their monthly pay of several thousand dollars on flak jackets, tactical boots and other gear.</p><p>Restaurants, shops selling alcohol, underground brothels and casinos are booming, according to Ukrainian officials and media reports – along with a black market for drugs, especially amphetamines and crystal meth that help soldiers stay awake and overcome fear and boredom.</p><p>There is another black market – of stolen weaponry, from pistols and assault rifles to explosives and even grenade launchers, according to dozens of Russian court records that often name Chechen servicemen as mastermind contrabandists.</p><p>The market dates back to 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists carved out two “People’s Republics” in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk.</p><p>In 2022, Moscow declared their annexation along with two more Ukrainian regions, even though none of them are 100 percent occupied.</p><p>But Donetsk and Luhansk – known collectively as Donbas – still keep the vestiges of “independence” such as a “head of state”, a “parliament”, border checkpoints and customs offices.</p><h2 id=\"militarising-the-economy\">‘Militarising the economy’</h2><p>Moscow’s reasons are simple, according to the head of the Strategic Research and Security Institute, a Kyiv-based think tank.</p><p>“They need to create a militarised springboard that is not on Russian territory,” Pavel Lisyanskiy told Al Jazeera. “They militarise the economy, there’s fewer and fewer people, it will be a huge military base to frighten Europe.”</p><p>However, Moscow “is no longer ashamed to just dispatch its appointees” who control the economy despite occasional objections from separatists, Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Moscow is not ceremonious with them, jailing and assassinating the most disobedient ones, Fesenko said.</p><p>Ukrainian officials and media reports have claimed that Moscow had several separatist <a href=\"/news/2022/4/22/reporters-notebook-how-donbas-evolved-under-separatists\">strongmen killed</a>, and several more have been forced out and jailed in Russia.</p><h2 id=\"everyone-s-in-jail\">‘Everyone’s in jail’</h2><p>Moscow has poured billions of dollars into construction projects in the Donbas, where entire cities such as Avdiivka or Bakhmut have nearly been razed to the ground, and dozens of plants and factories cannot possibly be restored.</p><p>“Unfeasible” was the word Donetsk’s “head” Denis Pushilin used in September when describing the rebuilding of the colossal Azovstal and Ilych steel plants in the southern city of Mariupol.</p><p>The plants once churned out two-fifths of Ukraine’s steel that contributed 0.6 percent to the nation’s gross domestic product.</p><p>Instead, Pushilin said, new resorts will be built in their stead near the Sea of Azov, which is favoured by tourists with little children because of its shallow waters with next to no waves.</p><p>But the construction boom goes hand in hand with corruption.</p><p>Under Ukraine, it was “controllable”, analyst Fesenko said. “But after 2014, a big redistribution began, and criminal wars added to the corruption.”</p><p>In November, Donetsk’s “deputy construction minister”, Yulia Mervaezova, was charged with embezzling 9 billion rubles ($115m), and the amount “will probably go up”, prosecutors reportedly said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donetsk residents use rainwater and melted snow for drinking because of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/ticking-environmental-bomb-water-crisis-worsens-in-russia-annexed-donbas\">catastrophic water shortages</a> caused by the destruction of a sophisticated water supply system.</p><p>A pipeline drawing water from southwestern Russia cannot provide nearly enough, but no construction company wants to build a second pipeline because of corruption risks, a top official admitted.</p><p>“Nobody wants to approach [the second pipeline], because everyone who built the first one is in jail,” Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said in November.</p><p>The unveiling of construction projects “has become a tool of political theatre and elite enrichment rather than genuine efforts at recovery”, according to analysis by the Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington, DC, published in December. “This approach prioritises political visibility and control over genuine reconstruction.”</p><p>Russia’s federal budget can no longer foot the bills – and Moscow forced some 40 Russian regions to “sponsor” the construction of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and roads in occupied Ukrainian cities, towns and districts.</p><p>“Sponsor regions play the key role in the region’s restoration and development,” Donetsk’s “construction minister” Vladimir Dubovka said in January 2025.</p><p>The regions also dispatch thousands of teachers, health professionals and construction workers to the Donbas.</p><p>The city of Moscow “sponsors” the regional centres of Donetsk and Luhansk, St Petersburg – Mariupol, while the town of Shakhtarsk is “supervised” by the resource-rich Pacific island of Sakhalin.</p><p>The “sponsors” often find the money by ignoring their own needs.</p><p>As the northwestern Arkhangelsk region paid for the rebuilding of occupied Melitopol, its administration reportedly turned a blind eye to the plight and pleas of residents of several apartment buildings that stood on concrete stilts nailed in permafrost, which thawed because of global warming.</p><h2 id=\"irreversible-consequences\">‘Irreversible consequences’</h2><p>Donbas has some of the world’s richest coal mines, including ones with coking coal necessary for steel making.</p><p>It also boasts deposits of iron ore, lithium, graphite, manganese, nickel, titanium, rare earths and noble gas neon used in chip-making.</p><p>But the renewed and so far limited extraction of minerals is “barbaric”, analyst Lisyanskiy said.</p><p>Last year, half a dozen small water bodies disappeared because of tectonic fissures caused by irresponsible mining, he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaining rivulets, lakes and groundwater in Donbas are contaminated by chemical waste as safety standards are routinely snubbed.</p><p>“The consequences are irreversible, it’s not even a hundred years, believe me,” said Lisyanskiy, who spent years working as a mine engineer in the Donbas region.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Saturday, just under two weeks into the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">protests that are now sweeping Iran</a>, United States President Donald Trump took to his social media platform of choice to post a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115872214156165257\">message of support</a>: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.”</p><p>As usual, Trump’s random capitalisation scheme and excessive use of exclamation points would better befit an elementary schoolchild than the leader of the global superpower. But the promise of American help is also problematic in far more significant ways.</p><p>For starters, “help” is not exactly a specialty of the US – and particularly not under the guidance of the man who <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/22/by-bombing-iran-the-us-continues-to-make-the-world-safe-for-war\">bombed Iran</a> just last summer, right after returning to power on a pledge to keep the US out of foreign wars.</p><p>Trump is furthermore responsible for maintaining a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">crippling sanctions regime</a> against the Islamic Republic, thereby fuelling the high inflation that triggered the present protests in the first place. As is par for the course in such forms of economic warfare, the nonelite of Iran have paid the highest price.</p><p>In addition to constituting a departure from his whole “America First” premise, Trump’s recent offer of “help” to the Iranians marks a shift in presidential rhetoric vis-a-vis the much-maligned country. Previously, the Trumpian discourse mainly targeted Iran’s alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles equipped with chemical and biological warheads – all of which were marketed as a dangerous threat not only to the US but also to America’s BFF and current regional <a href=\"/opinions/2024/5/9/give-or-take-a-few-bombs-us-complicity-in-genocide-remains-ironclad\">partner in genocide</a>, the state of Israel.</p><p>Now, however, Trump is in “rescue” mode, <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2007082423121748269\">warning</a> this month that “if Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/trump-cancels-iran-meetings-urges-protesters-to-take-over-institutions\">assured</a> Iranian protesters that “help is on the way” without elaborating as to what this might consist of. Right-wing US media have pitched in with such encouraging <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-historic-chance-help-topple-irans-america-hating-regime\">headlines</a> as “Trump has historic chance to help topple Iran’s America-hating regime.”</p><p>For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has chimed in with the affirmation that Israel supports the Iranian protesters’ “struggle for freedom and firmly condemns the mass killings of innocent civilians” – quite the statement from someone who has been presiding over the genocide of Palestinians for more than two years.</p><p>With his recent promises of assistance, one can’t help but wonder if Trump isn’t taking a page from the old playbook of former US President <a href=\"/opinions/2022/5/22/george-w-bush-is-not-funny\">George W Bush</a>, the ex-“war on terror” chief and the face of an administration that was dedicated to propagating the very <a href=\"/news/2021/9/10/decades-after-9-11-what-became-of-the-uss\">neo-conservative ideology</a> to which Trump has long ostensibly been so vehemently opposed.</p><p>In essence, the neo-con objective is to wreak military havoc throughout the world using democracy promotion and other superficially nice ideas as an excuse for deadly imperial expansion. And while Trump successfully wooed many US voters with his alleged commitment to abandoning such pursuits in far-off lands in favour of total self-absorption and “making America great again”, it seems the neo-conservative impulse is hard to kick.</p><p>To be sure, Trump’s presidency recalls Bush’s in more ways than one. Both men possess clownish demeanours – not to mention an intriguing relationship with English grammar and spelling – that would be entirely amusing if not for the extensive bloodshed over which they have respectively presided.</p><p>Likewise, both men have proven disproportionately eager to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/2/did-god-want-trump-to-bomb-iran\">invoke God</a> as an ally in their destructive endeavours.</p><p>Despite Trump’s professed opposition to the policy of regime change and the Bush-era interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan – part of a “war on terror” that ultimately left <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/31/here-is-to-a-quarter-century-of-us-military-havoc\">millions of people dead</a> – he has in his first year back in office managed to bomb an assortment of nations as well as <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">kidnap the president of Venezuela</a>, Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Florida Congressman Randy Fine, who has just <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/florida-congressman-files-bill-let-155609049.html\">introduced a bill</a> that would permit Trump to annex Greenland, has also taken to X to <a href=\"https://x.com/RepFine/status/2011105866389602514\">propose</a> that “Maybe we should Maduro Khamenei.” In this case, “Khamenei” refers to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei while “Maduro” functions as a brand-new verb for abducting the leader of a sovereign state.</p><p>But as Trump now promises that the US is “ready to help!!!” Iran, it’s worth thinking back on other instances of American “help!!!” in the country – like that time in 1953 that the CIA engineered a coup d’etat against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, which set the stage for the long reign of the torture-happy shah of Iran, who was finally overthrown by the Iranian Revolution in 1979.</p><p>The late shah’s son, it so happens, is now conveniently agitating for US intervention from his position of <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/reza-pahlavi-selling-his-royal-residence-in-potomac-maryland-for-3-1m/\">gilded exile</a> outside Washington, DC.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump may have caught on to the perks of “helping” people in other countries as a means of distracting from certain antidemocratic realities at home – among them that the US has been converted into a <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/20/trumps-big-beautiful-police-state-is-here\">full-fledged police state</a> where immigration agents feel free <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/us-woman-killed-by-ice-agent-called-domestic-terrorist-what-it-means\">to murder US citizens</a> at will.</p><p>And as Trump continues semi-channeling Bush, pretty much the last thing Iranians need is for the US to “come to their rescue”.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Since then, however, they have escalated into a broader challenge to the country’s clerical leadership, which has been in power since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump took to social media to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">tell protesters</a> in Iran that help was “on its way”, prompting speculation that US intervention in the country could be imminent.</p><p>But if Washington does intervene in Iran, what options does it have, and how feasible are they?</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, Trump wrote: “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP”.</p><p>“MIGA” refers to “Make Iran Great Again” – a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.</p><p>The US president did not expand on what form this “help” would take.</p><p>However, on January 2, Trump wrote on Truth Social that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue”. He added: “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-trump-administration-said\">What has the Trump administration said?</h2><p>On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that while diplomacy remained Trump’s first option for Iran, he is “unafraid to use the lethal force and might of the United States military if and when he deems that necessary”.</p><p>“Air strikes would be one of the many, many options that are on the table for the commander-in-chief,” Leavitt said. As president of the US, Trump is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p><p>“He’s made it quite clear he certainly doesn’t want to see people being killed in the streets of Tehran, and unfortunately, that’s something we’re seeing right now.”</p><p>Referring to Trump’s use of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-nuclear-sites-how-big-are-radiation-risks\">military force</a> in Iran, Leavitt said: “Nobody knows that better than Iran.”</p><p>In June 2025, during Iran’s 12-day war with Israel, the US bombed <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/6/23/live-iran-vows-to-respond-to-us-attacks-trump-hints-at-regime-change\">three Iranian nuclear sites</a> at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan following more than a week of Israeli strikes on Tehran’s military and nuclear sites. The 12-day war between Iran and Israel lasted from June 13 to June 24.</p><p>However, the situation now is not the same as it was in June last year. The US military presence has since decreased in the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-the-us-military-presence-decreased\">Why has the US military presence decreased?</h2><p>The USS Gerald Ford, the US Navy aircraft carrier and the world’s largest warship, left Norfolk, Virginia, on June 24 and was deployed to the Mediterranean near the Middle East, allowing Washington to showcase its military posture in the region during the 12-day war.</p><p>However, the USS Gerald Ford has now been sent to the Caribbean as part of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) for Operation Southern Spear, which has been building off the coast of Latin America since November.</p><p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that operation was launched to target alleged <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/us-claims-it-strikes-two-boats-carrying-narcotics-in-pacific-killing-six\">“narco-terrorists”</a> in Latin America. US strikes have been carried out at least 30 times on Venezuelan boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, which the US alleges were carrying drugs, although it has provided no evidence of this.</p><p>On January 3, US forces abducted Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/what-is-the-us-charging-nicolas-maduro-with\">Nicolas Maduro</a>, whom the Trump administration describes as a narco-terrorist. He currently faces charges related to weapons and drug trafficking in New York.</p><p>It would take about 10 days for the USS Gerald Ford to travel between the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, according to estimates in an October 2025 analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) carried out before the warship’s deployment to Latin America. This is if it travels 20 knots on average, which is 37km/h (23mph).</p><p>Based on the CSIS numbers, it would likely take the Ford another week to travel from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf, and the coast of Iran.</p><p>Besides the Ford, the US has moved its associated strike group vessels out of the Mediterranean Sea, primarily to the Caribbean Sea as well. As a result, the US strike power in the Middle East is currently significantly smaller than it was in June.</p><h2 id=\"what-military-presence-does-the-us-have-in-the-middle-east\">What military presence does the US have in the Middle East?</h2><p>Despite the relocation of its warships, the US does still operate a broad network of military sites, both permanent and temporary, in at least <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/mapping-us-troops-and-military-bases-in-the-middle-east\">19 locations</a> in the Middle East. This has remained the same between June and now.</p><p>Of these, eight are permanent bases in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>According to unnamed diplomats quoted by the Reuters news agency, some personnel have been instructed to leave the US military’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday, but it is unclear for what reason. Al Udeid is the Middle East’s largest US base, and it houses 10,000 troops. During the 12-day war, Iran launched <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/the-12-day-war-ended-with-an-attack-on-qatar-why-didnt-it-escalate\">an attack</a> on the Al Udeid base.</p><p>“It’s a posture change and not an ordered evacuation,” one of the diplomats told Reuters, adding he’s not aware of any specific reason for the move.</p><p>This was after US B‑2 stealth bombers dropped 14 “bunker buster” bombs on at least two Iranian nuclear sites. The US still has the military capacity to do this.</p><h2 id=\"could-the-us-target-the-leadership-in-iran\">Could the US target the leadership in Iran?</h2><p>“Trump favours short, sharp operations with minimal risk to US troops,” Shahram Akbarzadeh, a professor of Middle East and Central Asian politics at Australia’s Deakin University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He cited the recent <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/abduction_n?tl=true\">abduction</a> of Maduro from Venezuela and the US assassination of <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/who-was-qassem-soleimani-irans-irgcs-quds-force-leader\">Qassem Soleimani</a>, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) elite Quds Force, in a drone attack in Baghdad, Iraq, in 2020.</p><p>“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post back in June, referring to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><p>“He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”</p><p>Akbarzadeh said since Trump has already suggested he could take out the Iranian supreme leader, that could be a possibility, but Trump will have to “be prepared for the inevitable backlash”.</p><p>“If the supreme leader is eliminated in a plan to decapitate the Islamic regime, the IRGC is the most likely player to step into the void and take control. That would not be a good outcome for the US, and I suspect the Trump administration is mindful of that possibility,” Akbarzadeh said. However, he added that the tide of support of the people would be unlikely to turn towards the leadership if the supreme leader is targeted, as the clerical regime is unpopular.</p><p>If the IRGC were to take control, Iran would likely move from a theocratic republic hybrid to overt military rule, Akbarzadeh said. It would likely be even more opposed to Washington than the current clerical leadership. The IRGC is also more likely to retaliate against a US strike.</p><p>Experts say it is unlikely the US will carry out an operation in Iran similar to the one in Venezuela, which resulted in the abduction of Maduro.</p><p>“The logistics of doing something like the operation in Venezuela are too difficult in Iran. The distance that US helicopters have to fly is much greater, and the Iranian security is already on alert – in case Trump attempts something like that,” said Akbarzadeh.</p><p>“Iran may think that the US may hope that a targeted strike would eliminate the supreme leader or a number of key leaders, and then the US would try to force what is left of the Islamic republic to do what the leader refuses to do on nuclear or missile issues,” said Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>“Their reading of Venezuela is that the US … wants to change the game in Iran, but that the US is not about to invade Iran with troops, and the US is not necessarily looking for regime change and nation-building of the kind we saw in Iraq or Afghanistan.”</p><h2 id=\"is-a-ground-invasion-possible\">Is a ground invasion possible?</h2><p>Experts say it is unlikely that Washington would send troops to Iran.</p><p>“Trump is not a nation builder. He does not believe in long-term commitments or building democracy. Remember, he gave up on Afghanistan. So he is not going to commit to boots on the ground in Iran. It is simply too costly,” Akbarzadeh said.</p><p>Under Trump, the US has moved decisively towards ending its long war in Afghanistan, which began in 2001.</p><p>In 2020, during Trump’s first term, US officials and Taliban representatives signed the <a href=\"/news/2020/2/29/afghanistans-taliban-us-sign-agreement-aimed-at-ending-war\">Doha agreement</a> after months of negotiations in Qatar, to end the war. The actual withdrawal of troops took place in 2021, during the presidency of Joe Biden.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He stressed that these children did not die merely from the cold but also because a “man-made shortage” of food and medicine has left them with zero resilience.</p><p>“Children aged two or three have severely weakened immune systems,” Elder told Al Jazeera, describing the situation as “extreme misery”.</p><p>“We are talking about layers upon layers of rejection [of aid],” he added, noting that Israel continues to block the entry of cooking gas and fuel needed for heating, leaving families defenceless against winds that weather experts said exceeded 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>‘Expendable lives’</strong></h2><p>When asked about the lack of humanitarian response and Israel’s move to cut ties with UN agencies during such a crisis, Albanese was blunt.</p><p>“Israel generally does not care about Palestinian lives. On the contrary, it finds them expendable and [believes they] can be destroyed,” she said.</p><p>She argued that the international community is complicit by focusing on other global conflicts while ignoring the “genocide” that has left Gaza’s population exposed to the elements without homes, electricity or drainage systems.</p><p>“What more do we need to see? What have we not seen yet?” she asked.</p><h2><strong>Call for arms embargo</strong></h2><p>Albanese insisted that sending aid, which is often blocked, is no longer a sufficient response to such catastrophes. She called for immediate punitive measures against Israel to force a change in its policy.</p><p>“States must cut trade ties, impose an embargo on arms exports and stop normal dealings with Israel,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She emphasised that the “starting point” for any solution must be the International Court of Justice advisory opinion ordering the dismantling of the occupation rather than political plans that ignore the reality on the ground.</p><h2><strong>‘Winds like a tropical storm’</strong></h2><p>The vulnerability of the population was highlighted by Khaled Saleh, a senior weather presenter at Al Jazeera.</p><p>He explained that the depression brought polar winds reaching speeds typically associated with tropical storms.</p><p>“These winds can uproot trees, … so imagine what they do to worn-out tents,” Saleh said, noting that the lack of infrastructure meant water had nowhere to go but into the shelters of displaced Palestinians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

So I am told that it has the ear of the government, because that’s a good chunk of the electorate. And the community of mothers on Mumsnet crosses divisions of class, faith, ethnicity.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This campaign is about mothers for mothers. The situation being endured by mothers in Gaza is unimaginably brutal and horrific.</p><p>We want to galvanise the mums of Great Britain to speak up for the mums of Gaza through their communities, one of which – and probably the most powerful – is Mumsnet. Many people express the desire and need to do something in relation to the suffering they see in Gaza and across the occupied territories, but they don’t know what or how. This campaign is something they can join with if they want to.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: As a mother yourself, how has it felt watching the genocide unfold?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> Honestly, unspeakable. Sometimes I feel beside myself.</p><p>Everybody in the world loves their children in the same way. Palestinian parents love their children just as much as we do. How can our politicians sit back and watch what these parents are enduring? And watch the unimaginable suffering being inflicted on children?</p><p>There are more child <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/amputees-from-israels-gaza-war-use-homemade-prosthetics-to-re-enter-life\">amputees</a> now in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/gaza-babies-suffering-from-severe-cold-as-israel-keeps-blocking-aid-msf\">Gaza</a> than in any other time or place in history. There are many children who have <a href=\"/video/quotable/2024/11/17/gaza-children-with-no-family-left-just-wandering-the\">lost all their family</a>, young children without parents or family left. There are parents who have no children left. There are pregnant <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/mothers-children-suffer-israels-engineered-starvation-in-gaza\">mothers</a> who are starving, giving birth to premature and very underweight babies who struggle to survive. Most of Gaza’s healthcare system has been destroyed, and where hospitals are still functioning, they do so with a chronic lack of equipment and medicines. There are minimal resources for <a href=\"/news/2025/1/28/five-babies-in-incubator-hrw-on-danger-to-pregnant-women-babies-in-gaza\">maternal and neonatal care</a>. The infant mortality rate has leapt up by 75 percent, and miscarriages by 300 percent.</p><p>Any mother in the world seeing this situation would be haunted and horrified, I think. I would hope so.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: For many years, you’ve protested for the rights of Palestinians. What’s behind your activism, something that, as we have seen, comes with risk to careers?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I learned about the situation of the Palestinian people many years ago. It struck me from the very first as a narrative of extreme injustice. My husband is Jewish and his mum, my beloved mother-in-law, was a refugee from Hitler’s Vienna [Austria was annexed by the Nazis in 1938 and liberated in 1945].</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235596\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235596\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-07-25T184809Z_844985804_RC2UTFA45MHC_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-BRITAIN-PROTEST-1768305750.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1155&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"British actor Juliet Stevenson attends a pro-Palestinian protest outside Downing Street, a demonstration featuring the banging of pots and pans to honour the Palestinians shot while queuing for food in Gaza, in London, Britain, July 25, 2025.

But as many, many Jews are now saying, what the Israeli government is doing now, what has been perpetrated on the Palestinian people since <a href=\"/news/2022/5/15/nakba-mapping-palestinian-villages-destroyed-by-israel-in-1948\">1948</a>, was never a just or wise solution. The UK is <a href=\"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/balfour-masterminds/index.html\">deeply implicated</a> in those historical events.</p><p>I read Edward Said and other Palestinian writers, and I read Israeli writers … I’m concerned with the safety and security of Israeli citizens, too. The brutality lashed out against Gaza and the occupied territories serves nobody in the region.</p><p>As for careers, my career – I honestly feel that if people don’t want to work with me because they don’t like what I’m saying about this, then I don’t think I want to work with them. And if they’re going to punish me for my belief system, then I probably don’t belong there. And most importantly, I don’t think my career is more important than the lives of Palestinian children. I really, really don’t.</p><p>And when I come to the end of my life, whenever that is, I want to be able to look back at my life and say I hope I did the right thing at the right time.</p><p>Of course, I want to go on working as an actor; I love the work. And I need my platform and my profile to be able to be effective – that’s important, too. But I haven’t yet felt that I’ve been penalised for activism – I’ve never worked as hard or as much as I did last year. So I’m optimistic that there are enough people in the industry who don’t want to punish me for this, and who feel the same.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the muted response to the genocide in Gaza from usually outspoken characters in the arts or feminists who speak up about oppression in other regions of the world?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I’m painfully disappointed by the silence in my industry, by the silence everywhere. I’m dismayed by how people are allowing the bullying into silence to be effective – by their yielding to that power. At this point in the genocide, silence is not a passive act. It’s active – it’s a decision to collude.</p><p>We look back at Germany at the time of the Holocaust, and we harshly judge those who didn’t speak out against that barbarism, and we admire those who did. But what about the current genocide? Why do we so often look back at history and assess it in that way, but we don’t bring those judgements to bear on the world we’re living in now?</p><p>I do wish more leading figures in the arts, and more arts and cultural institutions, would engage with what is happening in Palestine and use their voices and influence. It’s our job, isn’t it, to reflect the human condition, human experience? If we’re not doing that in relation to the genocide, then I don’t know what we are doing, really.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Several British actors over the years, yourself included and Vanessa Redgrave, have criticised Israeli policy that disregards Palestinian rights. Has the space for speaking up become more restrictive in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I’d like to acknowledge Vanessa’s astonishing legacy of always speaking out and always fighting for human rights. She’s been a really inspiring person in our industry doing that. And I would also like to acknowledge the voice and the actions of many young people in my industry now – not famous or with high profile, but who are really engaged and tirelessly support the Stop the War movement, and who call for humanity and action. It takes bravery – as it does in <a href=\"/news/2024/3/11/hollywood-stars-wear-red-pin-badges-at-the-oscars-what-does-it-mean\">Hollywood</a>, where a few have stood up and spoken out. I’m so grateful that they found the courage. … But most people have not.</p><p>There was a great wave of public support that grew during last summer. My great fear now is that it’s subsiding again – the illusion of the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/2/the-ceasefire-did-what-it-was-meant-to-do-make-gaza-invisible\">so-called “ceasefire”</a> has taken hold – when in fact there has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/israeli-quadcopter-kills-three-in-gazas-khan-younis-police-chief-slain\">no ceasefire</a> [and] much of the mainstream media colludes. There is, in addition, so much distraction in the news because of world events elsewhere …  and then of course there is the power of <a href=\"/video/money-works/2025/11/26/whats-the-price-tag-on-israels-propaganda-machine\">Israel’s propaganda machine</a>, which is immense and far-reaching.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What propels you to keep going?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> It’s vitally important to keep Palestine conscious in people’s minds – to sustain its presence in the media. To keep the movement for peace and justice alive and energised.</p><p>My values have shifted, my community of friendships has partly shifted, my work and general interests have shifted. Much has changed for me in relation to this. A lot of the people I spend time with now are people who are in this community, and who will not give up hope. My mantra in life is one that I adopted when I was very young – “Despair is a luxury we cannot afford.”</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Does your family join your activism?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> My husband Hugh [Brody], though not religious, feels his Jewish identity very deeply. Our children identify as Jewish. And we have many Jewish friends, but all of them are appalled by what’s happening. Most of them would adhere strongly to those who are saying “<a href=\"/features/2023/10/23/not-in-my-name-the-european-jews-condemning-israels-war-on-gaza\">Not in my name</a>”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235576\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235576\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235576\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8700-1768305299.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Courtesy Juliet Stevenson\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4235576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Juliet Stevenson pictured with her husband, the writer and anthropologist Hugh Brody [Courtesy: Juliet Stevenson</figcaption></figure><p>This insistence by the government of Israel that to criticise Israel is anti-Semitic, this eliding of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism, is not only ludicrous – what government in the world is beyond criticism? – but it’s very, very dangerous for Jewish people. Because if you say that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, then it means that all Jews are somehow implicated in what Israel’s doing. Which is palpably very far from the truth – and feeds the real and abhorrent currents of genuine anti-Semitism in the world.</p><p>Hugh is a writer and an anthropologist, less inclined to be collective. But for a while now, he has gone on the Saturday marches and walked with the Holocaust group. He has committed to that community.</p><p>I am relieved and very strengthened by that and by the support of our children. It would be very painful and difficult if we were not of like mind in this.</p><p><em><strong>Note: This interview was lightly edited for brevity.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
