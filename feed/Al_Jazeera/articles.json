Syria’s Ministry of Interior said on Tuesday that 130 of 200 ISIL escapees had been recaptured.</p><p>The ministry accused the SDF of releasing ISIL fighters from the prison in the northeastern city of al-Shaddadi as a form of “political and security blackmail”. The army said it deliberately bypassed al‑Shaddadi prison in line with an agreement that the SDF would later hand control of the facility to authorities in Damascus.</p><p>The SDF has blamed the Syrian army for the prison break, saying it “lost control” of the jail after an attack by tribal fighters affiliated with the army.</p><p>SDF commander Fawza Youssef on Tuesday blamed al-Sharaa’s government for failing to uphold the deal.</p><p>“There is no political will on the part of the government to implement a ceasefire,” he told Al Jazeera. “If the violations and attacks continue, the SDF cannot be disarmed.”</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syria-announces-ceasefire-agreement-with-kurd-led-sdf-after-heavy-fighting\">agreement reached on Sunday</a> between al-Sharaa and Abdi stipulates the withdrawal of the SDF from Raqqa and Deir Az Zor, parts of which are east of the Euphrates, within a month.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Interior Ministry accused the SDF of “trying to deflect blame” as it faced internal divisions.</p><p>“We prefer peaceful solutions, but all options are open,” the spokesperson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The deal included the SDF’s withdrawal from the area around the al-Aqtan prison. As it appeared on the verge of collapse, Al Jazeera correspondents on Tuesday reported that the Syrian army had begun artillery shelling around the prison and the SDF’s 17th Division headquarters in Raqqa.</p><p>Local sources in Hasakah province in the northeast said the army reached the Panorama intersection, located at the southern entrance to the provincial capital, also called Hasakah.</p><p>The Interior Ministry said it was ready to take over the management and security of ISIL prisons in Hasakah in accordance with international standards.</p><p>Information Minister Hamza Mustafa said the army secured the city of al-Shaddadi in the Hasakah countryside after taking control of the prison located there.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"taking-control-of-isil-prisons\">Taking control of ISIL prisons</h2><p>The SDF, the United States-backed force that fought ISIL in Syria, controls more than a dozen prisons in the northeast, where about 9,000 ISIL members have been held for years without trial.</p><p>While al-Sharaa’s government has pledged to reunify Syria after nearly 14 years of war, the SDF has repeatedly underlined al-Sharaa’s previous affiliation with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly part of al-Qaeda.</p><p>In a statement on Monday, the SDF referred to the government as “ISIS sympathizers, whose actions are directed and orchestrated by the Turkish state,” and pledged to respond in a similar manner to the <a href=\"/news/2014/10/7/street-battles-as-isil-enters-syrias-kobane\">battle to capture Kobane in 2014</a>.</p><p>“Today we reaffirm that the will of the people is stronger than all forms of aggression and occupation,” the statement said.</p><p>The Syrian government responded by rejecting “any attempt to use the issue of terrorism as a tool for political or security blackmail”.</p><p>“The insistence on linking the actions of law enforcement and the restoration of state legitimacy with the danger of activating terrorist cells constitutes a blatant attempt to distort the facts and fuel the conflict in order to maintain an authority that was imposed by force of arms,” it said in a statement.</p><p>“The Syrian government warns the SDF leadership against taking any reckless steps that would facilitate the escape of ISIS detainees or open prisons for them as a retaliatory measure or as a political pressure tactic.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Aleppo, said the army accused the SDF of releasing the detainees while the SDF said their escape was due to their forces being overwhelmed by attacks.</p><p>A video that emerged overnight also alleged to show the execution of female Kurdish fighters. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the SDF, released a statement saying such conduct was a “reproduction of terrorism and poses a direct threat to regional and international security”.</p><p>Basravi said both sides were reverting to familiar language and using violence to settle scores in places of Syria that had been hoping for a return to peace after the ceasefire was reached.</p><h2 id=\"al-sharaa-s-offer-to-abdi\">Al-Sharaa’s offer to Abdi</h2><p>Five hours of talks on Monday between al-Sharaa and Abdi aimed at salvaging the ceasefire ended without agreement, sources told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The president offered to appoint Abdi to the post of deputy defence minister and nominate him to be governor of Hasakah in exchange for the deployment of Syrian internal security forces to its capital.</p><p>The offer also included the condition of removing members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) from the territory. Turkiye sees the SDF as a Syrian branch of the PKK, an organisation that it has been at war with since 1984 and considers a “terrorist” group.</p><p>Abdi asked for five days for consultations, a request al-Sharaa rejected. The president gave the SDF leader until the end of Tuesday to accept the offer, warning that failure to do so would trigger military action and the collapse of the ceasefire.</p><p>Al-Sharaa on Monday spoke by phone with US President Donald Trump, and the two stressed the importance of preserving Syria’s territorial unity and independence and underlined the need to guarantee the rights and protection of the Kurdish people.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said the US was in a “unique position to end this crisis” because it has close ties with both the SDF and Damascus.</p><p>Washington trained and equipped the SDF to fight ISIL and maintains about 900 soldiers in SDF-controlled areas. Trump also removed al-Sharaa from the global “terrorist” sanctions list and <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/11/video-trump-hails-syrias-al-sharaa-after-historic-white-house-talks\">welcomed him to the White House</a> in November.</p><p>Oghanna said SDF members were worried about Washington’s growing ties with Damascus and feared that fighting may force the US to pick a side.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The total value of the assets is reportedly believed to be close to the cost of damages incurred in Tehran.</p><p>Popular former footballer Voria Ghafouri, who had been arrested in 2022 for <a href=\"/news/2022/11/25/iran-arrests-footballer-ghafouri-for-spreading-propaganda\">supporting previous nationwide protests</a>, also had his cafe confiscated.</p><h2 id=\"trump-threats-crossing-red-line\">Trump threats ‘crossing red line’</h2><p>At the height of the protests, Trump called on Iranians to “take over” government institutions, alleging “help is on the way”, before expressing “great respect” for the Iranian leadership based on a claim that planned hangings for more than 800 political prisoners were halted.</p><p>But then on Saturday, Trump said it is time for an end to the 37-year rule of Khamenei in Iran – prompting some of the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic to shoot back.</p><p>In a statement carried by state media, the Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member constitutional watchdog that has to approve legislation before it becomes law, said it condemns the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” US president.</p><p>The council stressed that any transgression against the supreme leader “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences”.</p><p>Ghalibaf, the parliament chief, told a public session of parliament on Monday that Trump “used all of his non-existent credibility to extend chaos, insecurity and killings in Iran”.</p><h2 id=\"internet-blackout-remains-in-place\">Internet blackout remains in place</h2><p>Meanwhile, Hossein Afshin, deputy for scientific affairs to the Iranian president, told reporters on Monday that internet restrictions will “gradually” be lifted from the end of the week, but did not divulge further information.</p><p>NetBlocks and other international monitors said the occasional internet reconnections signal that the establishment may be testing ways to more vigorously enforce its controlled digital blackout of the Iranian population.</p><p></p><p>State media announced on Monday that the chief executive of Irancell, one of the country’s top mobile and internet carriers, was replaced.</p><p>The move came after “some of Irancell’s operators refrained from the order to restrict communications” on January 8 for several hours, according to the Tasnim news agency, also affiliated with the IRGC. That was the night when the internet and all mobile communications were abruptly cut off at an unprecedented scale.</p><p>According to state media, the reformist Ham-Mihan daily newspaper was confiscated on Monday, with two reports written about the protests cited as the reason.</p><p>State television also confirmed on Monday that its satellite broadcast was “disrupted by an unidentified source for moments” the night before. The feed appeared to show moments from the nationwide protests at the time of hijacking.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His attendance comes amid strained US ties with its European allies over his threat to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.</p><p>Here is more about the WEF and what to expect at the meeting.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248969\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-What-is-the-World-Economic-Forum-1768737184.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - What is the World Economic Forum 2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-wef\">What is the WEF?</h2><p>The WEF is a think tank and event organiser based in the Swiss city of Geneva. The first summit held in Davos in 1971 was a gathering of business executives. However, over the years, it has expanded in scope, discussing issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology and global cooperation.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-the-wef-summit-in-2026\">Where is the WEF summit in 2026?</h2><p>The summit is at the conference centre in Davos, an Alpine town in Switzerland, famous for its ski resort and home to about 10,000 people.</p><p>Davos, at a height of about 1,500 metres (nearly 5,000 feet), is located in the Graubunden canton in the eastern Alps of Switzerland.</p><p>It has been the venue of the WEF summit every year in January since 1971.</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-summit-at-davos\">When is the summit at Davos?</h2><p>The main sessions began on Monday, January 19, and the annual meeting will wrap up on January 23.</p><p>Sessions begin at 9am (08:00 GMT) every day.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-expected-to-attend-and-who-isn-t\">Who is expected to attend, and who isn’t?</h2><p>Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond, plus untold numbers of activists, journalists and outside observers are expected to attend.</p><p>Organisers say a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and about 850 chairpersons and chief executives of many of the world’s leading companies, are attending.</p><p>Headlining the lineup is Trump, who is set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several cabinet ministers and top advisers, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Trump also wants to hold a meeting of his ‘Board of Peace’ on Gaza at the annual gathering, according to a report by Bloomberg news.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are among the who’s who attending the WEF summit.</p><p>Organisers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.</p><p>Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France’s Mistral AI.</p><p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among several top officials from international institutions.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-not-attending\">Who is not attending?</h2><p>Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the summit, the organisers said on Monday, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran. <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">Abbas Araghchi</a> had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday.</p><p>“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the WEF said on X.</p><p>“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.</p><p>Israel, accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has also been invited. President Isaac Herzog will represent Israel at the event.</p><p>Mozambique President Daniel Chapo cancelled his trip to Davos and will not attend the meeting due to massive flooding in his country. He said on social media late on Sunday that “the absolute priority at this moment is to save lives”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-on-the-agenda\">What is on the agenda?</h2><p>The theme this year is “A Spirit of Dialogue”. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues ranging from geopolitics and artificial intelligence to climate change.</p><p>Trump is expected to meet global business leaders on Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p><p>Business leaders, including CEOs in financial services, crypto and consulting, are invited to a reception after Trump’s address to the WEF’s annual meeting, the sources told Reuters on Monday. The agenda was unclear.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-different-this-year\">What’s different this year?</h2><p>The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump’s pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran — not to mention his aggressive tariff policies — have upended the world order and raised questions about the US role in the world.</p><p>European Union leaders have dubbed Trump’s threat to slap new tariffs over his Greenland takeover bid a “blackmail”.</p><p>The advent of AI – its promise and perils – has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labour leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and the right to innovate.</p><p>Davos conference organisers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year, it is “A Spirit of Dialogue” – around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity.</p><p>Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify the gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Something in the way the United States envoy said it – phase two – really made it sound like things might finally be turning the corner.</p><p>In less than 24 hours, another announcement followed. The White House named the members of a new <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/who-is-part-of-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza\">“Board of Peace”</a>, tasked with overseeing a technocratic committee that would manage the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza. The committee will be led by Dr Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian official, who is presented as part of a forward-looking plan for reconstruction and stability.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On paper, it appears to be a movement. Like structure. Like planning for a future beyond war.</p><p>But on the ground in Gaza, there isn’t a sense of confidence. There is doubt – and a lot of it.</p><p>Many Palestinians here struggle to understand how a board meant to rebuild Gaza can include people who have openly supported Israel, especially when the destruction is still everywhere you look, and no one has been held accountable.</p><p>Buildings are still in ruins. Families are still grieving. Entire neighbourhoods are gone. Against that backdrop, talk of governance and reconstruction feels disconnected from reality.</p><p>For families who have lost their homes, their loved ones, and their sense of safety, the contradiction is hard to ignore. It’s difficult to be asked to trust a future designed by people who seem untouched by the present pain and untouched by responsibility for it.</p><p>For those whose daily life is characterised by the constant buzz of drones and sudden Israeli air attacks, nothing’s really shifted.</p><p>Parents still think hard about where their kids will sleep tonight. Aid workers still map their routes, not by where help is most needed, but by which roads might actually get them through alive. Families still hush up at night, straining to hear if the quiet will hold or if the fighting will break out again.</p><p>All these official statements? They feel miles away from what’s actually happening. Phase two might exist in some news release, but for most people, life still feels stuck right where it started.</p><p>You don’t feel a ceasefire in speeches or headlines. You feel it in what’s missing, the sudden silence, the easing in your chest, the nights that don’t end with a jolt. That’s what people are waiting for. Not the label, not the milestone. Just the change itself.</p><p>After months of loss and exhaustion, it’s normal to want to believe things really are getting better. Diplomats cling to the idea of progress. Governments need to say momentum’s building. But the people actually living this? They just want something steady. They want to know tomorrow won’t be worse than today, that they can wake up and not flinch.</p><p>But right now, that feeling isn’t there. Promises are uneven, timelines keep slipping, and too many commitments just fade into the background. For people living through it, this doesn’t feel like peace on the move; it feels like everything’s hanging by a thread, ready to snap at any minute. Just calling it “phase two” doesn’t make it feel any safer.</p><p>And then there’s that quieter hurt that comes from hope getting stretched too thin. When official words don’t match real life, people learn to lower their expectations. Hope turns into something fragile – something you hold close but don’t trust too much, because getting let down again just stings. Announcing progress before anyone can feel it doesn’t build trust. It erodes it.</p><p>This isn’t about throwing out diplomacy. It’s just about honesty. If “phase two” is going to mean anything, people need to feel it in their daily lives: Fewer funerals, hospitals that actually work, roads that don’t feel like traps, days where fear isn’t always there.</p><p>Real peace grows in those small, ordinary moments, walking down the street without bracing yourself, sleeping through the night without planning how to run if things go wrong.</p><p>Until those moments show up, “phase two” is mostly just a symbol. And symbols, no matter how hopeful, can’t keep anyone safe. Only real change does that.</p><p>For people living day to day, peace isn’t about the next announcement. It starts when they can get through a night and believe the ceasefire will still hold in the morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is 27, grew up in a middle-class neighbourhood of Dhaka, and became eligible to vote nearly a decade ago. He never did – not in Bangladesh’s national elections in 2018, nor in the 2024 vote.</p><p>“My vote had no real value,” he said.</p><p>Like many Bangladeshis in his age group, Alam’s political consciousness formed under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s long period of government, when opposition parties and election watchdogs repeatedly questioned the credibility of polls.</p><p>Over time, he said, disengagement with politics became normal, even rational, for a generation. “You grow up knowing elections exist, but believing they actually don’t have the power to decide anything. So you put your energy elsewhere… studies, work, even trying to leave the country,” he said.</p><p>This calculation began to shift for him in July 2024, when student protests over a government job reservation system favouring certain groups spiralled into a nationwide uprising. Alam joined marches in Dhaka’s Mirpur area and helped coordinate logistics for protests, as Hasina’s security forces launched a brutal crackdown.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office later estimated that up to 1,400 people – most of them young – may have been killed before Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, ending nearly 15 years in power.</p><p>When Hasina left, Alam said the moment felt like something that had appeared permanent had broken. “For the first time, it felt like ordinary people could push for a change,” he said. “Once you experience that, you feel responsible for what comes next.”</p><p>Bangladesh is now heading for a national election on February 12, the first since the uprising. European Union observers have described the upcoming vote as the “biggest democratic process in 2026, anywhere”. And Alam plans to vote for the first time.</p><p>“I’m thrilled to exercise my lost right as a citizen,” he said.</p><p>He is not alone. Bangladesh has about 127 million registered voters, nearly 56 million of them between the ages of 18 and 37, according to the Election Commission. They constitute about 44 percent of the electorate, and are a demographic widely seen as the driving force behind Hasina’s downfall.</p><p>“Practically speaking, anyone who turned 18 after the 2008 parliamentary election has never had the chance to vote in a competitive poll,” said Humayun Kabir, director general of the Election Commission’s national identity registration wing.</p><p>“That means people who have been unable to vote for the last 17 years are now in their mid-30s… and especially eager to cast their ballots.”</p><p>This eagerness comes after three post-2008 elections that “were not considered credible”, Ivars Ijabs, the EU’s chief observer, said.</p><p>The 2014 polls saw a mass opposition boycott, and dozens of seats where Hasina’s Awami League party faced no contest. The 2018 vote, though contested, became widely known as the “night’s vote”, after allegations that ballot boxes had been filled before polling day.</p><p>The 2024 election, meanwhile, again went ahead amid a major boycott by opposition parties, with critics arguing that conditions for a “fair contest did not exist”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24224305623258-1768878892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE- Protesters shout slogans as they celebrate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

Haq described the upcoming election as a psychological release valve after years of repression, during which young people “could not hold their representatives accountable; rather, those representatives appeared to them as oppressors”.</p><p>Many young people still do not trust the existing system, Haq argued, and some remain sceptical of the democratic transition itself.</p><p>Umama Fatema, a Dhaka University student who emerged as a prominent leader during the 2024 protests, said the uprising generated powerful expectations among young people: promises of “no corruption, no manipulation, equality of opportunity and political reform”.</p><p>But translating these aspirations into institutions has proven far more difficult. As the transition unfolded, Fatema said the reform process, led by the interim administration of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, alongside manoeuvring by political parties – including those born out of 2024’s protests – became increasingly complex.</p><p>“Very few people and their aspirations have been meaningfully involved and incorporated,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253092\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25215551352377-1768885347.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Leader of National Citizen Party (NCP), Nahid Islam, addresses supporters during a political rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025.

A far-right Islamist party, the Jamaat’s opposition to Bangladesh’s independence during the 1971 war has long limited its mainstream appeal.</p><p>“Historically, those who rule us come to power with big promises,” Saha said. “But after a few years, power blinds them, and the same abuses repeat.”</p><p>The NCP, he said, initially felt different. “We thought of the NCP as a beacon of light. But seeing it align with a party that carries so much historical baggage made many of us lose hope.”</p><p>Fatema, who led the protests alongside several figures who later founded the NCP, said the party’s alignment with the Jamaat risks shrinking the significance of the July 2024 uprising. “Over time, it could seriously damage how this uprising is remembered in history,” she warned.</p><p>The NCP positioned itself at its launch as a generational alternative to Bangladesh’s traditional parties, promising what it called a “new political settlement” rooted in the 2024 July movement. But as talks advanced over the electoral alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the party saw a wave of resignations, including from several senior figures and women leaders who had been expected to contest parliamentary seats. Many of them have since announced independent bids, saying the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>Nahid Islam, the NCP’s chief, has defended the alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, describing it as a “strategic electoral arrangement aimed at greater unity”, rather than an ideological alignment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253096\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25345467213828-1768885528.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C493&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People watch Bangladesh's Chief Election Commissioner A.M.M.

But I want to see whether the system can at least function properly. That alone would be a major change,” she said.</p><p>For others, like Sakibur Rahman, 23, a voter from the eastern Brahmanbaria district who studies philosophy at the University of Dhaka, the appeal of democracy remains conditional.</p><p>“You can talk about democracy all day, but if people don’t feel safe, can’t speak freely and can’t earn a living, democracy feels abstract, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Rahman said he would support whichever party could credibly guarantee public safety, freedom of expression, religious freedom, and minorities living without fear.</p><p>For many women voters, the calculation is sharper still. Women make up nearly half of Bangladesh’s electorate, but young women say questions of dignity and everyday security will shape their ballot.</p><p>“We hear promises of women’s rights, but the lived reality is far from ideal. That will shape how many of my female friends will vote,” Akter, the master’s student, said.</p><p>Yet the political field they are being asked to choose from remains overwhelmingly male. Election Commission data shows that only 109 of the 2,568 candidates contesting the election, or about 4.24 percent, are women.</p><p>Fatema said the political space for women has narrowed rather than expanded since the uprising. “After August 5, women who speak about their agency, their contributions, and their right to representation have been suppressed in many ways,” she said.</p><p>“Harassment, from online abuse to sexual threats, has become routine in political spaces.” These pressures are pushing women out of visible political roles, just as the country enters a critical political transition, she added.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, a political observer and adjunct researcher at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, said the disconnect between women’s prominence in protest movements and their marginalisation in formal politics raises doubts about the depth of reform.</p><p>“No structural change is possible without women’s political representation, and participation at the highest levels… both in parliament and in policymaking,” he said. “Without that, promises of any new political order remain incomplete.”</p><p>Fahmidul Haq of Bard College said political parties would have to approach young voters differently than in the past, by addressing “their traumas, desires, and demands sincerely”, and by campaigning with honesty and transparency.</p><p>“Young people are deeply sceptical of absurd promises,” he said, adding that those may in fact alienate them.</p><p>Still, something fundamental has changed. For Alam, the first-time voter from Dhaka’s Mirpur, July 2024 permanently altered how his generation relates to power.</p><p>“We now dare to question everyone,” he said. “Whoever comes to power, that habit won’t disappear.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

protect minors online.</p><p>The government said on Monday it would examine <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/why-is-australia-banning-social-media-for-teenagers\">evidence from around the world</a> on a wide range of suggested proposals, including looking at ‌whether a social media ban for minors would be effective, and if one ‌was introduced, how best to ‌make it work.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

Australia, which last month became the first country in the world to ban social media for young people ‌under 16 years old, hoping to learn firsthand from the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/snapchat-starts-age-checks-in-australia-ahead-of-teen-social-media-ban\">Australian approach</a>, the UK government said in a ‍statement.</p><p>“The consultation will look at options including raising the digital age of consent, implementing phone curfews to avoid excessive use, and restricting potentially addictive design features such as ‘streaks’ and ‘infinite scrolling’,” the government said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement comes as governments and regulators worldwide grapple with the rapid explosion of AI-generated content, which was highlighted this month by an international outcry over reports of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/mother-of-elon-musks-child-sues-his-ai-company-over-grok-deepfake-images\">Elon Musk’s Grok AI chatbot</a> generating non-consensual sexual images, including of children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The UK has already set out plans for an outright ban on <a

view nude images on their devices, ⁠it said in Monday’s statement.</p><p>“We are determined to ensure technology enriches children’s lives, not harms them – and to give every child the childhood they deserve,” UK Secretary of State for Technology Liz Kendall said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement did not mention a particular age limit for social media use, but the statement said it was exploring a ban “for children under a certain age”, in addition to other measures, such as better age checks and looking into whether the current digital age of consent of 13 years was too low.</p><p>The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it were in power, the UK’s PA Media news agency reports.</p><p>Badenoch, PA reports, said the planned consultation by the Labour-led government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer amounted to more delay from his leadership, after earlier accusing him of lacking the “backbone” to enforce a social media ban.</p><p>“The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,” Badenoch said.</p><p>“This is yet more dither and delay from Starmer and a Labour Party that have entirely run out of ideas.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The ministry’s claims could not be independently verified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s armed forces are introducing a new approach to air defence, involving small groups of interceptor drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.</li>\n<li>The Kyiv Independent media outlet reported that Ukraine’s SBU secret service captured a Russian soldier suspected of executing nine Ukrainian prisoners of war in 2024.</li>\n</ul><p></p><h2 id=\"military-aid\">Military aid</h2><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Czech Republic will not sell or donate to Ukraine light combat planes that could shoot down incoming Russian drones, the country’s prime minister, Andrej Babis, said, rejecting a plan outlined by President Petr Pavel.

It is instead boosting arms production, including a target of 1,000 drones per day, he added.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kyiv has held “substantive” talks on security and economic issues with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and envoy Steve Witkoff, with more discussions expected at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, Ukraine’s security chief and top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he hopes to sign documents with the US on post-war <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/zelenskyy-says-us-security-guarantee-text-ready-to-be-finalised-with-trump\">security guarantees</a> for Ukraine at Davos this week, adding that his team of negotiators had held several rounds of talks in the US.</li>\n<li>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will travel to Davos this week and hold meetings with members of the US delegation on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the Reuters news agency reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the visit.</li>\n</ul><p> </p><h3>Politics</h3><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine will face enormous challenges to organise its first elections since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, with its infrastructure shattered and millions of people displaced by war, the country’s election chief, Oleh Didenko, said, responding to Trump’s demand for Ukraine to hold the vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Russia jailed an American man for five years for illegally transporting weapons, a court announced, saying that a rifle was found on his yacht after it docked in the port city of Sochi last June. It identified the man as Charles Wayne Zimmerman, and said he “admitted his guilt in full”. It did not mention when exactly the man was sentenced, but said an appeal against the conviction had been rejected.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that the 330-kilovolt (kV) Ferosplavna-1 power line has been reconnected to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The power line is one of two high-voltage lines supplying electricity that powers the Russian-controlled nuclear power plant in Ukraine, and was disconnected earlier this month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukrainian Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Telegram that he had informed the head of the IAEA about Russian preparations for more strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities, including those that ensure the operations of nuclear plants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s federal budget proceeds from taxes on oil and gas are expected to drop by 46 percent in January from the same month in 2025 due to weaker oil prices and a stronger rouble, according to an analysis by Reuters. Oil and gas revenue are key to funding Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Polish pipeline operator Gaz-System will increase gas transmission capacity to Ukraine between February and April, the company said in a statement, as Russia continues to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/zelenskyy-demands-faster-energy-imports-as-ukraine-reels-from-power-outages\">attack Ukraine’s energy sector</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_4252859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252859\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252859\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260118__936N864__v1__MidRes__UkraineRussiaConflictWar-1768866879.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Local residents gather around a bonfire during an outdoor party to keep warm as many apartments remain without heating in Kyiv on January 18, 2026, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Powell plans to attend the high court’s Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>It is a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell’s announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment</a> of the Fed chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year’s more subdued response to Trump’s repeated attacks on the central bank in favour of a more public confrontation.</p><p>Powell issued a video statement on January 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump’s efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed’s key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6 percent, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1 percent, a position few economists support.</p><p>The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation that Cook has denied. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court on October 1 issued a brief order <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/1/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-fed-governor-cook-firing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allowing her to stay on the board</a> while they consider her case.</p><p>If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed’s board and greater influence over the central bank’s decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.</p></div></div></body></html>"
