What could this mean for the future of Palestinian land?</p><p><strong>In this episode: </strong></p><p><strong>Episode credits:</strong></p><p><em>This episode was produced by Noor Wazwaz and Melanie Marich, with Tamara Khandaker, Marcos Bartolomé, Maya Hamadeh, Tuleen Barakat, and our guest host, Kevin Hirten.

The reports related to investment opportunities in Afghanistan and assessments of Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited.</p><p>Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement on Thursday that officers had now opened a full investigation into the offence of misconduct in public office.</p><p>A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which handle the most serious criminal offences.</p><p>Thames Valley Police has previously said it was also reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Andrew. Thursday’s arrest was not related to that allegation.</p><p>In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the US by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.</p><p>Other police forces are also conducting their own investigations into Epstein’s links to the UK, including the assessment of flight logs at airports. They are coordinating their work within a national group.</p><p>On Friday, London’s Metropolitan Police said it was assessing, with the help of US counterparts, whether the capital’s airports, which include Heathrow, “may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation”.</p><p>It also said that it is asking past and present officers who protected Mountbatten-Windsor to “consider carefully” whether they saw or heard anything that may be relevant to the investigations.</p><p>As of now, it said no new criminal allegations have been made regarding sexual offences within its jurisdiction.</p><p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times. The last member of the royal family to be arrested in the UK was Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649 after being found guilty of treason.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s all lies,” the 66-year-old man says. “Anything Israel agrees to certainly won’t be in our interest,” he tells Al Jazeera in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“Trump, together with Israel, wants to use the Board of Peace to impose their decisions on the world by force. This is about power, control, and domination, without regard for weaker nations like us,” he added.</p><p>Over the past two years, reconstruction plans have been discussed after every ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, Israeli restrictions on the entry of construction materials have hindered the full implementation of those pledges.</p><p>“Even if the board decides to rebuild Gaza, this is unlikely and won’t happen. We’ve heard this many times and nothing happened,” he adds.</p><p>“How can we trust a peace board in which Israel is a member? It is the one that killed us, destroyed us, and committed genocide.”</p><p>While Abu Makhdeh insists he is not optimistic about the board’s decisions, he also expresses concern about Trump and Israel’s insistence on disarming Hamas. Under the truce accord, Hamas is required to hand over its weapons.</p><p>“Their main goal is to disarm Hamas so that we drown in internal and civil disputes,” he adds.</p><p>He said he sees talk of peace as deceptive, pointing to ongoing violations in the occupied West Bank, including the destruction of Palestinian houses and property, settlement expansion, and restrictions on normal life, alongside the deepening tragedy in Gaza.</p><p>“There is no optimism in American decisions. This is just media talk.”</p><p>Al-Ghoul expressed cautious optimism over the idea of sending an international peacekeeping force to Gaza.</p><p>“Personally, I hope this force is sent, but it must act as a deterrent to Israel’s continued attacks, like UNIFIL in Lebanon.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.</p><p>The majority did not address whether companies could get refunded for the billions they have collectively paid in tariffs. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up for refunds in court, and Kavanaugh noted the process could be complicated.</p><p>“The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument,” he wrote.</p><p>Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera that the court ruling was “definitely a big repudiation of Trump’s tariff agenda and will force him to rely more on other tools, most of which require more public comment period and Congressional authorisation”.</p><p>Friday’s ruling will also, in particular, “rein in Trump’s ability to threaten tariffs against any country for any reason”, Ziemba told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"additional-tariffs\">Additional tariffs</h2><p>Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate, over the next decade, trillions of dollars in revenue for the US, which possesses the world’s largest economy.</p><p>Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since December 14. But Penn Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) stood at more than $175bn. That amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.</p><p>The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to impose taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress, the first president to use that.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.</p><p>Ziemba said she expects Congress to support tariffs on China and perhaps approve secondary tariffs, but many other tariffs, like fentanyl tariffs on Canada and Mexico or broad reciprocal tariffs, “are unlikely to pass”.</p><p>Trump described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenceless and ruined without them. In November, he told reporters that without his tariffs, “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.” Trump said the US was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.</p><p>After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan.”</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.</p><p>Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security, and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against US exporters.</p><p>None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and they may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.</p><p>But, “the administration is likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, [and] the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels,” warned Michael Pearce, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics. That said, the by-sector and by-country implications could end up looking very different, “which will create another bout of trade policy uncertainty for business, investors, and households. This uncertainty is a key downside risk that could ding, rather than derail, growth this year,” Pearce added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She claimed she had been forced to have sex with him on multiple occasions when she was 17, a minor under US law. Giuffre <a href=\"/news/2025/4/26/epstein-prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-by-suicide-family\">died by suicide</a> in April last year after reaching a settlement in this case.</p><p>When he was still a prince, Mountbatten-Windsor served as the UK’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, only stepping down when controversy over his links to Epstein intensified. Throughout his time in the role, he faced persistent criticism over his “party prince” image, his conduct on overseas trips, and the cost of his lavish taxpayer‑funded trips and hospitality.</p><p>But Mountbatten-Windsor is far from the first British royal to be engulfed in scandal. In 1936, the monarchy was rocked when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II largely kept the institution steady in the early decades of her reign, but as her children reached adulthood, a new wave of marital crises and personal controversies engulfed the family.</p><p>Here is a closer look at some of the major scandals to have roiled the royals and their reputation in recent decades.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1992-queen-elizabeth-s-annus-horribilis\">1992: Queen Elizabeth’s ‘annus horribilis’</h2><p>During a speech to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession in November 1992, Queen Elizabeth II described the year as her “annus horribilis”, which is Latin for “horrible year”, following a series of scandals.</p><p>Three of her children’s marriages had failed: Then‑Prince of Wales – now King – Charles and Princess Diana separated, as did Mountbatten-Windsor and his wife, Sarah Ferguson. Princess Anne and Mark Phillips got divorced.</p><p>In August 1992, while separated but still married to Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson was photographed on holiday in the south of France with her American financial adviser John Bryan. Bryan was seen kissing her toes, much to the uproar of the general public.</p><p>The same year, a phone call between Diana and her friend, James Gilbey, was leaked and became tabloid fodder. It was believed that the call had been illegally recorded and sold to the media. The intimate and emotional nature of the call led to speculation that Gilbey and Diana were more than friends. On the call, Gilbey called Diana “Squidgy”, and hence the incident became known as “Squidgygate”.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4324805\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"1993-camillagate\">1993: Camillagate</h2><p>An end to the Queen’s “annus horribilis” was not to be.</p><p>Soon after Squidgygate came “Camillagate”.

About the affair, she said: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,” which garnered huge public sympathy. She also spoke openly about her mental health struggles – in particular with the condition bulimia nervosa.</p><p>Diana’s candid interview opened the lid on life in the royal family, and she was widely viewed as the “people’s princess” after it was aired.</p><p>Following the interview, Queen Elizabeth II recommended that the couple divorce quickly – the marriage was legally dissolved the following year.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding the interview came under scrutiny more than 20 years later when Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, alleged that Bashir had used false documents and other dishonest tactics to enlist him to persuade Diana to do the interview.</p><p>The BBC appointed a retired senior judge in 2020 to lead an investigation into the matter. A report from the inquiry said Bashir used “deceitful behaviour” and breached BBC rules by mocking up fake bank statements and showing them to Spencer to gain access to the princess.</p><p>In 2021, Princes William and Harry – Diana’s now-grown children – issued a strong criticism of the BBC and British media for what they called unethical practices after the investigation concluded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-52103891-1771587553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C522&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diana, Princess Of Wales, visits The National Children’s Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in February 1995, the year she was interviewed on Panorama [Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1997-death-of-diana\">1997: Death of Diana</h2><p>Two years after the Panorama interview, the princess died aged 36 in a Paris traffic accident as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi photographers.</p><p>On August 30, 1997, a group of paparazzi had camped outside the Ritz hotel in Paris in hopes of obtaining shots of Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.

Both Diana and Fayed were killed.</p><p>The public outpouring of grief over Diana’s death contrasted sharply with what was seen as stony silence from the royal family in the immediate aftermath.
