He also declined to endorse the opposition leader, exiled Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, saying she does not have the approval or “respect” of the people.</p><p>What the US wants from Rodriguez is likely to revolve around Venezuela’s oil, which Trump and other US officials have characterised as US oil – based on the South American country’s nationalisation of its oil industry between the 1970s and the 2000s, forcing most US oil companies out.</p><p>“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights, they took all of our oil from not that long ago. And we want it back,” said Trump in December.</p><p>In his typically forthright manner, Trump has also said that Venezuela’s oil reserves would cover any costs the US incurs from its attack on the country, and “the damages” allegedly caused by Venezuela to the US.</p><p>Oil is vital to Venezuela, and the US had used its importance to pressure the country prior to the abduction of Maduro.</p><p>US sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil have been a core element of US policy toward Venezuela since 2017, especially under combined Trump-era directives. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) is blacklisted, and Washington has taken measures restricting the shipment of diluents that are needed for heavy crude.</p><p>A host of oil traders, companies and ships that transport the goods have been sanctioned, including last month, while Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters, which led to at least two tankers being confiscated.</p><p>US sanctions and pressure are some of the main reasons why Venezuela’s oil exports are not comparable to the country’s oil reserves.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil exports averaged about a meager 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and the US “oil embargo” knocked them down to around 500,000 bpd last month, according to preliminary figures based on ship movements.</p><p>In comparison, major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia export millions of barrels per day on average.</p><p>Francisco Rodriguez, the former head of the economic advisory of the Venezuelan National Assembly, said gold and oil reserves are among the country’s main hopes for economic recovery.</p><p>“If the US moves to remove the sanctions and clear the hurdles for investors to come back in, you can get the oil output to 2.5 million barrels per day in the scope of three to five years,” he told Al Jazeera from the US state of Colorado, pointing out that production currently stands at below one million barrels per day.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“I think what the Trump administration is saying is that we need to prioritise the recovery of the oil sector and get the economy on a manageable basis so that we think about more orderly political transition,” the former official said.</p><p>“But if you try to directly hand over the power to the opposition right now without having set the basis for economic recovery, that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to chaos.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-opec-and-others\">What does this mean for OPEC and others?</h2><p>At least in the short term, the Venezuela developments do not mean a major change for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But things could drastically change with time.</p><p>Venezuela cannot quickly raise production due to its ageing infrastructure, and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-seizes-second-oil-vessel-off-venezuela-coast-officials-say\">unilateral US seizures of tankers</a> near Venezuela’s waters only led to an uptick in oil prices before another stabilisation.</p><p data-start=\"480\" data-end=\"636\">Venezuela’s upstream oil infrastructure, particularly under PDVSA, has suffered from more than a decade of underinvestment, so some wells are mechanically compromised, restarting shut-in wells often requires full workovers or redrilling, not simple reactivation, and routine preventive maintenance largely ceased after the US embargoes.</p><p data-start=\"640\" data-end=\"767\">The crude cannot flow or be exported without diluents, which are being blocked by the US, while storage, blending, and upgrading facilities are bottlenecked, with many operating well below nominal capacity.</p><p>But theoretically, if a US-directed Venezuela manages to rapidly boost output in the future, OPEC will face a supply glut or will have to adjust quotas. This would give Washington indirect but major influence inside the group and over global supply, disrupting the delicate balance members have been trying to keep for years.</p><p>West Asia neighbours like Iran and Saudi Arabia are also directly affected if Caracas leans towards the US in the long term.</p><p>The anti-US and Israel establishment in Iran has lost another major ally in Maduro, after the fall of top leaders of the <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">Tehran-backed “axis of resistance”</a> over the past two years.</p><p>Iran has also been hampered in efforts to develop its oil sector due to stringent Western sanctions, and like Venezuela under Maduro, Iran sends most of its oil at heavily discounted prices through a shadow fleet of ships to China. A robust return of Venezuelan oil to the market would further undermine Iranian oil.</p><p>Saudi Arabia was not a close ally of the Maduro establishment like Iran, but it also risks future oversupply that may push global prices down if Venezuela makes a comeback. That may force Riyadh to cut production and weaken its price leadership in the global market.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Military campaigns were inseparable from missionary efforts as conversion to Christianity became both a justification for empire and a tool of control. Faith and force advanced together, reshaping societies across the Americas.</p><p>Through the conquests of the Aztec and Incan empires, the documentary shows how Spanish power was established through violence, alliances and religious authority. The mission system spread across the Americas, reorganising Indigenous life around churches, labour regimes and colonial administration. Conversion promised salvation but enforced obedience and cultural destruction.</p><p>The film also examines the economic foundations of Spanish imperial power. Vast quantities of gold and silver were extracted from the Americas alongside the exploitation of Indigenous and enslaved labour. These resources fuelled European economies, financed global trade and helped integrate the Americas into an emerging world system built on extraction and inequality.</p><p>By tracing how faith, conquest and wealth operated together, the documentary reveals how Spanish colonialism shaped global capitalism, religious power and imperial governance. It shows how the legacies of conquest, forced conversion and resource extraction continue to influence social inequality, cultural identity and economic structures in the modern world and how current global superpowers like the United States and China adopt this model to their benefit. It also draws on the parallels between the erasure of cultural artefacts then and today’s “algorithmic colonisation”.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 4 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">4 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

How did he come to lead Venezuela? And how did he end up abducted by the US? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"maduro-s-early-life\">Maduro’s early life</h2><p>Maduro was born in a working-class family on November 23, 1962, in the El Valle neighbourhood of Caracas.</p><p>His parents are Nicolas Maduro Garcia, a trade union leader, and Teresa de Jesus Moros, who also had three daughters together: Maria Teresa, Josefina, and Anita Maduro.</p><p>Maduro was raised under the significant influence of his father’s politics.</p><p>Maduro once shared that his grandparents were of Sephardic Jewish descent, and converted to Catholicism upon arriving in Venezuela.</p><p>Growing up, Maduro was a fan of Western rock music and often quoted artists including John Lennon.</p><p>He attended a public high school, the Liceo Jose Avalos, in El Valle, where he was involved in student politics and reportedly served as the student union president; however, there are no records that show he graduated.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rise-to-power\">Rise to power</h2><p>Maduro’s political rise began in organised labour.</p><p>He is believed to have joined the Socialist League of Venezuela, a Marxist-Leninist party, in the early 1980s.</p><p>At the age of 24, in 1986, Maduro was sent as a representative of the Socialist League to Cuba for a year of political training at<span> the Escuela Nacional de Cuadros Julio Antonio Mella, run by the Union of Young Communists (UJC).</span></p><p>Upon his return, he started working as a bus driver in Caracas city’s metro system, and then founded and led the SITRAMECA, or Sindicato de Trabajadores y Trabajadoras del Metro de Caracas, in 1991.</p><p>Maduro became active in the transport workers’ union during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and founded one of the company’s first informal labour syndicates, gradually entering the power centres through union politics.</p><p>A 2006 cable from the US Embassy in Caracas, made public by WikiLeaks, noted that Maduro was on the national committee of the Socialist League and he “reportedly turned down a baseball contract from a U.S. Major League Baseball scout.”</p><p>He was moved by the leadership of Hugo Chavez, a Venezuelan lieutenant colonel who led the armed Bolivarian movement rebelling against the so-called “Puntofijismo” system, Venezuela’s two-party democracy system, and the sitting President Carlos Andres Perez, citing corruption.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the early 1990s, Maduro joined MBR-200, the civilian wing of the movement, and later continued to campaign for Chavez’s release after he was jailed for the failed 1992 coup.</p><p>Maduro met his future wife, Cilia Flores, when she headed the legal team that won freedom for Chavez in 1994.</p><p>After Chavez was pardoned and released, Maduro joined the Movement of the Fifth Republic, a socialist political party, in 1997 to run in the 1998 elections. Maduro was elected to the National Constituent Assembly while Chavez won the presidency.</p><p>Maduro was close to Chavez during the drafting of a new constitution in 1999, and after six years in office, he was designated the<span> minister of foreign affairs. In October 2012, Maduro became vice president of Venezuela amid the rapidly deteriorating health of Chavez.</span></p><h2 id=\"consolidation-of-power-in-caracas\">Consolidation of power in Caracas</h2><p>In December 2012, as the charismatic Chavez fell ill and was flying to Cuba for cancer treatment, he anointed Maduro, then the vice president, as his political successor in a televised address.</p><p>In elections after Chavez’s death, Maduro won by a slim margin in April 2013.</p><p>He began his presidency by expelling US diplomats, calling them “historical enemies” and accusing them of poisoning Chavez. He labelled the domestic opposition “fascists” working to “divide the country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The first lady went on to hold multiple high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament.</p><p>Maduro inherited firm control over key institutions that Chavez had already reshaped, including the military leadership, the Supreme Court, and state media.</p><p>But the former union leader did not have his mentor’s charisma, and had to deal with a collapsing economy and an opposition, including Maria Corina Machado, who later won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, that called for protests across the country. Maduro cracked down on them, killing at least 43 protestors.</p><p>Facing increasing opposition pressure and plummeting popularity, Maduro established a pro-government constituent assembly in 2017 to neutralise the legislature, now controlled by the opposition. Another round of protests and further crackdown followed, with Venezuelan forces killing more than 100 people.</p><p>All the while, the economy tanked, with Venezuela’s nearly 30 million population facing shortages of essentials, and oil production dropping to margins.</p><p>In the next election in 2018, Maduro was declared the winner unopposed, but 45 countries, including the US, did not recognise him, and he jailed some opposition leaders and forced others into exile.</p><p>In 2024, Maduro was again chosen the winner in the presidential election, widely seen as non-transparent, with the election council failing to show the tally sheets. More mass protests followed, met with a harsh crackdown.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4213603\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213603\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213603\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-07-25T110051Z_870521246_RC2W1Y9PYO1D_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ELECTION-MADURO-PROFILE-1767513250.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C534&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4213603\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro gestures during an event in Caracas, Venezuela, December 8, 2022  [Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-did-trump-decide-he-needed-to-remove-maduro\">Why did Trump decide he needed to remove Maduro?</h2><p>After US President Trump returned to office for a second term in January last year, he upped the ante against the Venezuelan leader.</p><p>The Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on Caracas, doubled the bounty on Maduro, and imposed sanctions on his family members.</p><p>Since September, US forces have conducted strikes on vessels off the Venezuelan coast, which the White House alleges were involved in “narco-terrorism”.</p><p>Saturday came the tipping point, when Maduro and his wife were abducted by US special forces and taken to the US to face trial on charges brought against them in the US.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4213600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2018-08-04T232211Z_1404503989_RC1198793F00_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-MADURO-1767513238.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C460&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4213600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro attends a military event in Caracas on August 4, 2018 [Miraflores Palace/Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

She is the daughter of left-wing rebel fighter Jorge Antonio Rodriguez, who founded the Socialist League party in the 1970s. Her father was killed while tortured in police custody in 1976, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.</p><p>Rodriguez’s brother, also named Jorge, also holds a key role in government as the head of the National Assembly.</p><p>She is an attorney who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela and rose rapidly through the political ranks in the past decade. Rodriguez has a long history of representing on the world stage what late President Hugo Chavez called his socialist “revolution” with those carrying on his legacy referred to as Chavistas.</p><p>She served as communication and information minister from 2013 to 2014, foreign minister from 2014 to 2017 and as the head of a pro-government Constituent Assembly, which expanded Maduro’s powers, in 2017.</p><h2 id=\"economic-prowess\">Economic prowess</h2><p>Rodriguez is sometimes perceived as more moderate than many soldiers who took up arms with Chavez in the 1990s.</p><p>Rodriguez’s roles as finance and oil minister, held simultaneously with her vice presidential post, have made her a key figure in the management of Venezuela’s economy and gained her major influence with the country’s withered private sector.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United States intervention in Venezuela to abduct President Nicolás Maduro is not law enforcement extended beyond its borders. It is international vandalism, plain and unadorned.</p><p>Power has displaced law, preference has replaced principle and force has been presented as virtue. This is not the defence of the international order. It is its quiet execution. When a state kidnaps the law to justify kidnapping a leader, it does not uphold order. It advertises contempt for it.</p><p>The forcible seizure of a sitting head of state by the US has no foothold in international law. None. It is not self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It was not authorised by the UN Security Council. International law is many things, but it is not a roving moral warrant for great powers to perform regime change by abduction.</p><p>The claim that alleged human rights violations or trafficking in narcotics justifies the removal of a foreign head of state is particularly corrosive. There is no such rule. Not in treaty law. Not in custom law. Not in any serious jurisprudence.</p><p>Human rights law binds states to standards of conduct. It does not license unilateral military seizures by self-appointed global sheriffs. If that were the rule, the world would be in a permanent state of sanctioned chaos.</p><p>Indeed, if the US were serious about this purported principle, consistency would compel action far closer to home. By the logic now advanced, there would be a far stronger legal and moral case to seize Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, given the extensive documentation of mass civilian harm and credible allegations of genocide arising from Israel’s conduct in Gaza.</p><p>Yet no such logic is entertained. The reason is obvious. This is not law. It is power selecting its targets.</p><p>Regime change is not an aberration in American foreign policy. It is a habit with a long paper trail, from Iran in 1953 to Guatemala in 1954, Chile in 1973 and Iraq in 2003.</p><p>But the kidnapping of a sitting president marks a new low. This is precisely the conduct the post-1945 legal order was designed to prohibit. The ban on the use of force is not a technicality. It is the central nervous system of international law. To violate it without authorisation is to announce that rules bind only the weak.</p><p>The US understands this perfectly. It is acting anyway and in doing so is conducting the autopsy of the UN Charter system itself.</p><p>The rot does not stop there. Washington has repeatedly violated its obligations under the UN Charter and the UN Headquarters Agreement. It has denied entry to officials it disfavours. Preventing the Palestinian president from addressing the UN General Assembly in person last year was not a diplomatic faux pas. It was a treaty breach by the host state of the world’s principal multilateral institution.</p><p>The message was unmistakable. Access to the international system and adherence to the UN Charter is conditional on American approval.</p><p>The UN was designed to constrain power, not flatter it. Today, it increasingly fails to constrain serious international law violations. Paralysed by vetoes, bullied by its host and ignored by those most capable of violating its charter, the UN has drifted from the supposed guardian of legality to a stage prop for its erosion.</p><p>At some point, denial becomes self-deception. The system has failed in its core promise. Not because international law is naive but because its most powerful beneficiary has decided it is optional.</p><p>It is, therefore, time to say the unsayable: The UN should be permanently relocated away from a host state that treats treaty obligations as inconveniences. And the international community must begin a serious, sober conversation about an alternative global structure whose authority is not hostage to one capital, one veto or one currency – or a system whose powers supersede the UN precisely because the UN has been hollowed out from within.</p><p>Law cannot survive as a slogan. Either it restrains those who wield the most force, or it is merely rhetoric deployed against those who do not. What the US has done in Venezuela is not a defence of order. It is a confirmation that international order has been replaced by preference. And preferences, unlike law, recognise no limits.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump later posted a photograph of the Venezuelan leader on his Truth Social social media platform, blindfolded, wearing a grey tracksuit.</p><p>After departing the USS Iwo Jima, US forces escorted Maduro on a flight, touching down in New York’s Stewart Air National Guard Base at about 4:30pm (21:30 GMT).</p><h2 id=\"how-many-people-were-killed-in-the-us-strikes-on-venezuela\">How many people were killed in the US strikes on Venezuela?</h2><p>The US strikes hit Caracas as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to the Venezuelan government.</p><p>To Linda Unamumo, a public worker, the US attacks caused an explosion that was so strong it destroyed the roof of her house.</p><p>“Even up until a little while ago, I was still crying … I was crying because I was so scared … I had to leave my house with my daughter, with my family, and go to another house, a neighbour’s house. It was really traumatic. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, really,” she told the AFP news agency.</p><p>While official casualty counts have yet to be released, an official told The New York Times newspaper on condition of anonymity that at least 40 people had been killed in the attacks.</p><p>According to Trump, a few US members were injured in the operation, but he believed no one was killed.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-venezuela\">What’s next for Venezuela?</h2><p>During his news conference on Saturday, Trump announced that the US would “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-after-nicolas-maduro-seized\">run” the country</a> until a new leader was chosen.</p><p>“We’re going to make sure that country is run properly. We’re not doing this in vain,” he said. “This is a very dangerous attack. This is an attack that could have gone very, very badly.”</p><p>The president did not rule out deploying US troops in the country and said he was “not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to”.</p><p>Trump also, somewhat surprisingly, ruled out working with opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who had dedicated her prize, which he so wanted to win himself, to the US president.</p><p>“She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country,” he said.</p><p>The Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela’s Supreme Court ordered Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to serve as acting president following the US’s abduction of Maduro.</p><p>The court ruled that Rodriguez will assume “the office of President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in order to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defence of the Nation”.</p><p>The court also said it would work to “determine the applicable legal framework to guarantee the continuity of the State, the administration of government, and the defense of sovereignty in the face of the forced absence of the President of the Republic”.</p><p>Trump had said earlier on Saturday that the US would not occupy Venezuela, provided Rodriguez “does what we want”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4213166\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213166\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213166\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25223734718647-1767493833.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delcy Rodriguez addresses the press\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4213166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez speaks to the press at the Foreign Office in Caracas, Venezuela, on August 11, 2025 [Ariana Cubillos/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
