In a speech to the American Business Forum in Florida, the president appeared to walk back his funding threat even as he railed against communism.</p><p>“We’ll help him, we’ll help him. We want New York to be successful. We’ll help him a little bit, maybe,” he said.</p><p>Numerous Republicans and MAGA supporters have launched <a href=\"/news/2025/10/25/zohran-mamdani-defends-his-muslim-faith-against-racist-baseless-attacks\">vitriolic and racist attacks</a> on Mamdani in the build-up to the mayoral election and after Mamdani swept to victory.</p><p>Days before the election day, Mamdani gave an emotional speech addressing “racist, baseless attacks” from his opponents. Speaking outside a mosque in the Bronx, Mamdani criticised opponents for bringing “hatred to the forefront”, noting that their Islamophobia not only affected him as the Democratic nominee for mayor but also <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/22/nyc-working-class-muslims-see-progress-in-mamdani-but-policies-win-votes\">close to one million Muslims</a> living in New York.</p><p>Earlier this week, Mamdani told reporters his team contacted the White House because he had made a “commitment that showed a willingness to meet with anyone and everyone, so long as it is for the benefit” of New Yorkers.</p><p>“The president ran a campaign where he spoke about a promise to deliver cheaper groceries, a promise to reduce the cost of living,” Mamdani said. “We are seeing his actions … leading to the exact opposite effect for New Yorkers. I will go to make the case, to the president, and to anyone, frankly, that these are the kinds of things we need to change.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it was only in 2017, when she was bedridden for 11 months after having cancer treatment, that she picked it up again.</p><p>The first time Mwangi was diagnosed, it was with spine cancer. Housebound and wanting to pass the time, she decided to knit hats, which she ended up donating to cancer patients at Kenyatta National Hospital.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Then the next year, in 2018, her world was shaken when she was diagnosed again – this time with stage-three breast cancer.</p><p>“I felt like it was the end of me when the diagnosis came out,” said the 52-year-old mother of three, who recalls being “terrified” at the news.</p><p>She isolated herself from friends and family and even turned off her phone. “I told my husband that I don’t want to interact with anyone; the world felt so violent.”</p><p>Mwangi had to undergo a mastectomy – a surgical removal of part or all of a breast – and 33 sessions of radiotherapy. In all, she was in treatment for four years, losing her hair and her savings in the process.</p><p>“I had taken a 1.3-million-Kenyan-shilling (about $10,000) loan to expand my business as a tailor, and all was swept [away] by treatment,” she lamented.</p><p>Added to the physical and financial devastation was the social discrimination.</p><p>Though the mastectomy helped save her life, it brought stigma in her community in central Kenya, some 40km (24.8 miles) northeast of the capital Nairobi.</p><p>“People referred to me as the woman whose breasts were cut,” said Mwangi, who was declared cancer-free in 2020. “Losing them affects your dignity.”</p><p>She soon realised that she wasn’t the only one: While at the cancer ward of a local hospital, she noticed other women were hiding their chests under big scarves and baggy clothes. When she spoke to them, she learned that they, too, had undergone mastectomies.</p><p>Although there are several cancer survivor support groups in Kenya that offer screening and counselling services, some of them for free, experts say the public health system often lacks adequate oncology and follow-up care, with many survivors left to navigate recovery on their own.</p><p>Determined to help others like herself, Mwangi thought of what got her through her illness: knitting. And then she came up with an idea to support survivors while earning money: knitted breast prostheses made of colourful cotton yarn.</p><p>At a cancer support group she attended while ill, one of the sessions taught the participants to make yarn breast prostheses. Mwangi learned the basics from there and later watched tutorials on YouTube before she began practising to perfect her craft.</p><p>“Thank God for knitting. It was a form of simple therapy for me,” Mwangi said. “It took my mind away from thinking about [the cancer].”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4114599\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4114599\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4114599\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2020-02-14T070110Z_1826411990_RC270F980A4C_RTRMADP_3_KENYA-HEALTH-1763463867.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C493&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4114599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A patient is seen through the glass as she undergoes a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer at a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya [File: Njeri Mwangi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"physical-and-psychological-care\">Physical and psychological care</h2><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, according to the World Health Organization. Kenya’s National Cancer Institute says it affects more than 6,700 women in the country every year.</p><p>Many undergo mastectomies and are left searching for prosthetic breasts.</p><p>But in Kenya, one silicone prosthetic costs an estimated 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($170) according to Mwangi, making them unaffordable to many – more than 40 percent of Kenya’s population lives <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">below the international poverty</a> line of $3 per day, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Mwangi sells each prosthetic she knits for 1,500 Kenyan shillings ($11,60).</p><p>They come in different sizes and colours and are filled with yarn before being placed into specially adapted bras with pockets, which are sold separately for between 1,000 ($7.74) and 2,000 Kenyan shillings ($15.49) each.</p><p>Mwangi produces about 50 pieces a week, and to date, has sold about 600 breast prostheses, as well as more than 450 knitted hats for cancer patients.</p><p>She sells her products in cash at her shop, but also in bulk to organisations she has partnered with – like Milele Health, Kenyatta National Hospital and Childhood Cancer Initiative – who then donate them to survivors.</p><p>This has helped her rebuild her business, while also continuing to aid those in need.</p><p>Mwangi also tries to help through the New Dawn Cancer Warriors support group she leads, which brings survivors together to share their stories.</p><p>She recounts the day a 33-year-old survivor called Jane joined the group, at first sitting at the back of the room, too nervous to speak.</p><p>When Mwangi spoke to her privately, she learned that her confidence had dropped since having a mastectomy. So she encouraged her, making her see that the loss of a breast does not devalue a woman, and also donated a knitted prosthesis to help her. Slowly, she says, Jane regained her confidence, and after five months, she was sitting at the front during group meetings and contributing. Today, Mwangi says her self-esteem and courage have returned.</p><p>Joy Kulet, a psychologist in Kenya who sees many women who have had mastectomies, says knitted prosthetics not only provide an affordable solution, but also help restore self-confidence.</p><p>“Losing a breast for a woman is more than physical; it is psychological,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109642\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109642\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109642\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hanna-Nungari-Mugo-1763286323.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C497&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109642\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hannah Nungari Mugo, a breast cancer survivor, used to be a vegetable seller but now knits to earn money to support her family [Daniel Kipchumba/Egab]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"knitting-gave-me-purpose\">‘Knitting gave me purpose’</h2><p>In Thika town, the sound of busy sewing machines can be heard from outside Mwangi’s tailoring shop.</p><p>Inside, finished clothes hang on the wall near two women focused on sewing. Once in a while, they exchange jokes and laugh heartily as their experienced hands continue feeding fabric into their machines.</p><p>As the sewing continues, Mwangi sits nearby, knitting a prosthetic breast. When she finishes, she immediately begins stuffing it with wool-like fibre, before moving on to make another piece.</p><p>Beside her, the colourful knitted breast prostheses are on display on a table.</p><p>Most of the breast prostheses Mwangi sells have been made by her, but some – especially when she receives big orders – are made by women she’s trained, who she hires to help with the knitting.</p><p>Since January, Mwangi says she has taught more than 200 women to knit during informal lessons she holds in her tailoring shop.</p><p>“Knitting has not only saved me, it has also given me purpose,” said Mwangi.</p><p>Among those she has trained is 46-year-old Hannah Nungari Mugo, a former vegetable trader at Thika market and also a breast cancer survivor.</p><p>Mugo underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 2019. As her hair fell out and her body became weak, her husband took out a 500,000 Kenyan shilling ($3,800) loan to keep them afloat.</p><p>“It consumed all the savings we had,” she said.</p><p>But like Mwangi, the stigma that followed was one of the worst parts of the experience, she says. In her neighbourhood, people saw her as “fragile” and excluded her from activities.</p><p>“I joined [Mwangi’s] training and after just a few weeks, I had the basics,” she said. She now makes approximately seven prostheses a week to sell at Mwangi’s store, which earns her an income to support her family.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109651\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109651\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109651\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mary-Patricia-Karobia-1763286390.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mary Patricia Karobia, a liver transplant survivor, is part of Mwangi’s knitting and support group [Daniel Kipchumba/Egab]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"sharing-stories-is-part-of-healing\">Sharing stories is ‘part of healing’</h2><p>The workshops aren’t just for breast cancer survivors. Others struggling with different health conditions have also participated, like 58-year-old Mary Patricia Karobia, who uses the opportunity to share her own story of stigma and survival.</p><p>In 2011, she was diagnosed with liver fibrosis and underwent a successful liver transplant. But just like Mwangi and Mugo, discrimination awaited.</p><p>“People were whispering that my liver was removed,” she said, recalling that she was excluded from activities and duties at women’s events, as she was believed to be too weak to contribute.</p><p>She felt marginalised. But then she came across Mwangi and her space that enabled women to talk about their experiences with others going through something similar, and she was inspired to join.</p><p>“I now knit four [prostheses] each week,” Karobia said. “Apart from earning me an income, making prosthetics gives me joy as I am helping breast cancer survivors regain their self-esteem.”</p><p>“The healing journey [from cancer] is unique for each individual. For some, it is smooth, but others relapse along the way,” said Kulet, the psychologist, adding that community support groups like Mwangi’s are essential.</p><p>“Sharing their story is part of healing,” she said, especially in spaces where survivors can share openly without fear of judgement.</p><p>Mwangi considers her work to be part of the larger healing process for breast cancer survivors who have undergone mastectomies. She says she has witnessed improved self-esteem and courage in many of the women who have acquired the prostheses – something that makes her proud.</p><p>For now, due to space constraints, Mwangi’s training workshops can only accommodate four people at a time. And financially, she is limited: she can’t register as a training school due to a lack of funds; the price of yarn also fluctuated a few times this year – from 450 Kenyan shillings ($3.40) to almost double that – forcing her to sometimes raise prices.</p><p>But she remains hopeful.</p><p>“My dream is to train as many cancer survivors as possible in Kenya,” she said. She wants them all to have their own independent businesses one day, so that hopefully, they too can “earn a living through knitting”.</p><p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This makes India one of the three nations most affected by <a href=\"/news/2021/10/26/india-climate-change-migration-poverty-extreme-weather\">internal displacements</a> due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.</p><p>Moreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.</p><h2 id=\"zero-adaptation-money-for-two-years\">Zero adaptation money for two years</h2><p>To help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.</p><p>Managed by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of <a href=\"/news/2023/3/29/indias-warm-weather-plans-exclude-the-most-vulnerable-report\">vulnerable households</a>.</p><p>During a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.</p><p>“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.</p><p>In another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.</p><p>“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.</p><p>But the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.</p><p>Government records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.</p><p>Since the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.</p><p>As a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.</p><p>“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.</p><p>An official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.</p><p>“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p><h2 id=\"limate-injustice-at-its-most-blatant\">‘Climate injustice at its most blatant’</h2><p>Meanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.</p><p>In the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.</p><p>“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.</p><p>This year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Behera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>In West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.</p><p>In the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.</p><p>“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.</p><p>In the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.</p><p>Thakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4096819\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4096819\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4096819\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s2-1762773236.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The government-provided tarpaulin tents in Reasi district are too small for residents to stand\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4096819\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The government provided tarpaulin tents to affected families in Kashmir’s Reasi district, while the photo on the right shows Qamar Din’s relatives watching helplessly as his house collapses [Junaid Manzoor Dar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Yet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.</p><p>A government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.</p><p>“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”</p><p>Activist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.</p><p>“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.</p><p>“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”</p><h2 id=\"migration-no-longer-a-choice-but-a-survival-strategy\">‘Migration no longer a choice but a survival strategy’</h2><p>Climate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.</p><p>“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Bhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.</p><p>“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.</p><p>“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”</p><p>Bhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.</p><p>“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.</p><p>Back at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.</p><p>“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.</p><p>“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Unable to visit him or communicate with him, his relatives are only able to receive updates from the US embassy.</p><p>The teenager has been suffering from severe weight loss while in detention, his father, Zaher Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera earlier this year. He also contracted scabies, a contagious skin infection.</p><p>The last visit he received from US embassy staff was in September.</p><p>Israeli authorities have committed <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/its-israeli-policy-report-reveals-abuse-of-palestinians-in-prisons\">well-documented abuses</a> against Palestinian detainees, including torture and sexual violence, especially after the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.</p><p>“We hear and see people getting out of prison and what they look like, and we know it’s bad,” Kadur said.</p><p>“Mohammed is an American kid who was taken at 15. He is now 16, and he’s been sitting there for nine months and hasn’t seen his mom, hasn’t seen his dad.”</p><p>He added that the family is also concerned about Mohammed’s mental health.</p><p>“We’re requesting that he gets sent to a hospital and evaluated by a third party, not by a prison medic or nurse. He needs some actual attention,” Mohammed’s uncle told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Mohammed, who is from Florida, was visiting Palestine when in the middle of the night he was arrested, blindfolded and beaten in what Kadur described as a “kidnapping”.</p><p>The US Department of State did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the latest consular visit to Mohammed.</p><p>When Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Israel last month, he appeared to have misheard a question about Palestinian prisoner <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/marwan-barghoutis-son-says-family-fears-for-his-life-in-israeli-prison-2\">Marwan Barghouti</a> and thought it was about Mohammed’s case.</p><p>“Are you talking about the one from the US?

I think he’s morally unfit to be president,” Comey told ABC News in 2018.</p><p>He added that a president must “embody respect” and adhere to basic values like truth-telling. “This president is not able to do that,” Comey said.</p><p>In Wednesday’s hearing, Comey’s defence also pointed to the series of events leading up to the former FBI director’s indictment.</p><p>Last September, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media a message to Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling Comey and James “guilty as hell” and encouraging her not to “delay any longer” in seeking their indictments.</p><p>That message was “effectively an admission that this is a political prosecution”, according to Dreeben, Comey’s lawyer.</p><p>Shortly after the message was posted online, Halligan was appointed as acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia</p><p>She replaced a prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who had reportedly declined to indict Comey and others for lack of evidence. Trump had denounced him as a “woke RINO”, an acronym that stands for “Republican in name only”.</p><p>Dreeben argued that switcheroo also signalled Trump’s vindictive intent and his spearheading of the Comey indictment.</p><p>But Lemons, representing the Justice Department, told Judge Nachmanoff that Comey “was not indicted at the direction of the president of the United States or any other government official”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
