Three other protesters, all reported to be teenagers, were injured in the incident. Israeli media reports say the bus driver had previously been attacked by demonstrators before driving into the crowd.</p><p>Netanyahu issued a statement on Wednesday morning, pledging that the incident would be thoroughly investigated and urging “restraint to prevent the mood from becoming further inflamed so that, heaven forbid, we do not have additional tragedies”.</p><p></p><p>Anger over the exemption of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox students dates back to early attempts in 1999 to formalise what had previously been a de facto arrangement, with Haredi leaders arguing that young men should be allowed to focus on full-time religious study to preserve Jewish law and tradition, rather than be conscripted to join the army, as other Israeli Jews are.</p><p>However, legal challenges to the exemption, most recently from the Supreme Court late last year demanding that Haredi recruitment be enforced, combined with reports of manpower shortages linked to Israel’s military conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight.</p><p>Polls show broad public support for the ending of the exemption, a notion publicly backed by Netanyahu. But two of the prime minister’s key coalition partners, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and Shas, have repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the government or vote against the state budget, triggering new elections, unless legislation is passed preserving Haredi exemptions or limiting conscription for students at Israel’s ultra-Orthodox schools, known as yeshivas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“You need to remember, these aren’t political parties in the conventional sense,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said, characterising UTJ and Shas as operating to the benefit of their community and not wider society. “They are elected as parties to operate as pressure groups inside the Knesset [parliament]. They know that no one outside of their own ultra-Orthodox community will vote for them, and they really have no interest in persuading them to do so.”</p><p>“All they have is their own religious base, with a proportion in society that is constantly increasing,” added Mekelberg. “Preserving that base, for the large part, is about keeping them out of the army where they might encounter different types of approaches to religion, including secularism, which their rabbis are afraid would tempt and corrupt them.”</p><h2 id=\"bitter-debate\">Bitter debate</h2><p>Despite the limited deaths, the Israeli army has incurred compared to the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed during its genocidal war on Gaza, anger over the Haredi communities’ apparent exemption from the draft has grown among a society <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/two-years-into-its-war-on-gaza-israel-is-fractured-isolated-analysts\">fractured</a> from two years of unrelenting conflict.</p><p>An autumn poll last year showed an overwhelming number of Israeli respondents saw the societal schism between secular and ultra-Orthodox Israelis as one of the most divisive issues facing contemporary Israel.</p><p>Responding to the death of Eisenthal, UTJ’s Meir Porush told reporters, “It is impossible to ignore the fact that more than once during demonstrations by the ultra-Orthodox public, there is a public atmosphere that it is permissible to harm the demonstrators.”</p><p>“The situation in which incitement is rampant against the ultra-Orthodox public is causing Jews to fear for their safety in the Land of Israel,” Porush continued. “I call on all public leaders to call for an end to the harm and incitement against the ultra-Orthodox public.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-22T172528Z_145204992_RC25HHAT7N13_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-CONSCRIPTION-PROTEST-1765889244.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An Israeli police officer pulls an ultra-Orthodox Jew during a protest.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police clash with ultra-orthodox protesters during a previous protest over compulsory enlistment in West Jerusalem [Ammar Awad/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>“There’s very little sympathy for the ultra-Orthodox among much of Israeli society,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst, said. “They’ve gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the rest of the population, so most people don’t really care … Israeli society is broken.”</p><h2 id=\"divisive\">Divisive</h2><p>From Israel’s creation in 1948, a handful of highly skilled ultra-Orthodox scholars were granted exemptions from Israel’s mandatory military service, which applies to most Jewish citizens. However, over the years, the influence of influential religious parties, such as Shas and UTJ, has led to a significant increase in the number of military exemptions, currently estimated at about 90 percent of the <a href=\"/features/2024/7/21/who-are-israels-ultra-orthodox-and-will-conscripting-them-sow-discord\">13,000 ultra-Orthodox</a> men who reach conscription age each year.</p><p>While Shas and UTJ only hold 18 seats in the parliament, the fractured nature of Israeli politics and Netanyahu’s reliance upon the right have given the ultra-Orthodox a disproportionate level of influence.</p><p>“It’s true that they don’t have many seats, but Netanyahu absolutely needs their support to maintain his coalition and remain prime minister,” Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and former political aide to several senior Israeli political figures, including Netanyahu, told Al Jazeera. “It’s true that the ultra-Orthodox parties also need Netanyahu and his government to have any power and relevance in their own communities. But the draft issue is everything. To them, if they lose this: they have nothing.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3898351\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3898351\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250819__69XX4R6__v2__HighRes__TopshotIsraelPoliticsMilitaryReligion-1755640109.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3898351\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man stands in front of a burning fire during a protest against Israeli army conscription in Kfar Yona [John Wessels/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"increasing-influence\">Increasing influence</h2><p>Across Israel, the Haredi are a growing social and political constituency, with both their political heft and the influence of religion across society increasing as their numbers do.</p><p>In 2009, the Haredi made up 9.9 percent of Israel’s population. By 2065, they are forecast to make up more than 30 percent. Alongside this growth, ultra-Orthodox parties are making sure their members’ interests are served and that they remain loyal: all of which could spell problems for Israel’s future.</p><p>“Parties like Shas and UTJ rely on keeping its younger members religious and reliant upon benefits,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>“This is a serious problem, because their numbers are growing,” he added. “An ultra-Orthodox family will typically have six to seven children. It’s unlikely that any of the boys will ever study core subjects like maths or science. Instead, they’ll go to the yeshiva and live off benefits. This is a real demographic problem. And this isn’t a future problem. It’s one that’s happening now.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It reaffirmed its commitment to streaming giant Netflix’s $82.7bn deal for the film and television studio and other assets.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Some investors, however, pushed back on Warner Bros. Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said that the media giant’s board had “made an error” by not considering Paramount’s bid.</p><p>On CNBC on Wednesday, Halbower called the deal “economically superior”.</p><p>Paramount’s financing plan would saddle the smaller Hollywood studio with $87bn in debt once the acquisition closes, making it the largest leveraged buyout in history, the Warner Bros board told shareholders after voting against the $30-per-share cash offer on Tuesday. The letter accompanied a 67-page amended merger filing that laid out its case for rejecting Paramount’s offer.</p><h2 id=\"paramount-deal-remains-inadequate\">Paramount deal ‘remains inadequate’</h2><p>The revised Paramount offer “remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in Paramount Skydance ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should Paramount Skydance fail to complete the offer”, the Warner Bros board wrote.</p><p>Paramount, which has a market value of about $14bn, proposed to use $40bn in equity, which would be personally guaranteed by Oracle’s billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David is Paramount’s CEO, and $54bn in debt to finance the deal.</p><p>Its financing plan would further weaken its credit rating, which S&amp;P Global already rates at junk levels, and strain its cash flow – heightening the risk that the deal will not close, the Warner Bros board said. Netflix, which has offered $27.75 a share in cash and stock, has a $400bn market value and investment-grade credit rating.</p><p>The decision keeps Warner Bros on track to pursue the deal with Netflix, even after Paramount amended its bid on December 22 to address the earlier concerns about the lack of a personal guarantee from Ellison, who is Paramount’s controlling shareholder.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount and Netflix have been vying to win control of Warner Bros, and with it, its prized film and television studios and its extensive content library. Its lucrative entertainment franchises include  Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Friends, and the DC Comics universe; as well as coveted classic films such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-applauds\">Netflix applauds</h2><p>Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters welcomed Warner Bros’ decision on Wednesday, saying it recognises the streaming giant’s deal “as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry”.</p><p>Warner Bros Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC that the company was not currently in talks with Paramount but remains open to a transaction with the Ellison-led firm, and both the deals have a path to regulatory approval.</p><p>“From our perspective, they’ve got to put something on the table that is compelling,” he said, referring to the Paramount offer.</p><p>Wednesday’s filing said Warner Bros’ board met on December 23 to review Paramount’s amended offer and noted some improvements, including Ellison’s personal guarantee and a higher reverse termination fee of $5.8bn, but found “significant costs” associated with Paramount’s bid compared with a Netflix deal.</p><p>Warner Bros would be obligated to pay the streaming service a $2.8bn termination fee for abandoning its merger agreement with Netflix, $1.5bn in fees to its lenders and about $350m in additional financing costs. Altogether, Warner Bros said it would incur about $4.7bn in additional costs to terminate its deal with Netflix, or $1.79 per share.</p><p>The board repeated some concerns it had laid out on December 17, such as that Paramount would impose operating restrictions on the studio that would harm its business and competitive position, including barring the planned spin-out of the company’s cable television networks into a separate public company, Discovery Global.</p><p>Paramount offered “insufficient compensation” for the damage done to the studio’s business, if the Paramount deal failed to close, Warner Bros said.</p><p>Paramount “repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal” to Warner Bros shareholders, the board wrote, “despite clear direction” on the deficiencies in its bid and potential solutions.</p><p>The jockeying for Warner Bros has become Hollywood’s most closely watched takeover battle, as studios race to scale up amid intensifying competition from streaming platforms and volatile theatrical revenues.</p><p>While Netflix’s offer has a lower headline value, analysts have said it presents a clearer financing structure and fewer execution risks than Paramount’s bid for the entire company, including its cable TV business.</p><p>“WBD does not want to sell to Paramount, so it will keep rejecting Paramount as long as it is able to,” said Ross Benes, an analyst at eMarketer.</p><p>“But this process is not over … Paramount will have opportunity to make further attempts.”</p><p>Harris Oakmark, Warner Bros’ fifth-largest investor, previously told Reuters that Paramount’s revised offer was not “sufficient”, noting it was not enough to cover the breakup fee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount has argued its bid would face fewer regulatory obstacles, but a combined Paramount-Warner Bros entity would create a formidable competitor to industry leader Disney and merge two major television operators and two streaming services.</p><p>The valuation of Warner Bros’ planned Discovery Global spin-off, which includes cable television networks CNN, TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service, is seen as a major sticking point. Analysts peg the cable channels’ value at up to $4 per share, while Paramount has suggested just $1.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about further consolidation in the media industry, and US President Donald Trump has said he plans to <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weigh in</a> on the landmark acquisition.</p><p>On Wall Street, Warner Bros Discovery is up 0.3 percent in midday trading amid the news of the rejected bid. Netflix is also up 0.3. Meanwhile, Paramount is down 0.1 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have made it clear that they are especially not interested in becoming part of the US.</p><p>On January 4, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, “It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the US needing to take over Greenland.”</p><p>“The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom,” she said, alluding to the Faroe Islands, which, like Greenland, are also a Danish territory.</p><p>“I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.</p><p>US special forces <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/abduction_n?tl=true\">abducted</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during an operation in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on January 3.</p><p>Hours later, Katie Miller, the wife of close Trump aide and US Homeland Security Advisor <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">Stephen Miller</a>, posted a photo on X showing the US flag imposed on the map of Greenland.</p><p></p><p>Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen hit back in an X post, writing, “Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights.”</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland-so-badly\">Why does Trump want Greenland so badly?</h2><p>The location and natural resources of the Arctic island make it strategically important for Washington.</p><p>Greenland is geographically part of North America, located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It is home to some 56,000 residents, mostly <a href=\"/program/witness/2021/6/17/the-fight-for-greenland-a-new-generation-speaks\">Indigenous Inuit people</a>.</p><p>It is the world’s largest island. Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, is closer to New York City  – some 2,900km (1,800 miles) away – than the Danish capital Copenhagen, which is located 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>Greenland, a NATO territory through Denmark, is an EU-associated overseas country and territory whose residents remain European Union citizens, having joined the European Community with Denmark in 1973 but having withdrawn in 1985.</p><p>“It’s really tricky if the United States decides to use military power to take over Greenland. Denmark is a member of NATO; the United States is a member as well. It really calls into question what the purpose of the military alliance is, if that happens,” Melinda Haring, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Greenland offers the shortest route from North America to Europe. This gives the US a strategic upper hand for its military and its ballistic missile early-warning system.</p><p>The US has expressed interest in expanding its military presence in Greenland by placing radars in the waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom. These waters are a gateway for Russian and Chinese vessels, which Washington aims to track.</p><p>The island is also incredibly rich in minerals, including rare earth minerals used in the high-tech industry and in the manufacture of batteries.</p><p>According to a 2023 survey, 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland.</p><p>Greenland does not carry out the extraction of oil and gas, and its mining sector is opposed by its Indigenous population. The island’s economy is largely reliant on its fishing industry.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3429559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greenland-Map-jan-8-2024-1736341778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Where is Greenland Map\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"are-chinese-and-russian-ships-swarming-greenland\">Are Chinese and Russian ships swarming Greenland?</h2><p>However, while Trump has spoken of Russian and Chinese ships around Greenland, currently, facts don’t bear that out.</p><p>Vessel tracking data from maritime data and intelligence websites such as MarineTraffic do not show the presence of Chinese or Russian ships near Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"are-russia-and-china-a-threat-to-greenland\">Are Russia and China a threat to Greenland?</h2><p>The ships’ location aside, Trump’s rhetoric comes amid a heightened <a href=\"/news/2025/3/28/is-trumps-greenland-plan-part-of-a-scramble-for-the-arctic\">scramble</a> for the Arctic.</p><p>Amid global warming, the vast untapped resources of the Arctic are becoming more accessible. Countries like the US, Canada, China and Russia are now eyeing these resources.</p><p>“Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernising military infrastructure,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said during an address in March 2025 at the International Arctic Forum in the Russian city of Murmansk, the largest city within the Arctic Circle.</p><p>During this address, Putin said that he believed Trump was serious about taking Greenland and that the US will continue with efforts to acquire it.</p><p>In December 2024, <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/why-is-canada-scrambling-to-counter-russia-china-in-the-arctic\">Canada released a policy document</a> detailing plans to ramp up its military and diplomatic presence in the Arctic. Russia is also <a href=\"/features/2022/3/28/what-is-behind-russias-interest-in-a-warming-arctic\">constructing military installations</a> and power plants in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia and China have been <a href=\"/news/2024/7/23/us-wary-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-increasingly-strategic-arctic\">working together</a> to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions while <a href=\"/program/101-east/2022/3/3/behind-chinas-rise-in-the-arctic\">Beijing seeks an alternative shipping route</a> to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca.</p><p>The Northern Sea Route (NSR), a maritime route in the Arctic Ocean, is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice. The NSR can cut shipping trips significantly short. Russia is hoping to ramp up commerce through the NSR to trade more with Asia than Europe due to Western sanctions. Last year, the number of oil shipments from Russia to China via the NSR rose by a quarter.</p><p>China is also probing the region, and has sent 10 scientific expeditions to the Arctic and built research vessels to survey the icy waters north of Russia.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rubio has echoed Trump in his comments in recent days.</p><p data-v-a500cf4d=\"\">But what has been holding back the flow of Venezuelan oil, preventing the country from attracting investments and driving the country into poverty?</p><p>A key reason is one that Trump and Rubio have been silent about: Washington’s own efforts to strangle Venezuela’s oil industry and economy through sanctions, which also have set off a refugee crisis.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-venezuelan-oil\">What has Trump said about Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday night, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/7/trump-says-venezuela-to-hand-over-up-to-50-million-barrels-of-oil-to-us\">Trump said</a> Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the US.</p><p>Trump wrote: “This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!”</p><p>Trump added that he had directed his energy secretary, Chris Wright, to execute the plan “immediately”.</p><p>“It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States,” Trump wrote.</p><p>During the news conference on Saturday, Trump said US oil companies would fix Venezuela’s “broken infrastructure” and “start making money for the country”.</p><p>Earlier Trump had accused<span> Venezuela in a Truth Social post of “stealing” US oil, land and other assets and using that oil to fund crime, “terrorism” and human trafficking. Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">made similar claims</a> in recent days.</span></p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-the-us-to-take-venezuelan-oil\">What does it mean for the US to take Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>Oil is trading at roughly $56 per barrel.</p><p>Based on this price, 30 million barrels of oil would be worth $1.68bn and 50 million barrels of oil would be worth $2.8bn.</p><p>“Trump’s statement about oil in Venezuela is beyond an act of war; it is an act of colonisation. That is also illegal based on the UN Charter,” Vijay Prashad, the director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research based in Argentina, Brazil, India, and South Africa, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that the US involvement in Venezuela was “less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits”.</p><p>“This [oil] is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources.”</p><p>According to the website of the US Energy Information Administration, the US consumed an average of 20.25 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2023.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-rubio-said-about-venezuelan-oil\">What has Rubio said about Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>In an interview on the NBC TV network’s Meet the Press programme that aired on Sunday, Rubio said: “We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela.”</p><p>“No more drug trafficking … and no more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world and not benefitting the people of Venezuela or, frankly, benefitting the United States and the region,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio said in the interview that since 2014, about eight million Venezuelans have fled the country, which he attributed to theft and corruption by Maduro and his allies. According to a report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from May, nearly 7.9 million people have indeed left Venezuela.</p><p>But he was silent on the US’s own role in creating that crisis.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-us-sanctions-against-venezuela-s-oil\">What are the US sanctions against Venezuela’s oil?</h2><p>Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 under then-President Carlos Andres Perez during an oil boom. He established the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) to control all oil resources.</p><p>Venezuela continued to be a major oil exporter to the US for some years, supplying 1.5 million to 2 million barrels per day in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>After President Hugo Chavez took office in 1998, he nationalised all oil assets, seized foreign-owned assets, restructured the PDVSA and prioritised using oil revenue for social programmes in Venezuela.</p><p>From 2003 to 2007, Venezuela under Chavez managed to <a href=\"https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/93923/weisbrot_revista_fall_08.pdf\">cut its poverty rate in half</a> – from 57 percent to 27.5 percent. Extreme poverty fell even more sharply, by 70 percent.</p><p>But exports declined, and government authorities were accused of mismanagement.</p><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil in retaliation for nationalising US oil assets in 2005.</p><p>Under US sanctions, many senior Venezuelan government officials and companies have been barred from accessing any property or financial assets held in the US. They cannot access US bank accounts, sell property or access their money if it passes through the US financial system.</p><p>Critically, any US companies or citizens doing business with any sanctioned individual or company will be penalised and risk becoming subject to enforcement actions.</p><p>Maduro took over as president in 2013 after Chavez’s death. In 2017, Trump, during his first term in office, imposed more sanctions and tightened them again in 2019. This further restricted sales to the US and access for Venezuelan companies to the global financial system. As a result, oil exports to the US nearly stopped, and Venezuela shifted its trade mainly to China with some sales to India and Cuba.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-family-venezuelan-tankers-what-we-know\">imposed yet more sanctions</a> – this time on Maduro family members and Venezuelan tankers carrying sanctioned oil.</p><p>Today, the PDVSA controls the petroleum industry in Venezuela, and US involvement in Venezuelan oil drilling is limited. Houston-based Chevron is the only US company that still operates in Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-hurt-venezuela-s-oil-flows\">How have sanctions hurt Venezuela’s oil flows?</h2><p>Trump might today be interested in getting Venezuelan oil flowing, but it is US sanctions that blocked that flow in the first place.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a region in the eastern part of the country stretching across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>While the country is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels – it earns only a fraction of the revenue it once did from exporting crude.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, Venezuela exported $4.05bn of crude oil in 2023. This is far below other major exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn).</p><h2 id=\"how-have-us-sanctions-hurt-venezuelans-and-the-country-s-oil-infrastructure\">How have US sanctions hurt Venezuelans and the country’s oil infrastructure?</h2><p>The US sanctions on Venezuelan oil prevent US and non-US companies from doing business with the PDVSA. Because the US is a market no one wants to lose, firms, including banks, are wary of taking any steps that could invite Washington’s sanctions.</p><p>In effect, that has meant Venezuela’s oil industry has been almost entirely deprived of international financial investment.</p><p>The sanctions additionally restrict Venezuela from accessing oilfield equipment, specialised software, drilling services and refinery components from Western companies.</p><p>This has resulted in years of underinvestment in the PDVSA’s infrastructure, leading to chronic breakdowns, shutdowns and accidents.</p><p>The sanctions have also resulted in broader economic turmoil.</p><p>The country’s gross domestic product per capita stood at about $4,200 in 2024, according to World Bank data, down from more than $13,600 in 2010.</p><p>From about 2012, the economy went into a sharp decline, driven by domestic economic policies, a slump that was later deepened by US sanctions. The resulting hardships have pushed millions of Venezuelans to leave the country – the same people who Trump and Rubio now argue should benefit from Venezuela’s oil revenues.</p><h2 id=\"does-the-us-have-any-claim-to-venezuelan-oil\">Does the US have any claim to Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>US companies began drilling for oil in Venezuela in the early 1900s.</p><p>In 1922, vast petroleum reserves were initially discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in Lake Maracaibo in Zulia state in northwestern Venezuela.</p><p>At this point, US companies ramped up their investments in the extraction and development of Venezuelan oil reserves. Companies such as Standard Oil led development under concession agreements, propelling Venezuela to a position as a key global supplier, especially for the US.</p><p>Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC, joining at its creation on September 14, 1960. OPEC is a group of major oil-exporting countries that work together to manage supply and influence global oil prices.</p><p>But the claims by Trump and Miller that Venezuela somehow “stole” US oil are baseless under international law, experts said.</p><p>The principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, adopted by the UN General Assembly in a resolution in 1962, is clear that sovereign states have the inherent right to control, use and dispose of their resources for their own development.</p><p>In other words, Venezuela alone owns its oil.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>2025 was the year the world relearned a fundamental truth: conflicts are not confined within discrete borders. A war in one region now pushes migration across continents, disrupts food and energy markets, strains humanitarian systems, and reshapes global alliances. If the battlefield is local, the shockwaves are global.</p><p>Two small states, Norway and Qatar, have in this environment made mediation not an instrument of goodwill, but a core instrument of security policy. Diplomacy is, for both of us, not a matter of public ritual or symbolic gesture: it is a strategic responsibility in a world where unresolved conflicts return inevitably through different channels. Stability is achieved by means of access, credibility, and the capacity to keep adversaries engaged in political dialogue even when trust has collapsed.</p><p>“Time has its revolutions”, as an old phrase goes, and as the world turns toward 2026 a different mindset of truly transformative scale is urgently needed. The international system has for too long normalized disruption. 2026 must normalize peace. Mediation is no longer merely the moral option: it is the strategic one. It is the only means of dispute settlement capable of truly disrupting escalation before escalation truly disrupts the world.</p><p>For Norway and Qatar, 2025 has delivered harsh but invaluable lessons in what effective mediation actually requires — not sweeping diplomatic triumphs, but the disciplined, often unseen work of keeping crises from consuming entire regions.</p><p>Four examples of effective mediation</p><p>Few conflicts have shocked the world’s conscience more than the war in Gaza. While the two-state solution is still an unfinished mediation project, many issues have been resolved through diplomatic channels, with our countries positioned at the very center of these efforts.</p><p>Even while hostilities intensified and tensions escalated, confiscated tax funds were released, prisoners freed, hostages returned to their loved ones and humanitarian access improved. Our experience tells us that humanitarian relief operations, and political tracks cannot be separated or stymied. One cannot survive without the other: unless diplomacy and humanitarianism advance together, neither can succeed.</p><p>Our ongoing engagement in the Sudan do not only seek to reduce violence and improve humanitarian access. It is also to reaffirm that there is no credible alternative to a political process that safeguards unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and stability. Surely any sustainable path forward must reflect the aspirations of the Sudanese people, protect against foreign intervention, and safeguard state institutions from collapse.</p><p>Our efforts in the Great Lakes and the Sahel have reinforced a simple but often neglected reality: regional peace requires regional responsibility. Stability cannot be outsourced. As the UN Security Council has stressed, no mediation initiative can be viable without ownership and full involvement of all relevant parties.</p><p>In Colombia, we came together once again to help bring an end to more than twenty years of armed conflict involving one of Colombia’s most powerful armed groups, the El Ejercito Gaitanista de Colombia (EEGC). At the margins of the Doha Forum last year, we witnessed the signing of new commitments between the Government of Colombia and the EEGC—another significant stride toward lasting peace and stability in Colombia and the wider region.</p><p>These experiences differ in context, but they combine to provide the same answer: mediation is crisis insurance. It prevents regional disasters from becoming global ones.</p><p>If 2025 revealed the limits of military power, 2026 will reveal whether the world is willing to invest in peace before it is forced instead to bankroll reconstruction. It will test whether political dialogue can become the first line of defence rather than some last-ditch attempt.</p><p>Moving from crisis management to crisis prevention</p><p>Five shifts are essential if we are to move from crisis management to crisis prevention.</p><p>First, we must invest in mediation early, not after the collapse. The cost of preventative diplomacy is, for all of us, a fraction of the price to be paid after war has already erupted.</p><p>Second, our efforts must be guided always by international law: truly lasting solutions, capable of standing the test of time, can be achieved only in accordance with international legitimacy achieved through adherence to the law.</p><p>Third, humanitarian access is non-negotiable. Civilians cannot be used as leverage in political or military logic.

Even the most carefully drafted agreements will, if there is no monitoring or accountability, remain fragile.</p><p>Fith, mediation processes — and those who lead them — must be protected. In an era of disinformation, polarization and targeted attacks, safeguarding mediators is no longer optional; it is essential to the credibility and continuity of any peace effort.</p><p>These are not idealistic demands.

If the world is to make one resolution for 2026, it should be this: seek peace before disruption seeks us.</p><p>The alternative is already visible.

Millions of young people are inheriting conflicts they did not start and may not understand, yet will be expected to endure. In such a world, security becomes reactive, exorbitantly expensive, and ultimately unsustainable.</p><p>Mediation is not what we do when everything else has failed. It is what prevents everything else from failing. This is why the Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to mediation as a means of achieving the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p><p>The value of peace will in 2026 no longer be measured in ideals or statements, but in the stability, the safety, and the economic security it provides to societies, including those far beyond any single conflict zone.</p><p>The choice is between a world that learns from 2025 — and a world that is content to repeat its mistakes.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

Yadoma, 25 and married with children, who had returned home to her parents’ house for a visit, also died in the attack.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We ran with nothing,” said 65-year-old Isa, standing on the parched soil of his farm in the Lake Chad village of Malam Fatori, to which he recently returned. “For more than 10 years, we slept in relatives’ homes. I felt like a stranger in my own country.”</p><p>Before the deadly attack, Isa, a farmer, produced hundreds of bags of rice, maize and beans annually, enough to feed his family and sell in markets in neighbouring Niger.</p><p>After that night, he fled and spent the next decade in displacement camps across the border.</p><p>But last year, he joined thousands of other former residents who have relocated back to Malam Fatori and other towns as part of a resettlement <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/west-africa/nigeria/b184-rethinking-resettlement-and-return-nigerias-north-east\">programme</a> initiated by the government.</p><p>The village sits on the edge of Nigeria’s northeastern frontier, close to the border with Niger, where the vast, flat landscape stretches into open farmland and seasonal wetlands.</p><p>A decade ago, homes there were intact and full, their courtyards echoing with children’s voices and the steady rhythm of daily life. Farms extended well beyond the town’s outskirts, producing grains and vegetables that sustained families and supported local trade.</p><p>Irrigation canals flowed regularly, and the surrounding area was known for its productivity, especially during the dry season. Markets were active, and movement between Malam Fatori and neighbouring communities was normal, not restricted by fear.</p><p>Today, the town carries the visible scars of conflict and neglect, with much of it lying in ruin.</p><p>Rows of mud-brick houses stand roofless or partially collapsed, their walls cracked by years of abandonment. Some homes have been hastily repaired with scrap wood and sheets of metal, signs of families slowly returning and rebuilding with whatever materials they can find.</p><p>The farms surrounding Malam Fatori are beginning to show faint signs of life again. Small plots of millet and sorghum are being cleared by hand, while irrigation channels – once choked with sand and weeds – are gradually being reopened.</p><p>Many fields, however, remain empty, overtaken by thorny bushes and dry grass after years without cultivation. Farmers move cautiously, working close to the town, wary of venturing too far into land that was once fertile but has long been unsafe.</p><p>For returnees like Isa, walking through these spaces means navigating both the present reality and memories of what once was. Each broken wall and abandoned field tells a story of loss, while every newly planted seed signals a quiet determination to restore a town that violence nearly erased.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4219713\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4219713\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219713\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1-1767716660.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malam Fatori\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4219713\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Residents of Malam Fatori buy fish at a local market in the town [Adamu Aliyu Ngulde/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"between-two-pressures-boko-haram-and-the-army\">Between ‘two pressures’: Boko Haram and the army</h2><p>For the Borno State administration, the returns are a success. “There are 5,000 households of returnees in Malam Fatori, while the town’s total population now exceeds 20,000 people,” Usman Tar, Borno State commissioner for information and internal security, told Al Jazeera last year.</p><p>As we toured the town, the security presence was visible. Armed patrols, checkpoints and observation posts were stationed along major routes and near public spaces, reflecting ongoing efforts to deter attacks and reassure residents.</p><p>Families interviewed said they were subjected to frequent security checks and strict movement controls, measures they understand as necessary but which also disrupt daily routines and limit access to farms, markets and neighbouring communities.</p><p>Residents and local officials say the threat remains close. Fighters from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), another armed group active in the area, are believed to be operating from swampy areas approximately two kilometres from the town, using the difficult terrain as cover.</p><p>Although the town itself is under heavy military protection, surrounding areas continue to experience attacks, kidnappings and harassment, particularly along farming routes and access roads.</p><p>These persistent security incidents reinforce a climate of fear and uncertainty among returnees. While many families have chosen to remain and rebuild despite the risks, they say the proximity of armed groups and the ongoing violence in nearby communities make long-term recovery fragile.</p><p>“Here in Malam Fatori, we live under two pressures,” said resident Babagana Yarima. “Boko Haram dictates our safety, and the military dictates our movement. Both limit how we live every day.”</p><p>Farmers wait up to eight hours at military checkpoints when transporting produce. Curfews prevent evening farm work. Access to agricultural land beyond the town requires military permits or armed escorts.</p><p>“Insecurity and military restrictions limit access to farmlands, forcing farmers to cultivate smaller areas than before,” said Bashir Yunus, an agrarian expert at the University of Maiduguri who also farms in the region.</p><p>Fishing, previously a major food source and income generator from Lake Chad, has become dangerous and requires permits to leave the town boundaries.</p><p>“Movement beyond the town’s boundaries now requires military permits. Militant attacks in isolated areas continue,” said Issoufou.</p><p>The United Nations has raised concerns about the government’s resettlement programme, citing potential protection violations. Mohamed Malick, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, said during an interview with journalists in Maiduguri that “any returns or relocations must be informed, voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable”.</p><p>Malick added that the return of refugees to Malam Fatori and other insecure areas must be carefully evaluated against established safety and humanitarian standards, and must only take place if conditions allow for basic services and sustainable livelihoods.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4219715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4219715\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219715\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2-1767716663.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malam Fatori\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4219715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A committee registers returnees from Niger in Malam Fatori [Adamu Aliyu Ngulde/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-man-without-land-is-a-man-without-life\">‘A man without land is a man without life’</h2><p>Settled back on his land, Isa wakes before dawn each day, leaving his home in the quiet hours before the town stirs.</p><p>He walks to the fields that once yielded fertile harvests, now choked with weeds and debris. The land that once fed his family and supported their livelihood now demands relentless effort just to coax a small crop from the exhausted soil.</p><p>‎With each turn of the hoe and careful planting of seeds, he is determined to reclaim a fragment of the life that was disrupted by conflict.</p><p>‎He also participates in community farming initiatives, joining neighbours in collective efforts to restore agricultural production for the returning population and aid the town’s slow recovery.</p><p>‎However, the area he personally cultivates is far smaller than what he once managed, constrained by limited access to tools, seeds and water, as well as by the lingering insecurity in the region.</p><p>‎”A man without land is a man without life,” he said.</p><p>‎‎Most families in Malam Fatori now eat only twice a day, a sharp contrast to life before the conflict. ‎Their meals typically consist of rice or millet, often eaten with little or no vegetables due to cost and limited availability. ‎</p><p>Food prices have risen dramatically, placing further strain on households already struggling to recover. ‎A kilogramme of rice now sells for about 1,200 naira (approximately $0.83), nearly double its previous price, making even basic staples increasingly unaffordable for many families.</p><p>‎Fish, once plentiful and affordable thanks to proximity to Lake Chad, have become scarce and expensive. Insecurity, restricted access to fishing areas, and disrupted supply chains have severely reduced local catches.</p><p>‎At the local market and at aid distribution points, women queue before dawn, hoping to secure small quantities of dried fish, groundnut oil or maize flour when supplies arrive.</p><p>‎Deliveries are irregular and unpredictable, often selling out within hours. Many women say they return home empty-handed after waiting for hours, compounding daily stress and uncertainty about how to feed their families.</p><p>‎Local health workers warn that malnutrition remains a serious concern, particularly among children under the age of five.</p><p>Basic services remain inadequate across town. Roads are poor, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/61552131186636/posts/mallam-fatori-back-to-school-with-nostalgia-and-euphoriaafter-11-years-of-insurg/122267468000071039/\">schools and health clinics </a>operate with minimal resources.</p><p>“Security risks and inaccessible routes through surrounding bushland continue to restrict humanitarian access, preventing aid agencies from reaching several communities. Basic services such as clean water, healthcare and quality education remain inadequate,” Kaka Ali, deputy director of local government primary healthcare, told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4219726\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4219726\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219726\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/7-1767716678.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malam Fatori\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4219726\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Returnee homes in Malam Fatori [Adamu Aliyu Ngulde/ Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Despite ongoing challenges, residents of Malam Fatori are steadily working to rebuild their community and restore livelihoods disrupted by years of conflict.</p><p>‎Across the town, women have organised themselves into small cooperatives, producing handmade mats and processing groundnut oil for household use and local sale.</p><p>‎Fishermen, once central to the local economy, now operate cautiously in small groups in line with security regulations. Along riverbanks and storage areas, they repair damaged canoes and carefully mend fishing nets that were abandoned or destroyed during the conflict.</p><p>‎At the same time, teams of bricklayers are reconstructing homes destroyed during the violence, using locally sourced materials and shared labour to rebuild shelters for returning families.</p><p>The town’s clinic, staffed by six nurses, is overstretched. Vaccinations, malaria treatment and maternal health services are rationed. Power outages and equipment shortages compound the challenges. But it is a lifeline.</p><p>At Malam Fatori Central Primary School, children from the town and surrounding communities are being taught with the few resources available.</p><p>There are only 10 functional classrooms for hundreds of pupils, so some learn outdoors, under trees or in open spaces. There is a shortage of teachers, so some educators brave the conditions and travel long distances from the southern parts of Borno State.</p><p>In another, more unusual arrangement, soldiers stationed in the town occasionally step in to teach basic civic education and history lessons.</p><p>While not a replacement for trained teachers, community leaders say their involvement provides pupils with some continuity in education. The presence of soldiers in classrooms, they say, also reassures parents about security and underscores a shared effort to stabilise the town and rebuild essential services.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4219734\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4219734\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219734\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11-1767716692.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malam Fatori\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4219734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Primary school students in Malam Fatori [Adamu Aliyu Ngulde/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"this-land-contains-our-future\">‘This land contains our future’</h2><p>‎Amid all of the returning and rebuilding, security remains a dominant feature of daily life in Malam Fatori.</p><p>‎Soldiers remain stationed throughout the town<strong>, </strong>at markets and other public spaces to deter attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, former Boko Haram members who have enrolled in a government-led deradicalisation and repentance programme also assist in protecting farmers working on the outskirts of the town, helping to rebuild trust between civilians and security structures.</p><p>Abu Fatima<strong> </strong>is a former Boko Haram fighter who joined the repentance programme. ‎“Troop patrols are constant, curfews dictate daily life,” he said about the security arrangements in Malam Fatori.</p><p>Although residents welcome the security provided by the soldiers’ presence in the town, “many say they feel trapped – unable to fully rebuild the lives they had before Boko Haram, yet unwilling to abandon a homeland that defines them”, he said, echoing the tension felt by many returnees.</p><p>‎Bulama Shettima has also lived through the personal cost of the fighting that has devastated northeast Nigeria. Two of the 60-year-old’s sons joined ISWAP, a tragedy that left the family with deep emotional scars. After years of uncertainty and fear, one of his sons was later deradicalised through a government rehabilitation programme. This has allowed his family to heal and reconcile. Coming back to Malam Fatori is also part of that.</p><p>“Returning wasn’t about safety,” he said. “It was about belonging. This land contains our history. This land contains our grief. This land contains our future.”</p><p>‎Today, Bulama is focused on rebuilding his life and securing a different future for his children.</p><p>‎He works as a farmer, cultivating small plots of land under difficult conditions, while also running a modest business to supplement his income. ‎</p><p>‎Despite his losses, Bulama places strong emphasis on educating his other children, saying that their schooling is a form of resistance against the cycle of violence that once tore his family apart. It will also allow them to grow up with choices, he says.</p><p>As many displaced families remain in Niger or live in limbo in Maiduguri, fearing a return to towns where armed men operate not far away, those now in Malam Fatori consider it a move worth making.</p><p>For Isa, the decision to return represents a calculated risk.</p><p>“We are caught between fear and order,” he said. “But still, we must live. Still, we must plant. Still, we must hope.”</p><p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"
