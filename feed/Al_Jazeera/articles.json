            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"396\">In September 2025, I am supposed to start a new life, not in war-torn Gaza, but in a lecture hall in the United Kingdom. After nearly a year of endless efforts, applications, exams, and navigating bombings, displacement and blackout zones just to apply, I was accepted. Not once, but five times, by the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Exeter, and Ulster. I even secured funding.</p><p data-start=\"398\" data-end=\"1081\">But instead of boarding a plane, I remain trapped in Gaza, a place where war has flattened homes, stolen futures and caged dreams. The bombs have not stopped. Neither has our will. Unlike students in other war-torn areas, we, Gaza Palestinian students, are not being offered any path out. Many countries, such as France, Ireland and Italy, have successfully evacuated their students through government-coordinated efforts and humanitarian corridors, like via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). These governments made it clear that their students matter. The UK has not. Despite its global standing and historic reputation for championing justice and education, it remains silent.</p><p data-start=\"1083\" data-end=\"1395\">This is not just my story. It is a collective cry from dozens of us, admitted to top British universities, with scholarships or personal savings, who survived bombs and sieges only to be abandoned at the final border: there is no visa centre in Gaza to submit fingerprints, and no route out without evacuation.</p><p data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"2120\">After the war broke out in late 2023, I was forced to pause my online university studies, as both the classes and the fees became impossible to maintain under the siege. But I did not give up on education. Instead, I began applying to UK universities through UCAS, a process that demanded a carefully written personal statement, recommendation letters, detailed documentation and weeks of waiting. I submitted everything using borrowed internet in relatives’ homes or from paid co-working spaces that I reached on foot, under the midday sun or pouring rain, with no transportation. There were days when I sat on a plastic chair in the street, emailing colleges and researching entry requirements while missiles flew overhead.</p><p data-start=\"2122\" data-end=\"2568\">When universities asked for English qualification submissions, I had no centre in Gaza to support me, not for training, not even to register. Most UK universities would not accept Duolingo, the only test I could afford and access online. So I stretched every resource and applied for each institution’s approved test, juggling freelance mobile programming by day to support myself and studying English by night, often under a mobile flashlight.</p><p data-start=\"2570\" data-end=\"2861\">Some tests required constant camera and microphone monitoring, difficult in a war zone where displacement, noise and unstable internet made focus nearly impossible. One infraction and the test would be void. My laptop battery often died before the test ended. But I endured and succeeded.</p><p data-start=\"2863\" data-end=\"3345\">My family shares this hunger for education. My brother is a mechanical engineer who won the competitive Qaddumi scholarship last year to begin a master’s programme at the University of Liverpool in January 2025, but it has been deferred. My sister was accepted into a Turkish government-funded medical programme at Samsun University, which was also postponed because of the war. Three of us, all with dreams and drive, are stuck in Gaza. We did everything right. So why are we left behind?</p><p data-start=\"3347\" data-end=\"3658\">After much struggle, I finally passed the tests and converted my conditional offers into unconditional ones. I even secured funding, enough for at least the first year’s tuition fees and living expenses. I was also promised support from private foundations, conditional only on submitting my visa application.</p><p data-start=\"3660\" data-end=\"4192\">But when I tried to apply for a visa, I hit a dead end: biometric fingerprints. The UK has no visa centre in Gaza. To complete the process, I would need to cross a border that is shut unless I am listed for evacuation. There are more than 100 Gazan students accepted to UK universities, 48 with full scholarships, who face the same deadlock. Many, like me, are running out of time. Inside the UK, institutions like the Gaza Scholarship Initiative (GSI) have stepped in to amplify our voice to the government because they believe in us.</p><p data-start=\"4194\" data-end=\"4400\">Some have carried their offers from 2024, after universities generously deferred their admission. Most universities, however, will not offer such flexibility again. For all of us, 2025 is our last chance.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Other countries acted.</p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Ireland coordinated directly with Israel to evacuate its students via the Karem Abu Salem (known to Israelis as Kerem Shalom) crossing. France and Italy did the same. Students were transported to nearby countries to finish visa processing and begin their studies. They understood the stakes, not just academic, but human. These governments coordinated with humanitarian agencies to get their students out, then facilitated visas and asylum claims.</p><p data-start=\"4839\" data-end=\"5152\">The UK has done nothing similar, despite numerous appeals from students, universities, advocacy groups like GSI, and members of parliament. We have written letters to MPs, university heads and the British Council. Even university leaders who support our admission cannot help unless the UK government steps in.</p><p data-start=\"5154\" data-end=\"5469\">This silence hurts most because it is not due to incapability. The UK can act but it simply chooses not to. If the government coordinated with Israeli authorities and humanitarian groups like the ICRC, students could be evacuated through Kerem Shalom into Egypt or Jordan, where they could finalise visas and travel.</p><p data-start=\"5471\" data-end=\"5594\">This is not speculative. It is exactly what other democratic nations have done. The difference? They cared enough to try.</p><p data-start=\"5596\" data-end=\"5644\">What does this say about whose futures matter?</p><p data-start=\"5646\" data-end=\"6091\">The UK has invested for decades in international education, offering prestigious scholarships like Chevening and the Commonwealth. It champions learning and opportunity and leads countless international partnerships. But when it comes to Gaza students, who embody that very ethos, we are being forgotten. What message does that send? Does our survival, our future, matter less? Are we invisible to the very system that welcomed us in writing?</p><p data-start=\"6093\" data-end=\"6365\">I still believe in British education. I am inspired by its professors, challenged by its rigour, and drawn to its diversity and values. I fought for my place there. I hope, not just for me but for my peers, that the UK government remembers its legacy and chooses to act.</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Because if not now, when?</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

We focused on Democrats; Massie is a conservative maverick who has clashed with Trump.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers began to seek records about Epstein after the Miami Herald’s late 2018 investigation into the case.</p><p>Before then, political coverage of the Epstein case was typically framed around the financier’s ties to former President Bill Clinton. His wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, lost the presidential election to Trump in 2016, and her role as a Trump rival kept the Epstein topic alive, especially in conservative media outlets.</p><p>Given this framing, Democrats often weren’t asked to comment on the topic, declined to comment, or didn’t raise Epstein as an issue.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Starting in 2019, but before Epstein’s <a href=\"/news/2019/7/8/jeffrey-epstein-faces-sex-trafficking-and-conspiracy-charges\">arrest</a> that year on federal sex trafficking charges, some Democratic lawmakers including Representative Lois Frankel and Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, both of South Florida, launched a years-long quest to release Epstein records.</p><p>The Democrats called for former US Attorney <a href=\"/economy/2019/7/12/us-labor-secretary-acosta-resigns-amid-epstein-plea-deal-scrutiny\">Alex Acosta</a>, who served as labour secretary during Trump’s first term, to testify about Epstein’s plea deal. They asked the Justice Department to investigate and release records. Democrats later pursued other strategies, including asking a Palm Beach, Florida judge to release records.</p><p>“A full accounting for these heinous crimes is lacking,” Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact in an August 1 written statement. “Those prospects changed when Republicans momentarily joined the call for full disclosure.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"in-2019-some-democrats-called-for-a-plea-deal-investigation\">In 2019, some Democrats called for a plea deal investigation</h2><p>Acosta signed off in 2007 on Epstein’s secret plea deal in which he agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges, serve 18 months in county jail and pay monetary damages to his victims. In exchange, the US attorney’s office agreed to forgo federal prosecution. Epstein entered his guilty plea in 2008.</p><p>The Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility investigated Acosta’s role and, in November 2020, released a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/58YHw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summary</a> that said he showed “poor judgement”.</p><h2 id=\"spring-2019-focus-on-acosta-s-role\">Spring 2019: Focus on Acosta’s role</h2><p>Before Epstein’s July 2019 arrest on federal charges, Frankel and Wasserman Schultz called on the Justice Department to make public Acosta’s role in the plea deal.</p><p>Frankel submitted a list of questions for Acosta, including whether any politicians lobbied prosecutors on Epstein’s behalf.</p><p>Senator Tim Kaine and Senator Patty Murray joined the effort, sending a separate letter to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility asking to make its records public.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"summer-2019-focus-on-how-past-investigations-were-handled\">Summer 2019: Focus on how past investigations were handled</h2><p>US Representative Elijah Cummings invited Acosta to testify before the House oversight committee, which Cummings chaired. A few days later, on July 12, Acosta announced he had <a href=\"/video/2019/7/12/epstein-scandal-us-labor-secretary-acosta-to-resign\">resigned</a> as labour secretary, after Democratic leaders and presidential candidates called for him to do so.</p><p>On the day Acosta resigned, Khanna said Acosta should testify before the House oversight committee, and later that month Senator Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats who called on the Justice Department to make public the results of its review of Acosta’s handling of the Epstein case.</p><p>Also in July, the congressional Democratic Women’s Caucus requested that the House Oversight and Reform Committee open an investigation into how the Palm Beach, Florida Sheriff’s Office handled the Epstein investigation.</p><p>Days after Epstein’s August 2019 <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">death</a> in a Manhattan jail cell, Khanna posted his support for an investigation into the death, writing: “There are too many unanswered questions, and far too many who deserve closure, to leave this case unexamined.” Khanna attached to his post a link to a Daily Beast article that said bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to the FBI demanding answers about Epstein’s suicide.</p><p>Democrats continued their push for a plea deal investigation, writing multiple letters, including one to Trump’s then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another to the House judiciary and oversight committees.</p><p>Democrats, along with some Republicans, proposed legislation to prevent prosecutors from striking secret plea deals, and Democrats also sought records about the Epstein case from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</p><h2 id=\"2020-to-2024-focus-on-records\">2020 to 2024: Focus on records</h2><p>Democrats tried other tactics to obtain records, such as requesting them from a Palm Beach judge – a strategy spearheaded by the Palm Beach Post that can take years to succeed.</p><p>Some records emerged from civil lawsuits and the federal prosecution of <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/why-is-ghislaine-maxwell-so-central-to-trump-epstein-conspiracy-theories\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, who was convicted for her role in a scheme with Epstein to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When Maxwell was <a href=\"/news/2020/12/29/epstein-associate-ghislaine-maxwell-denied-bail-in-abuse-case\">charged</a> in 2020, Democrats continued to push for transparency.</p><p>Frankel told PolitiFact in an August 1 interview that the House oversight committee wanted to hold a hearing at which they would hear from Epstein victims, their lawyers and prosecutors. They wanted to subpoena the prosecutors to ask them under oath “why they gave this guy a slap on the wrist, who pressured them?” Frankel said.</p><p>However, “We were told by the Justice Department to cut it off” because it could compromise the Maxwell investigation, Frankel told PolitiFact.</p><p>After Biden <a href=\"/news/2021/1/20/joe-biden-sworn-in-as-president-of-the-united-states\">took office</a> in 2021, Democrats appeared to dial back their public calls for Epstein records’ release.</p><p>“Pushes for oversight and record releases were at times tempered by a need to respect both the victims’ pursuit of justice in courts and their fears of reprisals,” Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact. “As disclosures were denied or delayed, we did what lawmakers do and legislated to protect future victims.”</p><p>In February 2024, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a bill to allow the release of Epstein 2006 grand jury testimony after a similar effort failed in previous state legislative sessions. Frankel praised the legislation.</p><p>A Palm Beach judge released records in July 2024, which showed prosecutors had heard testimony about how Epstein sexually assaulted two teenage girls before they gave Epstein a plea deal. Frankel again repeated her push for an explanation.</p><p>In September 2024, Wasserman Schultz along with Representative Burgess Owens, introduced a bill, similar to earlier proposals, to require prosecutors to inform victims of such plea deals. The bill did not receive a vote.</p><p><em>*Caryn Baird and Louis Jacobson contributed to this report*</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It excludes visitors from Mexico, Canada and the more than 40 countries enrolled in the US Visa Waiver Program. That programme allows citizens to travel to the US for tourism or business for up to 90 days without a visa.</p><p>Here’s what else to know about the mechanics of the proposal and the history of the idea.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-visa-bond\">What is a visa bond?</h2><p>A visa bond is a financial guarantee that some countries require for certain foreign nationals applying for temporary visas to ensure visa holders adhere to the terms of their visa – particularly the length of stay.</p><p>Each year, the US grants thousands of temporary nonimmigrant visas to foreign students, tourists and workers. The visas can last from a few weeks to several years.</p><p>If a nonimmigrant remains in the US longer than their authorised period of admission, it’s known as a visa overstay.</p><p>Most countries require proof of funds for visas but don’t use a system where visitors have to post a refundable bond to enter. New Zealand previously had a visa bond policy to manage overstays, but it is no longer in effect. In 2013, the United Kingdom tried and subsequently scrapped a plan to require a bond on visitors from certain “high-risk” countries.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-are-the-bonds\">How much are the bonds?</h2><p>The proposed US bonds have three tiers: $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000.</p><p>The State Department notice said it expects about 2,000 visa applicants will need to post visa bonds during the programme.</p><p>“If the average bond is $10,000 (from options of $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000), the initial cost to aliens of bonds for 2,000 visa applicants will be $20,000,000,” the notice said.</p><p>Bond amounts will be set by consular officers who will also consider an applicant’s “personal circumstances,” including their reason for travel, employment, income, skills and education.</p><p>Consular officers will be able to request waivers in limited circumstances, the department said, such as travel for US government employees or urgent humanitarian needs.</p><h2 id=\"has-this-been-tried-before\">Has this been tried before?</h2><p>Trump’s State Department tried a visa bonds programme in 2020, but it was not fully implemented because of a decrease in global travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>State Department guidance historically discouraged consular officers from requiring visa bonds, because the process was “cumbersome” and could lead to misperceptions by the public, the State Department’s notice said.</p><p>However, the department said this view “is not supported by any recent examples or evidence, as visa bonds have not generally been required in any recent period, notwithstanding a 2020 pilot programme that did not provide any substantive data.”</p><p>The number of noncitizens who arrived on a visa with no matching departure data “demonstrates that hundreds of thousands of nonimmigrant visitors fail to timely depart in accord with the terms of their visitor visa,” the notice said, citing government reports since 2000.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-would-be-affected\">Which countries would be affected?</h2><p><a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/tourists-from-malawi-and-zambia-are-first-to-face-15000-visa-bonds-in-us\">Malawi and Zambia</a> are the first two countries subject to visa bonds, the State Department announced on August 5.</p><p>“Beginning August 20, nationals of Malawi and Zambia applying for B-1, B-2 business and tourist visas will be required to post a bond of up to $15,000,” Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokesperson, said.</p><p>Additional countries subject to the bond programme will be identified based on high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or countries that offer Citizenship by Investment. The department said the list may be revised throughout the programme.</p><p>Citizenship by Investment programmes essentially sell citizenship to noncitizens by having them invest in the country’s economy and have no residency requirement. Some countries with these programmes include Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Austria, Jordan, St Lucia and Turkiye.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-high-visa-overstay-rates\">Which countries have high visa overstay rates?</h2><p>In fiscal year 2023, numerous countries in Africa, as well as Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and Yemen, recorded the highest overstay rates for people visiting on B-1 and B-2 visas, a Department of Homeland Security Overstay Report found.</p><p>Many of the 12 countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban, including Chad and Eritrea, also have high rates of visa overstays.</p><h2 id=\"what-percentage-of-migrants-in-the-country-illegally-are-visa-overstays\">What percentage of migrants in the country illegally are visa overstays?</h2><p>In its report to Congress, the DHS said it anticipated 39 million departures for visa holders in fiscal year 2023; there were about 400,000 visa overstays that year.</p><p>Visa overstayers are estimated to account for a sizable proportion of migrants in the US illegally, which partly explains the increase in the country’s unauthorised migrant population, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.</p><p>Drawing on data from the 1990s, the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) concluded in 2002 that about 41 percent of migrants in the country illegally are visa overstayers. That figure became the most widely quoted percentage, echoed by politicians including John Carter, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.</p><p>In 2003, the INS reprocessed the data and estimated that 33 percent of the undocumented migrant population in the nation in 2000 had overstayed their visas.</p><p>In more recent years, the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank studying international migration, found that about 42 percent of the 2014 population in the country without proper documentation were overstayers. The centre cited this figure in 2024.</p><p>Identifying and tracking visa overstays remains tricky, especially as the nature and origin of border crossers have changed, Jeffrey Passel, a Pew Research Center senior demographer, said. “In simple terms, the way we make our estimates doesn’t take into account mode of entry and the underlying data doesn’t have this information either.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

economies are facing new uncertainty from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, as his administration cracks down on exports directed through third countries to avoid his tariffs on China.</p><p>Under an executive order issued by Trump last week, goods imported into the US face a punitive 40 percent tariff, plus penalties and any applicable country-of-origin duties, if US Customs and Border Protection determines they have been “transshipped”.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4

4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>The tariff is set to go into effect on Thursday, along with Trump’s latest country-specific tariffs ranging from 10 to 41 percent.</p><p>While China is the main target of the new tax on transshipments, which applies to all redirected goods irrespective of country of origin, Southeast Asia could suffer much of the fallout because of the region’s highly integrated supply chains with Chinese manufacturers, trade experts say.</p><p>The fallout will depend on exactly how the Trump administration defines transshipments, which is still unclear, said Puan Yatim, an associate professor at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Graduate School of Business.</p><p>“If Washington maintains a narrow interpretation – targeting only those goods that are imported from China, minimally processed or relabeled and then re-exported to the US – the economic impact on ASEAN may be limited,” Yatim told Al Jazeera, referring to the Southeast Asian regional bloc.</p><p>“However, a broader and more punitive interpretation – where goods with any significant Chinese input are also deemed in violation – could prove economically devastating for countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Chinese manufacturers have for years been steadily expanding into Southeast Asia as part of a strategy known as “China Plus One”.</p><p>The strategy has helped Chinese firms avoid US tariffs, exploit cheaper labour, and diversify their supply chains – a particular concern during China’s COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>From 2020 to 2024, Chinese foreign direct investment into the 10 ASEAN nations grew from $7.1bn to $19.3bn, according to ASEAN data.</p><p>During the same period, exports from China to Southeast Asia rose from $385bn to $587bn, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>The surge in Chinese exports, including goods illegally mislabeled to conceal their origin in some cases, has placed Southeast Asia in the Trump administration’s crosshairs.</p><p>“[Companies] need intermediate imports from China to create products which get shipped to the US, but because companies have been embroiled in illegal transshipments in the region, there’s a huge bias in the Trump administration that ASEAN is the predominant channel,” Priyanka Kishore, principal economist at Asia Decoded in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A key example of trade that invoked Washington’s ire centred on the solar cell industry.</p><p>Following a years-long investigation, the US Department of Commerce in April announced tariffs of up to 3,500 percent on Southeast Asian manufacturers alleged to have illicitly exported Chinese goods.</p><p>Southeast Asia is now in a “sticky situation” where it must appease the US – the region’s top export market – while not alienating China, Kishore said.</p><p>Beijing has threatened to “resolutely take countermeasures” against countries that agree to trade deals with the US that go against its interests.</p><p>In May, Malaysia announced that it would no longer allow nongovernmental organisations such as chambers of commerce to issue certificates of origin, as part of its efforts to ensure the integrity of its exports.</p><p>Vietnam similarly agreed to a 40 percent transshipment tariff in a framework deal reached with the US in May, while Indonesia’s Trade Minister Budi Santoso said last month that his country was opposed to transshipping.</p><p>Despite Southeast Asian governments’ efforts to mollify the US, the transshipment tariff could create major compliance issues for the private sector, said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore.</p><p>A top concern will be how the US treats products made with components from multiple countries.</p><p>US tariffs are typically determined by the location where a product underwent “substantive transformation”, but if the Trump administration were to apply duties based on the presence of even small amounts of Chinese components, compliance and enforcement would be extremely difficult, Okun said.</p><p>“You’re going to have to be doing due diligence on supply chains that you never had to do before,” Okun told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The changes would “potentially redefine trade,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3875000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3875000\" class=\"wp-caption

Plus One competitive advantage with his tariffs on the region’s economies, said Richard Laub, CEO and cofounder of Dragon Sourcing, a global procurement service provider.</p><p>Under Trump’s latest tariffs, Singapore is subject to a 10 percent rate, while Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia are subject to rates of 19 or 20 percent – less than the 30 percent rate proposed for China under the White House’s latest tariff framework.</p><p>Trump’s transshipment tariff potentially eats into that advantage.</p><p>“A lot of the Chinese supply strategy has been to establish some kind of facility abroad with limited content, limited value, adding those facilities to basically circumvent those transshipments. I suspect that that will come to a standstill,” Laub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A Washington, DC-based consultant, who advises businesses on trade and supply chain issues in China, said he had observed a similar phenomenon, but to the detriment of US exporters.</p><p>“We are seeing [multinational corporations] from around the globe, particularly those that served the China market from the United States, doing more to localise supply chains for China in China,” the consultant told Al Jazeera, asking not to be named due his engagements with the US government.</p><p>Companies in sectors that rely on materials like foreign-sourced steel – which is subject to separate US tariffs – have found manufacturing becoming too expensive in the US and started moving manufacturing out of the country, the consultant said.</p><p>“This is a terrible outcome and the opposite of what the administration intends,” he said.</p><p>Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said despite the uncertainty, the direction of the policy in Washington is ambiguously bad for Southeast Asia.</p><p>“Clearly, the US is concerned about transshipments,” Marro told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Clearly, it is moving to crack down on them, and so for those investors, those companies, those governments that have staked their premise on things like China Plus One, we are now seeing a reassessment, and that is something which investors have to be integrating into their strategies.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

After that, the mayor of Hiroshima reads out the declaration of peace in which they call for the abolition of nuclear weapons around the world,” he added.</p><p>Schoolchildren from across Japan participated in the “Promise of Peace” – reading statements of hope and remembrance. This year’s ceremony also included a message from the representative of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urging global peace.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hiroshima’s mayor, Kazumi Matsui, warned of the dangers of rising global militarism, criticising world leaders who argue that nuclear weapons are necessary for national security.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Among the world’s political leaders, there is a growing belief that possessing nuclear weapons is unavoidable in order to protect their own countries,” he said, noting that the United States and Russia still hold 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads.</p><p>“This situation not only nullifies the lessons the international community has learned from the tragic history of the past, but also seriously undermines the frameworks that have been built for peace-building,” he said.</p><p>“To all the leaders around the world: please visit Hiroshima and witness for yourselves the reality of the atomic bombing.”</p><p>Many attendees echoed that call. “It feels more and more like history is repeating itself,” 71-year-old Yoshikazu Horie told the Reuters news agency. “Terrible things are happening in Europe … Even in Japan, in Asia, it’s going the same way – it’s very scary. I’ve got grandchildren and I want peace so they can live their lives happily.”</p><p>Survivors of the bombings – known as hibakusha – once faced discrimination over unfounded fears of disease and genetic effects. Their numbers have fallen below 100,000 for the first time this year.</p><p>Japan maintains a stated commitment to nuclear disarmament, but remains outside the UN treaty banning nuclear weapons.</p></div></div></body></html>"

LAFC will formally introduce Son at a news conference Wednesday, but the club showed the forward on the stadium video board late in the first half as he waved to roaring fans thrilled by their team’s landmark acquisition.</p><p>LAFC, a deep-pocketed club with significant team success in its first eight seasons of existence, reportedly paid a transfer fee of more than $20m, which could end up being the most ever for an MLS move.</p><p>Son was a beloved presence at Spurs, scoring 173 goals in 454 competitive appearances for the North London club, while rising to global prominence with his combination of speed, playmaking skill and finishing acumen.</p><p>The captain was given a memorable farewell last week in Seoul during Tottenham’s exhibition match against Newcastle, getting a guard of honour from both teams and tearfully exiting in the second half while nearly 65,000 fans roared.</p><p>But South Korea’s most popular athlete – and almost certainly the greatest Asian soccer player in history – has chosen an auspicious stage for the next chapter of his ground-breaking career.</p><p>Los Angeles has the world’s largest ethnic Korean population outside Korea, with the city’s vibrant Koreatown district sitting just a couple of kilometres (miles) from LAFC’s BMO Stadium.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3874820\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3874820\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3874820\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-06T054242Z_1828656959_MT1USATODAY26788487_RTRMADP_3_MLS-LEAGUES-CUP-LAFC-AT-TIGRES-UANL-1754463299.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Son Heung-min (bottom row, second from right) attends a Leagues Cup match between LAFC and Tigres UANL\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3874820\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Son Heung-min (bottom row, second from right) attends a Leagues Cup match between LAFC and Tigres UANL [Kiyoshi Mio-Imagn Images/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>LAFC is undoubtedly hoping to market Son as a soccer counterpart to the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani, albeit on a smaller scale. Ohtani, the three-time MLB MVP from Japan who is on a trajectory to become the greatest Asian player in baseball history, draws fans from across the Pacific Rim to Dodger Stadium while attracting millions in sponsorships and partnerships for the Dodgers.</p><p>Son’s move to California also puts him in a position to have an effect on and off the field at the World Cup, which will be held across North America in 2026. Son, the captain of his national team, has already said he will play in his fourth World Cup.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>After leading Tottenham to its first European trophy in decades by winning the Europa League in May, in a fitting cap to his English career, Son will go straight into the MLS Cup race when he suits up for his new club. LAFC currently sits sixth in the Western Conference at 10-6-6, but with multiple games in hand on every team ahead of it due to its participation in the Club World Cup.</p><p>Son’s seven Premier League goals last season were his fewest since his Tottenham debut, but he still appears to have the pace and skill necessary to be a difference-maker at any level. He also turned 33 only a month ago, putting him on the younger end of the global stars recently arriving in MLS.</p><p>Lionel Messi and Marco Reus were 35 and Luis Suarez was 37 when they went stateside in recent years, while Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris were both 37 when they joined LAFC last year.</p><p>Son will be reunited in Los Angeles with longtime Tottenham teammate Lloris, who has been outstanding since becoming LAFC’s goalkeeper last season.</p><p>High-scoring French forward Denis Bouanga is the only designated player currently under contract for LAFC, and general manager John Thorrington has been criticised by some fans for not using the full power of his financial resources this season. LAFC spent months on an ultimately failed attempt to get France’s Antoine Griezmann to leave Atletico Madrid.</p><p>Bouanga and Son have both thrived on the left wing during their careers, but Son likely has more positional versatility than Bouanga, making him a candidate to line up in the middle or even on the right wing.</p><p>Son seems to be an infinitely better fit for LAFC than Giroud, who moved to Lille last month after one disappointing year in California. LAFC plays a counterattacking, speed-based style that didn’t suit Giroud’s goal-scoring strengths, while Son should be right at home in such a system.</p><p>But LAFC could also alter its style in the winter, after coach Steve Cherundolo departs for Germany following four largely successful seasons highlighted by an MLS Cup championship.</p></div></div></body></html>"
