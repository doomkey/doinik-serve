Legally, there are no conditions for a pardon.</p><p>The pardon request will first be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice’s pardons department, which will send its opinion to Herzog’s office.</p><p>While the president usually follows the ministry’s recommendation, he is not required to do so.</p><p>Herzog has previously said he sees a negotiated settlement between prosecutors and Netanyahu’s legal team as the most effective way to conclude this legal matter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3360783\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3360783\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-israeli-leaders-and-people-reacted\">How have Israeli leaders and people reacted?</h2><p>Israelis <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/israelis-protest-in-tel-aviv-after-netanyahu-seeks-pardon-on-fraud-cases\">protested</a> outside Herzog’s home in Tel Aviv on Sunday night against Netanyahu’s pardon petition, joined by opposition politicians, including Naama Lazimi.</p><p>Herzog and Netanyahu are former political rivals, but they have a good working relationship.</p><p>“After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the president will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,” a statement from Herzog’s office said in response to the pardon request.</p><p>“He basically says, ‘I’m completely innocent,’” Yohanan Plesner, president of The Israel Democracy Institute, told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>“So there is no assumption of responsibility … this might project a problematic message to all public figures and to what our public norms might look like.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-netanyahu-accused-of\">What is Netanyahu accused of?</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown:</p><h3>Case 1000, the ‘Gifts Affair’</h3><p>Netanyahu was charged in 2019, while he was prime minister, with fraud and breach of trust during his tenure as minister of communications from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>The charges say Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, received lavish gifts worth nearly $200,000, including champagne and cigars, from two wealthy businessmen in exchange for political favours.</p><p>The businessmen are Israeli Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.</p><p>Milchan testified that he provided gifts to Netanyahu in June 2020. Packer was also implicated as having shared the costs of these expensive gifts with Milchan.</p><p>Netanyahu is accused of advancing Milchan’s interests by helping him secure a US visa renewal by lobbying US officials on his behalf. He is also accused of advancing a tax exemption law that could have benefitted Israelis abroad, like Milchan.</p><p>As for Packer, media reports claimed that he was making big investments in Israel, and his lawyers had inquired about Israeli citizenship or residency for the billionaire, which would have benefitted him tax-wise.</p><p>Fraud and breach of trust can carry prison sentences of up to three years, while bribery can carry up to 10 years and/or a fine.</p><p>The goods were valued at approximately 700,000 shekels ($186,000), according to a statement made by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit following the indictment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Case 2000, the ‘Netanyahu-Mozes affair’</h3><p>This case also charges him with fraud and breach of trust, saying Netanyahu made a deal with businessman Aron Mozes, a controlling shareholder of the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, which was critical of Netanyahu.</p><p>The alleged deal was for favourable coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for legislation to slow the growth of the rival Israel Hayom newspaper, which had overtaken Yedioth Ahronoth. A legislative bill was being considered that would have limited Israel Hayom’s circulation.</p><p>The indictment summary said, despite “a profound rivalry” between the two men, they conducted three series of meetings between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>During these meetings, Netanyahu and Mozes “engaged in discussions regarding the promotion of their common interests: improving the coverage that Mr. Netanyahu received in the ‘Yedioth Ahronoth’ media group; and the imposition of restrictions on the ‘Israel Hayom’ newspaper”, the indictment said.</p><h3>Case 4000, the ‘Bezeq affair’</h3><p>This case indicts Netanyahu for granting regulatory favours to Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq in return for positive coverage on Walla, a news website controlled by its former chairman.</p><p>Netanyahu, communications minister at the time, allegedly provided regulatory benefits to Shaul Elovitch, the owner of Bezeq, who also controlled the news website Walla.</p><p>The benefits reportedly included mergers and financial gains. In exchange, Elovitch provided favourable coverage of Netanyahu and his wife.</p><p>Netanyahu “dealt on several occasions with regulatory matters pertaining to Mr Elovitch, and took specific actions that promoted significant business interests of Mr Elovitch of substantial financial value”, the indictment summary said.</p><p>Besides fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery in this case.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-israeli-politicians-were-charged-with-corruption\">What other Israeli politicians were charged with corruption?</h2><p>Since 1996, <a href=\"/news/2018/2/14/israels-leaders-and-corruption-allegations\">every Israeli prime minister</a> has been the subject of a corruption investigation.</p><h3>1996-99</h3><p>Netanyahu, in his first term as prime minister, was investigated for reasons including a kickback scheme and influence peddling.</p><h3>1999-2001</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak was investigated on allegations of illegal campaign financing, bribery and money laundering.</p><h3>2001-06</h3><p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the late 1990s in what came to be known as the Greek Island affair.</p><h3>2006-09</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was convicted of taking $430,000 in bribes while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He was imprisoned in February 2016 for fraud, breach of trust, falsifying corporate records, and tax evasion.</p><h3>2009-21</h3><p>Netanyahu returned to the premiership. During this period, he was charged with the cases above, while two other cases against him were dropped.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It read: “Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”</p><p>I liked the rhythm and the urgency of it. But I didn’t yet know what it meant to rage from within the belly of the beast.</p><p>I would learn soon enough.</p><h2 id=\"when-education-isn-t-enough\">When education isn’t enough</h2><p>I began studying law while in solitary confinement at the Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearny, New Jersey. At 25, I was educated, street-smart, well-travelled, well-read, and owned and ran a successful business selling phones and laptops. And still, I couldn’t follow the jargon in court. It sounded like a strange language that everyone else spoke fluently. I asked my lawyers some questions, but I didn’t press. I was new. I trusted them.</p><p>It’s a mistake that still haunts me. If I’d known what I now know, I would have insisted on different strategies in court to fight my case. Had I done so, I don’t believe I would have been handed two consecutive life sentences – 150 years in prison.</p><p>You see, the system wants you to sit down, shut up, and comply. But every misstep is hung around your neck like a noose. And when your lawyer fails you, if you try to appeal, the court’s starting point is “sound trial strategy”, meaning they believe the defence lawyer did their job well to begin with.</p><h2 id=\"into-the-law-library-no-saviours-just-strategy\">Into the law library: No saviours, just strategy</h2><p>When I got to New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) in Trenton in 2005, an older prisoner told me, “Your job is to stay out of trouble, live, and fight for your life. There are no saviours. Get to the law library and learn.”</p><p>So I joined the Inmate Legal Association (ILA), a prisoner-run paralegal group. They trained me, and I became an uncertified paralegal.</p><p>Soon after joining the ILA, I started my own legal fight and began helping others. My first victory was a procedural motion that helped a fellow inmate get back to court. That memory still sits like a trophy in my mind. Helping someone else made the struggle worth it.</p><p>Another win came in the federal habeas court, where I wanted to challenge my conviction. My petition was dismissed. But I appealed. I trusted my research. I filed. And I won. The result didn’t stick, and the petition was later denied. But the short-lived victory meant something: we can push back.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4098860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4098860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4098860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scanned_20251002_212050-1-1759830913-1-1762852879.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C591&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prison series\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4098860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Illustration by Martin Robles]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hidden-resistance-behind-bars\">Hidden resistance behind bars</h2><p>This is the life of a pro se litigant — pro se means “for oneself” in Latin — someone who represents themselves in court. Serving as your own legal counsel is rarely a choice; more often, it’s a necessity. I hired my own attorney, and the state assigned a second lawyer for my trial and initial appeals. After that, I was on my own. I couldn’t afford further legal representation. And I’m far from alone.</p><p>Imprisoned people file tens of thousands of pro se motions every year. US court data from 2000-2019 shows that 91 percent of legal challenges by prisoners were filed pro se.</p><p>This is not new. A Bureau of Justice Statistics report from the mid-1990s showed that 93 percent of federal habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners then were also pro se.</p><p>These numbers confirm what we see inside: legal representation ends after pretty much the first appeal, and beyond that, we’re on our own, with no training, limited resources, and overwhelming barriers.</p><h2 id=\"voices-from-the-legal-underground\">Voices from the legal underground</h2><p>Take Martin Robles, a 52-year-old Puerto Rican who’s spent nearly 30 years behind bars. Once he no longer had appointed counsel, Martin took charge of his appeals. “The courts don’t follow their own rules,” he told me. “They don’t hold prosecutors accountable like they do us. We’re time-barred (and appeals are denied) — for being an hour late. But prosecutors? They get unlimited leeway.”</p><p>The courts don’t care about the difficulties prisoners endure to communicate with paralegals or to research case law to prepare legal briefs. Access to the law library to do all this is curtailed. We have to request a pass to visit during our housing unit’s weekly rotation, but the passes are limited, and sometimes we wait weeks to enter the library. Courts routinely impose deadlines on prisoners that are also impossible to meet, yet fail to give any latitude for prison constraints. One friend, for example, was given a month to file a legal brief but wasn’t allowed in the prison library during this time as he had a cast on his arm, and this was considered a possible weapon. But without access to the library, he could not get help from paralegals, consult legal reference books, or use the computers to type his brief. The deadline passed, and he wrote to the judge about his plight, but was not given an extension.</p><p>Martin has turned his outrage into something productive. “I’m starting the first Spanish-language law class at NJSP,” he said.</p><p>“It’s voluntary. I’m doing it for the people. I’m tired of them being taken advantage of.”</p><h2 id=\"when-money-can-t-buy-protection\">When money can’t buy protection</h2><p>Kashif Hassan, 39, entered the system with a master’s degree and hired private attorneys. “I threw money at lawyers, and thought I was good,” he said. “But I got manipulated and railroaded. I didn’t fight early enough.”</p><p>Eventually, Kashif picked up legal texts and took charge of his future. “My first win was a bail motion in the county [jail],” he said.</p><p>“If you don’t fight, no one else will. Pro se litigation works if you know what you’re doing. But courts treat us like amateurs. Like we don’t count.”</p><h2 id=\"a-lawyer-who-didn-t-prepare-a-defence\">A lawyer who didn’t prepare a defence</h2><p>Tommy Koskovich, 47, was arrested while in high school. “My attorney mocked me,” he recalled. “Said he wasn’t getting paid enough by the Public Defender’s Office, so he didn’t prepare a defence. When I refused the plea deal, he said, ‘I didn’t prepare a defence for you.’”</p><p>Tommy has subsequently lost all his appeals, but he is now pursuing his only remaining options: a motion to overturn his sentence and clemency. He has also applied for the latter through New Jersey’s new Clemency Initiative.</p><p>Throughout the process, Tommy has learned to identify legal issues. “Sometimes courts only take your issue seriously after you file pro se,” he said. “That’s how State v Comer happened, where an inmate raised the issue himself.”</p><p>James Comer was 17 when he was convicted of a felony murder and other offences after carrying out several armed robberies with two others in the year 2000. He was sentenced to prison until the age of 85. He likely would have died in jail, but he took his fight with his lawyers to the New Jersey Supreme Court and was resentenced. He was freed in October after serving 25 years.</p><p>Martin, Kashif and Tommy reflect what many of us behind the wall already know: the system isn’t built for justice – it’s built for conviction. The moment your initial appeals end, you’re on your own.</p><p>Every mistake you make is punished. Every misstep is used to shut the door tighter.</p><h2 id=\"the-legal-fight-is-also-a-moral-one\">The legal fight is also a moral one</h2><p>Still, we fight. We write in broken chairs under flickering lights. We teach others how to file motions, navigate case law, and decode legal jargon.</p><p>As for me, I’m working on a motion for DNA testing to prove my innocence and an alternative motion to vacate my sentence. But a few cases are pending in the New Jersey Supreme Court that could help my case, so I’m waiting on their outcomes.</p><p>Because we do not go silent.<br>\nWe do not go gentle into that good night.<br>\nWe rage – against wrongful convictions, indifferent courts, and a system that hopes we’ll give up.<br>\nWe rage, even when no one is watching.<br>\nEven when no one believes.<br>\nEven when the victories are small.</p><p>Rage, after all, is hope in motion.</p><p><em><strong>This is the first story in a three-part series on how prisoners are taking on the US justice system through law, prison hustles and hard-won education.</strong></em></p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

Abdullah has the same calm look, but his hair is now longer and his skin has a tinge of yellow. Standing beside him in the picture is Mohammad, who is now 11, and Mahmoud, who is eight.

In early November, a team of doctors in Gaza took blood samples from Abdullah’s siblings and sent them to Italy to determine their compatibility as donors for the boy’s marrow transplant.</p><p>If one is a match, they will all be allowed onto a medical flight to Padova. If the results are negative, they will need to apply to the Italian government for family reunion – a much longer process fraught with logistical challenges.</p><p>Iman said the fate of his family hangs on those results. They could save Abdullah from the disease, and the rest of their family from Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“I fear for their safety every day,” she said. “Abdullah misses his siblings, and I miss my children, too.”</p><p>Abdullah shyly nodded in confirmation, adding that he misses a nicely done kebab, too. He has no penchant for Italian food and reminisces about the seasoned meat the family’s go-to restaurant in Deir el-Balah served.</p><p>Asked whether he would like to bring Gaza to Padova, he said, “Not all of it, just my neighbourhood.”</p><h2 id=\"escaping-war-in-gaza\">Escaping war in Gaza</h2><p>Iman found out she was pregnant with Qamar in March 2024, as the war was raging around her. At first, she thought her period had skipped because she had been barely surviving on water and bread. When it became apparent that a fourth child was on the way, she recalls feeling “terrified”.</p><p>“I was constantly worried and anxious that they’d tell me the baby was deformed, abnormal, sick,” because of the lack of food and sanitation, she said. “My body was exhausted, and I couldn’t stand. I spent my entire pregnancy lying on the floor,” she says rapidly in Arabic, before picking up the toddler tugging insistently at her leg and placing her on her lap to feed her.</p><p>Her baby girl was delivered in a tented field hospital in Deir el-Balah that lacked basic sanitation and medicines, as victims of Israeli bombardment were rushed in.</p><p>“You could see someone injured at any moment – an amputated limb, an amputated hand … The scenes were horrific,” she said. “And the doctors were nervous because the area was being targeted.”</p><p>Months later, in April this year, Abdullah started feeling sick.</p><p>“He was yellow, had abdominal cramps, a headache,” she said.</p><p>At the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, Abdullah was strapped to an IV and given painkillers and antibiotics. The fluids kept the fever from spiking, but nothing could stop the cancer from spreading.</p><p>The family was advised to take him to the European Hospital in Khan Younis, despite the Israeli army having announced a major expansion of military operations in the area.</p><p>The 10-kilometre (six-mile) ride southward was “terrifying”.</p><p>“There wasn’t a soul on the street,” Iman remembered. Doctors could only offer diluted chemotherapy treatment. Abdullah was flagged to the World Health Organization (WHO) for medical evacuation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, medical evacuation was granted shortly afterwards. Iman and her husband, Ahmad, did not need words to take the decision to split the family.</p><p>“There was more silence than dialogue,” she said.</p><p>Ahmad arrived at the European Hospital on May 13 to bid Iman, Abdullah and Qamar an emotional farewell. As he was leaving the compound, the earth shook and a slab of concrete flew right past his head.</p><p>That day, the Israeli military announced they had dropped nine bunker-busting bombs and dozens of other munitions on the hospital’s courtyard and surrounding area. They claimed to have killed Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar and more than 20 other members of the group. International law prohibits attacks on hospitals, which constitute a war crime. Hamas confirmed Sinwar’s death in August, but did not provide details on how he died.</p><p>“I was convinced that [my husband] had been killed,” Iman recalled.</p><p>“I kept calling him and screaming, saying, ‘I swear, he’s gone’,” she said. “I called 10 times or more, but he didn’t answer. I was certain he had been martyred. But I didn’t give up, I didn’t give up! After so many attempts, finally, he answered.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-life-away-from-home\">A new life away from home</h2><p>Abdullah is among more than 5,500 children who have been evacuated from Gaza through medical evacuations coordinated by the WHO.</p><p>A total of 8,000 people have so far been able to leave for life-saving treatment, but 16,500 people are still waiting, according to United Nations figures. Of those, 3,800 are children.</p><p>Since July 2024, more than 900 patients have died while awaiting medical evacuations, according to the WHO.</p><p>Abdullah was taken to Padova thanks to the doggedness of lawyer Rebecca Fedetto, who in February founded an organisation to facilitate and support medical evacuations.</p><p>“I knew I wanted to do something and be active,” she told Al Jazeera. “I couldn’t live normally, my conscience didn’t allow it.”</p><p>Fedetto worked the phone in search of anyone who could help her navigate the process of paperwork, approvals, and coordination required to provide a referral for a patient to be moved to a medical facility abroad.</p><p>“At one point, I thought I wouldn’t make it, it was all so complex,” she said. “When it started to work out, I couldn’t believe it.”</p><p>Her self-made NGO, Padova Abbraccia i Bambini (Padova Hugs Children), has facilitated six medical evacuations, welcoming 25 people. Among them are six-year-old Ahmad, who is recovering from third-degree burns on nearly half of his body, and eight-year-old Seela, who lost both legs.</p><p>A team of volunteers caters to the families’ every need, offering transport, babysitting, homeschooling and emotional support.</p><p>Fedetto said the city’s response has been overwhelmingly welcoming.</p><p>“Many people have emailed us asking if they could help, because this war is something that touches our conscience” she said. “Often people want to help, they just don’t know how.”</p><p>WHO has appealed for countries to offer more medical evacuations, as Gaza’s healthcare remains limited. Only 18 hospitals out of 36 are partially functional.</p><p>More than 30 countries have so far heeded the call, including European Union member states, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>“We are thankful for their solidarity,” Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the occupied Palestinian territory, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Peeperkorn said that under the terms of the ceasefire, WHO should be able to evacuate 50 patients per day, in addition to their caregivers.</p><p>“To make this possible, more countries must step forward with generosity and accept patients in need,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I’m exhausted, but I have to do it to support my siblings.”</p><p>Mohammed is one of a growing number of Palestinian children in Gaza who have been forced into work as a result of Israel’s war.</p><p>With at least 39,000 children having lost one or both parents in the war, and the enclave’s economy devastated by the conflict, children as young as eight have been pushed into work for their families’ survival – losing not only their education, but their childhoods.</p><p>Mohammed’s mother, Atad Ashour, says she knows her son should be in school, but that they have no alternative.</p><p>“After his father was killed, we were left with no income at all,” she said.</p><p>She said Mohammed’s older brothers were unable to find jobs, and she was unable to provide the family with anything.</p><p>“He’s still a child, but he’s carrying a responsibility that isn’t his,” she said. “The circumstances pushed us into this.”</p><h2 id=\"children-bear-the-brunt\">Children bear the brunt</h2><p>Aid agencies in Gaza say children have borne the brunt of the war, forcing them into additional responsibilities that would normally be the domain of adults.</p><p>“We’re seeing more children scavenging through waste, looking for pieces of scrap or firewood to sell, children selling coffee,” said UNICEF spokesperson Tess Ingram.</p><p>She said the organisation was working with partners “to do everything we can to try and stop these negative coping mechanisms, including giving families cash assistance, educating them about the risks of child labour and trying to help families resume employment”.</p><p>Speaking from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Rachel Cummings, Gaza humanitarian director for Save the Children, said the family breakdown caused by the war was also driving children into roles caring for siblings or older family members.</p><p>“The whole family structure has been disrupted in Gaza and children are very vulnerable,” she said. “This very precarious situation is really taking its toll.”</p><h2 id=\"more-than-600-000-out-of-school\">More than 600,000 out of school</h2><p>The statistics paint a bleak picture of the effect of the war on children in Gaza, where nearly half the population is under 18.</p><p>More than 660,000 children are out of formal education, while an estimated 132,000 face the risk of acute malnutrition, according to Save the Children.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the loss of parental breadwinners, in particular, had forced Gaza’s children into doing tasks “that they were not supposed to be doing”.</p><p>“They were supposed to be in school, playing with their friends,” she said. “The war’s toll on Palestinian children has been massive.”</p><p>As he walks home at the end of another long day earning money for his family, Mohammed walks past a school, wishing he were still a student.</p><p>“If my father were alive, you would find me at home going to school,” he says.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But even where there was no change in policy stance, labour migration fell in most European Union countries, dropping to below 2019 levels.</p><p>According to Jean-Christophe Dumont, who leads the OECD’s international migration division, the downturn can be chalked up to a “less favourable” global economic situation.</p><p>In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecast by 0.5 percentage points to 2.8 percent for 2025, citing President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/opinions/2025/4/3/american-consumers-set-to-be-the-biggest-losers-in-trumps-trade-wars\">trade war</a> as a limiting factor.</p><p>Meanwhile, other countries that had traditionally been among the largest recipients of migrants have toughened entry rules. Over the past two years, Canada, Australia and the UK have all brought in measures to limit work-related migration.</p><p>Elsewhere, Dumont noted that a large number of Ukrainians granted temporary protection in Europe had eased labour shortages in several sectors, reducing the demand for foreign workers.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/international-migration-outlook-2025_ae26c893-en/full-report/recent-developments-in-international-migration-movements-and-labour-market-inclusion-of-immigrants_203de29e.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">most recent</a> data from the OECD, an estimated 5.1 million Ukrainians who fled their country following Russia’s <a href=\"/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets\">full-scale invasion in 2022</a> are now living in OECD member states, as of June 2025.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-other-types-of-migration\">What about other types of migration?</h2><p>The OECD recorded a 13 percent fall in the number of new international students arriving in OECD nations between 2023 and 2024. Tighter visa policies in the UK, US, Canada and Australia played a key role, driven by concerns about migration fraud as well as pressure on local housing markets.</p><p data-start=\"1746\" data-end=\"2267\">By contrast, migration for humanitarian reasons has continued to climb. Asylum applications surged in the US in the final months of the Biden administration last year, and the UK has experienced a sharp increase in illegal <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/refugee-and-migrant-crossings-to-uk-hit-record-high-by-end-of-july\">small-boat arrivals</a> from EU countries in recent months.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>These increases mean that, despite the fall in labour and student migration, total permanent migration to advanced economies in 2024 dipped only slightly, by 4 percent, from a peak in the previous year.</p><p>Still, the 6.2 million newcomers to the OECD recorded in 2024 exceeded pre-pandemic levels by about 15 percent. Temporary labour mobility, involving visas which do not lead to permanent settlement, held steady at approximately 2.3 million. This remains above 2019 levels.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-migration-numbers-changed\">How have migration numbers changed?</h2><p>A record 6.5 million people settled in OECD countries in 2023. That was an increase of almost 10 percent on the previous record of six million who moved in 2022 – the greatest rise was in the UK.</p><p>Roughly one-third of OECD countries experienced record levels of immigration in 2023, including Canada, France and Japan. The US received 1.2 million permanent legal immigrants and Donald Trump based his 2024 election campaign on <a href=\"/economy/2024/10/3/how-will-trumps-plans-to-deport-undocumented-migrants-impact-us-economy\">curbing migration</a>.</p><p>Despite the political debate, research by investment bank Goldman Sachs found that immigration drove most of the employment gains in Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Germany and the UK in 2023, and added more than four million jobs in the US.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-future-hold\">What does the future hold?</h2><p>Dumont suggested that overall immigration to OECD countries may ease slightly in 2025, but it will remain historically high despite stricter US immigration policies. He also highlighted that the employment rate among migrants remains solid in labour markets.</p><p>In the UK, for instance, the employment rate among foreign-born workers stood at about 76 percent – a figure that slightly surpassed the rate recorded for people who were born in the country.</p><p>He attributed this partly to visa schemes geared towards higher-skilled roles and partly to the fact that lower-skilled migrants were willingly “filling gaps” in jobs UK nationals do not want.</p><p>Fabiola Mieres, a senior specialist in migration at the International Labour Organization, told Al Jazeera: “We need to rethink some of the issues around native labour shortages in areas like agriculture, construction and health [where migrant workers tend to be concentrated].</p><p>“Clearly, minimum wages and working conditions are part of the story.”</p><p>She added that “immigration will likely continue to form an important part of electoral politics around the world, especially in Europe and the US. It creates a lot of heated emotions.”</p><p><strong>What is the OECD?</strong></p><p>The OECD was founded in 1948 to coordinate the US Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe following World War II. At the time, it provided a forum for economic planning and the removal of trade barriers between its European members.</p><p>By the late 1950s, as European reconstruction neared completion, member states sought a more global framework for economic cooperation. In 1961, the OECD expanded its membership to include the US and Canada.</p><p>Over subsequent decades, the OECD widened its membership to include countries from the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting its evolution from a transatlantic group to a broader community of advanced and emerging countries.</p><p>By the late 20th century, the OECD had grown into a central hub for economic research, policy analysis and the development of governance standards. It became widely recognised for its work and research on education, labour markets and environmental policy.</p><p>In 2019, the OECD <a href=\"/economy/2019/10/9/oecd-takes-aim-at-tech-giants-with-global-tax-plan\">spearheaded a proposal</a> to tax big multinational companies at least 15 percent to put an end to decades of tax competition between governments trying to attract foreign investment.</p><p>The rules, which were <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\">adopted by the G20</a> in October 2021, have made it harder for large international companies, including giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, to avoid taxation by establishing offices in low-tax jurisdictions.</p></div></div></body></html>"
