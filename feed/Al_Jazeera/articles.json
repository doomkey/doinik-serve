There, it is said, we see the first glimpses of what warfare of the future will look like, not just in terms of weaponry, but also in terms of new technologies and tactics.</p>\n<p>Most recently, the United States-Israeli attacks on Iran demonstrated not just new strategies of drone deployment and infiltration but also new vulnerabilities. During the 12-day conflict, Iran and vessels in the waters of the Gulf experienced repeated disruptions of GPS signal.</p>\n<p>This clearly worried the Iranian authorities who, after the end of the war, began to look for alternatives.</p>\n<p>“At times, disruptions are created on this [GPS] system by internal systems, and this very issue has pushed us toward alternative options like BeiDou,” <a href=\"https://hammihanonline.ir/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-23/42985-%DA%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AB%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%A8-%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF\">Ehsan Chitsaz</a>, deputy communications minister, told Iranian media in mid-July. He added that the government was developing a plan to switch transportation, agriculture and the internet from GPS to BeiDou.</p>\n<p>Iran’s decision to explore adopting China’s navigation satellite system may appear at first glance to be merely a tactical manoeuvre. Yet, its implications are far more profound. This move is yet another indication of a major global realignment.</p>\n<p>For decades, the West, and the US in particular, have dominated the world’s technological infrastructure from computer operating systems and the internet to telecommunications and satellite networks.</p>\n<p>This has left much of the world dependent on an infrastructure it cannot match or challenge. This dependency can easily become vulnerability. Since 2013, whistleblowers and media investigations have revealed how various Western technologies and schemes have enabled illicit surveillance and data gathering on a global scale – something that has worried governments around the world.</p>\n<p>Iran’s possible shift to BeiDou sends a clear message to other nations grappling with the delicate balance between technological convenience and strategic self-defence: The era of blind, naive dependence on US-controlled infrastructure is rapidly coming to an end. Nations can no longer afford to have their military capabilities and vital digital sovereignty tied to the satellite grid of a superpower they cannot trust.</p>\n<p>This sentiment is one of the driving forces behind the creation of national or regional satellite navigation systems, from Europe’s Galileo to Russia’s GLONASS, each vying for a share of the global positioning market and offering a perceived guarantee of sovereign control.</p>\n<p>GPS was not the only vulnerability Iran encountered during the US-Israeli attacks. The Israeli army was able to assassinate a number of nuclear scientists and senior commanders in the Iranian security and military forces. The fact that Israel was able to obtain their exact locations raised fears that it was able to infiltrate telecommunications and trace people via their phones.</p>\n<p>On June 17 as the conflict was still raging, the Iranian authorities urged the Iranian people to stop using the messaging app WhatsApp and delete it from their phones, saying it was gathering user information to send to Israel. Whether this appeal was linked to the assassinations of the senior officials is unclear, but Iranian mistrust of the app run by US-based corporation Meta is not without merit.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity experts have long been sceptical about the security of the app. Recently, media reports have revealed that the artificial intelligence software Israel uses to target Palestinians in Gaza is reportedly fed data from social media. Furthermore, shortly after the end of the attacks on Iran, the US House of Representatives moved to ban WhatsApp from official devices.</p>\n<p>For Iran and other countries around the world, the implications are clear: Western platforms can no longer be trusted as mere conduits for communication; they are now seen as tools in a broader digital intelligence war.</p>\n<p>Tehran has already been developing its own intranet system, the National Information Network, which gives more control over internet use to state authorities. Moving forward, Iran will likely expand this process and possibly try to emulate China’s Great Firewall.</p>\n<p>By seeking to break with Western-dominated infrastructure, Tehran is definitively aligning itself with a growing sphere of influence that fundamentally challenges Western dominance. This partnership transcends simple transactional exchanges as China offers Iran tools essential for genuine digital and strategic independence.</p>\n<p>The broader context for this is China’s colossal Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While often framed as an infrastructure and trade project, BRI has always been about much more than roads and ports. It is an ambitious blueprint for building an alternative global order. Iran – strategically positioned and a key energy supplier – is becoming an increasingly important partner in this expansive vision.</p>\n<p>What we are witnessing is the emergence of a new powerful tech bloc – one that inextricably unites digital infrastructure with a shared sense of political defiance. Countries weary of the West’s double standards, unilateral sanctions and overwhelming digital hegemony will increasingly find both comfort and significant leverage in Beijing’s expanding clout.</p>\n<p>This accelerating shift heralds the dawn of a new “tech cold war”, a low-temperature confrontation in which nations will increasingly choose their critical infrastructure, from navigation and communications to data flows and financial payment systems, not primarily based on technological superiority or comprehensive global coverage but increasingly on political allegiance and perceived security.</p>\n<p>As more and more countries follow suit, the Western technological advantage will begin to shrink in real time, resulting in redesigned international power dynamics.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

At one point, to scare him, they fired at the ground near him, sending shrapnel flying into his abdomen and causing heavy bleeding.</p>\n<p>After three days, the men were lined up by their captors.</p>\n<p>“They tried to negotiate with us, demanding 3 million Sudanese pounds [about $1,000] per person,” al-Sadiq recalled.</p>\n<p>Three men were released after handing over everything they had, including a rickshaw and all their cash. Al-Sadiq and the other remaining prisoners were moved to a smaller cell – an even more cramped toilet tucked beneath a staircase.</p>\n<p>“There was no ventilation. There were insects everywhere,” he said. They had to alternate sleeping – two could just about lie down while two stood.</p>\n<p>A few kilometres away, al-Sadiq’s friend, the musician, who asked to remain anonymous, had also been arrested and held at the Paratrooper Military Camp in Khartoum North, which the RSF captured in the first months of the war with Sudan’s military.</p>\n<p>That would not be the only time the musician was taken because the RSF had been told that his family were distantly related to former President Omar al-Bashir.</p>\n<p>“They said I’m a ‘remnant of the regime’ because of that relation to him even though I was never part of the regime.

That’s almost the load of one truck, or half of a truck, coming from the crossings into the Gaza Strip,” Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>He cited witnesses who said the airdrops took place near a restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/7/20/israel-issues-forced-displacement-order-in-central-gaza-in-new-campaign\">military area</a> in northern Gaza, making retrieving them in the dark especially difficult.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Equally, Israel’s plan to allow for so-called “humanitarian pauses” in Gaza starting on Sunday will have no major effect on the starvation crisis, Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>“Again, this is not a solution when we talk about passing the tipping point of this enforced starvation, and according to medical sources we spoke to earlier today, they confirmed that at this point we’re going to see mass scale starvation mortality,” he said.</p>\n<p>As starvation spreads, Israel has pressed on with its daily bombardment of Gaza.</p>\n<p>At least six people were killed in an Israeli drone attack on a tent camp in al-Mawasi near Khan Younis on Saturday. The area designated as a safe zone by Israel has come under constant deadly attack by its forces.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Civil Defence agency in Gaza says none of its vehicles will be able to offer lifesaving services soon due to disrepair and lack of fuel, calling on the international community to act.</p>\n<p>“We stress the need for an urgent intervention to pressure the Israeli occupation authorities to allow fuel and repair parts for vehicles to enter,” the Civil Defence said in a statement.</p>\n<p>While some Western countries have made strongly-worded statements against Israel’s policies in Gaza, advocates have been calling for <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/uk-threatens-further-action-against-israel-if-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-fails\">real consequences</a> to ensure accountability and deter further Israeli abuses. Punitive sanctions against Israel have been raised as possibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"handala-ship-intercepted\">Handala ship intercepted</h2>\n<p>Shortly after making its airdrops announcement, the Israeli military raided a ship of international activists carrying baby formula, food and medical supplies to Gaza.</p>\n<p>A livestream showed Israeli soldiers boarding and intercepting the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/18/who-is-handala-the-inspiration-behind-latest-gaza-flotilla-ship\">Handala vessel </a>with 19 activists onboard. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the aid ship, said the vessel was violently seized in international waters.</p>\n<p>“The unarmed boat was carrying life-saving supplies when it was boarded by Israeli forces, its passengers abducted, and its cargo seized,” the coalition said in a statement. “The interception occurred in international waters outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international maritime law.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not clear what will happen to the advocates. Last month, Israel intercepted the Madleen aid ship and towed it to an Israeli boat before detaining the activists, and then interrogating and deporting them.</p>\n<p>Ann Wright, a member of the Freedom Flotilla Steering Committee, called for the protection of the international activists by their home countries.</p>\n<p>“Protect innocent international people who are merely accompanying a small amount of aid – medical and food – as a symbol of the international outrage at what Israel is doing,” Wright told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>The Gaza Government Media Office called the interception of Handala a <a href=\"/features/2025/6/9/what-happens-next-to-the-gaza-flotillas-madleen-and-its-crew\">crime of piracy</a>.</p>\n<p>“This blatant aggression represents a major violation of international law and the rules of maritime navigation, and it shows once more that the [Israeli] occupation acts like a bully outside the authority of the law,” the office said in a statement.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
