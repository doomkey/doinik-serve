The strong-smelling product consisted of menthol, camphor, eucalyptus and several other oils blended together in a petroleum jelly base. The ointment helped open blocked noses, and when rubbed on the chest, the vapour soothed a cough.</p><p>Richardson initially named his concoction Vick’s Croup &amp; Pneumonia Salve. An enthusiastic gardener, he thought of the name after seeing an advertisement for seeds of the Vicks plant, whose leaves smell like menthol when crushed. He also borrowed the name from his brother-in-law, Dr Joshua Vick, a trusted doctor in their town of Greensboro. He felt “Vick” was “short, easy to remember and <a href=\"https://vicks.com/en-us/vicks-history/heritage-of-care-and-trust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">looked good on a label</a>”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3841612\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3841612\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3841612\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vicks.-1752686470.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C480&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Vicks VapoRub glass jar.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3841612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An old glass bottle of Vicks VapoRub [Courtesy of Ella Moran]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"magic-salve-to-vaporub\">‘Magic’ salve to VapoRub</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://vicks.com/en-us/vicks-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1911</a>, 17 years after the salve was created, Richardson’s son Henry Smith, the one who once suffered from croup, was steering the family business. He renamed the product Vick’s Vaporub Salve from Vick’s Magic Croup Salve, the name under which it had been sold since 1905. That year, the packaging was also changed from <a href=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/xuuihvmvy6c9/7JElW6yq65IIUwgG8DuKh3/12ecae3aec8cd5559ee39714de37c7fb/p-1894-XXL_2x.png?fm=avif&amp;q=95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transparent glass</a> to the distinctive cobalt blue.</p><p>By then, Richardson had also created 21 remedies for various ailments, including Vick’s <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60845-d319245-r558112568-Greensboro_History_Museum-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html#photos;aggregationId=101&amp;albumid=101&amp;filter=7&amp;ff=261212300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Liver Pills</a> for “<a href=\"https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn92074073/1897-10-25/ed-1/seq-4/#words=Vick%27s+Little+Liver+Pills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">constipation and torpid liver</a>”; Turtle Oil Liniment for “sprains, sores and rheumatism”; <a href=\"https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn91068384/1901-05-15/ed-1/seq-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tar Heel Sarsaparilla</a> to purify “bad blood”; and Grippe Knockers for the flu.

The Spanish flu claimed the lives of 50 million people – more than eight times the number of COVID-19 deaths.</p><p>This was when Vick’s VapoRub sales began to soar.</p><p>“Its closest rival was Ely’s Creme Balm … something of a copycat product but doesn’t seem to have had the same cachet,” explained Catharine Arnold, author of the book Pandemic 1918.</p><p>She added that there were other remedies for respiratory ailments, including coughs, colds and the flu, such as Hale’s Honey of Horehound and Tar. Some products did not stand the test of time, such as “vaporisers”, similar to modern nebulisers, and throat lozenges such as Formamint. It contained the chemical formaldehyde, which is <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhrm-12-2020-0058/full/html\">toxic</a> in large amounts.</p><p>However, a marketing campaign led by Smith took the Vicks brand onto the global stage.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, the company produced a series of six ads. Rather than solely promote Vick’s VapoRub, the series focused on raising awareness about the Spanish flu and included information about symptoms, treatment and tips to avoid getting sick. It urged people not to panic and conveyed that the brand cared about people’s wellbeing at a bleak time. The flu was just another variation of an influenza that strikes every century and is caused by germs that attack the nose, throat and bronchial tubes, the ads said. Vick’s VapoRub would “throw off the grippe germs” and make it easier to breathe, they said.</p><p>Years later, the accuracy of this content came under criticism. Still, “at the time, this advertisement must have seemed reassuring, telling readers it was just the same old flu, only, of course, it wasn’t,” Arnold said.</p><p>“Spanish flu was an atypical autoimmune virus which attacked the youngest and fittest and caused unusual reactions, such as violent haemorrhaging and the notorious heliotrope cyanosis when people’s skin turned blue.”</p><p>However, the advice in the advertisements to rest and stay in bed was “sensible”, she added, because the virus was spread through human contact.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3843381\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3843381\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3843381\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP21260828293021-1752765237.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C507&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - In this November 1918 photo made available by the Library of Congress, a nurse takes the pulse of a patient in the influenza ward of the Walter Reed hospital in Washington.

Supplies expected to last four months had run out in three weeks.</p><p>Newspaper notices published at that time showed the company had received orders for 1.75 million VapoRub jars in a single week, and the daily turnover of the business was about $186,492. The jars came in <a href=\"https://exhibits.lib.unc.edu/exhibits/show/going-viral/item/5528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three sizes</a> costing 30 cents, 60 cents and $1.20.</p><p>“Big shipments are en route to jobbers [wholesalers] by freight and express. Until these arrive, there may be a temporary shortage. All deals postponed. Buy in small lots only,” one notice read.</p><p>The company informed the public that it was working day and night to catch up with demand. The orders received were twice the company’s daily output, and by November 1918, the firm said its factory was running 23.5 hours daily to produce 1.08 million jars weekly.</p><p>The product gained worldwide popularity during the pandemic, and according to company data, VapoRub sales grew from $900,000 to $2.9m from 1918 to 1919.</p><p>Afterwards, Vick Chemical Company continued to market its product in novel ways. It sent millions of free samples to mailboxes and in 1924 published a 15-page advertisement in the form of a children’s book called The Story of Blix and Blee. The story, written in rhyming verses, was about two elves named Blix and Blee who lived in an empty Vicks VapoRub jar beneath an old jujube tree. One night, they rushed to the rescue of a sick child, little Dickie. The elves convinced the child, who was refusing to take the medicine given by his mother, to use Vicks VapoRub to soothe his cough so he could sleep.</p><p>More than 130 years later, Vicks VapoRub is sold in about 70 countries on five continents with more than 3.78 million litres (more than 1 million gallons) of it produced annually. From 2011 to 2016 alone, there were more than a billion units sold worldwide, according to its owner Procter and Gamble.</p><p>For Arnold, Vicks VapoRub is part of an American childhood.</p><p>“Generations of us grew up with that familiar waxy menthol compound, robes and pyjamas redolent of Vicks during flu season,” she said. “That familiar blue and green label is as much of an American cultural icon as Coca-Cola or Campbell’s soup.”</p><p><em>This article is part of Ordinary Items, Extraordinary Stories, a series about the surprising stories behind well-known items. </em></p><p><em>Read more from the series:</em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/7/26/how-the-inventor-of-the-bouncy-castle-saved-lives\">How the inventor of the bouncy castle saved lives</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/8/2/how-a-popular-peruvian-soft-drink-went-toe-to-toe-with-coca-cola\">How a popular Peruvian soft drink went ‘toe-to-toe’ with Coca-Cola</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/8/9/how-a-drowning-victim-became-a-lifesaving-icon\">How a drowning victim became a lifesaving icon</a></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But there was a more subdued atmosphere a few hours later as Trump and Putin departed on their respective planes – with no clear breakthrough on the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Here are some key takeaways from their meeting:</p><h2 id=\"no-deal-until-there-s-a-deal\">‘No deal until there’s a deal’</h2><p>While the meeting was anticipated to take about seven hours, it wrapped up in less than three. Trump and Putin addressed a gathering of journalists after the talks with relatively brief pre-prepared statements. Neither leader took any questions.</p><p>Putin said his country is committed to ending the war, but the conflict’s “primary causes” must be eliminated for an agreement to be long-lasting.</p><p>Putin also warned Ukraine and the European Union against throwing a “wrench in the works” and cautioned against attempts to use “backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress”.</p><p>A relatively subdued Trump praised the “extremely productive meeting”, in which he said “many points were agreed to”. He said there is a “very good chance of getting there” – referring to a ceasefire – but conceded that there remain sticking points with Moscow, including at least one “significant” one.</p><p>He cautioned that it’s “ultimately up to them” – referring to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said.</p><p>And there was none by the time Trump and Putin left Alaska.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-pr-coup-for-putin\">A PR coup for Putin</h2><p>The Russian leader has become an increasingly maligned and isolated figure in the West since waging war on Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But on Friday, that ended, with a red carpet welcome, a flypast by US fighter jets and warm applause from Trump.</p><p>Putin himself seemed pleased, grinning out the window as he drove off the tarmac with Trump in the presidential Cadillac limousine known as “The Beast”.</p><p>“For three years they [Western media] have been talking about Russia’s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet that greeted the Russian president in the United States,” Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gloated after the summit, on Telegram.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"talking-business\">Talking business</h2><p>Before the meeting, it was widely anticipated that Putin would attempt to dilute peace talks with talk of bilateral trade and cooperation.</p><p>Trump had asserted that there would be no discussion of business with Putin until the pair had made substantive progress on bringing about a ceasefire in Ukraine.</p><p>This plan, however, seems to have been derailed somewhat, with the Russian president saying in his post-meeting statement that the pair discussed their collaboration in the areas of tech and space.</p><p>“It’s clear that US and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the US can offer each other so much. In trade, digital, high-tech and in space exploration, [and] we see that Arctic cooperation is also very possible,” he told reporters.</p><p>Russia has previously tried to pitch its vast <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/15/can-putin-sway-trump-with-economic-offers-in-alaska\">reserves of rare earth minerals</a> – critical for several cutting edge sectors – to the US to broker a breakthrough.</p><h2 id=\"next-up-another-meeting\">Next up: Another meeting – and pressure on Ukraine</h2><p>As Trump thanked Putin for his time, he said he hoped they would meet again soon. Putin quickly responded by saying, in English with a laugh, “Next time, in Moscow”.</p><p>“I’ll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening,” he said in response.</p><p>Trump has previously asserted that he hopes to host a trilateral meeting on ending the war in Ukraine very soon, this time attended by Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, too. In Alaska, the US leader said he would now call NATO officials and Zelenskyy to discuss the meeting.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity after the meeting, Trump was asked how he rated the summit on a scale of 10. He described the meet as a “10 out of 10”.</p><p>“We got along great,” he said.</p><p>Then, he emphasised the importance of the Ukrainian leader agreeing to a deal.</p><p>“Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it’s up to President Zelenskyy,” he said, adding that he’ll attend the next meeting “if they’d like”.</p><p>“Make a deal,” he said, in a message apparently for Zelenskyy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

A couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway,” Trump said.</p><p>“So there is no deal until there is a deal,” Trump said, adding that he will now call up NATO as well as President Zelenskyy and others to brief them on the meeting.</p><p>“It’s ultimately up to them,” the president said.</p><p>“Many points were agreed to,” he continued, without providing any details.</p><p>“There are just a very few that are left; some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.</p><p>“But we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”</p><p>Later, in an interview with Fox TV, Trump advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they’re not. They’re great soldiers,” Trump replied when asked about his advice to Zelenskyy.</p><p>The US president added that Zelenskyy and Putin were going to set up a meeting to try to reach a ceasefire. “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it’s up to President Zelenskyy … And if they’d like, I’ll be at that next meeting,” Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity after the Alaska meeting.</p><p>In his first public comment after the Alaska talks, Zelenskyy said he supported Trump’s proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US, and Russia, adding that Kyiv is “ready for constructive cooperation”.</p><p>“Ukraine reaffirms its readiness to work with maximum effort to achieve peace,” the Ukrainian president posted on X.</p><p>Zelenskyy said that he plans to meet the US president in Washington next week after holding a “long and substantive” conversation with Trump. The Ukrainian leader said he spoke to Trump one-on-one and then in a call with other European leaders.</p><p>He reiterated the importance of involving Europe.</p><p>“It is important that Europeans are involved at every stage to ensure reliable security guarantees together with America,” he said. “We also discussed positive signals from the American side regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security.”</p><p><span>Earlier, the US president held a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart and subsequently spoke to several European and NATO leaders after the talks with Putin, the White House said.</span></p><p>As the two leaders were talking, the war raged on, with most eastern Ukrainian regions under air raid alerts. Governors of Russia’s Rostov and Bryansk regions reported that some of their territories were under Ukrainian drone attacks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the outcome of the summit, described as “anticlimactic”.</p><p>Ukraine’s opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko said on the Telegram messaging app after the talks: “It seems Putin has bought himself more time. No ceasefire or de-escalation has been agreed upon.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Anchorage, Alaska, said President Trump is likely to come in for criticism for a summit that “all became much ado about nothing”.</p><p>“The only achievements that were actually made was that the Russian president has been able to continue his war, which we know is now a war of attrition and which each day favours the Russian side,” Halkett said.</p><p>“He has bought time,” she said.</p><p>Also reporting from the summit, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, James Bays, said Ukraine’s European allies – who had been pushing for concrete steps to come out of the meeting, such as a ceasefire – will likely see the meeting as “a big win for President Putin”.</p><p>“And it does beg all sorts of questions about where the diplomacy on Ukraine goes,” Bays said.</p><p>Melinda Haring, senior fellow from the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center, said that expectations were low.</p><p>“In some senses, I think Kyiv will wake up in the morning and European capitals will wake up and be relieved that you know Donald Trump did not try or agree to some kind of land swap,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That was the worst-case scenario … that major foreign policy decisions over Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be made without Ukraine.”</p><p>Trump ended his remarks at the news conference on Friday by telling Putin, “I’d like to thank you very much, and we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon.”</p><p>To which Putin quickly chipped back: “Next time, in Moscow.”</p><p>Trump then responded, saying that he might “get a little heat on that one” but that he could “possibly see it happening”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
