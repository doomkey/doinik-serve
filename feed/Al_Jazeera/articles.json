A relatively newer technique has been developed in Ladakh to create an “ice stupa”, which is formed after spraying water in freezing temperatures. The conical shape ice structure remains frozen for a longer period as its surface is not fully exposed to the sun.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_vulnerable_glacier floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-is-glacier-grafting-carried-out\">How is glacier grafting carried out?</h2><p>So-called “male” and “female” ice is sourced from different locations and brought together to create an artificial glacier. Villagers where this technique has been implemented as well as experts told Al Jazeera that volunteers go out to collect around 200kg (441 pounds) of “male” ice from one valley and “female” ice from another. Male ice is typically black in colour, while female ice is usually lighter, providing more fertile water that enhances agricultural productivity, according to locals.</p><p>In ancient times, due to the absence of available transportation as well as steep, narrow and slippery routes through the mountains, volunteers would travel on foot for several days, carrying the ice in traditional wooden cages on their backs.</p><p>The process requires specific materials: coal, grass, salt and water collected from seven different streams. Before setting out to the grafting site, the group would recite Quranic verses, perform spiritual rituals and pray for success.</p><p>The material, including both sets of ice blocks, would be carried to the site while “strictly following environmentally respectful and culturally sacred practices”, the locals said.</p><p>They would avoid the use of plastics, refrain from immoral actions and only consume locally produced foods such as wheat, barley, apricots and homemade bread during the process.</p><p>Humour, music, or harm to living creatures is strictly prohibited, as the procedure was viewed as both a spiritual and ecological responsibility.</p><p>At the grafting site, a small trench would be dug in a safe area, away from avalanche or flood-risk zones. The male and female ice pieces would be carefully layered together, mixed with salt, coal and grass.</p><p>“The male pieces are put on the right, while on the left, female ice pieces,” Zakir said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3972254\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3972254\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/skardu3-1758555264.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"skardu glacier pakistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan is home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers [Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Water collected from the seven streams would slowly be dripped over the ice to help bind the layers.</p><p>Over several months, the pieces fused into a single ice mass. If the site received seasonal snowfall, the mass would gradually develop into a glacier. After surviving for at least three years and enduring seasonal snow cycles, the artificially grafted glacier would expand. Over the next few years, it would become a reliable water source.</p><p>Zakir added that site selection is critical in the process: north-facing slopes, strong winds, less sun exposure and protection from direct flowing water are essential.</p><h2 id=\"rituals-discipline-and-collective-labour\">Rituals, discipline and collective labour</h2><p>Locals and experts told Al Jazeera that the deep spiritual and cultural aspects surrounding this technique are what distinguish glacier grafting from purely technical interventions.</p><p>Ice pieces are never allowed to touch the ground and must remain in continuous motion from collection to planting.</p><p>“Often, vehicles that carry these ice pieces are never switched off,” Zakir recalled, adding that those helping out are forbidden from speaking, using plastic or relieving themselves near the site.</p><p>“If one volunteer feels tired, without lying down, he will pass the basket [carrying the ice] to another volunteer.”</p><p>Historically, glacier grafting has also concluded with local music known as Gang Lho that is sung directly to the ice. One such song, the professor recalled, addresses the glacier as a living being, calling it “my dear baby glacier” having “pastures to grow… mountains to climb”.</p><p>Often, volunteers and villagers would have tears in their eyes, praying for the glacier’s establishment and survival in order to aid their survival and livelihood.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912886\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-01-1756384125.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_glacier floods_August25_2025\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-long-does-glacier-grafting-take-is-it-guaranteed-to-survive\">How long does glacier grafting take? Is it guaranteed to survive?</h2><p>A successfully grafted glacier can start supplying water within two decades, making it a long-term investment in water security.</p><p>However, experts warn that the process is vulnerable – not only to a failure of the natural process, a lack of snowfall, drops in temperatures, and climate change, but also to conflict.</p><p>“In abnormal climatic conditions, such as during war, the process may fail,” Zakir warned.</p><p>“Both India and Pakistan have deployed military forces in the glaciers, and the bullets they use, as well as the movement of soldiers and equipment, are very harmful to glaciers.”</p><p>The South Asian neighbours have fought three wars over the disputed Kashmir region, which they both govern parts of.</p><h2 id=\"can-glacier-grafting-solve-water-scarcity-problems\">Can glacier grafting solve water scarcity problems?</h2><p>The mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change, according to the World Bank.</p><p>With temperatures rising globally, glacier grafting may not be able to offer a wholesome solution to Pakistan’s melting glaciers problem. But it remains a powerful example of how Indigenous knowledge, culture and collective care have long shaped survival in the mountains.</p><p>Locals told Al Jazeera that glacier grafting is now more critical than ever to counter water scarcity and erratic snowfall that cause problems for irrigation, domestic consumption and livestock.</p><p>They also worry that the practice of glacier grafting is rapidly disappearing. Younger generations, drawn to urban centres and alternative livelihoods such as tourism, education and business, no longer engage in traditional irrigation.</p><p>This shift has disrupted the intergenerational transfer of Indigenous knowledge, they lamented.</p><p><em>This story was produced in partnership with the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulitzer Center</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Protesters accused the Awami League government of using the quota system to reward its supporters.</p><p>The Hasina government was forced to abolish the quota in 2018. But in June 2024, a court reinstated the quota system, triggering the protests that soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina’s “autocratic” regime. Hasina’s 15-rule was marked by widespread human rights violations and suppression of dissent.</p><p>Nur backed the student-led uprising and was a key mobiliser in the July 2024 revolution.</p><p>He cofounded Gono Odhikar Parishad, a rights-focused political party, and positioned himself as part of a youth-driven, antiestablishment movement in Bangladeshi politics. However, the party has been mired in frequent internal rifts and breakaways.</p><p>In the post-2024 Hasina period, Nur moved closer to the BNP-led bloc on reform and governance policies.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-zonayed-saki\">Who is Zonayed Saki?</h2><p>Saki became involved in politics as a student activist during the movement against General Hussain Ershad, who ruled Bangladesh from 1982 to 1990.</p><p>The 52-year-old won the presidency of the Bangladesh Student Federation, a progressive student organisation, in 1998.</p><p>Saki is the joint convener of the Ganosanhati Andolan, or People’s Solidarity Movement, a progressive party that emerged in the late 2000s.

The 25 have been drawn overwhelmingly from the BNP and its close allies.</p><p>Among the state (junior) ministers appointed to Rahman’s government are Nurul Haque and Zonayed Saki, first-time parliamentarians, who were prominent voices during the 2024 protests.</p><p>While members of the cabinet have been announced, the ministries they will be responsible for have not yet been confirmed. Here’s a look at who some of them are.</p><h3>Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2023/10/29/bangladesh-opposition-leader-alamgir-detained-after-antigovernment-rally\">Alamgir</a>, who has served as secretary-general of the BNP since 2016, was elected to his seat in parliament by the constituency of Thakurgaon-1, a district in northwestern Bangladesh.</p><p>Alamgir, 78, served as a member of parliament from 2001 to 2006 under the previous BNP government, led by Rahman’s late mother, Khaleda Zia, during which he was also state minister for agriculture and later for civil aviation and tourism.</p><p>After the end of that government’s term, a caretaker administration took over until elections in 2008, which Alamgir stood in but did not win. He remained a senior member of the BNP outside parliament.</p><p>In October 2023, Alamgir was detained by police the day after mass antigovernment protests swept through Dhaka when Hasina’s Awami League party was in power. The police said he had been detained for questioning in connection with the violence that erupted during those demonstrations.</p><p>When the BNP win was announced last week, Alamgir hailed the victory and called the BNP “a party of the people”.</p><h3 id=\"amir-khasru-mahmud-chowdhury\">Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury</h3><p>Chowdhury was elected from the Chattogram-11 constituency, which covers the Bandar and Patenga areas of Chattogram city in southeastern Bangladesh.</p><p>From 2001 to 2004, Chowdhury served as minister of commerce under the previous BNP administration. He is a member of the BNP’s standing committee.</p><p>Before last week’s vote, Chowdhury said that if elected, the BNP would govern by investing in people, “in health, in education and upskilling” and by supporting “artisans, the weavers” and small industries with credit as well as helping them access international markets, including by helping them with their branding.</p><h3>Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku</h3><p>Tuku, 75, has been elected as a member of parliament for the Sirajganj-2 constituency in North Bengal.</p><p>Tuku is a member of the BNP Standing Committee, the party’s top policymaking body.</p><p>He is a veteran BNP figure who has been elected to parliament multiple times and has held important party roles. From 2001 to 2006, he served as the state minister for power. In 2006, he also briefly served as the state minister for agriculture.</p><p>In 2007, during the military-backed interim government, a special anticorruption court in Dhaka sentenced Tuku to nine years in prison in a case filed against him by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). The ACC accused Tuku of concealing information about assets worth 49.6 million takas (roughly $400,000).</p><p>The High Court upheld his conviction and jail sentence in 2023 after a lengthy appeal process. However, in September 2025, a year after the overthrow of the Awami League government, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court acquitted Tuku.</p><h3>Khalilur Rahman</h3><p>Khalilur Rahman is a technocratic minister, appointed for his expertise rather than as a party politician. He is not a member of parliament.</p><p>He served as national security adviser in the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus, which took over to oversee a transition after Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>He also served as the government’s representative for the Rohingya issue during Yunus’s tenure. The refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in southern Bangladesh are sheltering more than one million <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/no-expectations-bangladesh-election-means-little-to-1m-rohingya-refugees\">Rohingya refugees</a>, most of whom fled Myanmar in 2017 to escape a military crackdown.</p><h3 id=\"afroza-khanam-rita\">Afroza Khanam Rita</h3><p>The only woman cabinet minister, Rita is a first-time member of parliament but comes from a political family: Her late father was a four-times MP. Rita is also the chairwoman of the Monno Group of Industries, a conglomerate whose firms produce ceramic ware, textiles and agricultural machinery – primarily for export.</p><h3>Asaduzzaman</h3><p>Asaduzzaman, was elected from the Jhenaidah-1 (Shailkupa) constituency, which covers Shailkupa upazila in Jhenaidah district in southwestern Bangladesh.</p><h3>Dipen Dewan</h3><p>Dewan, 62, a Chakma Buddhist leader, is expected to be named minister of Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs. Dewan won from the Rangamati constituency.</p><p>Chakma Buddhists are an ethnic group of Tibeto-Burman speaking people. They are indigenous to the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and parts of northeastern India.</p><h3>Nitai Roy Chowdhury</h3><p>Chowdhury, a Hindu leader, is widely expected to become the minister of cultural affairs.</p><p>Chowdhury, 77, has served as a senior adviser and strategist for the BNP’s top leaders.</p><h2 id=\"how-significant-are-these-appointments\">How significant are these appointments?</h2><p>During campaigning, the BNP pledged to meet the people’s demand for an elected government with real legitimacy. Therefore, ministers and cabinet members can expect a significant amount of scrutiny, experts said.</p><p>Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, lecturer in global studies and governance at the Independent University, Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera: “The appointees in their respective fields will also face an invisible yet significant pressure to prove themselves more effective and distinctive than the previous administrations, both the interim government and, of course, the Awami League-led government under Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>He added: “It will be particularly interesting to observe whether, after a youth-led mass uprising, the core of executive power is taken over by the old guard or by new faces that reflect diversity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and religion.”</p><p>While two prominent figures from the 2024 student uprisings have been named as state ministers – Nurul Haque and Zonayed Saki – Rejwan added that leaders of the student-led National Citizen Party, which was founded after the 2024 uprising, had made a “strategic mistake” by allying with Jamaat instead of the BNP.</p><p>“They had the option to form an alliance with the BNP, which they later abandoned in favour of Jamaat. Given these political dynamics, it is unlikely that any student leaders will receive cabinet positions.”</p><h2 id=\"who-attended-the-ceremony-to-swear-in-the-new-cabinet\">Who attended the ceremony to swear in the new cabinet?</h2><p>Several foreign delegations were in Bangladesh to attend the ceremony.</p><p>They included Maldivian President <a href=\"/news/2023/10/1/who-is-mohamed-muizzu-maldivess-pro-china-president-elect\">Mohamed Muizzu</a> and Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.</p><p>India was represented by Om Birla, the speaker of its lower house in Parliament. Pakistani Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal also attended.</p><p>Leaders and representatives from Nepal and the United Kingdom, China, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Brunei were among those who were invited to attend.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A revised draft legislation is currently being debated in the national security committee in parliament before being sent for a second and a third reading.</p><p>A vote has yet to be scheduled.</p><h2><strong>Palestinian Prisoner’s Society: Prisoners living in ‘hell’</strong></h2><p>The head of a Palestinian society that campaigns for the prisoners said <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/global-system-of-human-rights-in-peril-warns-hrw-in-its-annual-report\">Palestinian prisoners</a> are already living “in hell”, and the law calling for the execution of prisoners represents a dangerous development.</p><p>“Escalation against prisoners has continued without pause over the past two years, culminating in what Israeli media announced regarding the imminent implementation of the execution law,” Abdullah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society in the occupied West Bank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Talk of additional measures and preparations to hang prisoners from Gaza and the West Bank comes within a broader escalation that coincides with the ongoing war against the Palestinian people, including within prison walls,” al-Zaghari said.</p><h2><strong>Violations of international law</strong></h2><p>He said all measures against prisoners introduced by Israel’s far-right government after it took office three years ago were a violation of international law.</p><p>Ramzi Odeh, professor of international law and head of the International Academic Campaign Against Occupation and Apartheid, said the proposed law constitutes “apartheid legislation” because it differentiates between Palestinians and non-Palestinians.</p><p>“An Israeli settler or soldier who kills a Palestinian is not subject to this law,” he told Al Jazeera. “They are tried under ordinary procedures, and the execution law is not applied to them. This is clear discrimination in punishment against Palestinians.”</p><p>Odeh said Israel has classified Palestinian detainees under what it calls the category of “unlawful combatants” – a designation that rights groups consider controversial because it removes them from prisoner-of-war protections under international law while also not treating them as civilian detainees subject to ordinary judicial safeguards.</p><p>“As a result, in many cases they are not presented with clear indictments, nor are they tried within defined timeframes, but are kept in detention for long and open-ended periods,” he said.</p><p>“The most dangerous aspect of this law is preventing the International Committee of the Red Cross from visiting prisoners, as well as restricting lawyers’ visits until the late stages of proceedings,” Odeh added.</p><p>He said the Fourth Geneva Convention clearly guarantees Red Cross visits, access to medical care, adequate food and family visits.</p><p>“Israel has exploited the events of 7 October 2023 to disregard these obligations, while the world remains silent,” he added.</p><h2><strong>Appeals for international support</strong></h2><p>Al-Zaghari called on Arab and Muslim mediators, including the emir of Qatar, and the Egyptian and Turkish presidents, to intervene and ensure protection for prisoners’ lives and rights.</p><p>Al-Zaghari said Palestinian rights organisations were preparing to launch an international campaign to confront what he described as “massacres” inside prisons. He said meetings have been held with foreign consuls and ambassadors, as well as with the International Committee of the Red Cross, but gave no further details.</p><p>“If there is no urgent and effective action to stop the prisoners’ execution law and the assaults inside prisons, the situation will deteriorate further and reach dangerous levels,” he warned.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 60 years ago, US officials decided that the largest island, Diego Garcia, would be a suitable location for a remote military base.</p><p data-start=\"1248\" data-end=\"1551\">The US saw the Chagossian population as a problem, as they wanted the island “clean” of inhabitants. Over the next decade, they secretly plotted with the UK – the colonial power governing Chagos – through a manufactured story based on racism and lies, to force the islanders from their home.</p><p data-start=\"1553\" data-end=\"1952\">One US admiral, Elmo Zumwalt, said the islanders “absolutely must go”. To scare them into leaving, UK and US personnel gassed their dogs. From 1967 to 1973, the UK proceeded to force all the Chagossians – as many as 2,000 people – from all the islands, not only Diego Garcia. The US built and has now operated the Diego Garcia base for more than 50 years.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2275\">Today, the Chagossians live in exile, largely in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Many remain in poverty and have been prevented by the UK and US from returning to live in their homeland, even though generations have continued to campaign to do so. The islands, apart from the US military base, remain abandoned.</p><p data-start=\"2277\" data-end=\"2717\">The story of US involvement in this forced displacement has been gradually uncovered, including through a congressional inquiry, the work of the academic David Vine, and the indefatigable struggle of generations of Chagossians to uncover the truth and return home. In 2023, Human Rights Watch found that the UK and US were responsible for crimes against humanity and had a duty to provide reparations – an opportunity to right their wrongs.</p><p data-start=\"2719\" data-end=\"3064\">As a result, the US State Department for the first time acknowledged “regret” for what had happened to the Chagossians. Subsequently, the UK and Mauritius agreed in principle to a treaty to recognise Mauritian sovereignty over the islands, although the UK will maintain formal control of Diego Garcia island and the US military base will remain.</p><p data-start=\"3066\" data-end=\"3554\">Forgotten in this settlement are the Chagossians. The treaty talks about historical wrongs, but the crimes are ongoing. The Chagossians are still prevented from returning home: Their islands – apart from the base – remain empty. Some Chagossians hope that the treaty will allow them to live on some of the islands, though this will depend on Mauritius fulfilling its obligations. The treaty itself provides no guarantee of their return and says nothing about the reparations owed to the Chagossians.</p><p data-start=\"3556\" data-end=\"3922\">The US still appears opposed to Chagossians returning to Diego Garcia, even though the base occupies at most half the island. No Chagossian we’ve spoken to wants the base to close; instead, they would like the opportunity to work there. The US has kept a very low public profile in the negotiations – at least until President Trump’s comments – hiding behind the UK.</p><p data-start=\"3924\" data-end=\"4150\">But the agreement’s terms make it clear that the US has been influencing the negotiations. The US “regret” for the treatment of the Chagossians has yet to translate into ensuring the Chagossians can return to Diego Garcia.</p><p data-start=\"4152\" data-end=\"4608\">The treatment of the Chagossians is a crime in which the US has been implicated for more than 50 years, and to which Trump has inadvertently drawn attention. Having acknowledged regret, the US and UK governments should now ensure that their actions align with their obligations under international law, including working with Mauritius to enable the Chagossians to return to their homeland and providing appropriate reparations. Until that happens, the injustice remains unresolved.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Edelman stated that the military intervention was ‘the most just and moral war in history’, according to him.”</p><p>Reina was critical of the athlete’s presence in Cortina during these Games, saying it “raises questions” as it pertains to the International Olympic Committee’s decision that “any athlete who has participated in activities supporting war, either militarily or through their social media accounts, is ineligible to participate.”</p><p>This decision had been specifically applied to Russian athletes after their country launched a war on Ukraine. He questioned why similar standards weren’t applied to Israel.</p><p>“Edelman asked his followers to cheer on Ward Fawarsa – an Israeli athlete present here in Cortina – while he was involved in an Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2023,” the Swiss journalist added.</p><p>The Israeli bobsleigh team finished last out of the 26 teams.</p><p>While the video has been widely circulated on social media, RTS removed it from their YouTube channel overnight.</p><p>The Swiss media outlet has confirmed to Al Jazeera that the video originated from their coverage of the Games.</p><p>“Our journalist wanted to question the IOC’s policy regarding the statements made by the athlete in question,” RTS told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.</p><p>“However, such information, while factual, is inappropriate for sports commentary due to its length. Therefore, we removed the segment from our website last night.”</p><p>Reina’s commentary has been commended by a wide range of sports fans and Palestinian supporters, who lauded his courage to use his platform to condemn the Israeli athletes.</p><p></p><p>But he was also at the receiving end of criticism and outrage, led by the United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who accused Reina of anti-Semitism and “spreading bigotry and hatred” in a post on X.</p><p>The StopAntisemitism organisation, a prominent arm of the Zionist lobby in the US, called for Reina’s dismissal, claiming he insulted the Israeli team.</p><p>Edelman responded to Reina’s commentary on his social media accounts, saying: “I am aware of the scathing attack launched by the commentator against the Israeli bobsleigh team during today’s Swiss Olympics broadcast.</p><p>He added: “The Scholl Runnings team consists of six proud Israelis who reached the Olympic podium. We have no coach, no intensive training programme, just a dream, determination, and unwavering pride in what we represent. We work together to achieve a great goal and successfully surpass it. Because that’s what Israelis do. I don’t think it’s possible to watch that and believe what the commentator is saying.”</p><p>The IOC did not issue a statement on the incident, but its spokesman, Mark Adams, responded to questions on it during his news conference on Tuesday.</p><p>“I would remind everyone involved, however tangentially, in the Olympic Games, of the values and the charter and the idea of us trying to bring people together despite what’s happening in the rest of the world,” he said.</p><p>“But in terms of specific comments by a commentator on one specific broadcast, I think that’s a matter to refer to the broadcaster. So that’s not a question for us at this stage.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For decades, the “alternative homeland” – the notion that Jordan should become the Palestinian state – was dismissed in Amman’s diplomatic circles as a distant nightmare or a conspiracy theory.</p><p>Today, under the shadow of a far-right Israeli government and a devastating genocidal war in Gaza, that nightmare has become an operational reality.</p><p>The alarm in the Hashemite Kingdom reached a fever pitch on Sunday, following the Israeli cabinet’s approval of measures to register vast swaths of the occupied West Bank as “state land” under the Israeli Ministry of Justice. The move, described by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich as a “settlement revolution”, effectively bypasses the military administration that has governed the occupied territory since 1967, treating it instead as sovereign Israeli soil.</p><p>For Jordan, this bureaucratic annexation is the final signal that the status quo is dead. With the Israeli military’s “Iron Wall” operation crushing refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarem, Jordan’s political and military establishment is no longer asking if a forced transfer is coming, but how to stop it.</p><p>“The transfer is no longer a threat; it is moving to execution,” Mamdouh al-Abbadi, Jordan’s former deputy prime minister, told Al Jazeera. “We are seeing the practical application … The alternative homeland is something that is coming; after this West Bank, the enemy will move to the East Bank, to Jordan.”</p><h2 id=\"silent-transfer\">The ‘silent transfer’</h2><p>The fear in Amman is not just about military invasion, but about a “soft transfer”, making life in the West Bank unliveable to force a gradual exodus towards Jordan.</p><p>Sunday’s decision to transfer land registration authority to the Israeli Justice Ministry is viewed in Jordan as a critical step in this process. By erasing the Jordanian and Ottoman land registries that have protected Palestinian property rights for a century, Israel is clearing the legal path for massive settlement expansion.</p><p>Al-Abbadi, a veteran voice in Jordanian politics, pointed to symbolic but dangerous shifts in Israeli military nomenclature.</p><p>“There is a new brigade in the Israeli army, named the Gilead Brigade,” al-Abbadi noted. “What is Gilead? Gilead is a mountainous region near the capital, Amman. This means the Israelis are proceeding with their strategic practices from the Nile to the Euphrates.”</p><p>He argued that the 1994 Wadi Araba Treaty is effectively null and void in the eyes of the current Israeli leadership.</p><p>“Smotrich’s ideology is not just the view of one person; it has become the doctrine of the state,” al-Abbadi said, warning that the Israeli consensus has shifted permanently. “They are the ones who killed the Wadi Araba treaty before it was even born … If we do not wake up, the strategy will be ‘either us or them’. There is no third option.”</p><h2 id=\"second-army-of-tribes\">A ‘second army’ of tribes</h2><p>As diplomatic avenues narrow, questions are turning to Jordan’s military options. The Jordan Valley, a long strip of fertile land separating the two banks, is now the front line of what Jordanian strategists call an “existential defence”.</p><p>Major-General (retired) Mamoun Abu Nowar, a military expert, warned that Israel’s actions amount to an “undeclared war” on the kingdom. He suggested that if the displacement pressure continues, Jordan must be ready to take drastic measures.</p><p>“Jordan could declare the Jordan Valley a closed military zone to prevent displacement,” Abu Nowar told Al Jazeera. “This could lead to conflict and ignite the region.”</p><p>While acknowledging the disparity in military capabilities, he dismissed the idea that Israel could easily overrun Jordan, citing the kingdom’s unique social fabric.</p><p>“The Jordanian interior, with its tribes and clans … this is a second army,” Abu Nowar said. “Every village and every governorate will be a defensive line for Jordan … Israel will not succeed in this confrontation.”</p><p>However, he cautioned that the situation is volatile. With the West Bank potentially exploding into a religious conflict, he warned of a “regional earthquake” if red lines are crossed. “Our army is professional and ready for all scenarios, including military confrontation,” he added. “We cannot leave it like this.”</p><h2 id=\"the-collapse-of-the-us-guarantee\">The collapse of the US guarantee</h2><p>Compounding Jordan’s anxiety is a deep sense of abandonment by its oldest ally: the United States. For decades, the “Jordanian option” —the stability of the Hashemite Kingdom — was a cornerstone of US policy.</p><p>But Oraib al-Rantawi, director of the Al-Quds Center for Political Studies, argued that this “strategic wager” has collapsed.</p><p>“The bet on Washington … has faltered, if not collapsed,” al-Rantawi told Al Jazeera. He pointed to a “paradigm shift” that began during US President Donald Trump’s first term, which saw Washington move its regional anchor from Amman and Cairo to the Gulf capitals, “dazzled by the shine of money and investments”.</p><p>Al-Rantawi noted that even under the Biden administration, and now with the return of Trump, the US has shown a willingness to sacrifice Jordanian interests for Israel.</p><p>“When put to the test — choosing between two allies — Washington will inevitably choose Israel without hesitation,” al-Rantawi said.</p><p>He described Jordan’s position as precarious, trapped in a dependency loop. “Jordan is between two fires: the fire of [US] aid on one hand, and the fire of the threat … the existential Israeli threat to the entity and identity,” he said.</p><p>General Abu Nowar echoed this scepticism regarding US protection, questioning whether Jordan’s status as a key non-NATO ally means anything in practice. “Will they apply Article 5 of NATO to us?” he asked. “This gives a lack of credibility to the Americans.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3505255\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/INTERACTIVE-US-foreign-aid-to-Jordan-1739358458.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - US foreign aid to Jordan-1739358458\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Facing this isolation, voices in Amman are calling for a radical overhaul of Jordan’s alliances. The kingdom has traditionally maintained a cold peace with the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah while shunning Hamas and other resistance factions, a policy al-Rantawi believes has been a strategic error.</p><p>“Jordan shot its diplomacy in the foot,” al-Rantawi explained, by insisting on an exclusive relationship with the weakened PA in Ramallah.</p><p>He contrasted Jordan’s position with that of Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye, which maintained ties with the Palestinian group Hamas and thus retained leverage. “Cairo, Doha, and Ankara kept ties with Hamas, which strengthened their presence even with the US,” he said. “Jordan gave up this role voluntarily … or due to miscalculation.”</p><p>Al-Rantawi suggested this reluctance stems from internal fears of empowering the Muslim Brotherhood within Jordan, but the cost has been a loss of regional influence just when Amman needs it most.</p><h2 id=\"preparing-for-the-worst\">Preparing for the worst</h2><p>The consensus among the elite is that the time for “diplomatic warnings” is over. The language in Amman has shifted to mobilisation and survival.</p><p>In early February, the kingdom officially resumed its compulsory military service programme, known as “Flag Service”, ending a 35-year hiatus. The Jordanian armed forces stated the move aims to “develop combat capabilities to keep pace with modern warfare methods” amid complex regional conditions.</p><p>Al-Abbadi went further, calling for universal conscription to ensure total readiness. “We ask the state for compulsory conscription; everyone in Jordan must be able to bear arms,” he said.</p><p>He also urged cultural mobilisation. “We must teach our children at least the Hebrew language, because he who knows the language of a people is safe from their evil.”</p><p>Calling for strict monitoring of the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge crossing, he added: “If there is a slow, camouflaged transfer … we must close the bridges immediately and without hesitation.”</p><p>As the Israeli Justice Ministry begins rewriting the land deeds of the West Bank, erasing Palestinian ownership in ledgers just as their homes are erased on the ground, Jordan faces its most precarious moment since 1967. The buffer is gone, and the kingdom finds itself standing alone in the path of the storm.</p><p>“The world gives speeches, everyone condemns … and Israel acts,” al-Abbadi said. “If we do not wake up … the strategy will be: ‘Either us or them’. There is no third strategy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In Area A, the PA controls most affairs.</p><p><strong>Area B</strong> represents about 22 percent of the West Bank. In both areas, while the PA is in charge of education, health and the economy, the Israelis have full control of external security, meaning they retain the right to enter at any time.</p><p><strong>Area C</strong> represents 60 percent of the West Bank. Under the Oslo Accords, control of this area was supposed to be handed over to the PA. Instead, Israel retains total control over all matters, including security, planning and construction. The transfer of control to the PA never happened.</p><p>Although Area C is the least populated part of the West Bank, with about 300,000 Palestinians compared with about 3 million in Areas A and B, the vast majority of home demolitions and settler attacks occur there, due to it being under full Israeli military and administrative control.</p><p>The Israeli Civil Administration rarely grants building permits to Palestinians in this area, so nearly all construction is considered illegal and subject to demolition.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3181340\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3181340\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3181340\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INTERACTIVE-Occupied-West-Bank-Area-A-B-C-5-Palestine-1726465625.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Occupied West Bank - Area A B C - 5 - Palestine-1726465625\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3181340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"record-number-of-israeli-settler-attacks\">Record number of Israeli settler attacks</h2><p>Since Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023, violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank has steadily risen.</p><p>According to data from OCHA, settlers have attacked Palestinians more than 3,700 times in the occupied West Bank over the past 28 months.</p><p>The number of settler attacks has risen sharply since 2016, with 852 recorded in 2022, 1,291 in 2023, 1,449 in 2024 and 1,828 in 2025 – an average of five attacks per day, according to data from OCHA.</p><p>Every West Bank governorate has faced settler attacks over the past year.</p><p>Data from OCHA shows that between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025, the Ramallah and el-Bireh governorate recorded the highest number of settler attacks with 523 incidents, followed by Nablus with 349 and Hebron with 309.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4319194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4319194\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4319194\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Settler-attacks-across-the0Doccupied-West-Bank-2024-2025-west-bank-October-14-2025-1771321248.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Settler attacks across theoccupied West Bank (2024-2025)-west bank - October 14, 2025-1771321248\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4319194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-israeli-settlers\">Who are Israeli settlers?</h2><p>Settlers are Israeli citizens living in illegal, Jewish-only communities, known as <a href=\"/news/2023/11/6/who-are-israeli-settlers-and-why-do-they-live-on-palestinian-lands\">Israeli settlements</a>, built on Palestinian-owned land that Israel occupied in 1967.</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu – Israel’s longest-serving prime minister – has bolstered settlement expansions since he first came to power in 1996, <a href=\"/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands\">undermining the 1993 Oslo Accords</a>, which called for the freezing of settlements and a mutually negotiated two-state solution.</p><p>Today, roughly 10 percent of Israel’s Jewish population, totalling between 600,000 and 750,000 people, live in about 250 settlements and outposts dispersed throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p><p>Many of these settlements are located near Palestinian population centres, often leading to increased tensions and restrictions on movement for Palestinians.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3608161 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Occupied-West-Bank-settlement-expansion-1743158479.png?resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Occupied West Bank - settlement expansion-1743158479\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

The probe seeks to “ensure we have safeguards in place not only to hold those individuals accountable, who were complicit, but to ensure that this can never happen again”.</p><p></p><p>Epstein bought the 7,600-acre (3075-hectare) property, which included a hilltop mansion and private runway, from former New Mexico Democrat Governor Bruce King in 1993.</p><p class=\"p1\">Victim advocates say Epstein trafficked and sexually abused girls at the so-called “playboy ranch” as early as 1996, including <a href=\"/news/2025/4/26/epstein-prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-by-suicide-family\">Virginia Giuffre</a>, the prominent victim who accused Epstein and the disgraced British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of abuse.</p><p>Multiple civil lawsuits specify the ranch as a site of abuse. Epstein’s habit of flying “masseuses” to the property – as well as hiring local massage therapists – was also revealed in the Epstein files as part of a ranch manager’s 2007 testimony to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p class=\"p1\">Epstein was never charged with crimes related to the site.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” said Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors.</p><p>Yet federal investigators never cast their eye on the property, according to Andrea Romero, a New Mexico state representative who co-sponsored the legislation.</p><p>And while New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas attempted to kick off a probe in 2019, federal prosecutors asked for it to be put on hold to avoid a “parallel investigation”, he said in a statement.</p><p>Epstein “was basically doing anything he wanted in this estate without any accountability whatsoever”, Romero said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The committee – which will have subpoena power – aims to close that gap by gathering testimony that could be used in future litigation, Romero said. New Mexico’s state attorney general has also allocated a special agent to look into any allegations that arise.</p><p class=\"p1\">The ranch was sold at a 2023 auction to the family of Don Huffines, a former Republican Texas senator who is now running for Texas state comptroller, the Santa Fe New Mexican media outlet reported. A family spokesperson said they would give investigators “full and complete cooperation”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
