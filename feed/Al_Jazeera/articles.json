Russian oil to Slovakia, making good on <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat\">an ultimatum</a> he issued to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>Fico’s announcement on Monday came two days after he warned Zelenskyy on social media that he would ask state-owned company SEPS to halt emergency supplies of electricity if flows of Russian crude oil via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline crossing Ukraine did not resume.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“As of today, if the Ukrainian side turns to Slovakia with a request for assistance in stabilising the Ukrainian energy grid, such assistance will not be provided,” Fico said in a video on his Facebook page.</p><p>Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement that it had not been officially informed yet, but that it would “not affect the situation in the unified power system of Ukraine”.</p><p>“The last time Ukraine requested emergency assistance from Slovakia was over a month ago and in a very limited volume,” it said.</p><p>Fico said the stoppage would be lifted “as soon as the transit of oil to Slovakia is restored”.</p><p>“Otherwise, we will take further reciprocal steps,” he said, adding his country would also reconsider “its previously constructive positions on Ukraine’s EU membership”.</p><p>He said the stalled oil supply was a “purely political decision aimed at blackmailing Slovakia over its international positions on the war in Ukraine”.</p><p>Slovakia and neighbouring Hungary, which have both remained dependent on Russian oil since the Kremlin launched its <a href=\"/features/2026/2/20/ukraines-patience-with-us-peace-push-wears-thin-as-russia-skirts-pressure\">invasion of Ukraine</a> almost four years ago, have become increasingly vocal in demanding that Kyiv resume deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline, which was shut down after what Ukraine said was a Russian drone strike hit infrastructure in late January.</p><p>Ukraine says it is fixing the damage on the pipeline, which still carries Russian oil over Ukrainian territory to Europe, as fast as it can.</p><p>Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage and have declared emergencies over the cut in oil deliveries.</p><p>The EU imposed a ban on most oil imports from Russia in 2022, but the Druzhba pipeline was exempted to give landlocked Central European countries time to find alternative oil supplies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union failed to agree on new sanctions on Russia for the fourth anniversary of Europe’s biggest war since World War II, after Hungary vetoed the move.</p><p>Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban – the friendliest EU leader to the Kremlin – is stalling the sanctions and a 90-billion-euro ($106bn) EU loan to Ukraine until Kyiv reopens the oil pipeline.</p><p>Fico also said he has refused to “involve the Slovak Republic” in the latest EU loan due to Zelenskyy’s “unacceptable behaviour”, alluding to Ukraine’s earlier halting of <a href=\"/news/2025/1/1/russian-gas-flow-to-europe-via-ukraine-stopped-who-does-it-hurt\">Russian gas</a> supplies after a five-year-old transit agreement expired on January 1, 2025, which Fico claimed is costing Slovakia “damages of 500 million [euros; $590m] per year”.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia have accounted for 68 percent of Ukraine’s imported power this month, according to Kyiv-based consultancy ExPro. It was not immediately clear if emergency electricity supplies were included in that figure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago! They were also just reaffirmed by the ridiculous and poorly crafted supreme court decision!” Trump said in the post.</p><p>Trump does have some authority to impose other tariffs, but they are much more limited.</p><p>Following the court’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6–3 decision</a> on Friday, the president said he would introduce a 10 percent tariff, raising it to 15 percent by Saturday under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, the maximum limit under the statute that enables the White House to impose tariffs for 150 days.</p><p>The statute only requires a presidential declaration and does not require further investigation. Section 122 is only temporary; the tariffs would then expire unless Congress extends them.</p><p>Trump’s tariffs are overwhelmingly unpopular. A new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"looming-uncertainty\">Looming uncertainty</h2><p>Experts warn that Trump’s newly imposed tariffs will fuel further economic uncertainty.</p><p>“What we do know is that it would continue to require all those parties affected to continue to live in uncertainty and, as many have already pointed out, such uncertainty is not good for our economy and has negative impacts on American consumers,” Max Kulyk, partner and CEO of Chicory Wealth, a private wealth advisory firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s impossible to plan. You hear that tariffs are off, and you are considering how to get refunds. Then a few hours later, it’s 10 percent. Then it’s 15 percent the next day…. Not having that stable framework is hurtful for activity, hiring, investment,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Gold, which is considered a safe investment in times of economic uncertainty, surged by 2 percent on Monday, hitting a three-week high as tariff pressures remain unclear.</p><p>US markets are also taking a hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 1.1 percent in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 is also down by 1 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by 1.5 percent since the market opened on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"stalling-trade-deals\">Stalling trade deals</h2><p>Trump’s erratic approach has also deterred movement on looming trade deals.</p><p>On Monday, the European Parliament opted to postpone voting on a trade deal with the US. It is the second time the bloc has pushed back the vote. The first was in protest against Trump’s unsolicited attempts to acquire Greenland.</p><p>The assembly had been considering removing several European Union import duties on US goods. Committee chair Bernd Lange said the new temporary US tariff could mean increased levies for some EU exports, and no one knew what would happen after they expire in 150 days. EU lawmakers will reconvene on March 4 to assess if the US has clarified the situation and confirmed its commitment to last year’s deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

another,” an anonymous resident of the town of Aguililla in Michoacan told the news service AFP, saying that cartel gunmen attacked a local outpost of soldiers on Sunday. “But they couldn’t advance because the soldiers stopped them.”</p><p>Defence Secretary Ricardo Trevilla said that an additional 2,500 security force members would be sent to Jalisco to reinforce the armed forces already deployed there, and Sheinbaum said that all of the more than 250 roadblocks erected across 20 states in response to the raid have been removed.</p><p>Mexican officials have sought to downplay the prospect of long-term disruptions stemming from the raid, with Sheinbaum saying that flights to and from Puerto Vallarta, located in the state of Jalisco, are expected to resume on Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>“In Puerto Vallarta, flights continue to be disrupted due to availability of flight crews. The Embassy is in close contact with airlines to monitor their plans,” the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a social media post on Monday. “All other airports in Mexico are open, and most airports are operating normally. If you are traveling via any airport other than Guadalajara or Puerto Vallarta, we have received no indication of any security-related flight disruptions.”</p><p>The Mexican embassy to the US has shared social media posts debunking online rumours of attacks on civilians at Guadalajara airport and US tourists being held hostage.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The government’s argument is that the taxes are necessary to pay salaries and pensions for state employees and retirees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We had to find a quick source to fund the raises,” he said. “These are exceptional measures… but the government wants to reform the tax system, not just impose new taxes.”</p><p>Salam also said that his government inherited a “very difficult” financial situation and promised that he would rebuild trust between the state and the people by working to establish a fair tax system.</p><p>Lebanon’s Finance Minister Yassine Jaber said the fuel price increase would take effect immediately, but that VAT increases would need parliament’s approval.</p><p>“More than 50 per cent of the budget today is allocated to salaries, and it was necessary to take steps to secure the funds,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"vat-is-a-regressive-tax\">VAT is a regressive tax</h2><p>But not everyone agreed with the decision, including some ministers themselves. The right-wing Lebanese Forces bloc – which is part of the government coalition – voiced objection to the tax increase, calling for a study of the impacts.</p><p>Analysts, meanwhile, were heavily critical of the tax increase. They said that the rise of petrol prices and VAT would punish the country’s most vulnerable and would further widen the gap between rich and poor in Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The people who are most affected by value-added taxes are usually the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable, given the type of their consumption, which is mostly filled of the goods and the services that are affected by taxation, and whereby the proportion of the taxation is significant,” Farah al-Shami, senior fellow and programme director for Social Protection at the Arab Reform Initiative, told Al Jazeera. “VAT is by nature the most regressive type of taxation. Studies have shown that it affects the full supply chain, meaning everything that goes into the production, for example, of a certain good is affected.”</p><p>A price increase at every step of the supply chain means that prices compound to end up being more expensive for consumers.</p><p>In 2019, decades of government mismanagement of the economy ended in the collapse of the banking sector and the depreciation of the Lebanese pound by over 90 percent. Before 2019, $1 was equivalent to 1,500 Lebanese pounds, whereas now $1 is valued at nearly 89,500 Lebanese pounds.</p><p>Many lost their life savings with the currency freefall. Banks quickly shut their doors and limited withdrawals. More than six years later, many Lebanese have not recovered, nor has the economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"scandalous-undertaxing\">Scandalous undertaxing</h2><p>The high cost of living is a regular talking point among Lebanese, particularly in the capital, Beirut. Many are struggling to make ends meet and rely on the $5.8bn in remittances from family or contacts abroad (these are 2024 figures).</p><p>With so many struggling, a tax increase that impacts the entire population is a recipe for anger. And analysts said that if the government is in need of tax revenue, there are plenty of undertaxed sources to draw from.</p><p>“Property in Lebanon remains scandalously undertaxed,” Dania Arayssi, a senior analyst at New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy Luxury, told Al Jazeera. “Real estate in Beirut — some of the most expensive per square metre in the region — generates a fraction of the public revenue it could and should. Capital gains on property are minimal. Wealth held in land and assets is effectively sheltered. Similarly, luxury goods face no meaningful additional burden.”</p><p>Fouad Debs, a lawyer and member of the Depositors Union, a group founded after the 2019 banking crisis to protect the rights of depositors, said the decision went against the government’s stated goals of reform.</p><p>“All of this is to keep the [current] system intact and save the banks, instead of having them also pay the taxes that they should pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If it wasn’t Turkiye, it would be Iraq. If it wasn’t Iraq, it would be Hezbollah. If it wasn’t Hezbollah, it would be the Muslim Brotherhood. It doesn’t matter who. There just always needs to be a threat.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"worsening-relations\">Worsening relations</h2><p>Israel has existed in a heightened state of war since the attack led by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Since then, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza, invaded Lebanon, bombed Yemen, occupied parts of Syria, launched a war against regional power Iran, and most recently defied global opinion and international law by moving closer to annexing territory in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Against this background, analysts explained, talk of more threats – such as the one from Turkiye – and fresh alliances are cast from the same mould. Despite being political opponents, Netanyahu and Bennett are both right-wing Israelis who are completely opposed to a Palestinian state, and who share similar beliefs on pushing for Israeli regional hegemony.</p><p>“This has always been what Naftali Bennett has been about,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said.</p><p>“Liberal [Israelis] have been projecting their own hopes onto him for years, simply because he was an opponent of Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s to miss the point,” he said, referencing both men’s apparent contempt for Palestinians. “He isn’t even pretending now. He’s just trying to overtake Netanyahu on his right.”</p><p>But a focus on Turkiye as a threat is both complicated – the two countries have a decades-long relationship, and Turkiye is a member of NATO – while also an understandable objective for an Israeli right keen to ensure that a new bogeyman exists.</p><p>While Israel has had an antagonistic relationship with Iran since the latter’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Israel-Turkiye relations have been more pragmatic, with Israel’s continued repression of Palestinians historically often a point of negotiated dispute, rather than open threats spurring aggressively hostile rhetoric.</p><p>However, since coming to power in the early 2000s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been increasingly critical of Israel.</p><p>Israel’s attack on a flotilla travelling to Gaza in 2010, ultimately killing 10 Turkish activists, was one of the defining moments in the relationship’s downturn, with fierce political rhetoric and diplomatic downgrades following.</p><p>Subsequent Israeli military operations in Gaza and Syria have further fuelled public and government anger in Turkiye, with Ankara adopting an increasingly confrontational stance to Israel’s genocide and territorial ambitions, leaving bilateral ties strained and the suggestion of Turkiye’s involvement in Gaza’s proposed interim security force politically toxic in Israel.</p><p>But beyond their clear opposition to Israel, comparisons between Ankara and Tehran border upon the ludicrous, analysts said.</p><p>“Israel has worked alongside Turkiye numerous times,” said Pinkas. “It wasn’t all that long ago that policymakers in Israel talked of the Middle East being overseen by two superpowers, Israel and Turkiye, in opposition to Iran. And now they’re trying to supplant Iran with Turkiye? What are they talking about, armed conflict? Turkiye is a NATO power.”</p><p>Pinkas noted further points of difference. “Has the leadership in Turkiye ever denied Israel’s right to exist, or threatened to wipe it from the map?” he asked.</p><p>“No,” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hexagonal-alliances\">Hexagonal alliances</h2><p>While the alliance with the US is ultimately Israel’s biggest protection, it has also sought to broaden its network.</p><p>At the forefront of this, Netanyahu explained, would be the support of India’s Modi and what he described as a “hexagon” of allied states, including India, the aforementioned Greece and Cyprus, and various unspecified Arab, African, and Asian nations.</p><p>“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu said, without specifying the “radical” states he was referring to.</p><p>Netanyahu stressed that his proposed new hexagon of alliances was intended to complement, rather than replace, Israel’s typical reliance on the US. But <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">some believe</a> – as support for Israel is becoming more politically toxic in the US – that Tel Aviv now needs to hedge its bets.</p><p>Political analyst Goldberg called the moves by Netanyahu “desperate”.</p><p>“All of this because we’ve burnt through past alliances with Russia and now the United States, so we’re [now] claiming that India will be leading this hexagon of ‘moderate states’,” Goldberg said. “Not even people in Israel, not even the most deluded, have any belief that Israel might still be a moderate state.”</p><p>And the talk of the Turkish threat and hexagonal alliances was evidence that Israel is not as central to decision-making on any US attack on Iran, said Yossi Mekelberg, an expert with Chatham House.</p><p>“It’s all deflection; there just isn’t any honesty, and it just gets worse and worse,” Mekelberg said of Netanyahu’s framing of events. “The big issue is Iran. [That is] what they’re interested in. Turkiye is just so much noise.”</p><p>While the intention may be to distract by talking up the Turkish threat, it still carries risks, Mekelberg cautioned.</p><p>“Most leaders, at least the devious ones, can separate rhetoric and reality, so there’s no real chance of one spilling over into the other,” he said. “The risk is that as Israel ramps up its rhetoric against Turkiye, it risks making it a genuine opponent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

much attention in local media, a senior former oil executive described a major shift in how Iran’s oil money was handled as hopes faded for resurrecting the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires\">2015 nuclear deal</a> with world powers and lifting sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">Ali Akbar Pour Ebrahim, a former CEO of Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO), the arm of the Ministry of Petroleum that sells most of Iran’s crude oil, told the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) the ministry has lost its agency in handling the funds.</p><p class=\"s7\">He explained that during the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani – when US President Donald Trump started his “maximum pressure” sanctions in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the nuclear accord – the ministry directly handled oil proceeds, but it was sidelined during the administration of his successor <a href=\"/news/2024/5/20/who-is-irans-president-ebrahim-raisi\">President Ebrahim Raisi</a>.</p><p class=\"s7\">“They forced the Petroleum Ministry to shut down its own trustees and created bank trustees who operated under the purview of the country’s commercial banks, which operated under the Central Bank,” Pour Ebrahim said without identifying the people and entities responsible.</p><p class=\"s7\">The official, who is now a banking and investment executive, said “we knew from the start” the trustees would take the money for themselves, adding that as much as $11bn was not returned after being handled by them.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to Pour Ebrahim, the trustees “mushroomed” after taking the money and using nationals from neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan to open bank

thorough investigation has been conducted.</p><p class=\"s8\">“Through the country’s oil money, these people became Rolls-Royce owners in the UAE overnight and are now living in penthouses of expensive hotels there,” Pour Ebrahim said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s7\">Hossein Samsami, a member of the parliament’s economic commission, confirmed to state-affiliated media that some of the agent banks have been colluding with the trustees to declare receipt of oil money to the Central Bank even when no funds were deposited.</p><p class=\"s7\">Mahmood Khaghani, a career oil official who formerly led the Caspian and Central Asia department of the Petroleum Ministry, was quoted as saying by state media on Saturday that if an independent audit is allowed, it would emerge that the misappropriated money amounts to much more than $11bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">He said the trustee-based system was originally created about two decades ago when a “shadow government” emerged as international pressure grew over <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/netanyahu-calls-for-dismantling-irans-nuclear-programme-in-any-us-deal\">Iran’s nuclear programme</a>, leading to the country eventually being hit with United Nations sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to the official, experts were sidelined at the Petroleum Ministry and other bodies in favour of actors affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected state bodies.</p><p class=\"s7\">“In effect, a number of people in the parliament, judiciary, government, and security and intelligence apparatuses entered oil deals,” Khaghani said. “This did not remain limited to selling oil. … The mafia is not active exclusively in oil but everywhere.”</p><h2 id=\"food-importers-become-oil-traders\" class=\"s3\">Food importers become oil traders</h2><p class=\"s7\">A Tehran-based oil expert, who spoke with Al Jazeera on background, said the nontransparent trustee model only begets corruption as powerful interest groups are given large sums with little to no accountability.</p><p class=\"s7\">E<span>conomist Morteza Afghah told the reformist Shargh newspaper that the misappropriated funds could have played a crucial role in bringing some stability to the country’s currency markets and reducing</span><a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\"> pressure on Iranians</a><span> losing their purchasing power by the day.</span></p><p class=\"s7\">“Allocating a strategic and complicated commodity to actors outside of their technical areas – under sanctions and faced with a currency crunch, without any transparent guarantees for the return of funds – appears neither logical nor low risk,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

plans to increase its reliance on the so-called trustees as authorities put in place contingencies for war.</p><p class=\"s7\">Agriculture Minister Gholamreza Nouri Ghezeljeh announced this month that importers of essential goods, including food, will now be officially given oil to sell and will be allowed to barter the oil for food.</p><p class=\"s7\">“From next year [starting in late March], it has been decreed that importers of essential goods will be introduced by the agriculture ministry to the Petroleum Ministry so they can get oil shipments,” he said, adding that the new trustees will be able to barter up to $1.5bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">This comes weeks after the Pezeshkian administration launched an initiative to eliminate a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\">preferential currency exchange rate</a> for imports of essential goods, based on the rationale it was breeding corruption.</p><p class=\"s7\">With the new scheme by the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad, the same importers who had their profits slashed with the elimination of the cheaper currency rate will now benefit on a new level after becoming oil trustees.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to state-affiliated media, the Mostazafan Foundation of Islamic Revolution could be among the new recipients of Iranian oil, but the head of the top <a href=\"/news/2018/10/16/us-sanctions-network-supporting-irans-basij-resistance-force\">state-run bonyad</a>, or charitable trust, said last week it has received no shipments so far.</p><p class=\"s7\">In late January, Pezeshkian convened the governors of Iran’s border provinces and announced on state television he is <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/iran-delegates-import-powers-as-us-war-threats-keep-economy-unstable\">delegating some authority</a> to them.</p><p class=\"s7\">The empowered governors may import “all goods that are directly linked with the livelihoods of the people and the needs of the market” in case of war, including importing without using foreign currency, bartering and allowing sailors to bring in products under simplified customs rules.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195928\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195928\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\"

So if we purchase a nonsanctioned ship costing $70m that can work for us for a year, it is undoubtedly worth it, and we can take care so it does not enter the sanctions list for a year,” he said.</p><p class=\"s7\">Iranian authorities have not publicly commented on the claim about the vessels but maintain oil sales remain strong despite Washington’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/us-slaps-new-sanctions-on-individuals-and-firms-that-help-iran-sell-its-oil\">stated efforts to drive them to zero</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has been increasingly focusing on intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil, also pressuring China through sanctions and threats to stop oil purchases from Iran, which has in turn threatened to shut down the strategic Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

True, its origins went back to the colonial world and many of its systems reflected colonial racial inequalities, but it was held up as the harbinger of global prosperity and order. In it, the West had magically transformed from a colonial villain to a saviour.</p><p>But for much of the Global South, the era looked very different. It was experienced as genocide, plunder and displacement. Across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, colonial administrations disrupted and suppressed local systems and industries, engineered cash-crop economies vulnerable to global price shocks, and redrew political authority to prioritise imperial control.</p><p>Eventually, demands grew for a more accurate accounting of the catastrophe the West inflicted on the rest, for acknowledgment of its historic crimes from extermination to enslavement, and for recompense. That coincided with a reordering of global power that left the West increasingly unsure of itself – no longer the saviours of us, the good guys of history they had long pretended to be.</p><p>There was some mealy-mouthed acknowledgment of this. In Kenya’s case, revelations of the existence of British torture camps during the 1950s fight for independence produced expressions of regret without apology from the British government, and penny-pinching compensation.</p><p>Similarly, Germany accepted that it committed a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in Namibia in the first decade of the 20th century, but continues to refuse to pay any compensation, instead offering $1.3bn to be paid through aid programmes out over 30 years as “a gesture of reconciliation”.</p><p>These were just crumbs, but marked an important turning point. Movements around the world from Black Lives Matter in the United States to Rhodes Must Fall in South Africa pushed to reconstruct historical narratives about white supremacy and Western domination. Critical anti-colonial thought and discourse spilled from academia into popular culture.</p><p>But the backlash came soon enough. In some quarters, there was outright rejection of “white guilt”, which was picked up by politicians and included in political campaigns. Colonial revisionism proved popular and electable. It has also quickly made it to international forums.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent speech at the Munich Security Conference is a case in point. He spoke of the pre-1945 imperial order with praise. For him, it was a time when “the West had been expanding – its missionaries, its pilgrims, its soldiers, its explorers pouring out from its shores to cross oceans, settle new continents, build vast empires extending out across the globe.”</p><p>Rubio framed Western dominance as an era of prosperity and moral leadership, arguing that the West should not be ashamed of its past. Colonialism, in this telling, was not racial hierarchy and extraction but stewardship, order, and civilisation. Its decline, implicitly, is something to regret.</p><p>What Rubio and the likes of him are calling for is for the West to fully embrace its role as the villain. Not rhetorically, of course – bad guys rarely proclaim themselves as such – but practically, by rehabilitating empire and abandoning guilt and shame for historical wrongs. They see historical reckoning as weakness, even self-hatred. And rather than address the wrongs of the past, they propose to use power to suppress remembrance.</p><p>This is a clear attempt at redemption through the conquest of memory. This is not about merely debating the past. It is about shaping the moral vocabulary of the present. It is also about moving away from the current “rules-based order” and towards a reality where there are no rules for “might makes right”.</p><p>If empire is benevolent, then contemporary hierarchies can be reframed as responsible leadership. Unequal trade regimes become stability. Military pressure becomes guardianship. Interventions become stewardship. Colonialism, as we have seen in the case of US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Board of Peace”, is rebranded not as domination, but as necessary order and a prelude to prosperity. Multipolarity is framed not as structural adjustment, but as destabilising decline.</p><p>This is politically useful in a moment when Western dominance faces challenges from rising powers and shifting alliances. Nostalgia for uncontested supremacy offers clarity and replaces discomfort with pride. It transforms demands for justice into accusations of ingratitude. And its grammar mirrors the familiar pattern. Empire harms but ultimately saves. It errs but redeems itself. Its centrality remains unquestioned.</p><p>There is no need for structural reckoning or restitution. The focus shifts from the material consequences of colonial rule to the emotional burden of Western shame. The story becomes about restoring confidence rather than confronting inequality.</p><p>Rubio’s speech was meant for a Western audience, but for the rest of us, it should set off alarm bells. It is tempting to treat such rhetoric as the moral failing of a few bad men – easily caricatured and just as easily ignored. That would be a grave error.</p><p>We must recognise that they are reconstituting the architecture of colonialism: a legal, economic and epistemic system designed to privilege Western interests, its oppression codified in law, its dictates enforced through coercion, and its benefits distributed along racial lines.</p><p>Thus, the rehabilitation of empire is not nostalgia. It is preparation. It is the construction of a moral framework in which the hierarchies of the present need no justification because the hierarchies of the past have been absolved. And while the past cannot be undone, it can be misremembered.</p><p>We have been living with the terrible consequences of doing so in our economies, within our borders and in our bodies, and just as we start to discard the scales from our eyes, there is an attempt to blind us again. We must not acquiesce to the revisionism, but rather actively resist it by speaking our truth, insistently and without apology, until it cannot be drowned out.</p><p>Memory is not passive. It is a choice made every day, and the choice belongs to us as much as to anyone.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In his view, Mexico’s government had simply been “doing its job” in the “<a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">war on drugs</a>” by eliminating El Mencho, and the US had nothing substantial to do with it.</p><p>Indeed, much like her predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum has perfected the art of doing the gringos’ dirty work while purporting to act in a “<a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">sovereign</a>” fashion – and even to defy the imperial overlords to the north.</p><p>Granted, she does not have a whole lot of room to manoeuvre given the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">recent kidnapping</a> by the US of Venezuelan head of state Nicolas Maduro – and the fact that Trump has made it known that he is beholden to no law, whether domestic or international.</p><p>But while Sheinbaum may have seen no choice but to temporarily placate the Americans and satisfy Trump’s need for blood, Mexicans will pay a heavy price.</p><p>A brief review of contemporary Mexican history confirms as much. No sooner did then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon launch his “drug war” under US guidance in 2006 than homicides and enforced disappearances <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/28/in-mexico-enforced-disappearance-is-a-way-of-life\">skyrocketed</a> in the country.</p><p>Well over half a million people have since been killed and disappeared, many of them victims of militarised agents of the state who often operate in cahoots with organised crime.</p><p>Nary a dent has been put in the northward flow of drugs while the southward flow of <a href=\"/opinions/2022/2/20/us-gun-companies-are-making-a-killing-in-mexico\">US-manufactured weapons</a> continues unabated.</p><p>The state of Jalisco itself happens to have the highest number of enforced disappearances in all of Mexico and made headlines last year with the discovery of a <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/26/how-the-discovery-of-a-mass-grave-sparked-uproar-over-the-missing-in-mexico\">clandestine crematorium</a> on a ranch outside Guadalajara, one of the host cities of the upcoming World Cup.</p><p>The ranch was reportedly used by the CJNG as a recruitment and training centre as well as an extermination site.</p><p>And the removal of El Mencho from the equation will do precisely nothing in terms of pacifying the landscape – just as the respective extraditions to the US of Sinaloa cartel leaders <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman</a> and <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada</a> merely set off an <a href=\"/opinions/2024/12/4/fear-and-loathing-in-culiacan-sinaloa\">ongoing violent battle</a> for power.</p><p>Contrary to lofty soundbites from US officials, the empire is not at all interested in getting rid of either drug trafficking or violence south of the border as both phenomena provide a perennial excuse for US interference in Mexico and beyond.</p><p>Were the gringos actually serious about ridding “Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world” of the whole cartel problem, a decriminalisation of drugs would do much to nip the business in the bud by rendering the movement of drugs far less fantastically lucrative.</p><p>A moratorium on the US’s obsessive manufacture of weapons would also help.</p><p>Obviously, nothing so much as resembling those potential solutions is even on the horizon. If it were, that would be one hell of a “great development” indeed.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He described Maduro’s abduction as a “political operation disguised as a legal debate”.</p><p>Despite these events of early January, however, the foreign minister stated that Venezuela is not in a state of war with the country that he said has been attacking it for the past decade, noting the US blockade and sanctions imposed on Venezuela for years in “full view of the world”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) described Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian situation as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/imf-warns-venezuelas-economy-and-humanitarian-situation-is-quite-fragile\">“quite fragile”</a>, pointing to an estimated triple-digit inflation and a sharply depreciating currency.

Secondly, they are engaging in meaningful conversation, trying to understand how a potential ceasefire could work from a technical perspective, just to have that frame on the table.</p><p>But meaningful does not mean in good faith.</p><p>Putin believes he can win the war.

No, I didn’t. But was I preparing myself for a long war? Yes, somewhere in the back of my mind, I was keeping that option open.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What does victory mean to you now?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> It started as a nightmare, and by the end of [2022], we captured half of the territories Russia had captured in the first months of the invasion, and we were pushing them back on old fronts. [Russian troops] were struggling to stabilise the front line; a sense of euphoria dominated in Ukraine, both among the decision-makers and the population.</p><p>This was the moment when victory was defined as regaining control of the 1991 border, which had existed before Russia annexed Crimea and intervened in the east of Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>But this hope … did not pass the reality check by the end of 2023, when our big counteroffensive failed to deliver.</p><p>Since then, politicians and people in Ukraine find it more and more difficult to redefine victory and speak about it, which I think is a big problem, because if you do not define what your final goal is, you will never get it.</p><p>So I offer my understanding of victory today, which would be to cease fire along the existing front line to stop hostilities and introduce a provisional truce between Russia and Ukraine to receive a long multi-year programme of military support to Ukraine; to launch a multi-billion recovery plan for Ukraine, and to see Ukraine as a member of the European Union.</p><p>Victory should always be defined, not only against your own goals, but also against the initial goals of your enemy.</p><p>So if I look back at 2022 and assume that Russia’s main objective was the demolition of the Ukrainian statehood and the return of Ukraine under its full control, then … Russia failed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"do-you-feel-the-west-and-your-vision-are-aligned\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Do you feel the West and your vision are aligned?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> The West doesn’t really exist anymore in the form we are used to thinking about it.</p><p>Europe is aligned.

This was an era of corruption scandals, drug-trafficking, migration crises, and dramatic turns such as Brazil’s polarising swing from Lula to Jair Bolsonaro and back again.

He said together, they would unite to collectively stand against what he called “radical” adversaries.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p data-start=\"992\" data-end=\"1144\">“In the vision I see before me, we will create an entire system, essentially a ‘hexagon’ of alliances around or within the Middle East,” Netanyahu said.</p><p data-start=\"1146\" data-end=\"1379\">“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis.”</p><p data-start=\"590\" data-end=\"990\">However, no government has publicly endorsed this plan – or its sectarian framing. Two of the three countries Netanyahu named – Greece and Cyprus – are members of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has an <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza\">arrest warrant</a> out for Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza, and would be legally obliged to arrest him if he set foot there.</p><p data-start=\"1381\" data-end=\"1521\">Andreas Krieg, associate professor of security studies at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli prime minister may be overselling his idea.</p><p data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1754\">“The ‘unnamed Arab/African/Asian’ component may exist in the form of ad hoc security coordination and transactional diplomacy, but not necessarily in a way that resembles a NATO-style pact or treaty. It isn’t an alliance,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1756\" data-end=\"1897\">“I’d treat the ‘hexagon’ less as a deliverable alliance and more as a branding exercise for a patchwork of existing relationships,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-netanyahu-mean-by-radical-axes\" data-start=\"1756\" data-end=\"1897\">What does Netanyahu mean by ‘radical axes’?</h2><p data-start=\"97\" data-end=\"348\">Netanyahu is seeking to replicate what he describes as his “victories” against the “Shia axis” – also known as the <a href=\"/video/start-here/2024/11/11/irans-axis-of-resistance-explained-start-here\">“axis of resistance”</a> – an informal, Iran-centred network of allied groups that oppose Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.</p><p data-start=\"350\" data-end=\"550\">At its core stands Iran, which supports Hezbollah in Lebanon – long regarded as the region’s most powerful non-state actor aligned with Tehran before Israel killed much of its leadership in 2024.</p><p data-start=\"552\" data-end=\"706\">In Iraq, Tehran maintains ties with various Shia armed groups, including factions within the Popular Mobilisation Forces and groups such as Kataib Hezbollah.</p><p data-start=\"708\" data-end=\"858\">More recently, in Yemen, <a href=\"/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide\">the Houthis,</a> a Zaidi Shia movement, have risen in prominence, with Tehran providing material support, training and weapons.</p><h2 id=\"is-netanyahu-right-about-an-emerging-sunni-axis-as-well\">Is Netanyahu right about an emerging ‘Sunni axis’ as well?</h2><p data-start=\"2012\" data-end=\"2361\">Not really. Israel attacked at least six countries in the region in 2025, including Palestine, Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, and conducted attacks linked to Gaza in international waters in Tunisia and Greece.</p><p data-start=\"2012\" data-end=\"2361\">It has also <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">threatened</a> Egypt, <a href=\"/features/2025/9/21/is-turkiye-israel-next-target-middle-east\">Turkiye</a>, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Jordan.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">Rather than forming a unified “Sunni axis” – as Netanyahu describes them – several Sunni-majority states in the region have coordinated diplomatically in response to Israel’s regional belligerence.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">This coordination has included <a href=\"https://web.mfa.gov.so/joint-statement-by-a-cross-regional-group-of-countries-on-israels-illegal-recognition-of-the-somaliland-region-of-the-federal-republic-of-somalia-on-26-december-2025/\">joint statements</a> condemning Israeli efforts to recognise Somaliland as an independent state, condemning Israeli strikes on Syria and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">The need to counter Israeli actions also loomed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s state visits at the start of February to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Those countries have experienced strained relations in recent years.</p><p data-start=\"2497\" data-end=\"2758\">“We see that there are growing common efforts by regional countries against Israel, joint statements, joint diplomatic efforts, joint military engagements, the exploration of potential for joint defence adventures,” said Omer Ozkizilcik, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p><p data-start=\"2760\" data-end=\"2965\">“This alliance is not an alliance or not a collective alliance based on an ideology or based on Sunnism.

It simultaneously engages China, Russia and the United States.</p><p data-start=\"3687\" data-end=\"3954\">India also maintains extensive ties across the Gulf. Workers in the region send home billions in remittances annually. New Delhi retains close relations with Iran – describing ties as “<a href=\"https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/India-Iran-Jan-2025.pdf\">civilisational</a>” – while also expanding <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.jp/en/saudi-arabia/article_145823/\">strategic cooperation</a> with Saudi Arabia.</p><p data-start=\"3956\" data-end=\"4282\">“The danger is in the signalling,” noted Krieg. Netanyahu’s framing as an “axis vs axis” project “risks hardening regional polarisation, giving Israel’s rivals (Iran, but also Turkiye and others) an easy narrative of encirclement, and making some would-be partners more cautious about being seen too close to Israel.”</p><p data-start=\"4284\" data-end=\"4442\">Netanyahu’s rhetoric could pull “India further into Middle East fault lines it generally prefers to manage pragmatically, not ideologically,” Krieg said, noting that India’s main interests lie in defence, technology and trade rather than signing up to Israel’s regional ambitions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4211384\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4211384\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4211384\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/000_88V2346-1767446339.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C), Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides (L) and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis (R) hold a joint press conference after a trilateral meeting in Jerusalem on December 22, 2025.

Although formally centred on energy and connectivity, the grouping has steadily expanded into security and defence cooperation, in part aimed at Turkiye.</p><p data-start=\"4702\" data-end=\"4971\">Greece approved the purchase of 36 PULS rocket artillery systems from Israel in 2025, valued at approximately $760m. The two sides are holding discussions about a broader defence package estimated at $3.5bn, including an Israeli-built multi-layered air defence system.</p><p data-start=\"4973\" data-end=\"5065\">Cyprus has also received Israeli-made air defence systems, with further deliveries expected.</p><p data-start=\"5067\" data-end=\"5290\">Yet even here, the picture is fluid. Turkiye and Greece have entered a cautious rapprochement. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Ankara earlier this month in an effort to stabilise relations and expand economic ties.</p><p data-start=\"5292\" data-end=\"5570\">“The truth is that while there are all sorts of tactical partners Israel might have, technical partnerships and alliances Israel might enjoy, nobody wants to touch Israel with a 10-foot pole,” said Ori Goldberg, an independent Israeli analyst and political commentator.</p><p data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5766\">“Israel is bad news. The Israeli brand has deteriorated to such an extent that it only brings potential chaos and instability, and in the most literal sense, look at what Israel does,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"45\" data-end=\"310\">On the face of it, Israel’s pitch for a wider regional alliance runs counter to the interests of these countries, which Krieg notes are largely centred on “Eastern Mediterranean security and energy dynamics” rather than a broader Middle East project Netanyahu envisions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-now\">Why now?</h2><p data-start=\"5786\" data-end=\"5855\">The initiative comes at a politically sensitive moment for Netanyahu, whose legal troubles abroad have been compounded by legal troubles at home.</p><p data-start=\"5857\" data-end=\"6102\">“With elections due later this year, Netanyahu has a clear incentive to project statesmanship and to argue that Israel is not diplomatically isolated and that it can still convene meaningful regional and extra-regional partnerships,” said Krieg.</p><p data-start=\"6104\" data-end=\"6255\">Netanyahu faces domestic pressure over proposed judicial reforms and protests surrounding efforts to recruit ultra-Orthodox Jews into military service.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6385\">He is also standing trial in <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/beyond-netanyahu-israels-major-political-corruption-scandals\">three corruption cases</a> involving charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust dating back to 2016, which may very well end in jail time.</p><p data-start=\"6387\" data-end=\"6445\">His “hexagon” initiative “reads as a hedge”, Krieg argued.</p><p data-start=\"6447\" data-end=\"6711\">“The Saudi normalisation track has become far more politically costly for Riyadh, and Israel is trying to show it has alternatives and can build ‘minilateral’ coalitions around connectivity, energy and security even without a headline Saudi breakthrough,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"6713\" data-end=\"6848\">Since October 2023, Israel’s economy has faced mounting strain, with business closures rising and credit agencies downgrading outlooks.</p><p data-start=\"6850\" data-end=\"7026\">“The Israeli economy is not doing well … jobs are disappearing, and investments are much costlier than they were. Israel is faltering at best and sailing at worst,” Goldberg said.</p><p data-start=\"7028\" data-end=\"7171\">“Nothing Israel does seems to work.
