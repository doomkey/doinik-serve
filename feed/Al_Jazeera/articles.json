Whether this will play out is another matter altogether,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had warned airlines last week of a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace due to a “worsening security situation and heightened military activity”.</p><p>Six airlines that account for much of the travel in South America then suspended flights to Venezuela.</p><p>That drew the ire of Caracas, which suspended the companies’ operating rights and accused them of “joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States”.</p><h2 id=\"scorched-earth-policy\">‘Scorched earth’ policy</h2><p>Charles Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, said Trump’s announcement on Saturday “turns up the pressure on Maduro”</p><p>“Clearly, what the government of the United States [and] President Trump wants is for Maduro to leave office, and that would mean he’d have to leave the country,” Shapiro told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added that while the Trump administration’s claims that its actions are part of a push to stem drug trafficking to the US, the real intention is to remove Maduro.</p><p>Meanwhile, Francisco Rodriguez, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a US-based think tank, warned of the effects that Trump’s policies will have on the citizens of Venezuela.</p><p>Saturday’s announcement reflects a “scorched earth” policy towards the country, which for years has been grappling with widespread poverty, unemployment and mass outward migration, Rodriguez wrote on X.</p><p>“A country subject to air isolation is a country where medicine and essential supplies cannot enter, and whose citizens cannot travel even for emergency reasons,” he said, adding that the Venezuelan people are not “chess pieces”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also see the timing of Pope Leo’s visit as reflective of a period in which historic foundations feel more able to restore properties, organise religious life and engage directly with state bodies.</p><p>“This is, first of all, a great honour for Turkiye,” Manolis Kostidis, vice president of the Greek Foundations Association, told Al Jazeera of the pope’s visit.</p><p>“It’s also extremely important for the Ecumenical Patriarchate and for the Greek community. Istanbul has hosted empires for centuries, and welcoming such a guest shows the value of the patriarchate – especially with the support the Turkish government has given in recent years,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the early decades of the Turkish Republic, Turkiye’s Greek, Armenian and Syriac populations numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Their decline over the 20th century was shaped by a series of political ruptures – from the 1942 Wealth Tax, which disproportionately targeted non-Muslims, to the 1955 Istanbul pogrom that devastated Greek, Armenian and Jewish neighbourhoods, and the 1964 deportation of more than 12,000 Greek citizens amid tensions over Cyprus.</p><p>Other administrative restrictions and legal rulings followed in subsequent decades, gradually accelerating emigration. Today, the remaining communities are far smaller, yet their representatives stress resilience, continuity and a deep sense of belonging to the country they have lived in for centuries.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4138962\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4138962\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4138962\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251129__86JK9EN__v1__HighRes__TurkeyVaticanPopeDiplomacy-1764417581.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pope Leo XIV stands with patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II (L) and patriarch Bortholomew I as he arrives for a private meeting with religious leaders at the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, in Istanbul on November 29, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4138962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pope Leo XIV, second from left, stands with Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II, left, and Patriarch Bortholomew I, second from right, as he arrives for a private meeting with religious leaders at the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church in Istanbul [Andreas Solaro/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>“If Turkiye’s population is 85 million, we are about 85,000 – one in a thousand,” Can Ustabası, head of the Minority Foundations Representative Office, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Communities that were once in the millions are now tiny. We’re citizens of this country, but history brought us to this point.”</p><p>While the pressures affecting minority groups through the 20th century are widely documented, community representatives agree that the atmosphere of the past two decades stands in sharp contrast.</p><p>From the 2000s onward, minority foundations benefitted from a number of legal changes.</p><p>The Foundations Law, first drafted in the Ottoman era and later adapted by the Republic, governs how non-Muslim charitable foundations own, manage and inherit property. A series of European Union-driven harmonisation packages between 2003 and 2008 expanded their ability to register assets, reclaim properties seized under earlier rulings, and receive donations and inheritances again.</p><p>This culminated in a 2011 government decree instructing the return – or compensation – of properties that had been taken from foundations under the 1974 Court of Cassation ruling and earlier administrative practices.</p><p>“Erdogan’s instruction to ‘return what rightfully belongs to them’ changed the attitude of every state body. Previously, getting permission to paint a church took years. Now, doors open easily,” Ustabasi said.</p><h2 id=\"one-of-most-comfortable-periods\">‘One of most comfortable periods’</h2><p>Lawyer Kezban Hatemi, who has advised minority foundations for decades, agreed that this has been “a major reform” but noted that more needed to be done. “Some cases are still ongoing – this kind of historical process never ends quickly,” Hatemi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>According to Hatemi, the earlier reluctance of state institutions was rooted in a decades-old mentality shaped by security fears and restrictive legal interpretations. She said minority foundations faced layers of bureaucratic obstacles for years, with even basic repairs or property registrations blocked. This only began to shift when EU harmonisation reforms created a new legal framework and political resolve emerged to act on it.</p><p>“The EU process gave real momentum – but it also took political will,” she said, noting that “a major blockage was removed” even as old fears loom for some.</p><p>“People abroad still say: ‘Don’t buy property in Istanbul, you never know what could happen.’ The memory from the 40s to the 70s is still very strong.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4138960\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4138960\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4138960\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251129__86JQ4WQ__v1__HighRes__TurkeyVaticanPopeDiplomacy-1764417553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People react and take photos in front of the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, where Pope Leo XIV meets with religious leaders, in Istanbul on November 29, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4138960\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People outside the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, where Pope Leo XIV met religious leaders on Saturday [Yasin Akgul/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>Ustabasi noted that while the process has not always been straightforward, some 1,250 properties “were returned through EU harmonisation reforms and changes to the Foundations Law” between 2003 and 2018.</p><p>Kostidis said the impact of the return of the properties has not only been material. “It makes us feel like full citizens,” he said, noting that “minorities have lived one of their most comfortable periods” since Erdogan came to power in 2003.</p><p>One of the clearest signs of renewed confidence is among Syriacs, particularly in Tur Abdin – the historic heartland of Syriac Christianity in southeastern Turkiye that stretches across Midyat and the wider Mardin region. In these villages, return migration has slowly begun to reverse.</p><p>“People who emigrated to Europe are building homes again in Midyat and its villages,” Ustabasi said. “The roads are better than Istanbul, security is solid, and some are even preparing to live there long term.”</p><p>He linked the shift directly to improved security conditions in the southeast, a region that for decades was affected by clashes between the Turkish state and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, making travel and daily life unpredictable. “A Turkiye without terrorism opens many doors. People feel safe travelling, restoring homes, returning to their villages,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kostidis said returns to Turkiye’s largest city of Istanbul are also possible – but require practical fixes.</p><p>“Large-scale returns are unlikely. But yes, some will come back if residency issues are fixed,” he said, calling for “a special regulation” for Greeks from Istanbul with Greek citizenship.</p><p>“All communities – Muslim, Jewish, Armenian, Syriac, Greek – should live in this city. Istanbul’s strength has always been its plurality.”</p><h2 id=\"powerful-message\">‘Powerful message’</h2><p>Despite significant progress, several legal and administrative issues remain unresolved, with the representatives citing foundation board elections, legal ambiguity around autonomy and longstanding cases in some properties’ handover.</p><p>Ustabasi called for changes in the legal framework, while Hatemi noted the state “still intervenes in foundation governance in ways it never does with Muslim foundations. This mentality hasn’t fully changed – but I’m hopeful.”</p><p>Turkish-Armenian journalist and writer Etyen Mahcupyan said the pace of reform shifted after a failed coup attempt in 2016, when state bureaucracy regained influence over politics and decision-making.</p><p>He believes restitution slowed as a result, but said momentum could return if Turkiye “brings EU membership back to the forefront”. Turkiye started talks to join the bloc in 2005, but the accession bid <a href=\"/news/2023/9/20/analysis-is-turkeys-bid-for-eu-membership-over\">has effectively been frozen</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mahcupyan views Pope Leo’s visit as carrying political and symbolic resonance, given that the pope is seen not only as a religious figure but also as a political actor.</p><p>“Considering Turkiye’s foreign policy ambitions, this visit offers positive contributions. Ankara wants to shape a Turkiye that is accepted in global politics – and the world seems ready for it.”</p><p>Mahcupyan noted the pope’s “<a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/pope-leo-decries-shameful-disregard-for-international-law\">clear position</a>” on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza “aligns closely with Turkiye’s own line. This kind of convergence is important. It prevents Turkiye from turning inward, helps the world look at Turkiye more gently – and softens attitudes towards non-Muslims.”</p><p>He also said the visit helps ensure minority communities “are not forgotten”.</p><p>Kostidis agreed.</p><p>“A Muslim-majority country hosting the leaders of the Christian world – you can’t give a more powerful message than this,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Most were interrogated on site and let go, but at least eight people were arrested and taken to Israeli military jails.</p><p class=\"s3\">At least nine Palestinians were detained in other military raids in Qalqilya, Jenin and Nablus. The Wafa news agency quoted local sources as saying on Saturday that two children and a woman were among five arrested at dawn in Qalqilya.</p><p>PRCS also said 10 Palestinians were injured in an Israeli settler attack near the village of Khalayel al-Louz, east of Bethlehem, Wafa reported.

Only 47 of them, mostly women, were allowed to retrieve their belongings on Thursday.</p><p class=\"s3\">A member of the Jenin Refugee Camp Services Committee told Al Jazeera that residents were given two hours to collect possessions, and some could not even recognise their homes due to the level of destruction after the Israeli assault.</p><p>The armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad said on Friday its fighters carried out a series of attacks on Israeli soldiers during raids in Jenin and Tubas.</p><p>The group said its fighters in Tubas targeted an Israeli foot patrol with an antipersonnel explosive device in the Wadi al-Tayaseer area.

There’s another soldier behind him without guns. He is the one that, as soon as he shoots, starts running to get the equipment,” he said.</p><p>“All this action would take only two or three minutes. Every shot, every bullet, is one kill. And by the three minutes, there will be a ceasefire, and we will collect what we need to collect and disappear,” he said.</p><p>“Metal Skin”, as he was then known due to his ability to survive many encounters with Indonesian forces, would not see his family for 24 years. He told Al Jazeera how the 1980s were a particularly difficult decade, when there was no international media attention and East Timor had no contact with the outside world.</p><p>He and his fighters, alone in the jungle, would receive just one letter a year from the political leadership of FRETILIN (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor), the political party of which FALINTIL was its armed wing.</p><p>It was during the 1980s that much of East Timor’s civilian population was forcibly displaced and starved; an <a href=\"https://cja.org/where-we-work/archives/timor-leste-east-timor/\">estimated 200,000 people died</a>, almost a third of the population, in what is widely considered a genocide.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4118848\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4118848\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4118848\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1999-08-07T120000Z_476293077_RP1DRIKYGWAA_RTRMADP_3_TIMOR-1763621899.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C498&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Falintil (Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor) soldiers drill at their guerrilla base in the Viqueque district in East Timor August 7.

Rather than instil fear, the outrages inspired many in FALINTIL to continue resisting, including the civilian villagers on whom the resistance relied for food, supplies and information about Indonesian troop movements.</p><p>“More villagers were willing to help us because of the atrocities against women,” he said. Despite the killing and torture, there were “more Timorese villagers that would like to support us and protect us, feed us and pass on information”.</p><p>After more than two decades of occupation and armed resistance, political advocacy by supporters abroad, and under pressure from the international community, the Indonesian government eventually agreed to hold a referendum to determine the first steps towards East Timor’s independence.</p><p>Then in 1999, a national vote was administered by the United Nations, and despite large-scale violence and intimidation from both the Indonesian army and collaborating local armed groups, 78.5 percent of East Timor’s voters cast their ballot in favour of independence.</p><p>By 2002, the long and bloody road to nationhood was complete.</p><p>While East Timor had finally achieved independence, the repercussions of Indonesia’s occupation remain deeply embedded in society.</p><h2 id=\"repercussions-kristina-siti-s-story\">Repercussions – Kristina Siti’s story</h2><p>Kristina Siti was no ordinary child growing up in Lospalos.</p><p>She was teased mercilessly by other children and shunned by adults because of her origins.</p><p>“They considered me an illegitimate child, an Indonesian child, a child without a father.

Last year, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison in the US after being extradited from Honduras on charges of drug trafficking.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Hernandez has been “treated very harshly and unfairly”. He cited “many people that I greatly respect”.</p><p>Trump also again threw his support behind Asfura, who is facing four opponents in the scandal-plagued race. No clear frontrunner has yet emerged.</p><p>He added that a loss for Asfura would lead to a rupture in US support for the country of about 11 million, echoing a similar threat he made in support of Javier Milei before Argentina’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">presidential election</a> in October.</p><p>“If he doesn’t win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Following Trump’s announcement that he would pardon Hernandez, Asfura told the news service AFP that he does not have any connections with the disgraced former president.</p><p>“I have no ties (with Hernandez),” Asfura told AFP in a phone call. “He was president of the Republic, the party is not responsible for his personal actions.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US president and several right-wing figures have previously accused Rixi Moncada, the candidate for outgoing President Xiomara Castro’s left-leaning LIBRE party, as well as Salvador Nasralla, of the centre-right Liberal Party, of being in the pocket of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Both candidates have rejected the claims, which come as Trump has increased pressure against Maduro. That has included surging US military assets to the region and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-says-us-will-soon-stop-venezuelan-drug-trafficking-by-land\">floating</a> possible land operations.</p><h2 id=\"drug-trafficking-conviction\">Drug trafficking conviction</h2><p>Despite Trump’s statements, the decision to pardon Hernandez sits uncomfortably with his administration’s pledges to target drug cartels and narcotic smuggling into the US.</p><p>That has included designating several cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” and launching strikes on alleged drug smugglers in international waters. Rights groups have said the attacks are tantamount to extrajudicial killings and likely violate both domestic and international law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During his trial, prosecutors accused Hernandez of working with powerful cartels to smuggle more than 400 tonnes of cocaine en route to the US. That included ties to the Mexico-based Sinaloa cartel, one of the criminal groups designated by the Trump administration as “terrorists”.</p><p>Hernandez allegedly relied on millions of dollars in cartel bribes to fuel his political rise.</p><p>At the time of his sentencing, former US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hernandez used his presidency “to operate the country as a narco-state where violent drug traffickers were allowed to operate with virtual impunity, and the people of Honduras and the United States were forced to suffer the consequences.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
