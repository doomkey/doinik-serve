Now it is time for the government to make amends.”</p><h2 id=\"a-surprise-trip-turned-deportation\">A surprise trip turned deportation</h2><p>Lopez Belloza, 19, was arrested on November 20 by immigration agents at Boston’s Logan airport.</p><p>The college freshman had been preparing to board a flight home to her family in Texas to surprise them for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p>She has since told The Associated Press news agency that she was denied access to a lawyer after her initial detention at the airport. The immigration agent told her she would need to sign a deportation document first, according to Lopez Belloza, who said she denied the offer.</p><p>For the next two nights, she said she was kept by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a holding room with 17 other women, without enough room to lie down.</p><p>Then, she was loaded onto a deportation flight, which took her to Texas, then to her native Honduras, on November 22.</p><p>“I was numb the whole plane ride,” Lopez Belloza told the AP. “I just kept questioning myself. Why is it happening to me?”</p><p>Her lawyers, however, had obtained during that time a court order barring her removal from Massachusetts for 72 hours. Lopez Belloza’s deportation violated that court order.</p><p>She has remained in Honduras for the last two and a half months, while legal challenges over her case proceeded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312184\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312184\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312184\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698f8288-1771012744.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1156&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza poses wearing a mortarboard after graduating from high school in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., in 2025. massdeportationdefense.org/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312184\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza poses after graduating from high school in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2025 [Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-legal-battle\">A legal battle</h2><p>In court, the Trump administration has apologised for the error in Lopez Belloza’s case, acknowledging that a mistake was indeed made.</p><p>“On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologise,” prosecutor Mark Sauter told the court.</p><p>But Sauter rejected accusations that the government wilfully defied the 72-hour court order, saying that Lopez Belloza’s deportation was the mistake of one ICE agent and not an act of judicial defiance.</p><p>The government has also argued that Lopez Belloza was subject to a removal order before her November 20 arrest and therefore should not be returned to the US.</p><p>Lopez Belloza was brought to the US from Honduras when she was eight years old, and in 2016, she and her mother were ordered to be deported.</p><p>But the college freshman said she had no knowledge of any deportation order and has told the media that her previous legal representation had assured her there was no removal order against her.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Trump administration has rejected efforts to bring Lopez Belloza back to the country, even on a student visa.</p><p>In a February 6 court filing, US Attorney Leah B Foley wrote that a student visa “is unfeasible as the Secretary of State lacks authority to adjudicate visa applications and issue visas”.</p><p>“In any event,” Foley added, “Petitioner appears ineligible for a student visa.” She explained that Lopez Belloza “would remain subject to detention and removal if returned to the United States”.</p><p>The filing ended with a warning to the court to “refrain from ordering Respondents to return Petitioner to the status quo because this Court lacks authority”.</p><p>The Trump administration has questioned the authority of federal courts to intervene in immigration-related matters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-series-of-mistakes\">A series of mistakes</h2><p>Critics, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of repeatedly failing to heed court orders it disagrees with.</p><p>Lopez Belloza’s case is not the first instance of an immigrant being wrongfully deported since the start of Trump’s second term.</p><p>Trump had campaigned on a pledge of mass deportation, and he has followed through with that promise, leading a series of controversial immigration crackdowns that have been accused of violating due process rights.</p><p>One of the most high-profile cases came in March 2025, when his administration wrongfully deported a Salvadoran father named Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his wife, a US citizen.</p><p>Abrego Garcia had been subject to a 2019 court order barring his removal from the US on the basis that he could face gang violence in El Salvador.</p><p>But he was nevertheless sent back to the country and was briefly held in El Salvador’s Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), a maximum-security prison.</p><p>On April 10, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, largely upholding a lower court’s decision.</p><p>But the Trump administration initially argued Abrego Garcia was outside of its power. Then, on June 6, it abruptly announced Abrego Garcia had been returned, only to file criminal charges against him and seek his deportation a second time.</p><p>Another case involved a Guatemalan man, identified only by his initials OCG.</p><p>He had been under a court protection order that barred him from being returned to Guatemala, for fear that his identity as a gay man would subject him to persecution.</p><p>But the Trump administration detained and deported him instead to Mexico, which in turn sent him back to Guatemala. He subsequently went into hiding for his safety.</p><p>In June, OCG was returned to the US after a court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. It also noted that OCG’s deportation “lacked any semblance of due process”.</p><p>Lopez Belloza continues her studies at Babson College remotely from Honduras as she awaits the outcome of her legal proceedings.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If you saw a building burning down with children inside, you wouldn’t hesitate to bang down the door to save those children’s lives. It is exactly the same principle. You don’t care about the value of the door. It is about those lives. It is about the liberation of Palestine. And so we do our bit to shut down the Israeli weapons trades from Britain.”</p><p>The group has been a thorn in Starmer’s side since Israel began its genocidal onslaught in Gaza.</p><p>Palestine Action-linked activists have carried out several raids, often leaving their mark in red spray paint intended to symbolise blood.</p><p>Dozens are currently being held on remand in relation to two actions.</p><p>Some prisoners, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at a UK subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Bristol.</p><p>Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at the UK’s largest air base in Oxfordshire, where they were alleged to have spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. It was after this raid that the government banned Palestine Action.</p><p>They all deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.</p><p>Six of the “Filton 24” were recently <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">acquitted</a> of aggravated burglary; five of them were bailed.</p><p>“At its core, Palestine Action is an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action,” the High Court judges said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have protested against the ban. Almost 3,000 of them have been arrested for raising placards with slogans such as: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>“The government committed a huge crime against its own population,” said Ammori. “It was unlawful for them to ban Palestine Action, and when they banned Palestine Action, they subsequently did thousands of unlawful arrests against their own citizens and tried to prosecute them through the courts for terrorism offences, for holding up signs.”</p><p>Despite Friday’s ruling, the ban remains in place pending appeal.</p><p>The UK’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by Friday’s ruling and intends to appeal – earning further criticism from rights groups and some fellow Labour politicians.</p><p>John McDonnell, an MP who voted against the proscription, said on X, “I thought it was unjust. We have a right to protest, to assemble, and to speak freely in this country – that has been secured largely by direct action over centuries. I am urging the government to abide by that tradition and not to appeal this judgement.”</p><p>“Shabana Mahmood needs to take a step back,” said Ammori. “She’s completely betrayed the Palestinian people since she’s become minister … it’s only going to backfire on her.</p><p>“Palestine Action’s ban will be lifted … We won today in the High Court … If they try and appeal, we’ll beat them again.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer designated it as a “terrorist” organisation and a national security threat, putting it on par with armed groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Here’s a timeline of when and why Palestine Action was banned and what members of the group have had to endure so far:</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-friday-s-ruling-mean\">What does Friday’s ruling mean?</h2><p>On Friday morning, judges at the Royal Courts of Justice struck down the British government’s proscription against Palestine Action, ruling that they were “satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate”.</p><p>Sean Summerfield, a UK-based barrister specialising in international criminal law and human rights at Doughty Street Chambers, told Al Jazeera that Friday’s ruling mainly vindicates those who stood in solidarity with Palestine Action and will not have an effect on those directly engaged with the group.</p><p>Since the ban, the UK police have arrested 2,787 people for holding signs like “I oppose genocide”, “I support Palestine Action” in silent vigils across the UK, according to a statement by the campaign group, Defend Our Juries.</p><p>After Friday’s court ruling, holding such placards will no longer be considered unlawful.</p><p>Defend Our Juries said that after Friday’s ruling, seven people charged with Section 12 (Terrorism Act 2000) offences for addressing Zoom calls as part of the Lift the Ban campaign against Palestine Action will also have their arrests deemed unlawful.</p><p>Summerfield said the UK’s Director of Public Prosecutions will now have a decision to make about what to do with those already arrested.</p><p>“Do they respect the decision of the High Court and discontinue those prosecutions, or do they continue to prosecute pending appeal? The Metropolitan police have already indicated they will now stop arresting people for holding placards, but that does not preclude further arrests if the appeal succeeds,” he said.</p><p>“But given the early indications that the government will appeal, the thousands of people arrested for holding placards are likely to remain in limbo,” he added.</p><p>Summerfield said that with respect to those activists directly engaged with Palestine Action who have broken into arms factories or disrupted supply chains on behalf of the group, prosecution will continue.</p><p>“This is because they have been charged with things like criminal damage. They will still be prosecuted,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"why-was-palestine-action-banned\">Why was Palestine Action banned?</h2><p>Last July, members of the UK parliament <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">voted</a> in favour of banning Palestine Action, which was established in July 2020. The direct action group describes itself as a movement “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.</p><p>The government proscribed the group under the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000. Other groups banned under the law include armed groups such as ISIS (ISIL), al-Qaeda and Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan.</p><p>The ban came after activists from Palestine Action entered the Royal Air Force station in Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, in June 2025 and vandalised military aircraft with red paint. At the time, the group said they carried out this action since “these [Royal Air Force] aircraft can be used to refuel and have been used to refuel Israeli fighter jets.”</p><p>Prime Minister Starmer condemned the incident. “The act of vandalism committed at RAF Brize Norton is disgraceful,” he said in a post.</p><p>Previously, in August 2024, Palestine Action activists had driven a van into Israeli defence and technology company Elbit’s headquarters in Bristol, causing extensive damage.</p><p>At about the same time, they had also spray-painted the Ministry of Defence, in central London, red and defaced a statue of Arthur Balfour with tomato ketchup inside the House of Commons. Balfour was a former Conservative prime minister who, serving as foreign secretary in 1917, authored the Balfour Declaration, which supported the establishment of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-happened-since-the-ban\">What has happened since the ban?</h2><p>Following the ban, Palestine Action said on X that “the real crime” was not the “red paint being sprayed on these warplanes, but the war crimes that have been enabled with those planes because of the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s genocide”.</p><p>The group added that the government’s move could risk criminalising legitimate protest.</p><p>Since the ban, being a member of the group or supporting Palestine solidarity protests organised by the group in the UK was considered an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>Last week, six people linked to Palestine Action were <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">acquitted of aggravated burglary</a> in connection with an alleged break-in at Elbit Systems in August 2024. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of criminal damage.</p><p>In total, 24 activists linked to the Palestinian direct action group arrested at different times are still awaiting trial, and many have been held beyond the maximum six-month detention limits.</p><p>Several Palestine Action activists launched <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-near-death-intent-on-continuing-protests\">hunger strikes</a> late last year, seeking better conditions in prison, rights to a fair trial, and for the UK government to reverse its decision to ban the group.</p><p>In January, a few of the activists ended their strike after a number of their demands were met, while others ended it due to health reasons.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-reactions-to-friday-s-ruling\">What are the reactions to Friday’s ruling?</h2><p>The court’s ruling has, however, been celebrated by people in the country, human rights groups, and members of the British government.</p><p>“This is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history,” Huda Ammori, the Palestine Action cofounder, said.</p><p>John Moxham, a retired professor of medicine who was standing outside the court at the time of the ruling, told Al Jazeera he’s “absolutely delighted”.</p><p>“I feel absolutely delighted because my wife was arrested for sitting down and supporting Palestine Action. I’ve been on all the marches and it’s just a wonderful day,” he said.</p><p>“The whole banning in the first place was just a total travesty, and it was obviously ridiculous. It’s so wonderful that it’s now been turned over. There ought to be a lot of resignations of government ministers and people. The prime minister and David Lammy [secretary of justice] have got a lot of blood on their hands.”</p><p>Anas Mustapha, head of public Advocacy at CAGE International, said: “Today’s decision is the correct legal outcome, though it was secured only through principled sacrifice and collective will.</p><p>“This ruling against the Home Secretary’s decision should now result in the withdrawal of charges against all Palestine Action activists in prison and the thousands who acted on their conscience, as part of the largest civil disobedience campaign this country has seen in recent years,” he added.</p><p>British Green Party MP Adrian Ramsay welcomed the ruling.</p><p>“The Govt must immediately stop interfering with legitimate peaceful protest – and instead fully address its complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” he said in a post on X.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>The British government has said it intends to appeal the court’s ruling.</p><p>“I am disappointed by ⁠the court’s decision ⁠and disagree with the notion that banning ⁠this terrorist organisation ⁠is disproportionate,” ⁠Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood ⁠said in a statement.</p><p>“I intend to fight this ‌judgment in the Court of ‌Appeal.”</p><p>Summerfield told Al Jazeera that the High Court’s ban remains in place until the government decides whether to appeal.</p><p>“The British government has until next Friday to launch an appeal,” he said.</p><p>“Assuming the government does appeal, the ban will remain in place at least until that appeal process has been exhausted, which could be lengthy,” he added.</p><p>But rights groups have called on the government not to appeal the court’s decision.</p><p>“The High Court’s decision sends a clear message: the Government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter terrorism powers to suppress protest,” Amnesty International’s UK division said on X.</p><p>“We welcome this judgment as an essential check on overreach and a powerful reminder that fundamental rights still carry weight in UK law,” the international rights group said.</p><p>“We urge the Government to respect the ruling and NOT to appeal this decision. We will continue to expose attempts to erode our rights.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Turnout was about 60 percent.</p><p>Registered voters also voted in a referendum to approve constitutional reforms, with just more than 60 percent voting “yes” for the July National Charter outlining those reforms.</p><p>Final official results are still pending, but Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, BNP’s secretary-general, hailed the sweeping election victory as evidence that the BNP is “a party of the people”. The party expects to form a government on Sunday.</p><p>On Friday night, Jamaat-e-Islami, the BNP’s main opponent in this election, had yet to concede defeat, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/bangladesh-election-results-2026-who-won-who-lost-whats-next\">saying</a> it was not “satisfied” with the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/like-eid-bangladeshis-hail-landmark-election-many-vote-after-17-years\">vote count</a> and raising “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.</p><p>Analysts fear this may signal a return to the confrontational politics of the past in Bangladesh.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311777\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311777\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311777\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-12T112649Z_1449003913_RC2BKJA78QP6_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-1770993898.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311777\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Polling officials count ballots inside a counting centre during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 12, 2026 [Fatima Tuj Johora/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-vote-for-familiarity-experience\">A vote for familiarity, experience</h2><p>Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at Dhaka University, said the result showed most people would rather opt to have a known political group in power at times of uncertainty.</p><p>“Voters choosing BNP means they ultimately chose a familiar political force. They appeared to prefer a party whose governing experience they already knew, despite reservations about some of its past practices,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ultimately, the result indicates that the people of Bangladesh have chosen to revert to institutional politics following the turbulence of 2024 rather than embrace any sort of ideological shift as represented by the student-led National Citizen Party, which joined forces with Jamaat to contest this election.</p><p>Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmad told Al Jazeera that this election was almost a “repetition of the 2001 election” when the BNP surged in popularity and won 193 parliament seats, ahead of the previously governing Awami League, which secured just 62.</p><p>The real litmus test, now, he said, will be to see how well the opposing parties cooperate in the new parliament. “Parliamentary democracy becomes successful through cooperation between the treasury bench and the opposition bench,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But can Bangladesh steer away from the confrontational politics of the past?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311738\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311738\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311738\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-12T180327Z_2056020255_RC2HKJA0BJZC_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-1770992839.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311738\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shafiqur Rahman, leader of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, attends a news conference following the general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 12, 2026 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"two-competing-mandates\">Two competing mandates</h2><p>Political reform is far from off the agenda, however, and this may ultimately be what drags the nation back to those bad old days, experts say.</p><p>On Thursday, Bangladesh also held a referendum on the July National Charter, a blueprint for constitutional reforms emerging from the 2024 uprising and aimed at restructuring the state’s governance architecture. It has been overseen by a caretaker government in place since the ousting of Hasina.</p><p>The charter proposes a new two-chamber parliament, new procedures for appointing constitutional bodies such as the Election Commission, and strengthening institutional checks to reduce winner-takes-all executive dominance.</p><p>It also outlines broader constitutional reforms, including expanded fundamental rights and limits on unilateral constitutional amendments.</p><p>With approximately 60 percent voting “yes” to it on Thursday, the referendum creates a parallel reform mandate alongside BNP’s parliamentary majority.</p><p>These two mandates may not fully align, Shahan said.</p><p>The BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30 – something the main opposition Jamaat alliance was eager to point out during campaigning.</p><p>Therefore, “the BNP’s manifesto, to a large extent, conflicts with the July Charter”, Shahan pointed out.</p><p>During campaigning, the BNP pledged to back the implementation of the charter if voters approved it in the referendum. But Ahmad noted that the BNP’s earlier dissent on parts of the charter means the party may not feel obligated to implement every single reform in it.</p><p>In particular, the BNP may be opposed to proposals for proportional representation and the new design of an upper house, which, it has argued, could dilute large parliamentary majorities under the current electoral system.</p><p>The scale of its election win indicates that the public expects the BNP will uphold its <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/is-bnps-tarique-rahman-the-change-post-hasina-bangladesh-is-looking-for\">campaign pledges</a>, particularly on corruption and institutional reform. Therefore, any decision not to pursue specific reforms will require public explanation, Ahmed said.</p><p>But the sheer size of the BNP’s majority could make it easier to proceed unchallenged by a weak opposition.</p><p>“Those who come with a majority naturally have much greater capacity to work on policy implementation and reform,” political analyst Dilara Choudhury said. But such dominance in parliament also means less accountability.</p><p>Shahan warned, “There is a serious concern that, based on political costs, we could return to confrontational politics again.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311790\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311790\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311790\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-09T201122Z_1891507241_RC2KIJAI02RP_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-TARIQUE-1770994102.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311790\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairman Tarique Rahman gestures to supporters during the final day of election campaigning, before the national election, in Jatrabari, Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 9, 2026 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-awami-league-factor\">The Awami League factor</h2><p>The landslide result also reshapes Bangladesh’s party system at a time when the Awami League is absent.

But he cautioned that a failure to deliver reforms or effective governance could reopen space for the Awami League’s revival if voters become disillusioned with both traditional and reformist actors.</p><p>For now, according to Shahan, post-election stability will depend on two factors: whether opposition parties accept the results and participate constructively in parliament, and whether the BNP uses its strong mandate to pursue inclusive reforms rather than majoritarian consolidation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311796\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311796\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311796\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-10T010421Z_2044896863_RC29IIA76RXJ_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-INDIA-CHINA-1770994234.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311796\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of July Oikya, a platform of several organisations that took part in the July 2024 revolution, march to the Indian High Commission to demand the extradition of deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and others who fled the country during and after the uprising, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 17, 2025 [File: Stringer/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-diplomatic-balancing-act\">A diplomatic balancing act</h2><p>The landslide result places the BNP at the centre of both domestic restructuring and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/bangladesh-election-whats-at-stake-for-india-china-pakistan\">regional realignment</a> in the wake of the 2024 uprising, said Shahab Enam Khan, geopolitical analyst and professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka.</p><p>This election will have “immediate implications” for the region, he added.</p><p>Particularly, Bangladesh’s relationship with India, where Hasina remains in exile, much to the anger of many in Bangladesh who would like to see her extradited to face the death penalty handed to her by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh in November last year, for ordering her forces to fire on protesters in 2024.</p><p>“The Sheikh Hasina factor will always remain … extradition will remain an agenda, but in reality it may not happen given her relationship with political circles in Delhi,” Khan said.</p><p>“This will be a government which will receive unprecedented support from all the global powers, including the regional neighbours,” Khan told Al Jazeera. The United States is likely to continue its engagement initiated under the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, while China will remain a key partner given its market-oriented approach to Bangladesh, regardless of which party is in power.</p><p>As a result, relations with India – warm under Hasina’s rule – could become more transactional. “[Bangladesh’s] foreign policy will be very confident and that will make Bangladesh–India relationship much more transactional … BNP will look forward to much greater cooperation from Delhi based on reciprocity,” he said.</p><p>On Pakistan, he noted, “Islamabad will continue to have a good relationship with Dhaka because historically it had a good relationship with both BNP and Jamaat … we will see trade and investment ties improving and possibly some security cooperation.”</p><p>But balancing ties with India, China, the United States and Pakistan simultaneously may pose diplomatic challenges.</p><p>“Delhi would always be suspicious about Islamabad’s engagement and the US will always have concerns about Beijing’s engagement,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, however, Khan said internal stability for Bangladesh will depend less on geopolitics than on governance.</p><p>“Instability can come from many corners – lack of reform delivery, weak economic performance and inflation,” he said. The evolving relationship between BNP and opposition forces, particularly Jamaat, is an unknown variable.</p><p>Above all, Bangladeshi politics must not return to the old style of repression over debate.</p><p>“If BNP resorts to the same policies that Awami League has … cracking down on the public when it comes to criticism of foreign policy … that will be massively disastrous,” he said, adding that foreign policy toward India and Pakistan “will be heavily monitored by the public”.</p><p>Whether the new government embraces a reformed constitutional order or reverts to majoritarian governance will depend on how it balances its parliamentary dominance, the July Charter reform mandate, and rising geopolitical expectations.</p><p>The election has settled the question of power; the durability of Bangladesh’s post-uprising political order will hinge on how that power is exercised.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ahmed bin Sulayem’s ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</p><p>The UAE government’s Dubai Media Office said Friday that Essa Kazim had been appointed chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group CEO of DP World, one of the world’s largest logistics companies, which claims to handle about 10 percent of global trade.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The roles were previously held by bin Sulayem, one of Dubai’s most powerful and well-connected people, who has led DP World – which operates more than 60 ports and terminals worldwide – for more than four decades.</p><p>Sulayem’s lengthy tenure at the helm of the logistics giant came to an end in a firestorm of controversy over his links with the disgraced financier, after recently <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/struggling-to-navigate-the-epstein-files-here-is-a-visual-guide\">declassified documents</a> showed the pair had exchanged messages for years before and after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"salacious-exchanges\">Salacious exchanges</h2><p>The friendly exchanges between the two include discussions about deals and also mention bin Sulayem visiting Epstein’s private island while sharing contacts in business and politics.</p><p>The two men also shared salacious comments about women, with bin Sulayem’s email address featuring a correspondence in which Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00774231.pdf\">remarked</a>, “I loved the torture video.”</p><p>Bin Sulayem’s name was blacked out in documents released by the Department of Justice, but on Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">identified him</a> in the House of Representatives, along with five others whose names had been redacted, saying the government had shielded their names “for no apparent reason”.</p><p>Since Khanna’s speech to Congress, the Justice Department partially unredacted some of the files he pointed to.</p><h2 id=\"partners-suspend-ties\">Partners suspend ties</h2><p>While the files referenced by Khanna did not appear to implicate bin Sulayem or the other men in any specific crimes, the revelation of bin Sulayem’s years-long friendship with Epstein prompted the ‌United Kingdom development investment agency, British International Investment, and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, to announce they had paused future ventures with DP World in response.</p><p>La Caisse, which in 2022 invested $2.5bn in Jebel Ali Port, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the National Industries Park, three of DP World’s flagship assets in the UAE, <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/11/top-canadian-pension-fund-halts-deals-with-uae-firm-over-epstein-ties\">said on Tuesday</a> that it would not carry out further investments until it shed light on bin Sulayem’s links to Epstein and took “necessary actions”.</p><p>On Friday, British International Investment welcomed DP World’s appointment of a new ⁠chief executive and said it would resume investment alongside the company.</p><p>“We ‌welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership to advance the development ⁠of key African trading ⁠ports to unlock the continent’s global trading potential,” a ⁠spokesperson for the agency said.</p><p>Epstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.</p><p>His contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019.</p><p>Epstein died in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.</p></div></div></body></html>"

BNP officials said the party expected to form a government by Sunday.</p><p>The BNP was followed by Jamaat-e-Islami, which secured 68 seats in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/bangladesh-goes-to-polls-in-crucial-first-election-since-deadly-uprising\">Thursday’s polls</a> – its highest-ever tally.</p><p>The party, which is led by Shafiqur Rahman and contested for the first time since a 2013 ban that was lifted after Hasina’s ouster, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/bangladesh-election-results-2026-who-won-who-lost-whats-next\">said</a> it is not “satisfied” with the vote count and raised “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.</p><p>The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists instrumental in toppling Hasina and part of a Jamaat-led alliance, won just six of the 30 seats that it contested.</p><p>The Election Commission has yet to formally announce the final tally, which is expected either later on Friday or on Saturday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Turnout <a href=\"/gallery/2026/2/12/bangladeshis-turn-out-for-historic-election-after-hasinas-downfall\">stood</a> at almost 60 percent of registered voters, according to the Election Commission, well over the nearly 42 percent in the last election in 2024.</p><p>The election featured a record number of parties, more than 50, and at least 2,000 candidates, many of them independents. The parliament comprises 350 lawmakers, with 50 seats reserved for women.</p><p>More than 127 million people were eligible to cast their votes, with many <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/like-eid-bangladeshis-hail-landmark-election-many-vote-after-17-years\">expressing enthusiasm</a> for what was widely seen as Bangladesh’s first competitive vote in years.</p><p>An interim government led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 85, has been in office since Hasina fled to India in 2024 after widespread protests led largely by young people, who were killed in their hundreds by security forces.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305169\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305169\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305169\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_2-01-1770807991.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_2_REVISED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Tarique Rahman, who has never held government office, returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom. The 60-year-old has yet to comment on the unofficial results but on Friday, he waved from his car as he left his house in the capital, Dhaka, for a mosque.</p><p>In a statement, the BNP asked people to refrain from large celebrations and offer special prayers instead.</p><p>“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"litmus-test\">‘Litmus test’</h2><p>The 78-year-old <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/bangladesh-court-sentences-ex-pm-hasina-uk-lawmaker-niece-in-graft-case\">former leader</a>, Hasina, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India. Her Awami League party was barred from the election.</p><p>BNP members have said the party would formally request Hasina’s extradition from India. In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers. Tarique Rahman has also promised to revive a stagnant economy, reset ties with countries in the region and crack down on corruption.</p><p>Abbas Faiz, an independent South Asia researcher, said the election was a test of how Bangladesh was “ready for democracy”.</p><p>“Also, a test of the political parties which have been able to take part in the elections. They have actually understood the aspirations and the wishes of the people of their country for the removal of corrupt practices in the administration and parliament,” Faiz told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added the election is the “litmus test” which puts responsibility on the “shoulders of the new government”.</p><p>But Faiz explained that the election would have been “fairer” if all parties, including the Awami League, were allowed to participate.</p><p>“But in a way, the problem lies with the Awami League itself, because it did not reimage itself as a party that could be trusted by the general populace in Bangladesh,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the US ambassador to Bangladesh, Brent T Christensen, were among the first to congratulate Rahman on his party’s victory. China’s embassy in Dhaka also congratulated the BNP over its election showing.</p><p>The election commission also said some 48 million ‌voters chose “Yes” ‌while about 23 million said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, though there was no official word on the outcome.</p><p>The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation, while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.</p><p>Fahmida Khatun, an economist and executive director of the Dhaka-based Centre for Policy Dialogue, told Al Jazeera that early signals support the perception of a credible election.</p><p>Although heavy security was reported across polling stations, “broadly, the voting was peaceful”, Khatun said, pointing to the voter turnout figure as an indicator of healthy participation.</p><p>“This indicates citizens wanted to exercise their voting rights and they wanted to choose their own people,” she added.</p><p>Several hundred international observers monitored Thursday’s voting, with the European Union’s Election Observation Mission expected to issue a preliminary report on its findings on Sunday.</p></div></div></body></html>"
