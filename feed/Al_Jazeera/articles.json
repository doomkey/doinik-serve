Gaza is destroyed, but Hamas is not yet destroyed. So there is something fundamentally wrong with the way this is conducted,” he said.</p><p>When asked if he believed Israeli forces may be guilty of carrying out war crimes since the conflict began more than two years ago, Guterres said that “there are strong reasons to believe that that possibility might be a reality”.</p><p>Responding to Guterres’s comments, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon accused the UN chief of using his “elevated platform to lambast and condemn Israel and Israelis at every opportunity”.</p><p>“The only crime committed is the moral abomination that more than two years after the horrific massacres of October 7, the UN secretary-general has still not visited Israel,” he told Reuters.</p><p>In October 2024, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, now the country’s defence minister, declared Guterres <a href=\"/news/2024/10/2/israels-katz-bars-un-chief-from-country-over-iran-attack-response\">“persona non grata”</a> in Israel, accusing him of giving “backing to terrorists, rapists, and murderers” for failing to condemn Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2024/10/2/risk-of-long-feared-regional-war-rises-as-israel-and-iran-swap-threats\">missile attack</a> on the country that month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>More than 70,000 people have died in Gaza since October 7, 2023, when Israeli forces launched an all-out assault in response to a <a href=\"/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded\">Hamas-led attack</a> on southern Israel that saw more than 1,200 people killed and 251 taken captive.</p><p>A fragile United States-brokered ceasefire – a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">20-point peace plan</a> pushed by US President Donald Trump – has been in place since October 10. But Israeli forces have repeatedly violated the truce with strikes and demolitions, claiming to be targeting Hamas infrastructure in Gaza.</p><p>Israel’s most recent violations on Wednesday resulted in <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/israel-accused-of-manoeuvring-as-it-says-gaza-crossing-open-one-way-only#:~:text=Israel's%20military%20has%20killed%20seven,from%20the%20war%2Dtorn%20territory.\">seven Palestinians being killed</a>, including two children aged eight and 10, in attacks on the coastal enclave.</p><p>According to Gaza’s authorities, Israeli forces have violated the ceasefire at least 591 times since it came into effect, killing at least 360 Palestinians and wounding 922 others.</p><p>In his Reuters interview, Guterres also praised the US for being instrumental in improving aid access in Gaza, saying the humanitarian situation has “considerably improved” because of pressure exerted by Washington on Israel.</p><p>“They have leverage that, of course, we [the UN] do not,” he said. “There is an excellent cooperation in the humanitarian aid between the UN and the US, and I hope that this will be maintained and developed,” he added.</p><p>Israel has continued to restrict the entry of aid into Gaza, despite a key condition of the initial phase of Trump’s peace plan being that it let humanitarian aid into the enclave and open the vital Rafah crossing separating it from Egypt.</p><p>On Wednesday, a military unit called Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said the “Rafah Crossing will open in the coming days exclusively for the exit of residents from the Gaza Strip to Egypt”.</p><p>The announcement, signalling only one direction of travel, has raised fears that Gaza residents could be permanently displaced, something far-right ministers in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline government have <a href=\"/news/2023/12/31/israeli-minister-reiterates-calls-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza\">promoted for months</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

fines of 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32m) if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to comply.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of adolescents are likely to be affected by the ban, with Instagram alone

verification instead.</p><p>“The government should require app stores to verify age and obtain parental approval whenever teens under 16 download apps, eliminating the need for teens to verify their age multiple times across different apps,” the Meta spokesperson said.</p><p>“Social media platforms could then use this verified age information to ensure teens are in age-appropriate experiences.”</p><p>YouTube has also attacked the social media ban.</p><p>The video-streaming giant said this week the new law would make young Australians “less safe” because those below 16 could still visit the website without an account, but would lose YouTube safety filters.</p><p>But Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells described its argument as “weird”.</p><p>“If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe and there’s content not appropriate for age-restricted users on their website, that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,” said Wells.</p><p>Wells added that some Australian teens had killed themselves as algorithms “latched on” – targeting them with content that drained their self-esteem.</p><p>“This specific law will not fix every harm occurring on the internet, but it will make it easier for kids to chase a better version of themselves,” she said.</p><p>The Sydney-based internet rights group Digital Freedom Project said it had challenged the laws in Australia’s High Court last week, calling them an “unfair” assault on freedom of speech.</p><p>Platforms are expected to devise their own means to stop rebellious teenagers from trying to skirt the law, by using fake IDs, for instance, but “no solution is likely to be 100 percent effective”, the internet safety watchdog has said.</p><p>There is keen interest in whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work as regulators around the globe wrestle with the potential dangers of social media.</p><p>Malaysia indicated it was <a

That’s 90 billion euros. The remainder would be for international partners to cover,” she said.</p><p>“We are increasing the cost of Russia’s war of aggression. And this should act as a further incentive for Russia to engage at the negotiating table,” von der Leyen added.</p><p>The Commission president suggested that the proposal to EU member states had taken into account almost all the concerns raised by Belgium, whose Brussels-based financial institution <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/eu-leaders-delay-decision-on-using-frozen-russian-funds-to-aid-ukraine\">Euroclear</a> is the main holder of the frozen Russian assets.</p><p>Von der Leyen said the new proposal also covers other financial institutions in the EU holding Russian assets, while EU officials said France, Germany, Sweden and Cyprus also hold such assets that will be used to fund the proposed loan.</p><p>The Commission also said the scheme does not amount to confiscating the money as it would be in the form of a loan – although Ukraine would only have to redeem it if Russia pays reparations for the war damage caused.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The EU could proceed with the frozen assets proposal if 15 out of 27 members vote in favour. The Commission said it hoped to clinch a firm commitment from member states at an EU leaders summit on December 18.</p><p>The second option – borrowing on international markets – would normally require unanimity among EU countries, which could prove a difficult hurdle as Hungary’s Russia-friendly government has opposed previous funding for Ukraine.</p><p>Belgium has repeatedly voiced its resistance to the frozen assets plan, suggesting the proposed use of 140 billion euros ($163bn) it holds would imperil a peace deal in the short term while placing it at risk of future crippling legal action by Russia.</p><p>One demand from Brussels is that EU countries commit to covering all legal costs arising from any future Russian lawsuits challenging the scheme.</p><p>On Wednesday, hours before the proposal’s presentation, Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot reiterated these reservations, saying the legal texts “do not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner”.</p><p>“We have repeatedly said that we consider the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky; it has never been done before,” Prevot said. “This explains why we keep on pleading for an alternative, namely the EU borrowing the amounts needed on the markets.”</p><p>Russia, meanwhile, has said the EU using its assets would constitute theft. On Monday, Andrei Kostin, the head of Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB, threatened the bloc with 50 years of litigation if the idea comes to fruition.</p><p>Von der Leyen, meanwhile, said United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “positively received” news of the proposed reparation loan. That reported assurance comes despite complexities shrouding the scheme related to the Trump administration’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point plan</a> to end the war, which proposed using some of the assets in a joint US-Russian investment vehicle.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, the EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027, taking a significant stride towards ending the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy.</p><p>The EU announced the “historic agreement” had been reached between EU government and European Parliament representatives on June proposals set out by the European Commission to end Russian energy shipments.</p><p>Under the agreement, member states will halt imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2026. Pipeline gas imports will stop by November 2027.</p><p>The body said the move allows it to end its “dependence on an unreliable supplier”, which has “repeatedly destabilised European energy markets, put at risk security of supply with energy blackmail and harmed the European economy”.</p><p>Von der Leyen hailed the move, saying that “today, we enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia”.</p><p>“By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector,” she said.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia look likely to mount legal challenges to the measure, with both countries still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Since India’s independence from British rule and its partition to create the state of Pakistan in 1947, the two countries have fought two of their three full-scale wars over Kashmir.</p><p>In the late 1980s, an armed rebellion against New Delhi’s rule erupted on the Indian side, which has since claimed tens of thousands of lives, most of them civilians. The rebellion saw the deployment of nearly a million Indian soldiers, making it one of the world’s most militarised regions. The rebels aim to either carve an independent nation out of Kashmir or merge the region with Muslim-majority Pakistan.</p><p>The anti-India sentiments in Kashmir intensified in 2019 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian government <a href=\"/news/2023/12/11/whats-article-370-what-to-know-about-india-top-court-verdict-on-kashmir\">scrapped a law</a> that granted the region partial autonomy in matters of land ownership and livelihoods, and split it into two “union territories” to be directly governed by New Delhi.

When millions of Muslims moved to a newly-created Pakistan in 1947 – as did Hindus to India – many left behind relatives on both sides of the border. Over the years, these blood ties gave rise to cross-border marriages between citizens of the two countries.</p><p>But on April 28, Samina was summoned to the local police station in Srinagar’s Dalgate area. Noorie and Hussein slept on their laps as the couple met the police officer. When the children woke up, they realised their father had brought them back home, their mother no longer around.</p><p>Samina was detained at the police station and informed that she would be deported to Pakistan — she is originally from Lahore — the next day.</p><p>Sitting quietly in a dimly lit room that served as a bedroom and kitchen, Majid said he is still struggling to process the events that turned his life upside down.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4049846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4049846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4049846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4287-1-1761052046.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistanis deported by India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4049846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Majid’s children looking out of the window of their one-room home [Arjumand Shaheen/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>He used to wait tables at a local restaurant and earned about $70 a month. But since his wife was taken away, he has not been able to leave his little children alone. He is now jobless.</p><p>“I have not slept properly for six months now. My whole time is spent taking care of the children. I cannot think about doing anything else,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Confined to his room, Majid says he is unable to go out even to buy groceries. “Sometimes, I think of ending my life,” he said. “But I stop myself, wondering who would take care of them when I am gone.”</p><p>Majid’s children, Hussein and Noorie, also do not know when they will be able to see their mother.</p><p>“The sudden separation from Samina has traumatised them. They call out to their mother in sleep,” Majid told Al Jazeera as he made a futile attempt to distract his children by showing them cartoons on his mobile phone.</p><p>“All they know is that the police took her away. Whenever they see any police or army officer, they ask them to bring their mother back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, forcibly separated from her children, Samina is struggling with health issues in Pakistan. Her blood pressure is unstable due to stress. “She gets hospitalised every now and then. Her blood pressure isn’t normalising,” said Majid.</p><p>When asked about the deportations, Shazia Ilmi, spokeswoman for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), suggested that the moves were driven by national security concerns. Those deported were Pakistani nationals, she emphasised, and often were “married to those who have been found involved in terrorism and activities that are antinational”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So this cannot become a way for Pakistani nationals to marry into India and support such activities. Why should India have Pakistani nationals?” she said.</p><p>When pressed to present evidence in support of her allegation that deportees were often married to those involved in “terrorism”, Ilmi accused Al Jazeera of having a “dubious agenda”. “I think you have a nasty agenda to find things against India and the Indian government, and it will not work,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"reunited-after-years-separated-again-in-12-days\">Reunited after years, separated again in 12 days</h2><p>Muhammad Shehbaz is a 32-year-old resident of Daryaganj, a densely populated neighbourhood of what is called Old Delhi. In 2014, he married his maternal cousin from Pakistan, 27-year-old Erum. Since then, Erum had been living in India on a long-term visa until she travelled to Pakistan to introduce their three-year-old son, Almeer, to her family.</p><p>That was in March 2020 – just 10 days before a lockdown and travel restrictions were imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Erum was forced to extend her stay in Pakistan, during which her Indian visa expired.</p><p>After the lockdown was lifted, Shehbaz tried hard to secure another Indian visa so that Erum could return. After five years of repeated rejections, she was finally granted one in April this year. After more than five years of separation, an elated Shehbaz was finally going to be reunited with his family.</p><p>Erum reached New Delhi on April 17. Twelve days later, the Pahalgam attack happened. She was deported back to Pakistan on April 29.</p><p>“After so many years of separation, hard work and longing, she had finally come home. My world had lit up, and I forgot everything. And then, in the blink of an eye, it all collapsed again. She was taken away, leaving me vulnerable and drowning in despair,” Shehbaz told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“When the police came to our home and informed us about Erum’s deportation, I became numb. My son was crying inconsolably. The struggles I faced all these years to reunite my family are beyond words. And now, it feels like it was all in vain.”</p><p>Almeer, now nine, first grew up for years without his father and has now been torn away from his mother. Shehbaz, who runs a small jewellery business, is worried about his future.</p><p>“He has grown frail and quiet, not expressing much, but I can see he is shattered inside,” Shehbaz told Al Jazeera. “Caught in the animosity between the two countries, why are ordinary citizens pushed to the wall? What is our fault?”</p><h2 id=\"parveena-hadn-t-been-to-pakistan-in-40-years\">Parveena hadn’t been to Pakistan in 40 years</h2><p>Back in Indian-administered Kashmir, Fazl‑u‑Rehman, 62, does not know if he might be able to see his wife, Parveena, who was deported in April to Pakistan, a country she had not seen in more than four decades.</p><p>Parveena, 65, was born in Pakistan’s Karachi city. But she never went back after marrying Rehman in 1982, as she built a life with her husband and children in Baramulla district.</p><p>Rehman now fears he may die without seeing her. “Our home has been divided. Everything is in ruins. I don’t know how many years I will live,” he told Al Jazeera, his voice choking.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4049848\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4049848\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4049848\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4438-1-1761052054.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistanis deported by India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4049848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soliha Parveen shows a photo of her mother, Parveena, on her mobile phone [Arjumand Shaheen/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Rehman and Parveena have two daughters – the elder one, Afreen, is married, while Soliha, 27, is at home, looking after her ageing parents while also pursuing a master’s degree in political science.</p><p>“I missed my second semester mid-term exams in July while managing the household responsibilities alone,” she told Al Jazeera. “I have to do it all alone – getting medicines, groceries and other household chores. Left with no option, I had to sacrifice my education.”</p><p>Soliha said her mother has been undergoing treatment for heart disease in Kashmir. But she has no means to continue her treatment in Pakistan, where she has no immediate relatives or financial support. She said her mother lives in Karachi with a distant relative, who is paralysed.</p><p>“There is no one to look after her. If anything happens to my mother there, the Indian government would be responsible,” she said.</p><p>“If someone else committed the crime, why are we being punished for it? My education and career are at stake. I am facing mental health issues because of my mother’s deportation.”</p><p>Her father, Rehman, intervened. “There are 700,000 to 800,000 armed forces in Kashmir. If they couldn’t prevent the [Pahalgam] attack, how are civilians being held responsible for it?” he asked, furiously.</p><p>Parveen urged the government to “stop punishing your own citizens” and demanded the return of their loved ones.</p><h2 id=\"never-felt-so-helpless-in-life\">‘Never felt so helpless in life’</h2><p>Abdullah* says he has been forced to rebuild his life that fell apart after his wife, Tamarah*, 25, was deported on April 29. He says his twin toddlers – Ayan and Atif, just 18 months old – no longer play, laugh, or eat as they once did. One of the twins was still breastfeeding when Tamarah was deported.</p><p>Abdullah, a 38-year-old public bank manager in Kashmir’s Kupwara district, married Tamarah in 2018. As she was driven to the Attari-Wagah border for deportation, Abdullah took his children and followed the police van in his car all the way from Kupwara to Amritsar, a distance of more than 500km (324 miles).</p><p>“I cried on the way, pleading helplessly with the police to at least let the children see their mother one last time,” he told Al Jazeera. “But they didn’t even allow us a proper goodbye.”</p><p>The first two months were “nothing short of hell” for the children.</p><p>“After the sudden separation from their mother, their health began to deteriorate. They suffered frequent fevers and vomiting,” he said, adding that he has barely attended office in the past six months, with one or the other child needing hospitalisation.</p><p>“Everything is disrupted. Life has turned upside down. I have never felt so helpless in my life,” he said.</p><p>Abdullah said even lawyers refused to take up the case of his children, separated from their mother. He said the lawyers said no legal action could proceed without permission from the federal Ministry of Home Affairs. In desperation, Abdullah said he wrote to Prime Minister Modi and other authorities in New Delhi and Kashmir, but received no response.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"because-they-are-pakistanis-and-muslims\">‘Because they are Pakistanis and Muslims’</h2><p>Human rights activists say there is no justification for penalising innocent civilians due to the tensions between India and Pakistan.</p><p>“Ordinary people hold no enmity towards each other. Why should they suffer because of political or diplomatic conflicts?” said Shabnam Hashmi, a New Delhi-based activist. “In any conflict, civilians must never be the casualties. To separate a child from their mother is cruel, traumatic, and utterly inhuman – a clear violation of human rights.”</p><p>Waheed Para, a Kashmiri legislator from the Peoples Democratic Party, said the deportation of Pakistani nationals is unjust and unfortunate.</p><p>“After Kashmir’s conversion into a union territory, our ability to influence or resolve such issues has been severely limited. We can raise our voices and try to intervene, but we remain largely powerless in the face of decisions made elsewhere,” he told Al Jazeera, referring to the federal government in New Delhi.</p><p>“In cross-border shelling, civilians lose lives and homes. Unfortunately, innocent citizens, children, and women continue to be the casualties of a geopolitical issue between India and Pakistan,” Para added.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Home Affairs for their response, but did not receive any reply.</p><p>Colin Gonsalves, Supreme Court lawyer and rights activist, said the deportation of Pakistani nationals has no legitimate connection to the Pahalgam attack.</p><p>“Linking them to Pahalgam [attack] is simply an excuse and a deeply flawed one … The government may claim it is a fallout of Pahalgam, but that claim is not only misleading, it’s dangerous,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They were deported simply because they are Pakistanis and Muslims – a clear reflection of a bias against both.”</p><p>Back in Kupwara, Abdullah wipes the tears rolling down his cheeks, struggling to speak as he recollects the months since his wife Tamarah was deported.</p><p>“What the Indian government did to us is no different from what the attackers did in Pahalgam. They destroyed our families and homes too,” he said. “Why are our innocent children being punished? What did they do?”</p><p><em>*Names changed to protect their identities over fears of government reprisal.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Since the end of the Cold War, it has deepened strategic and military ties with the US while trying to keep its friendship with Russia afloat.</p><p>Yet, Russia’s war on Ukraine has challenged that balance – and Putin’s visit could offer signs of how Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans to juggle New Delhi’s competing relationships without sacrificing any of them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3034793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3034793\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3034793\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-08T214113Z_1994694215_RC27R8A94GVJ_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-INDIA-TALKS-1720490958.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C475&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence near Moscow, Russia July 8, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3034793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence near Moscow, Russia, July 8, 2024 [Sergei Bobylyov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-scheduled-for-putin\">What’s scheduled for Putin?</h2><p>Putin is expected to land on Thursday evening and head for a private dinner with Modi at the prime minister’s residence in the heart of the Indian capital, New Delhi.</p><p>On the morning of Friday, December 5, Putin is scheduled to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential palace, for a guard of honour and a meeting with India’s ceremonial head of state, Droupadi Murmu. He will then, like all visiting leaders, travel to Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>Then, Putin and Modi will meet at Hyderabad House, a complex that hosts most leadership summits for the latest chapter of an annual India-Russia summit. After that, they are scheduled to meet business leaders, before attending a banquet thrown in Putin’s honour by Murmu, the Indian president.</p><p>Earlier, the Kremlin said in a statement that Putin’s visit to India was “of great importance, providing an opportunity to comprehensively discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations as a particularly privileged strategic partnership”.</p><p>Putin will be joined by Andrei Belousov, his defence minister, and a wide-ranging delegation from business and industry, including top executives of Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, and reportedly the heads of sanctioned oil firms Rosneft and Gazprom Neft.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149316\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149316\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149316\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25335239159230-1764816544.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greet each other before their meeting in New Delhi, India, on Dec. 6, 2021.

Modi was supposed to visit Russia for the summit, but the conclave was put off.</p><p>In 2023, Putin skipped a visit to India for the G20 summit in New Delhi. At the time, Putin was rarely travelling abroad, largely because of an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against him related to the Ukraine war. India is not a member of the ICC – and so it would have been safe for Putin to attend, but Western members of the G20 made it clear that their leaders would be uncomfortable sharing the room with the Russian president.</p><p>Finally, in 2024, the annual summit resumed, with Modi visiting Russia.

The West was stopping purchases of Russian crude, and a complete global ban on that oil would have shrunk global supplies, raising prices. India, by increasing its uptake of Russian oil, helped stabilise the global market.</p><p>But as Trump, in his second term, has looked for levers to use to pressure Moscow and Kyiv to end the war, he has targeted India for buying Russian oil. After initially imposing 25 percent tariffs on Indian goods, Trump doubled that to 50 percent as a penalty for Russian crude purchases.</p><p>For months after that, India continued importing Russian oil and defended what it called its “strategic autonomy”.</p><p>However, in October, Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil firms – Rosneft and Lukoil – and threatened sanctions against firms of other countries that trade with them.</p><p>Reliance, India’s largest private oil refiner – and the biggest buyer of Russian oil in India – has since said that it will no longer export petroleum products that use Russian crude.</p><p>Indian imports of Russian crude are expected to fall to a three-year low now. Meanwhile, India recently signed a deal to dramatically ramp up its import of gas from the US.</p><p>In the defence sector too, the US has been pressuring India to buy more from it and less from Russia.</p><p>“New Delhi is wary of upsetting Washington regarding its defence deals with Moscow, but that’s not going to deter it from making important deals,” said Donthi, the analyst at Crisis Group. “India hopes to blunt US criticism by making similar deals with it, some of which are already under way.”</p><p>But Trump’s pressure risks hurting goodwill for the US in India.</p><p>Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary and an ex-ambassador to Russia, said Trump and the US were employing “double standards”.</p><p>“Trump can roll out a red carpet for Putin in Alaska. Why should India not build on its ties with Russia then?” he added, referring to the Trump-Putin summit in August.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4147510\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4147510\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4147510\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-09-01T071903Z_1458167711_RC2VIGAJHB0S_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-SCO-PUTIN-MODI-1764750848.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C530&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4147510\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, September 1, 2025 [Vladimir Smirnov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"in-which-sector-are-india-russia-ties-strong\">In which sector are India-Russia ties strong?</h2><p>While the bilateral energy ties between India and Russia face several barriers, their defence ties are steadier.</p><p>Russia remains India’s largest defence supplier, accounting for roughly 36 percent of arms imports, and more than 60 percent of India’s existing arsenal.</p><p>Import numbers have come down from 72 percent in 2010, as India attempts to boost domestic production and also buy more from the US and European nations. But experts say that Russia’s position as India’s pre-eminent defence partner will likely remain unchallenged for several years.</p><p>The Russian S-400 missile defence system was central to India’s air defences during its four-day air war with Pakistan in May. India’s air force chief, Marshal AP Singh, said that “the S-400 was a game changer” for India.</p><p>New Delhi is now looking to buy additional S-400 air defence systems. Russia, meanwhile, wants to also sell India its Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighter jets. “The SU-57 is the best plane in the world,” said Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, ahead of the summit. “And it will be on the agenda.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3922713\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-What-do-INDIA-and-Russia-trade-most-sep3-2025-copy-4-1756879432.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-What do INDIA and Russia trade most?-sep3-2025 copy 4-1756879432\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-are-india-russia-trade-prospects\">What are India-Russia trade prospects?</h2><p>India-Russia trade has undergone a major shift since 2022, ballooning from a modest $10bn to a record nearly $69bn this year, primarily fuelled by New Delhi’s appetite for discounted Russian crude oil.</p><p>However, these numbers remain lopsided: Indian exports, largely pharmaceuticals and machinery, stand at roughly $5bn, resulting in a widening $64bn trade deficit. And Russia’s exports to India have been dominated by oil over the past three years. With trade now expected to fall, so will overall numbers, caution experts. The India-Russia goal of reaching $100bn in trade by 2030 appears distant.</p><p>Instead, analysts told Al Jazeera, the two countries now appear to be betting on labour migration as a driver of people-to-people and economic ties.</p><p>According to the estimates of the Russian Ministry of Labour, by 2030, the country is expected to see a shortfall of 3.1 million workers.

Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner spent hours at the Kremlin but departed with no breakthrough on ending the war.</li>\n<li>Trump said Witkoff and Kushner briefed him about the talks and told him their impression of Putin was “he would like to make a deal”. But Trump added that he “can’t tell” what will come out of the meeting “because it does take two to tango”. He added that Washington already has “something pretty well worked out [with Ukraine]”.</li>\n<li>Asked if it would be correct to say that Putin had rejected Washington’s proposals, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disagreed. “A direct exchange of views took place yesterday for the first time,” Peskov said. “Some things were accepted, some things were marked as unacceptable. This is a normal working process of finding a compromise.”</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed his team is preparing for meetings in the US and that dialogue with Trump’s envoys will continue. “Only by taking Ukraine’s interests into account is a dignified peace possible,” he said.</li>\n<li>An unnamed White House official confirmed to Reuters that Witkoff and Kushner would meet with Ukrainian officials in Miami on Thursday.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"united-nations\">United Nations</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ninety-one countries at the United Nations General Assembly, including the US, have backed a resolution demanding Russia “ensure the immediate, safe and unconditional return of all Ukrainian children who have been <a href=\"/news/2025/6/10/russia-ukraine-children-war\">forcibly transferred or deported</a>” from Ukraine since Moscow launched its war in 2022.</li>\n<li>Russia and 11 other countries voted against the resolution – which was drafted by Ukraine, Canada and the European Union – while 57 countries abstained.</li>\n<li>Ahead of the vote, Russia had urged countries to oppose the resolution. “Each vote for the resolution is support for lies, war and confrontation.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the body is “proposing to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next two years. That’s 90 billion euros”. She added that the “remainder would be for international partners to cover”.</li>\n<li>But Belgium, whose Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear is the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now\">main holder of the Russian assets,</a> has voiced a range of legal concerns. While von der Leyen said the proposal had taken into account Belgium’s concerns, Brussels does not “share that assessment”, a senior official told Reuters, adding that it “cannot accept being asked to bear the risks of such an operation alone”.</li>\n<li>The EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy. Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move towards a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.</li>\n<li>Hungary and Slovakia are both weighing up legal options to challenge the order, as both EU members are still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.</li>\n<li>More than two-thirds of NATO member states have so far committed $4bn worth of weapons for Ukraine through the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/germany-pledges-2bn-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-as-kyiv-seeks-more-funds\">Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL)</a> – an initiative to supply Kyiv with weapons bought from the US – according to the alliance’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte.</li>\n<li>Outside NATO, Australia and New Zealand have also agreed to contribute to the PURL initiative, Rutte said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"european-defence\">European defence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Germany has become the first European nation to deploy the Arrow air defence system, built to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles such as Russia’s Oreshnik.</li>\n<li>The system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the US Missile Defense Agency, is used as the upper layer of Israel’s missile defences. “Who could have imagined that only 80 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the Jewish state, through the technologies it develops, would help defend not only Germany but all of Europe,” said Ron Prosor, Israel’s ambassador to Germany.</li>\n<li>The Romanian military has blown up a maritime drone it said was endangering navigation in the Black Sea, identifying it as a Ukrainian-developed Sea Baby. Ukraine’s SBU security service, however, said that all of its Sea Baby maritime drones engaged in operational tasks in the Black Sea region were accounted for, with none entering Romanian waters.</li>\n<li>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has described attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea in recent days as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russian-tanker-struck-off-turkiye-as-ukraine-targets-shadow-fleet\">“very scary”</a>. Ukraine has claimed some of these attacks. Fidan said that the attacks threaten regional safety and show that the reach of the war is expanding.

for the next chair of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>While Trump has yet to confirm his nominee, one name stands out as the overwhelming favourite: Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Prediction market Kalshi on Wednesday put the odds of Hassett being nominated at 86 percent, compared with 6 percent for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and 4 percent for sitting Fed governor Michelle Bowman.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-matter-who-leads-the-federal-reserve\">Why does it matter who leads the Federal Reserve?</h2><p>As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, the Fed is arguably the most important financial institution on the planet.</p><p>The Fed performs several key roles in the US economy, including setting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and promoting the stability of the financial system by serving as a lender of last resort.</p><p>The most closely watched of these functions is monetary policy, which the Fed primarily manages by setting interest rates.</p><p>The Fed’s policymaking committee meets eight times each year to set the federal funds rate, the target interest rate at which commercial banks lend to each other on a short-term basis.</p><p>The committee is holding its final meeting of 2025 on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, when it is widely expected to agree on a 0.25 percent cut to the benchmark rate, currently set in the range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.</p><p>The benchmark rate has far-reaching implications for the entire economy, since banks’ borrowing costs influence the interest rates they charge customers for mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit.</p><p>Typically, the Fed, which has the dual mandate of encouraging employment and keeping prices stable, lowers interest rates when the economy is struggling and raises them when prices are rising too fast.</p><p>Cheaper borrowing encourages businesses to invest and consumers to spend more, stimulating economic growth.</p><p>On the other hand, higher borrowing costs act as a brake on economic activity, helping to bring down inflation.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-hassett-and-what-is-his-background\">Who is Hassett and what is his background?</h2><p>Though Hassett is among several names that have been mooted for the top job at the Fed, he stands alone for the amount of time he has spent in Trump’s proximity.</p><p>A career economist, Hassett was appointed as Trump’s top coordinator on economic policy after serving in his first administration as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, an older, more research-oriented body than the National Economic Council.</p><p>After leaving the first Trump administration in 2019, Hassett briefly returned to the White House to serve as an adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Crucially, Hasset has signalled his support for cutting interest rates faster – something Trump has been angrily demanding from the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for months to little avail.</p><p>Trump has insisted that concerns that his tariffs could spell a return to high inflation are overblown and suggested that the benchmark rate should be set as low as 1 percent.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last month, Hassett said he would be “cutting rates right now” if he were in Powell’s shoes.</p><p>Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Hassett would likely push for faster rate cuts in the role, albeit probably not at the pace Trump would prefer.</p><p>“I think it is likely that Hassett would try to lower the Fed’s policy interest rates, but probably not all the way to the 1 percent level that President Trump has demanded,” Gagnon told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He would probably argue that the administration’s deregulation agenda and the AI boom give the economy more room to grow without causing inflation.”</p><p>Before and in between his stints at the Trump White House, Hasset was an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, where he published extensively on tax and trade policy.</p><p>Hassett also served as an economic adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain, George W Bush and Mitt Romney.</p><p>Prior to getting involved in the world of politics, the economist did stints at Columbia Business School and the Fed’s research and statistics division.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-hassett-s-potential-nomination-attracting-controversy\">Why is Hassett’s potential nomination attracting controversy?</h2><p>Hassett’s reputation as a Trump loyalist has raised concerns in some quarters about the independence of the Fed.</p><p>The ability of the central bank to make its decisions free from political influence or considerations is widely seen as being crucial to confidence in the US economy.</p><p>But that longstanding expectation is already under scrutiny due to Trump’s repeated verbal attacks on Powell, whose term expires in May, and his <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/26/trump-orders-removal-o-fed-governor-cook-over-mortgage-fraud-claims\">push to remove Lisa Cook</a>, one of the Fed’s six other governors, over unproven claims of mortgage fraud.</p><p>“I think that concerns regarding the Fed’s independence are very real and valid,” Anastassia Fedyk, an assistant professor of finance at the Haas School of Business of the University of California Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s not just about Kevin Hassett being closer to President Trump than prior Fed chairs were to their nominating presidents. There is also the contextual background: the firing of Lisa Cook, the attempts to end Jerome Powell’s term early, and Kevin Hassett’s own stated approval for those attempts.”</p><p>Still, Hassett would not have free rein to steer the Fed if nominated and subsequently confirmed by the US Senate.</p><p>The central bank’s policy committee has 12 members – including four nominees of former Democratic President Joe Biden – and makes its decisions by majority vote.</p><p>David Wilcox, an economist with Bloomberg Economics and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that whoever leads the Fed next will face the same difficult task of supporting jobs without stoking higher inflation.</p><p>“On one hand, the jobs market appears to be weakening, albeit only slowly. On the other hand, inflation remains too high – noticeably above the Fed’s 2 percent objective,” Wilcox told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There’s plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree about how these competing considerations should best be balanced against each other, but no one should pretend that the choice is obvious,” Wilcox added.</p><p>“Any move toward a dramatically easier stance of policy risks pushing inflation higher for longer. We’ve just been through the worst bout of inflation in 40 years, and the American people have spoken loud and clear about how strongly they dislike inflation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two days later, he said, he found himself in the middle of a conversation that appeared to feature some of the most senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration.</p><p>Among the participants were Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><h2 id=\"trump-defends-signal-chat\">Trump defends Signal chat</h2><p>In the Signal chat, Hegseth reportedly <a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/the-atlantic-publishes-us-attack-plans-shared-on-signal\">divulged details</a> in advance about a March 15 attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Those details included the precise timing when the F-18 planes would launch, when the drones would arrive, and when both parties would conduct their air strikes.</p><p>Goldberg’s reporting on the chat prompted outrage towards the Trump administration and Waltz and Hegseth in particular.</p><p>Critics decried the risks that the messages posed to US military operations overseas, with some worrying that, if the Signal chat had fallen into the wrong hands, it could have endangered service members’ lives.</p><p>This week’s inspector general report recommends greater training to ensure compliance with operational security standards.</p><p>But it declines to weigh whether the material Hegseth transmitted over Signal was, in fact, classified at the time.</p><p>Instead, the inspector general points out that, as secretary of defence, Hegseth has the right to determine the classification level of military intelligence and could have declassified the information if he decided to do so.</p><p>Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for Hegseth’s office, described that finding as a victory for the embattled defence secretary, who has long denied that <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/pete-hegseth-says-signal-chat-had-no-war-plans-hes-wrong-say-experts\">“war plans” were shared</a> over the messaging app.</p><p>“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared,” Parnell wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/1996367776089571829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”</p><p>Parnell also took the media to task for highlighting the risks the information posed to US military members.</p><p>“There is zero evidence that supports this conclusion. None,” Parnell <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellUSA/status/1996358373978304864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response to a New York Times post that raised the potential dangers.</p><p>On the contrary, Parnell argued, the “flawless execution &amp; success of Operation Rough Rider” – the name of the Yemen bombing campaign – was evidence that no troops were put in harm’s way.</p><p>President Trump himself has previously called the fallout from the scandal <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/trump-calls-signal-chat-fallout-a-witch-hunt-amid-calls-for-probe\">a “witch-hunt”</a> and questioned whether Signal itself was not “defective”.</p><p>Administration officials <a href=\"/news/2025/3/31/white-house-dismisses-investigation-calls-says-case-closed-on-signalgate\">have repeatedly called</a> for the scandal, dubbed Signalgate, to be “case closed”.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>United States President Donald Trump has announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on car makers to control pollution from petrol-powered cars and trucks.</p><p>The plan was announced on Wednesday. If finalised next year, it would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon (3.8 litres) of petrol, through the 2031 model year.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of petrol vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles (65.5km) per gallon in the 2031 model year. That frees up car makers to produce larger vehicles like sports utility vehicles, which are more profitable than smaller cars.</p><p>The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse policies from the era of former Democratic President Joe Biden that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles (EVs). Burning petrol for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and in the US, it is the largest contributor.</p><p>Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest US automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.</p><p>Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.</p><h2 id=\"split-response\">Split response</h2><p>Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense”.</p><p>“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.</p><p>Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real-world market conditions”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Environmentalists decried the decision.</p><p>“In one stroke, Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p>“Gutting the [petrol-mileage] programme will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’’ said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All programme.</p><p>“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Major carmakers will save more than $35bn in technology costs through 2031 under a broad rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards, the Trump administration said.</p><p>General Motors would save $8.7bn from 2027 through 2031, while Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis would each save more than $5bn, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said. Hyundai would save $4.6bn, Subaru $3.8bn, and Toyota $2.3bn, it said.</p><p>But at the same time, fuel costs for drivers are expected to soar, and US drivers are expected to pay up to $185bn more through 2050, the NHTSA reported.</p><h2 id=\"false-ev-claims\">False EV claims</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate”, referring incorrectly to  Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8 percent of new vehicle sales in the US in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.</p><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included the use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on petrol. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.</p><p>Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81km) per gallon of petrol for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63km) per gallon today.</p><p>The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2 percent each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2 percent per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.</p><p>The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of petrol from being burned by 2050, according to the NHTSA’s 2024 calculations.</p><p>Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tonnes of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tonnes a year of deadly soot particles and more than 4,870 tonnes a year of smog components – nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons – going into the air in the coming years.</p><p>Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.</p><p>The proposal must undergo public comments over a 45-day period before it can be finalised.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That way, we also can make sure the games [and] other experiences are safe and secure,” he told reporters.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, Trump had launched an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">anti-immigrant tirade</a>, calling Somali people in the US “garbage”.</p><p>Al Jazeera asked Giuliani about Trump’s rhetoric and how it may clash with the message of unity that US officials are emphasising around the World Cup.</p><p>“The president has a unique style. I think it’s why he’s such an effective leader, to be perfectly honest, and I think it’s why he actually is the consummate host for this incredible World Cup that is going to be the largest in human history,” Giuliani said.</p><p>He went on to suggest that Trump’s <a href=\"/#flips-6385900455112:0\">bigoted approach</a> was a form of honesty.</p><p>“In terms of the president’s rhetoric, he’s unique in that regard. He’s a New Yorker like me. Sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians,” Giuliani said.</p><p>“But I think that’s also why he’s been able to actually really get to the hearts of so many Americans – because he is completely honest with them.”</p><p>Norona, however, said Trump’s comments send a “discriminatory” and “racist” message.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s style; it’s a deliberate choice of words,” he added. “It’s something that should be reprehensible for everyone.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857165\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857165\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-14T061845Z_853158429_RC2SLFAY2NQQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1753462505.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C586&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump looks at the golden glove trophy next to FIFA president Gianni Infantino after Chelsea won against Paris St Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trump looks at the golden glove trophy next to FIFA president Gianni Infantino after Chelsea won against Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 13 [Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fifa-pace-prize\">FIFA Pace Prize</h2><p>Trump has been showing ample interest in the World Cup and football generally.
