Enough. The game is over.”</p><p>Mousavi told state forces to “put down your guns and step aside from power so that the nation itself can bring this land to freedom and prosperity”, and stressed that this must be done without foreign intervention amid the shadow of another war with the US and Israel.</p><p>He said that Iran is need of a constitutional referendum and a peaceful, democratic transition of power.</p><p>A group of 400 activists, including figures from inside and outside the country, backed Mousavi’s statement.</p><p>Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent jailed former reformist politician, said that he wants Iran to “move beyond the wretched conditions that the guardianship of Islamic jurists and the failed rule of the clergy have imposed on the Iranian nation”.</p><p>In a short statement from prison last week, he said this would be contingent upon the “resistance, wisdom, and responsible action of all citizens and political actors” and called for an independent fact-finding mission to uncover the true aspects of “atrocities” committed against protesters last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"major-reforms\">‘Major reforms’</h2><p>Other former heavyweights have heavily criticised Iran’s current course, but have avoided calling for the effective removal of the Islamic Republic from power.</p><p>Former President Hassan Rouhani, who many believe is eyeing a potential future return to power, last week gathered his ex-ministers and insiders for a recorded speech, and called for “major reforms, not small reforms”.</p><p>He acknowledged that Iranians have been protesting for a variety of reasons over the past four decades, and insisted the state must listen to them if it wants to survive, but did not mention the internet blackout and <a href=\"/news/2019/11/24/iran-vows-to-punish-mercenaries-behind-deadly-demonstrations\">killing of protesters</a> during his tenure in November 2019.</p><p>Rouhani added that the establishment must hold public votes on major topics, including foreign policy and the ailing economy, in order to avoid further nationwide protests and prevent the population from looking to foreign powers for help.</p><p>Mohammad Khatami, the reformist cleric who was president from 1997 to 2005, adopted a softer tone and said violence derailed protests that could have helped “expand dialogue to improve the country’s affairs”.</p><p>He wrote in a statement that Iran must “return to a forgotten republicanism, and an Islamism that embraces republicanism in all its dimensions and requirements, placing development together with justice at the core of both foreign and domestic policy”.</p><p>Mehdi Karroubi, another senior reformist cleric who had his house arrest lifted less than a year ago after 15 years, called the protest killings “a crime whose dimensions language and pen are incapable of conveying” and said the establishment is responsible.</p><p>“The wretched state of Iran today is the direct result of Mr. Khamenei’s destructive domestic and international interventions and policies,” he wrote, in reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been in absolute power for nearly 37 years.</p><p>Karroubi noted one prominent example as the 86-year-old leader’s “insistence on the costly and futile <a href=\"/video/talk-to-al-jazeera/2025/6/19/iaea-chief-no-evidence-iran-is-building-a-nuclear-weapon\">nuclear project</a> and the heavy consequences of sanctions over the past two decades for the country and its people”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1976595\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1976595\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1976595\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP19263774605662.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C571&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iran US timeline\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1976595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 [File: Frank Franklin II/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"political-prisoners-rearrested\">Political prisoners rearrested</h2><p>Three prominent Iranian former political prisoners were arrested and taken to prison by security forces once again last week.</p><p>The Fars news agency, affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said the reason for the arrests of Mehdi Mahmoudian, Abdollah Momeni, and Vida Rabbani was that they had sneaked out Mir Hossein Mousavi’s statement from his house arrest.</p><p>Mahmoudian is a journalist and activist, and co-writer of the Oscar-nominated political drama movie, It Was Just an Accident, which won the Palme d’Or at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. Momeni and Rabani are also political activists who have previously been arrested by the Iranian establishment multiple times.</p><p>The three were among 17 human rights defenders, filmmakers and civil society activists, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi and internationally recognised lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who co-signed a statement last week that put the blame for the protest killings on the supreme leader and the theocratic establishment.</p><p>“The mass killing of justice seekers who courageously protested this illegitimate system was an organised state crime against humanity,” they wrote, condemning the firing on civilians, the attacks on the wounded, and the denial of medical care as “acts against Iran’s security and betrayal of the homeland”.</p><p>The activists called for holding a referendum and constituent assembly to allow Iranians to democratically decide their political future.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hardliners-incensed\">Hardliners incensed</h2><p>In hardline-dominated circles and among their affiliated media, the mood has been entirely different.</p><p>On Sunday, lawmakers in parliament donned the uniforms of the IRGC, which was last week designated a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-slams-selective-outrage-after-eu-labels-irgc-a-terrorist-group\">“terrorist” organisation</a> by the European Union.</p><p>They chanted “Death to America” and promised they would seek out European military attaches working at embassies in Tehran to expel them as “terrorists”.</p><p>Nasrollah Pejmanfar, a cleric who represents northeast Mashhad in the parliament, told a public session of parliament on Sunday that former President Rouhani must be hanged for favouring engagement with the West, echoing a demand also made by other hardline peers in recent years.</p><p>“Today is the time for the ‘major reform’, which is arresting and executing you,” he said, addressing Rouhani.</p><p>Amirhossein Sabeti, another firebrand lawmaker, condemned the government of President Masoud Pezeshkian – but not Khamenei or the establishment – for proceeding with mediated talks with the US.</p><p>“Today, the people of Iran are waiting for a pre-emptive attack on Israel and US bases in the region, not talks from a position of weakness,” he claimed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The stock was up 2.1 percent from the market open in midday trading.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Walmart, which has 11,000 stores in 19 countries, joins a slate of nine corporate giants in the so-called trillion dollar club, including Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, among others. Amazon is the only other retailer that has broken the barrier and is now valued at $2.6 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"trade-deal-bump\">Trade deal bump</h2><p>On Monday, United States President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India that would slash tariffs to 18 percent from 50 percent and that impacts Walmart, which has strategically shifted supply chain operations to India and away from China.</p><p>On Tuesday, in an interview with CNBC, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the White House is still ironing out the details of the deal, but that still hasn’t slowed Walmart’s stock from <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popping on the looming deal</a>.</p><p>“We have an announcement of an India deal, but still no timeline about when it comes into effect and whether the secondary tariffs, the 25 percent linked to India’s purchase of Russian oil, when those would be removed, so I think there’s still a lot of questions,” economist Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While there are limited details on the specifics of the deal, markets are responding to tariffs likely to come down.</p><p>“Markets are, of course, forward-looking. I think this sort of reinforces a view in the marketplace that incremental tariffs will be less this year,” Ziemba said.</p><p>The big box retailer jumped from 2 percent of its global exports coming from India in 2018 to 25 percent in 2023, according to a Reuters review of import data in 2023. Walmart hopes to source $10bn in goods from India by next year.</p><p>At the time, the company also decreased its percentage of goods from China to 60 percent from 80 percent.</p><p>Walmart did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), a lobby for exporters, said the cut in US tariffs will significantly boost Indian exports, including textiles and apparel, putting them on par with Asian peers, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.</p><p>According to data from ImportYeti, a platform that tracks import contracts for major companies, Walmart’s biggest import areas are in home fabrics, apparel and toys.</p><p>“Those are the products facing the highest tariffs, while consumer electronics and other categories have largely been shielded. If the India–US deal becomes a reality, it would put tariffs on Indian goods entering the US at roughly the same level as those from Southeast Asia, making that supply-chain realignment more attractive. You also highlight the importance of the Indian market,” Ziemba added.</p><p>While the trade deal is in focus, Walmart has also invested significantly in India domestically, as well, and holds an 80 percent stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart.</p><h2 id=\"c-suite-changes\">C-suite changes</h2><p>The surge also comes concurrently with a shake-up in the C-suite. On Monday, John Furner took over as Walmart’s chief executive, succeeding longtime CEO Doug McMillion who announced his retirement late last year.</p><p>Furner, who started at the company in a job stocking shelves, has climbed up the ladder. Most recently, he served as the CEO of Walmart US, where he focused on key initiatives driving growth, including curbside pick-up. Prior to that, he served as the CEO of Sam’s Club, Walmart’s wholesale chain.</p><p>Furner’s appointment comes as the company grows as an e-commerce giant and intends to double down in AI tech, healthcare services, e-commerce, and hybrid options with its brick-and-mortar footprint.</p><p>“As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members,” Walmart said in a statement last month.</p><p>“Walmart is masterful at brick-and-mortar retail and remains highly competitive with Amazon. I love that because it shows consumerism is still alive and well. Five years ago, the narrative was the fall of the mall and the decline of retail. This confirms the opposite. Walmart also has a clear strategy for retaining consumers and managing the customer experience,” Brett Rose, CEO and founder of United National Consumer Suppliers (UNCS), a distributor that focuses on excess inventories, which it provides to more budget-friendly retailers, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The tech-centric focus comes as e-commerce has grown for the company, which reported a 28 percent jump in e-commerce sales compared with the previous quarter. Walmart is slated to release its next earnings report on February 19.</p><p>“What you need to look at is that Walmart has successfully become a marketplace, not as big as Amazon, but big enough to give it a run for its money,” said Rose.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The fall of its ally in Syria, <a href=\"/news/2024/12/8/syrias-bashar-al-assad-the-president-who-lost-his-homeland\">the al-Assad regime</a>, less than two weeks later, cut off a crucial land supply route used to transport financing and weapons from Iran.</p><p>The ceasefire stipulated that both Hezbollah and Israel would cease their attacks, Hezbollah would pull back its forces from south of the Litani River that runs across south Lebanon, and Israel would withdraw its forces from its northern neighbour.</p><p>But Israel has not stopped attacking Lebanon, and it continues to occupy five points in southern Lebanon. Other issues that are of importance to Hezbollah and the Lebanese state include the fate of Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails and reconstruction, which Israel has prevented through the repeated targeting of construction equipment.</p><p>Still, Hezbollah has only attacked Israel once since November 2024. The lone strike was in December 2024, when Hezbollah responded to repeated Israeli attacks by firing at an Israeli military post. No one was harmed, but Israel responded to that attack by killing 11 people in Lebanon.</p><p>In the months since, Israel has killed more than 330 people in Lebanon, including at least 127 civilians, and a top Hezbollah commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Haytham Ali Tabatabai</a>.</p><p>“Hezbollah committed to the ceasefire in order to give the Lebanese state, government, and army the opportunity to implement the ceasefire and achieve demands through diplomatic means, as promised by the President of the Republic [Joseph Aoun],” Kassir said. “Furthermore, it wants to take the time to rebuild and allow people to return to their villages and homes.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-position-to-respond\">‘No position to respond’</h2><p>For years, Hezbollah’s military capacity acted as a deterrent to Israeli aggression. But that changed after the last war.</p><p>Analysts said that should Hezbollah respond, it would likely incur the wrath of Israel’s military, bringing back a scale of violence that displaced more than 1.2 million people and killed thousands.</p><p>“Hezbollah is simply in no position today to respond to Israel,” Lebanese political analyst Karim Emile Bitar told Al Jazeera. “Any retaliation from Lebanon would provoke an uproar in the domestic political arena, and it is also likely to be highly ineffective from a military standpoint. The party is simply too weak to enter into such an endeavour.”</p><p>“Israel has changed the rules of engagement through deep intelligence penetration, cyber-enabled targeting, AI-assisted surveillance, and precision strikes that degrade command, logistics, and leadership,” Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is, however, one scenario that might force Hezbollah’s hand, analysts said. <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/iranian-official-says-progress-made-on-talks-as-us-iran-tensions-persist\">An attack on Iran</a>, Hezbollah’s longtime benefactor, could kick the group into action.</p><p>On January 26, Hezbollah’s leader Naim Qassem delivered a televised speech addressing his party’s position on US threats to attack Iran.</p><p>“We are determined to defend ourselves,” Qassem said. “We will choose in due course how to act.”</p><p>Hezbollah is a notoriously secretive group. And following a war where the group felt exposed by Israeli intelligence, their secretiveness has likely intensified. Still, reports in local media and some analysts have spoken about a potential divide in the group over its position vis-a-vis Iran, and how disarmament should proceed, if at all.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-s-survival\">Iran’s survival</h2><p>With that in mind, some members of Hezbollah may view the survival of the Iranian government as existential and push them to attack the US’s most fervent regional ally, Israel.</p><p>“The only scenario in which [Hezbollah may attack Israel] is if there is a genuine, clear and present existential danger to the very survival of the Iranian regime and if the Iranian regime orders all its regional proxies to go all in,” Bitar said. “Otherwise, I think Hezbollah is most likely to stay out of it.”</p><p>Salamey said that only a “dramatic external shock” like a regional war including Iran would draw in the group. Otherwise, any response “would likely require a clear crossing of red lines that directly threaten Hezbollah’s core survival, not symbolic or tactical losses.”</p><p>Still, he said, “any response would likely be limited, calibrated, and asymmetric, aimed at signalling relevance rather than triggering full-scale war. Hezbollah currently lacks the strategic confidence, logistical depth, and political cover needed for broad escalation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Growing tensions between the United States and Iran have left the two countries one spark away from a fire. An unprecedented accumulation of US military forces in the Middle East, coupled with Washington’s reliance on gunboat diplomacy, has distinctly increased the risk of war—one that engulfs Iran and the region, with far-reaching regional and global costs.</p><p>In the aftermath of the recent crackdown on protests in Iran, US President Donald Trump announced that it was time to remove Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His administration then deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and supporting warplanes, along with various air defence assets—including additional THAAD and Patriot missile systems—across the Middle East.</p><p>As military assets have been accumulated, Trump has threatened that if Iran does not agree to a deal, “the next attack will be far worse” than last June’s US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>From the US perspective, a favourable agreement would require Iran to demolish its nuclear enrichment programme and ballistic missile capabilities, while also pulling back its regional influence. Such maximum demands, combined with Tehran’s deep distrust of negotiations with the US, make a deal highly unlikely. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, clarified on Monday that civilian nuclear capability, as well as missile and drone capabilities, represent a “red line” for Tehran.</p><p>This does not necessarily signal a permanent diplomatic stalemate. However, Tehran interprets the US’s maximum demands as a potential threat of regime change—a notion repeatedly emphasised by Trump and hawks in Washington and Tel Aviv. In this context, another US strike would represent an “existential threat” to the Islamic Republic, eliminating any incentive for restraint.</p><p>The impact of any US military action against Iran would principally depend on the attack’s type, scale, and targets, potentially triggering a severe crisis in Iran, across the region, and globally.</p><p>Trump favours surgical and targeted military operations, which would probably combine leadership decapitation with efforts to significantly damage Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) military bases, Basij units—a paramilitary force under IRGC control—and police stations, which the US designates as responsible for firing on demonstrators.</p><p>Any US effort to impose regime change through military means would undoubtedly lead to dangerous outcomes domestically and regionally. In Iran, an attack could lead to the consolidation of power. But it could also lead to a full takeover by the IRGC or even internal conflict.</p><p>An attack on Iran similar to the one last year could well result in the Iranian people rallying behind the flag and rejecting regime change for several reasons. First, the Iranian people are afraid of a scenario similar to Syria and Libya where there is state collapse. Second, there is no credible moderate opposition that can lead change. Third, there is strong sociopolitical cohesion within Iran.</p><p>Political institutions, the military, and the IRGC are well-organised and benefit from substantial resources generated by a sanctions-induced rentier system. Moreover, significant segments of society—particularly the working-class groups often referred to as “revolutionaries”—are aligned with this structure.</p><p>If the attack is successful in targeting senior leadership of the Islamic Republic, this could bring about a succession crisis, create decision-making vacuums, and deepen competition within the regime. Under these circumstances, tensions between state institutions and military-security entities would grow. Given the concentration of hard power in the hands of the IRGC, the probability of establishing a military-dominated state would expand.</p><p>The US and Israel may also try to encourage the outbreak of civil war to geopolitically weaken Iran. Last month, there were calls from some US officials, such as Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, to arm Iranian protesters. That could easily extend to armed groups, and there are a number of those that have clashed with the Iranian authorities that the US can turn to.</p><p>Among them are the <a href=\"/news/2023/6/21/why-was-this-iran-dissident-group-raided-in-europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mojahedin-e Khalq</a> (MEK), formerly designated as a “terrorist” organisation by the US and the European Union (EU); the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), an armed Kurdish group looking for the secession of Iran’s western Kurdistan province; <a href=\"/news/2018/9/22/iran-who-was-responsible-for-the-deadly-attack-in-ahvaz\">Al-Ahwaziya</a>, an Arab nationalist movement supporting the separation of the oil-rich Khuzestan province in the southwest; <a href=\"/news/2019/2/16/iran-warns-pakistan-to-crack-down-on-jaish-al-adl\">Jaish al-Adl</a> (Jundallah), an armed group operating in southeastern Iran; and pan-Turkic groups in the northwest chasing the alliance of Turkic populations across Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Iran.</p><p>Facing Washington’s continuing escalatory rhetoric and track record of regime change operations, Iran has adopted a so-called madman strategy, simultaneously issuing conciliatory and confrontational signals. This posture is apparent in Tehran’s expressed openness to establishing a framework of negotiations with the US, alongside Khamenei’s speech on Monday, which <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">warned</a> that any military attack on Iran would cause a “regional war”, underscoring the state’s prevailing priority of thwarting regime change at any cost—even at the risk of regional and global consequences.</p><p>Iran has made clear that it will retaliate, including through allied forces in the region, potentially drawing Israel and Gulf states into a broader regional skirmish. This would trigger political instability and economic vulnerability, which in turn may prompt substantial capital flight, chiefly from the Gulf states, as well as increasing flows of refugees and migrants to Europe.</p><p>Moreover, if Iran attacks shipping in the Strait of Hormuz or Gulf energy infrastructure, there would be a spike in global oil and gas prices, exacerbating market volatility, inflationary pressure from higher energy costs, and a knock-on effect for fragile economies, which would further worsen migration pressures.</p><p>In the current situation, any US military escalation poses a risk not just for Iran but for the whole region. Middle Eastern history demonstrates that once a conflict is triggered, it spreads like a wildfire, destabilising the whole region in unpredictable ways.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2026/1/31/iranian-official-says-progress-made-on-talks-as-us-iran-tensions-persist\">pushing Iran to agree</a> to talks over the country’s nuclear programme, sent the USS Abraham Lincoln towards Iran last week, fuelling fears of a possible military confrontation.</p><p>But amid days of diplomatic efforts, Iranian President <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/iran-eyes-progress-towards-us-nuclear-talks-as-tension-eases\">Masoud Pezeshkian said on Tuesday</a> that he had instructed the country’s foreign minister to “pursue fair and equitable negotiations”.</p><p>“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists – one free from threats and unreasonable expectations – to pursue fair and equitable negotiations, guided by the principles of dignity, prudence, and expediency,” he wrote on social media.</p><p>“These negotiations shall be conducted within the framework of our national interests,” Pezeshkian added.</p><p>The downing of the drone did not appear to alter plans for the talks, which are expected to take place on Friday.</p><p>Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson as saying consultations were underway to select a venue for the meeting, with Turkiye, Oman and several other countries in the region having offered to host.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News earlier on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, “is set to have conversations with the Iranians later this week”.</p><p>“Those are still scheduled as of right now,” Leavitt said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Iranian officials have repeatedly said they are <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-says-ready-for-fair-talks-with-us-but-not-under-shadow-of-threats\">open to nuclear talks</a>, but only if the Trump administration ends its threats against the country.</p><p>Reporting from the Iranian capital Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said the exact topics that will be up for discussion between the two sides remain unclear.</p><p>Iranian officials have said they want the negotiations to focus on the country’s nuclear programme, while Washington reportedly wants to discuss a range of issues, including Iran’s ties to regional armed groups as well as its ballistic missile and defence programmes.</p><p>Tehran also has said it wants the talks to be bilateral – with Washington alone – while the US has shown more willingness to include other regional powers, Asadi added.</p><p>“[Iran] is saying it is appreciative of regional efforts to [bring] down [tensions] while the major issue remains to be solved between Washington and Tehran,” he said.</p><p><span>In a separate incident on Tuesday, CENTCOM accused Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces of harassing a US-flagged and US-crewed merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, a Gulf waterway that is <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\">critical to global trade</a>.</span></p><p>“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” said Hawkins, the CENTCOM spokesman.</p><p>Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency cited unnamed Iranian officials as saying later in the day that a vessel had entered Iranian territorial waters without the necessary legal permits.</p><p>The officials said the vessel was warned and left the area “without any special security event taking place”.<i></i></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Violence is ongoing elsewhere – from Myanmar’s civil war to conflict in Nigeria. Drone attacks targeting noncombatants have become commonplace in Ukraine while massacres of civilians across multiple conflicts continue, including in Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Yemen – all with apparent impunity.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The United States, historically the self-appointed world’s police officer, is <a href=\"/news/2025/3/16/is-trump-the-end-of-the-international-rules-based-order\">in retreat</a> and unwilling to uphold the humanitarian laws that for decades have provided some protection for civilians trapped in conflicts. That has left those laws under unprecedented strain around the world, the <a href=\"https://geneva-academy.ch/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WarWATCH-IHL-in-Focus-Report-2024-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> of 23 of the world’s conflicts conducted by the academy concluded.</p><p>“The years 2024 and 2025 proved devastating to civilians with little evidence of willingness among warring parties to limit the barbarity inflicted upon the most vulnerable,” begins the report, War Watch, which tracked breaches of international humanitarian law in the conflicts from July 2024 to December.</p><p>The Geneva academy is a joint initiative of the University of Geneva’s Faculty of Law and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies.</p><p>“Murder, torture, and rape were widespread; civilians and their homes, schools, and hospitals were bombed regularly and sometimes systematically. Genocide – the intended destruction of a protected national, ethnic, religious, or racial group – was found by a United Nations Commission of Inquiry to have been perpetrated against Palestinians in Gaza by Israel. In October 2025, the spectre of genocide was revived in Sudan,” it said in the report, released on Monday, adding that while the threat to international humanitarian law was not yet existential, “it is at a critical breaking point.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"few-consequences\">Few consequences</h2><p>The academy’s report cast the world in an unforgiving light. Over the reporting period, civilians were abused, dispossessed and slaughtered on an almost industrial scale, it said.</p><p>Beyond Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, the research noted the ongoing carnage of Russia’s war in Ukraine, where the killing of civilians is escalating as the conflict grinds on and more people have been killed in the past year than during the conflict’s previous two years.</p><p>Rape and gender-based and sexual violence have been documented across a series of conflicts, from Sudan, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/massacre-in-el-fasher-whats-happening-in-sudan-right-now\">accused</a> of massacring civilians in the western city of el-Fasher, to what the report called the “epidemic” of rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p>Drone attacks against civilians have become a defining feature in multiple conflicts while, in Myanmar, the military government was accused of continuing to attack civilians. In one village, the report noted, residents who had fled returned to find that the few neighbours who remained behind had been dismembered and their heads placed upon a fence.</p><p>All appeared to be taking place with few consequences for the perpetrators.</p><p>“If you don’t sanction or communicate that there will be a sanction, illegal acts will continue,” the report’s lead author, Stuart Casey-Maslen, told Al Jazeera. “Genocide isn’t new. We saw evidence of genocide in [Sudan’s] Darfur around 2004, but as one of the UN experts that helped launch the report pointed out, extermination is ongoing in multiple areas of Sudan. We’re seeing gang rape being carried out by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the street with impunity, and the US, which could bring pressure on the UAE [which is accused of but denies arming the RSF] isn’t acting.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"decline\">Decline</h2><p>The strain upon international humanitarian law is not the fault of the US alone, Casey-Maslen said,  Equally responsible were other actors, such as Russia, whose disregard for humanitarian law in Ukraine, the report’s authors said, has become almost systematic.</p><p>However, few would doubt that the US’s unquestioning support for Israel in its war on Gaza has gone a long way to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-is-the-rules-based-order-finished\">undermining</a> the principles of the humanitarian law it had historically claimed to champion.</p><p>Through two years of unremitting war, Israel has been accused of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/israeli-attacks-wound-civilians-across-gaza-in-latest-ceasefire-violations\">targetting civilians</a> and engaging in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/what-we-know-about-the-torture-abuse-of-palestinian-prisoners-by-israel\">torture</a>, including <a href=\"/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">rape</a>, and the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/israel-accepts-gazas-70000-death-toll-a-record-of-denialism-lies\">slaughter</a> of civilians, all with US support.</p><p>“It has been obvious for some time that international humanitarian law has been dying in front of us,” said Geoffrey Nice, a human rights lawyer and former lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. “There has been a time lag between those with prescience but no official responsibility pointing this out and governments with responsibility explaining it to their voters, but here we are.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s second term in office has made observers particularly worried about the future of international law as his administration makes clear it is willing to ignore key aspects of it and carry out acts that are at best dubious under international law, such as the <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\">abduction</a> of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>And according to Nice, Trump’s policy was already clear from his first term in office.</p><p>“For those paying attention, the first real sign was Trump’s speech to the UN during his first term when [in 2018] he <a href=\"/news/2018/6/20/us-withdrawal-from-un-human-rights-council-what-you-need-to-know\">withdrew</a> from the Human Rights Council and expounded on a theme of sovereignty that seemed to evoke a kind of Westphalian world,” he said, referring to the principle in international relations in which each state retains absolute sovereignty over their own territory.</p><p>In the wake of his attack on Venezuela in early January, Trump went further still, telling The New York Times that the only constraint upon him was, not international law, but his “own morality”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h2><p>Richard Gowan, the International Crisis Group’s programme director, said the report aligns closely with his organisation’s reporting from various warzones.</p><p>”Tragically, we see a growing number of armed groups targeting civilians in the knowledge that they are unlikely to face real political or legal penalties.</p><p>“There is a widespread sense that the laws of war are breaking down, and this is likely to lead to a vicious cycle in which combatants increasingly resort to atrocities to gain tactical or strategic advantage,” he said.</p><p>However, while international humanitarian law has been under unprecedented strain, its centre could still hold, Casey-Maslen suggested.</p><p>Organisations such as the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court still have a huge role to play in ensuring that the protections afforded civilians under humanitarian law are maintained as long as those organisations themselves are respected, funded and not regarded as a convenience.</p><p>Likewise, states that still cling to the idea of international law could still exert influence over how their allies behave, Casey-Maslen said, pointing to the relatively limited number of civilian deaths that Western-equipped Ukraine had been accused of causing in comparison with Russia. What is critical, he said, was to retain the value of international law for all.</p><p>“When we lose international law, everyone loses, ” he said. “The Global South typically pays in lives and blood, and the West loses any sense of moral authority. We all end up poorer as a result.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands of Palestinians were also killed during the Nakba.</p><p>Shakir said the report documented how the denial of return “amounts to a crime against humanity”.</p><p>He said he had been told that Executive Director Philippe Bolopion, who took the helm of HRW late last year, was worried the report would be misread by “detractors” as a call to “demographically extinguish the Jewishness of the Israeli state”, according to his resignation letter seen by Al Jazeera and dated January 15.</p><p>Shakir wrote: “Through this process, I have lost my faith in the integrity of how we do our work and our commitment to principled reporting on the facts and application of the law.”</p><p>The report was slated to be published on December 4 and had been given the greenlight by others in HRW during an internal review, Shakir said.</p><p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, HRW said it had received the resignations of two people working on Israel-Palestine after “a decision to pause the publication of a draft report on the right of return of Palestinian refugees”.</p><p>“The report in question raised complex and consequential issues. In our review process, we concluded that aspects of the research and the factual basis for our legal conclusions needed to be strengthened to meet Human Rights Watch’s high standards,” the group said.</p><p>“For that reason, the publication of the report was paused pending further analysis and research. This process is ongoing.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"acts-of-genocide-in-gaza\">‘Acts of genocide’ in Gaza</h2><p>In his letter, Shakir said he has received criticism from those in Israel as well as Palestine throughout his time at HRW.</p><p>“My strongest defense has been saying with full conviction that we hold our Israel/Palestine work to the same standard as the other 100 countries we cover,” he wrote.</p><p>But his stint had its challenges, he added.</p><p>“At times, some in the organization, driven by bias, pressure, politics or cowardice, have tried to manipulate our findings on Israel/Palestine to arrive at their preferred outcomes, but, throughout my tenure, the review process ensured we published the facts as we documented them and the findings that derived from our principled and consistent application of the law.”</p><p>At HRW, Shakir investigated rights abuses in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza and documented how Israel instituted an apartheid system and persecuted Palestinians.</p><p>In 2019, the Israeli government <a href=\"/news/2019/11/5/israels-top-court-upholds-deportation-of-senior-hrw-official\">deported him</a> due to his advocacy.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a report</a> in late 2024, HRW said Israel had “deliberately inflicted conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the population in Gaza by intentionally depriving Palestinian civilians there of adequate access to water, most likely resulting in thousands of deaths”.</p><p>That, the group said at the time, made the Israeli authorities “responsible for the crime against humanity of extermination and for acts of genocide”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

make the death penalty “another discriminatory tool in Israel’s system of apartheid”, Amnesty International said.</p><p>“These amendments mean that the most extreme and irrevocable punishment is being reserved for, and weaponised against, Palestinians,” it said.</p><p>“If adopted, these bills would distance Israel from the vast majority of states which have rejected the death penalty in law or in practice, while further entrenching its cruel system of apartheid against all Palestinians whose rights Israel controls.”</p><p>Israeli authorities have defended the measures, which are moving to committee stages for debate, as a necessary deterrent against deadly attacks.</p><p>But legal experts said their scope and application would violate international legal norms and result in the unjust

and the occupied Palestinian Territory” while weakening safeguards designed to prevent miscarriages of justice.</p><p>The bills include one that would allow for the application of the death penalty by amending the Israeli Penal Law and the Defence Regulations that Israel applies to the West Bank, the group said.</p><p>A second would introduce special provisions and an ad hoc military court to prosecute those accused of involvement in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>The rights group said proposed amendments to military laws applicable in the West Bank that

But the country’s inclusion in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, represents a huge step for the Azzurri.</p><p>Italy’s success at the European qualification last July, in which they finished second to the Netherlands, guaranteed a World Cup debut. Their 12-run victory over Scotland secured their progression and stunned the cricket world; Scotland, one of the most successful second-tier nations, were expected to finish in the top two.</p><p>A standout performance by allrounder Harry Manenti, who scored a run-a-ball 38 and took five wickets, and a 21-ball 50 from Emilio Gay, absent from the current squad through injury, turned the tournament on its head. Italy qualified through a superior net run rate, although <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/24/bangladesh-out-of-t20-world-cup-after-iccs-refusal-to-change-venues\">Bangladesh’s late withdrawal</a> from the T20 World Cup handed Scotland a last-minute berth.</p><p>Italy join Scotland, Nepal, West Indies and England in Group C of the 16-team tournament, with the top two progressing to the Super Eight phase. Their coach, former Ireland international Kevin O’Brien, has set his sights on reaching the knockout stage and was encouraged by the team’s performance in a pre-tournament tri-series against Ireland and the Netherlands in Dubai.</p><p>“We’re targeting to win games and, ultimately, want to qualify from the group,” said O’Brien. “We’ve got a very experienced squad, maybe not necessarily at World Cups, but we’ve certainly got players who have been playing professional cricket for numerous years.</p><p>“On our day, we can compete with any of the four other teams in our group. We beat Ireland in a T20 chasing 157, so that gives us a lot of confidence.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4285450\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4285450\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285450\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2227960210-1770121230.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C491&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wayne Madsen in action.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4285450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wayne Madsen, who also plays for Derbyshire and the London Spirit in the UK, is the captain of the Italy national team [File: Adam Davy/PA Images via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-s-in-italy-s-squad\">Who’s in Italy’s squad?</h2><p>The 15-player squad is a mixture of five “home-base” players and others drawn from Australia, South Africa and England who qualify as Italian through relatives. None were born in Italy, although several hold Italian passports.</p><p>There are two sets of Australian brothers: Harry and Ben Manenti, and Justin and Anthony Mosca. Both Manenti brothers have played in Australia’s Big Bash League, and Ben played in South Australia’s title-winning Sheffield Shield team last season.</p><p>Other notable names include 37-year-old former South Africa international, JJ Smuts, who recently qualified through his wife’s heritage. A regular on the T20 franchise circuit, the explosive top-order batter and handy left-arm orthodox spinner is expected to lead the way with both bat and ball.</p><p>The captain is 42-year-old Wayne Madsen, a South African-born batter who moved to England and is currently the Derbyshire club captain, armed with the experience of 253 first-class appearances. Grant Stewart, originally from Australia, is another experienced professional in English domestic cricket, where he plays for Kent.</p><p>Aside from Kalugamage, who is now a leg spinner, there are four home base players. Zain Ali is a towering all-rounder who was born in Pakistan and moved to Italy with his family as a two-year-old. Hassan Ali and Syed Naqvi also have Pakistani roots, while Jaspreet Singh was born in India and raised in Italy.</p><p>Rounding out the squad are Marcus Campopiano, who hails from England, South African-born Gian Piero Meade and England-based Australian player Thomas Draca.</p><h2 id=\"the-authenticity-issue\">The authenticity issue</h2><p>There will undoubtedly be questions about whether a side fielding several players who have played much of their cricket in other countries can truly be considered Italian, or if their inclusion is helping Italian cricket grow in any meaningful way.</p><p>O’Brien is adamant that the team identity is based firmly around Italian culture.</p><p>“Before the qualifiers, they spoke about why they’re playing for Italy,” said O’Brien. “A lot of the players have a deep connection to the country through parents or grandparents, a lot of them certainly when it comes to Italian culture. The home-based players all speak Italian fluently, three or four of the non-Italian-based players speak it fluently. It’s an important thing that we do, and something that brings the people, the players and the culture and cricketing history in Italy all together.”</p><p>O’Brien has experience of playing international cricket with players of mixed backgrounds, and he likens the current Italian squad to that of Ireland’s debut World Cup squad in 2007, which included several players from Australia and South Africa, although he acknowledges Ireland had a stronger domestic system.</p><p>“The difference is the club cricket. You’re not going to get somebody from Australia to come over and be a professional in one of the clubs in Milan or Rome, because the standard isn’t there at the moment.</p><p>“There’s a strong understanding and passion for cricket in Italy, and the Federation is getting into schools. They are making steps, trying to take cricket more into the grassroots level in Italy.</p><p>“Of course, it’s going to be difficult. But if you don’t take these baby steps, you’ll never know where the sport can get to, and World Cups, it’s gonna grow the interest. You might not see the results for 10 years or so, but this World Cup can be a huge springboard for cricket in the country.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4285393\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4285393\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285393\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/s2-1770120021.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Italy players in action\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4285393\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Italy have already signalled their intensions for the T20 World Cup, defeating Canada by 10 runs in Chennai, India, on Monday [Courtesy: International Cricket Council]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"chrishan-s-story\">Chrishan’s story</h2><p>Kalugamage’s journey highlights the importance of accessibility. After moving to a small town near Lucca, he turned to athletics in the absence of cricket and trained with Olympic gold medallist Marcell Jacobs, excelling in the long jump.</p><p>He discovered a local team before joining Roma Cricket Club, where he still plays, juggling cricket with 700-kilometre (435-mile) round trips from Lucca, where he works as a pizza chef.</p><p>“I lost a lot of jobs playing cricket in Italy, because I’m working in the restaurant,” said Kalugamage. “Sunday is the very busy day, so sometimes when I asked to leave to play cricket, they said ‘No, you can’t do it.’ But I leave my job, and I play cricket.”</p><p>Kalugamage’s development as an international leg spinner is remarkable considering Italian club cricket is played on a synthetic pitch typically used by junior and recreational players. O’Brien believes he could be a trump card for Italy with his quick leg breaks and googlies.</p><p>But Kalugamage also represents potential talent and passion. He cried with joy when Italy secured their qualification and says he has witnessed the sport’s growth in his adopted country.</p><p>“What we are actually thinking is that after the World Cup, it will be even bigger, and maybe a lot of young kids will be attracted by cricket and performances of our team.”</p><h2 id=\"world-cup-ambition\">World Cup ambition</h2><p>O’Brien knows what it’s like to shake up the established order. In 2011, he scored the then fastest World Cup century – off just 50 balls – in what was, at the time, the highest successful World Cup chase as Ireland defeated England.</p><p>“There’s a big similarity between where we are to where Irish cricket was in 2007, in terms of the strength of the teams. So there’s absolutely no reason why this Italian team can’t go into a group and win games and qualify for the Super Eight.”</p><p>For Kalugamage, who has never played in front of a large crowd, just making it to the world stage is a fulfilment of his childhood dreams.</p><p>“Il cricket e la mia vita,” he smiled when asked what the game means to him.</p><p>Cricket is my life.</p></div></div></body></html>"

While the conflict has ebbed and flowed over the decades, it has resurged sharply in recent years, in what analysts describe as an almost unprecedented phase.</p><p>The latest escalation unfolded on January 31, when <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/pakistani-forces-kill-145-fighters-in-balochistan-after-deadly-attacks\">coordinated attacks</a> were carried out in nearly a dozen cities across the province by secessionist groups seeking independence.</p><p>Led by the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">Baloch Liberation Army (BLA)</a>, the attackers killed more than 30 civilians and at least 18 law enforcement personnel. Following those attacks, during government operations lasting several hours, security forces said they killed more than 150 fighters.</p><p>A day later, Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister of the province, said in a television interview that the solution to Balochistan’s woes lay with the military rather than political dialogue.</p><p>But analysts say that the roots of the conflict – and some of the factors that keep it alive – lie in the final years of British rule in South Asia and the uncertain political geography preceding Pakistan’s independence.</p><h2 id=\"accession-to-pakistan-and-discontent\">Accession to Pakistan and discontent</h2><p>On the eve of partition, Balochistan was not a single political unit. Parts of the region were directly administered by the British as “Chief Commissioner’s Balochistan”, while the rest consisted of princely states including Kalat, Makran, Las Bela and Kharan, tied to the British Crown through treaties rather than colonial governance.</p><p>In 1947, the Khanate of Kalat was technically independent, a status initially recognised by Pakistan’s founder and first governor general, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</p><p>That position shifted as the strategic value of Balochistan’s coastline – a gateway to the Strait of Hormuz – became clear. Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, the khan of Kalat, agreed to accede to Pakistan on March 27, 1948.</p><p>His brother, Abdul Karim, rejected the deal and led a small band of fighters into Afghanistan, marking the first Baloch rebellion. It ended within months with his surrender.</p><p>The episode was seen among Baloch nationalists as a “forced accession” and laid the foundation for future resistance.</p><p>A pattern soon emerged. Political exclusion gave rise to armed resistance, followed by a military response, and then an uneasy and temporary calm – before the cycle would repeat itself.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"cycles-of-revolt\">Cycles of revolt</h2><p>The second major uprising began in 1958, triggered by Pakistan’s “One Unit” scheme, which dissolved provincial identities in West Pakistan into a single administrative entity.</p><p>Baloch leaders saw the move as an erosion of autonomy and demanded the release of Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, who had been arrested.</p><p>Nawab Nauroz Khan, a veteran tribal leader who had fought British rule, led an armed rebellion. It ended with his arrest and the execution of several associates after a military trial. Khan was also awarded the death sentence, but it was later commuted to a life sentence, and he eventually passed away in jail.</p><p>A third phase followed in the 1960s, driven by opposition to military rule in the province – at a time when Pakistan was ruled by its first military government, that of Ayub Khan – and demands for political rights, increasingly shaped by leftist ideas. Though limited, it reinforced the view that Balochistan’s relationship with the state was governed by force.</p><p>The most intense conflict erupted in the 1970s.</p><p>After the dismissal of the elected provincial government of Balochistan in 1973, led by the National Awami Party (NAP), a full-scale rebellion spread across large parts of the province.</p><p>The NAP and its leaders were accused by the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of the country, of a conspiracy hatched in London to allegedly help in the disintegration of Pakistan. The conspiracy was never proven.</p><p>But the party’s leaders, including then chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, were arrested. Thousands of Baloch fighters clashed with nearly 80,000 Pakistani troops, and thousands of people were killed.</p><p>The fighting ended in 1977 after General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in a coup and granted amnesty to Baloch fighters. Their core grievances, however, remained unresolved.</p><h2 id=\"the-tipping-point\">The tipping point</h2><p>A period of relative calm followed, but resentment persisted. Critics accused the state of exploiting Balochistan’s natural resources, such as gas reserves, while local communities remained deprived.</p><p>Several incidents highlighted what Baloch groups described as heavy-handed state tactics, leading to the fifth and current rebellion that began in the early 2000s.</p><p>One flashpoint was the 2005 rape of Shazia Khalid, a physician working for a state-run gas company, allegedly by an army captain. Pakistan was then ruled by General Pervez Musharraf, who had taken power in a 1999 coup.</p><p>The incident provoked massive local protests, which met lethal force, but the simmering tension exploded into a full-blown conflict in August 2006, when Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former chief minister of the province and a popular Baloch tribal chief, was killed in a military operation.</p><p>Bugti’s death turned him into the most powerful symbol of Baloch resistance, triggering a surge in anger and rebellion, alongside a growing belief among many Baloch that independence was the only path forward.</p><p>In recent years, protests have increasingly been led by younger, middle-class Baloch, with women playing a prominent role.</p><p>The state’s response has involved a vast security presence and tactics criticised by rights groups.</p><p>Activists accuse the government of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of ethnic Baloch suspected of supporting the rebellion. Many of the missing later turned up dead, often bearing signs of torture.</p><p>The government denies responsibility for the enforced disappearances and suggests that most of those who have gone missing have likely joined rebel armed groups, either in the mountains or across the border in Iran or Afghanistan.</p><h2 id=\"the-contemporary-rebellion\">The contemporary rebellion</h2><p>The ongoing rebellion has coincided with major shifts in Pakistan’s political economy.</p><p>Large-scale extraction of natural gas plans for deep-sea ports at Gwadar, excavation for minerals, and the launch of the $62bn China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have transformed Balochistan into a <a href=\"/news/2024/6/3/sharifs-beijing-trip-can-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-be-revived\">strategic focal point</a>.</p><p>For many Baloch groups, these projects represent extraction without benefit, leaving local communities marginalised.</p><p>Armed groups such as the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front frame their struggle as resistance to colonial-style exploitation and in pursuit of “national liberation”.</p><p>The Pakistani government has accused regional rival India of fomenting trouble in the province by supporting separatists. Those claims gained traction in 2016 with the <a href=\"/news/2019/9/2/indian-official-meets-detained-indian-spy-jadhav-in-pakistan\">arrest of Kulbhushan Jadhav</a> in Balochistan. Islamabad said he was an Indian intelligence operative working for the Research and Analysis Wing, India’s external intelligence agency.</p><p>Pakistan later released a video showing Jadhav confessing to facilitating attacks, presenting it as evidence of external interference. India has denied that Jadhav was a spy.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2025-01-1770042211.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"searching-for-solutions\">Searching for solutions</h2><p>The 2010s saw the emergence of more sophisticated Baloch armed groups that increasingly targeted Chinese citizens and projects.</p><p>Attacks hit Gwadar port, <a href=\"/news/2019/5/12/gunmen-attack-hotel-in-pakistans-gwadar-kill-five-people\">a luxury hotel in the city</a>, the <a href=\"/news/2018/11/23/gunmen-attack-chinese-consulate-in-karachi\">Chinese consulate in Karachi</a>, and a<a href=\"/news/2022/4/27/female-graduate-student-behind-pakistan-university-attack-report\"> Chinese cultural centre</a>, among many several other incidents.</p><p>As violence has intensified, the government has also increased its focus on extracting Balochistan’s mineral wealth.</p><p>China operates a major copper mine in Saindak, while the Reko Diq project in western Balochistan, which is considered one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits, is also in the pipeline.</p><p>With Balochistan making up 44 percent of Pakistan’s landmass, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, Abdul Basit, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, says geography poses a greater challenge than the rebellion.</p><p>Balochistan’s terrain is defined by a rugged, arid landscape of mountain ranges, with vast spaces which are only sparsely populated, making up just more than 6 percent of the total population of the country. The mountainous regions of the province are often used by rebel groups as sanctuaries.</p><p>“Can you really deploy security apparatus in a province which is as large as Balochistan, and with as difficult a terrain, to ensure complete eradication of violence, especially when the state refuses to look at the local faultlines?” he asked.</p><p>Many analysts argue that Pakistan must shift away from military-first approaches.</p><p>Imtiaz Baloch, a researcher on conflict in the province, says the rebellion has been handled with ego rather than a genuine effort to secure peace.</p><p>“Instead of addressing the root issues, governments have focused on shaping a narrative, mainly for audiences outside the province. Balochistan doesn’t need emotional posturing or optics; it needs a calm, political, and realistic approach,” he said.</p><p>Saher Baloch, a Berlin-based scholar with extensive experience in the province, says a political problem cannot be resolved through force.</p><p>Because fighters know the terrain better than security forces, she said that they need only to strike occasionally to expose state vulnerabilities.</p><p>“Where the state rules through fear rather than trust, intelligence also dries up. People don’t cooperate, information doesn’t flow, and that’s why even high security zones keep getting breached,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Government officials continue to argue that military force is the answer, a view that Rafiullah Kakar “strongly disagrees” with.</p><p>Kakar, a political analyst specialising in Balochistan and a doctoral candidate at the University of Cambridge, said Pakistan has relied on “coercive and militarised approaches” that have failed to bring stability.</p><p>“The Pakistani state needs to fundamentally shift and recalibrate its approach. The starting point must be meaningful confidence-building measures to create an enabling environment for political reconciliation and dialogue,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Any serious attempt to resolve the crisis, he added, must recognise its political nature and include steps such as addressing enforced disappearances, ensuring electorally legitimate representation, and establishing “a credible Truth and Reconciliation Commission”.</p><p>“Finally, the state must present a clear roadmap for structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms to address Balochistan’s longstanding political, economic, and governance-related grievances,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
