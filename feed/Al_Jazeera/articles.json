As they made a run for it, she saw young men from her village picking up guns to confront the RSF.</p><p>They were outgunned and outnumbered.</p><p>“While we were escaping, we saw the [RSF] kill six young men in front of us,” she told Al Jazeera, solemnly.</p><p>“The entire village escaped when the RSF arrived. We left with nothing but the clothes on our backs until we reached the nearest, safest village,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>An epicentre of conflict</h3><p>Sudan’s regular army, known as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), has fought a bloody civil war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since April 2023.</p><p>The conflict produced the worst humanitarian crisis in the world by most measures before the RSF’s recent attacks in North Kordofan, a strategic region in southern Sudan.</p><p>Over the last several weeks, the RSF has raided villages and scorched families to death. They have also shot and killed pregnant women and children, according to the Emergency Lawyers, a local monitor.</p><p>The violence has pushed tens of thousands of people to seek refuge in SAF-controlled el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan.</p><p>Hamisa and her family are struggling to survive after reaching the city on July 15. Like most displaced people, she is living in an overcrowded hut with barely enough food and clean water.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In addition, those displaced fear the RSF is trying to reimpose a siege on el-Obeid and then invade the city, a concern shared by analysts and relief workers.</p><p>“People all around us are still traumatised by the RSF. The children with us are very scared. They think the RSF will enter [el-Obeid],” Hamisa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A siege would exacerbate the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in el-Obeid and eliminate a key SAF logistics hub.</p><p>The SAF relies on el-Obeid to carry out air strikes against the RSF in the western region of Darfur, as well as to keep RSF fighters a safe distance away from the capital Khartoum, according to Nathaniel Raymond, who follows conflict dynamics in Sudan as head of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>“If SAF loses el-Obeid … they would lose a lot of their ability to project force outside of Khartoum,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3863375\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3863375\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3863375\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-Who-controls-what-in-Sudan-JULY-29-2025-copy-3-1753798269.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive map Sudan el-Obeid\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3863375\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A map showing areas under control by the RSF and SAF in and around the strategic city of el-Obeid in North Kordofan [Interactive/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h3>Strategic hub</h3><p>Back in February, the SAF managed to break the RSF’s chokehold siege over el-Obeid, providing much-needed relief to its units and fighters.</p><p>El-Obeid is located some 529 kilometres (329 miles) from North Darfur’s capital el-Fasher, where SAF forces and hundreds of thousands of civilians are currently besieged by the RSF.</p><p>Any hope of carrying out a rescue mission to break the siege requires that the SAF maintain control over el-Obeid, explained Raymond.</p><p>He added that holding on to the city would also protect Khartoum from being overwhelmed by RSF drone strikes.</p><p>Yet the looming onset of Sudan’s rainy season – accompanied by heavy fog and preceding heavy rainfall  – could give the RSF an opportunity to mount a major assault. The rainy season is arriving in Sudan late this year, but forecasts suggest it could start in the coming days or weeks, said Raymond.</p><p>“SAF pilots look out the window of their planes [when dropping bombs]. They do not have laser guidance [because they fly old planes]. When the clouds come, it’ll be an operational advantage for the RSF,” Raymond told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“[The start of the rainy season] is the sweet spot,” he added. “The roads aren’t saturated yet and the valleys aren’t full [of rain], so the RSF will have cloud cover without any impact on their manoeuvrability.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3838234\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3838234\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24162280843036-1752557353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sudanese soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces unit.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sudanese soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces unit, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy head of the military council, secure the area where Dagalo attends a military-backed tribe’s rally, in the East Nile province, Sudan, on June 22, 2019 [Hussein Malla/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Any attack on el-Obeid would be catastrophic for the roughly 137,000 people seeking refuge in the city, a figure disclosed to Al Jazeera by Emmanuel Ufot, the director of Emergency Programs in North Sudan for Mercy Corps, one of the few global relief agencies active in North Kordofan.</p><p>He added that civilians would have to flee to Kosti in White Nile state if the RSF attacks el-Obeid, since all other exit points would be besieged and closed off.</p><p>Kosti is about 265 kilometres (165 miles) away from el-Obeid.</p><p>“We have to factor in the women, babies, elderly and disabled. These are people that will not be able to run when there is a lot of conflict,” Ufot told Al Jazeera.</p><h3>No safe haven</h3><p>Another pressing concern is the severe lack of humanitarian relief for civilians, according to relief workers.</p><p>Ufot from Mercy Corps said that only about 5 percent of the displaced in el-Obeid have a sturdy roof over their head because they are taking shelter in a school.</p><p>The rest live in huts or without any shelter at all.</p><p>With the rainy season coming, flooding and overcrowding could lead to the rapid spread of preventable diseases like cholera, a waterborne illness that has already infected tens of thousands of people in Sudan. Children are particularly vulnerable to cholera.</p><p>The RSF is compounding the crisis by firing drones and heavy artillery at civilian targets such as homes, basic services  – like power stations, and hospitals, according to Yousef Hederby, a local volunteer.</p><p>“El-Obeid is subjected to a lot of artillery shelling [from the RSF]. And the shelling hits civilian homes and residential areas,” Hederby told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added that four people were killed and some 20 were injured by the indiscriminate shelling in mid-July. He noted the violence came after the RSF killed more than 300 people in villages located near el-Obeid in North Kordofan between July 12 and July 15.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent written questions to the RSF’s press office asking the group to respond to credible reports that it has intentionally targeted civilians and carried out mass killings in recent weeks.</p><p>The RSF did not respond before publication.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hamisa, the elderly woman who already survived one mass killing, fears she will not survive a second if the RSF enters el-Obeid.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera that the ongoing war in Sudan is worse than the civil war in the 1990s, referring to the north-south conflict that eventually divided Sudan into two countries in 2011.</p><p>“There were limits to the civil war in the 1990s. Our village wasn’t in a lot of danger at the time,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But this war has spread to every village and area in Sudan. There is a safe place in Kordofan,” she added.</p><p>“We are all very scared.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>It has been a year since the Southport attack, which triggered furious racist riots in the streets of the United Kingdom. Unruly crowds, galvanised by false claims that the perpetrator was Muslim, went on a rampage, attacking mosques, Muslim-owned businesses, homes, and individuals they perceived as Muslim.</p><p>As the riots were raging, I was finishing my novel, The Second Coming. The book is set in a dystopian future in which a Christian militia inspired by English nationalism seizes London, bans Islam, and exiles Muslims to refugee camps in Birmingham. The events unfolding in the streets as I was writing the final chapters made me realise that today, we are much closer to the dystopian world in my novel than I had imagined.</p><p>The scenes and images that helped me shape this fictional world were inspired by the England I lived in during my youth, when racist violence was rampant. Gangs of white youth would hunt us down, especially after the pubs closed, in wave after wave of what they called “Paki bashing”.</p><p>Knife attacks and fire bombings were not uncommon, nor were the demands by far-right groups, such as the National Front and the British National Party, for the repatriation of Black (ie, non-white) “immigrants”.</p><p>Attending school sometimes meant running through a gauntlet of racist kids. In the playground, sometimes they swarmed around, chanting racist songs.</p><p>As a student, I lost count of the number of times I was physically attacked, at school, in the street, or in pubs and other places. When I lived in East London, I was with the local youth of Brick Lane, where hand-to-hand fighting took place to stop hordes of racist attackers. These assaults were not an isolated phenomenon. Similar scenes took place across the country, with the National Front and British National Party organising hundreds of marches, emboldening white supremacist gangs.</p><p>Around this time, some of my peers and I were arrested and charged with “conspiracy to make explosives” for filling up milk bottles with petrol as a way of defending our communities against racist violence; our case came to be known as the Bradford 12. These struggles, whether in Brick Lane or Bradford, were part of a broader fight against systemic racism and far-right ideologies that sought to terrorise and divide us.</p><p>The overt, street-level violence of those years was terrifying, but it came from the margins of society. The ruling political class, though complicit, avoided openly aligning with these groups. A case in point is Margaret Thatcher, who in 1978, as the leader of the Conservative Party, gave an infamous interview in which she said, “People are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.” It was a subtle nod of approval for racist mobs, but as prime minister, Thatcher still kept far-right groups at an arm’s length.</p><p>Today, that distance has disappeared. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other prominent members of Labour regularly echo far-right rhetoric, promising to “crack down” on those seeking sanctuary here. His Conservative predecessor, Rishi Sunak, and his ministers were not different. His Home Minister Suella Braverman falsely claimed grooming gangs had a “predominance” of “British Pakistani males, who hold cultural values totally at odds with British values”.</p><p>While the old crude white racism has not disappeared, a more vicious form – Islamophobia – has been fanned over the past few decades. It feels like the old “Paki” bashing gangs have been replaced by a new crusading wave that equates Islam with terrorism; sexual abuse with Pakistanis; asylum seekers with parasitic hordes about to overrun the country.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>This is the soil in which the Reform Party has taken root and flourished, in which ever cruder forms of racism are made respectable and electable. When both Labour and the Tories have become havens for a complex web of political corruption, Reform’s simple anti-migrant and Islamophobic tropes are projected as an honest alternative. This has propelled the far-right party to the top of polls, with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/local-elections-reform-labour-tories-poll-b2739478.html\">30 percent</a> of voters supporting it, compared with 22 percent for Labour and 17 for the Conservatives.</p><p>In this environment, it was rather unsurprising that for the anniversary of the riots, the Economist magazine decided to run a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/07/24/seven-in-ten-britons-expect-more-riots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> focusing on race rather than on issues of economic decline, social deprivation and the never-ending austerity to which the working people of this country have been subjected. The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of the population think that multiculturalism is not good for the country, while 73 percent thought more “race riots” will happen soon.</p><p>The nurturing of violent racism at home has run parallel with England’s long history of enacting it abroad. The new face of racism is fed on old imperial tropes of savages that need to be tamed and defeated by civilised colonial rule. These racist ideologies, which welded the empire together, have come back home to roost.</p><p>They are playing out in the racist violence on the streets and in the state’s repression of Palestine supporters. They are also playing out in the UK’s unwavering political and military support for Israel, even as it bombs hospitals and schools in Gaza and starves children. Empire taught Britain to use racism to dehumanise entire peoples, to justify colonialism, to plunder, to spread war and famine. Genocide is in Britain’s DNA, which explains its present-day collusion with genocidal Israel.</p><p>Against this backdrop of racist, imperial violence, people of all colours and religions and none have mobilised. While they may not have stopped the genocide, they have laid bare the hypocritical barefaced lies of the British political elite. Only this sort of solidarity and challenge to racism can stop the dystopic world of my book becoming a reality.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The attack was captured on video, and the shooter was identified as Yinon Levi, a settler previously sanctioned by the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States under the Biden administration.</p><p>Hathaleen, aged 31, was a beloved activist and teacher from <a href=\"/features/2025/7/10/west-bank-palestinians-prepare-to-lose-homes-as-israel-pushes-for-expulsion\">Masafer Yatta</a> in the South Hebron Hills. He also played a supporting role in <a href=\"/news/2025/3/3/israeli-palestinian-film-no-other-land-wins-oscar-for-best-documentary\">the Oscar-winning film No Other Land</a>, which depicts the story of his village, subjected to relentless attacks from settlers and settler-aligned soldiers for decades.</p><p>Hathaleen’s killing is far from isolated. He is one of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/israel-has-killed-1000-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-since-october-7-2023\">more than 1,000 Palestinians</a> killed in the West Bank since the genocide in Gaza began in October 2023. This surge in violence coincides with a sharp rise in Palestinian land seizures and home demolitions. The Israeli government has used the genocide in Gaza as cover to accelerate its takeover plans for the West Bank. Just days before entering its three-month summer recess, the Israeli Knesset passed a non-binding motion to annex the entire territory.</p><p>The Knesset’s motion comes one year after the July 2024 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that Israel’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories it seized in 1967 is illegal and must end. The court ordered the Israeli regime to dismantle settlements, provide reparations and facilitate the return of displaced Palestinians, setting September 2025 as the deadline.</p><p>In the months leading up to the ICJ ruling, countries including Australia, France, the UK and Canada announced sanctions on a handful of settlers and entities involved in the settlement enterprise. Hathaleen’s killer, Yinon Levi, was among those sanctioned. Yet, as expected, travel bans and financial restrictions imposed by these countries have had no impact on the ground. Levi continued his attacks on Palestinians from his illegal settler outpost, operating under full army protection.</p><p>Not only have these sanctions had no impact, but by singling out a few settlers rather than addressing the broader machinery of settler colonialism, they also allow the Israeli regime to escape accountability by presenting settler violence as an aberration rather than an extension of state policy.</p><p>By deliberately distinguishing between “extremist” settlers and the rest of the Israeli regime, states implement token measures that enable them to posture as defenders of international law while avoiding any confrontation with the regime itself.</p><p>The reality is that Israel operates as a settlement enterprise, and its state policy has always been to expand its territory across all of Historical Palestine and beyond, as demonstrated by the occupation of parts of southern Syria and Lebanon over the last two years.</p><p>Today, more than 700,000 settlers reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem across more than 250 settlements and outposts, all of which violate international law and are sustained by state infrastructure, security forces and planning agencies. This expansion has been enabled by hollow measures such as the sanctioning of Levi, where targeting a few individuals serves only to shield the regime responsible for the very system they uphold.</p><p>This political theatre is utterly absurd. One cannot meaningfully sanction settler violence while maintaining full diplomatic, economic and military support for a regime that is, by definition, a settler regime. The settler and the state are inseparable. To sanction one while legitimising the other is not accountability; it is complicity. Hathaleen’s murder is not an anomaly but the direct outcome of this system, one that is protected, financed and excused by the same states that claim to oppose it. Such actions do not challenge the status quo; they entrench and normalise it. Breaking this cycle requires states to end their support for Israel’s genocidal regime of settlement and occupation altogether, through comprehensive sanctions and real accountability that targets the system, not just its murderous foot soldiers.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

On Sunday, the US president scored his biggest victory to date, as European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, like the leader of a vassal state paying homage to an emperor, travelled to Trump’s private golf course in Scotland to offer him tribute.</p><p>It came in the form of an entirely one-sided tariff pact in which Brussels accepted a huge tariff hike and pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on US fossil fuels and military products.</p><p>The pact has changed the balance between two of the largest economic powers in the world. The EU has simply rolled over without a fight. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as a “dark day” for the union, while a European diplomat bemoaned by saying “those who don’t hang together get hanged separately.”</p><p>The economic impact on the rest of the world is likely to be worse still. Trump has declared economic war on friends and foes alike. Many countries are facing higher tariffs than the EU and are less capable of defending themselves. By giving in, Brussels has made it harder for other countries to stand firm.</p><p>A 40 percent tariff on Laos or 36 percent on Cambodia, for example, will be devastating to the export industries which US corporations encouraged them to build in recent decades. And without a united front, other countries are reluctantly coming to the table.</p><p>Last week, Trump announced a deal with the Philippines for 19 percent tariffs on all goods exported to the US and no tariffs on imported US goods; it was unclear if Manilla had fully agreed to the arrangement before the US president made it public. Indonesia’s deal is even worse, with the country forced to give up controls on its critical mineral exports and aspects of its emerging digital sector – both of which are critical to its economic development. For Brazil, US demands go beyond the economic realm, with Washington going as far as trying to interfere in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p><p>While the provisions of different trade deals vary, they all follow the same strategy: Bullying governments to change their rules and regulations in favour of US corporate interests, especially those of oligarchs who surround the president.</p><p>Trump’s trade negotiations style might be highly erratic, but his is a clear-cut end goal: To upend the world economic system, replacing rules which were already unfair with the absolute dominance of the biggest bully.</p><p>The immediate impact of this restructuring will be bad for the countries that submit to it, but this won’t be the end of the story. By giving Trump what he wants, they have strengthened his hand, and he will be back for more.</p><p>Already, the EU has little clarity around a range of additional tariffs the US president might bring in and how they will affect the “deal” that’s been made. Canada ditched its digital services tax on Big Tech to get a deal, only to be hit by higher tariffs. The Philippines now faces a higher tariff than it did in April, despite making concessions. And the UK thought it had a deal on steel, only to discover it didn’t, really.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>There’s no fairness in any of this. The only way out is to stand up to Trump; he does not respect weakness.</p><p>As a minimum, for countries that have signed a deal, that means implementing as little as they can. Governments that can retaliate should do so. That does not necessarily mean matching tariff for tariff, a policy which could inflict serious self-harm, but rather using the tools that show their strength best.</p><p>The EU has ample power to challenge the US services trade, and should have retaliated by limiting US corporate access to, for example, government contracts, financial markets and intellectual property protection.</p><p>In failing to take such action, the EU showed a profound misunderstanding of the moment we’re in. Von der Leyen seems to think Trump is a temporary anomaly who can be contained while we wait for a resumption of business as usual in four years.</p><p>But in Europe and the US, the public has had enough of a corporate-dominated global economy. There’s no return to that world. Retaliatory policies like the ones mentioned above can not only maximise the pain directed at Trump’s oligarchic friends, but they can also help unwind the power of the monopolies which are at the heart of our deeply unfair, unsustainable economy.</p><p>This last point is important. Because if we want Trump gone, as millions of Americans do, we will not get there by handing him unnecessary victories. Trump won power by building a bridge between those angry at a corporate-dominated economy and the corporate barons themselves. It was an impressive feat. But the alliance will only last as long as he’s winning.</p><p>The question now is how governments can best protect their economies long-term, and that must come through regaining sovereignty, not handing it over to the bully in the White House. What’s more, such action can show Trump for the corporate lobbyist he really is and lay a path to his eventual downfall.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Two buildings down, another structure bore the word “Antiquite” written boldly in chalk. It, too, was closed. Outside, women in long, sweeping hijabs and men in turbans walked past, shouting hellos, as a roaming tea seller stopped to prepare glasses of ataya – a mixture of green tea, mint and sugar.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>Inside, Illo cleaned and dusted away, focused on his task. At age 63, he is tall and stately with a serene presence. A grey moustache and beard frame his lips, and the sides of his milky eyes crinkle when he smiles, which he does generously.</p><p>Illo’s store is one of the last few souvenir vendors still operating in the old Nigerien city.</p><p>Packed and stuffy, the mud structure barely has enough room for more than one person. On the shelves are dusty mementos from antique dealers and jewellers across Niger and the region: a bronze cup from somewhere in the desert, silver knives sheathed in dusty green and brown leather cases made by Agadez’s skilled artisans, chunky beaded necklaces from Ghana.</p><p>Despite staying open for several hours, no buyers came in aside from two teenage boys. They haggled with Illo over a pair of knives for several minutes before shuffling away in the opposite direction, empty-handed.</p><p>“It’s hard,” Illo said, his French soft and singsongy. Standing up slowly in the cramped space, he braced himself on achy knees. “Life is hard for anyone who works in tourism, but there aren’t many options. We have to endure it.”</p><p>Agadez, the ancient city of Tuaregs, lodged on the southern edge of the Sahara, has always been a natural crossroads between cultures and continents because of its location. Called the “gateway to the Sahara”, it was in this hot, arid savannah that camel-drawn caravans loaded with ceramics and silk from Arabia, or gold from West African kingdoms in present-day Ghana and Nigeria, stopped to rest during the trans-Saharan trade between the 8th and 16th centuries.</p><p>A two-minute walk from Illo’s store, the Grand Mosque – the world’s tallest mudbrick building – stands as a testament to this history. For centuries, its pointed minaret served both as a watchtower and a compass for travellers.</p><p>The building itself is built out of wooden beams and mudbricks, called banco. Tuareg artisans travelled as far as Timbuktu in Mali to learn the delicate art of building with the sun-dried bricks. It is the same unique material and technique used throughout the entire old town, earning the area a UNESCO World Heritage Site stamp in 2013.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Travellers and architecture buffs came from all over the world to see the ancient wonders for decades, boosting the local economy. Up until the late 1980s, when a Tuareg revolt led to armed conflict, thousands of tourists streamed in monthly, largely from Europe, to peer at the old mosque and walk through the old town’s gridded streets, which date back to how the early Tuareg settlers organised in encampments based on sub-tribes. The revolt ended tourism.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857109\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857109\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857109\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF7707-1753460418-rotated.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1366&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A view of the Grand Mosque of Agadez\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the Grand Mosque of Agadez [Shola Lawal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Today, the building continues to fascinate the few tourists who come by, even though getting to the very top is much harder than it looks. You have to crouch low to the ground and move up the steep stairs of the minaret in slow shuffles, as the narrow passage tightens with every step. Then, you must amble past a colony of shrieking bats before squeezing through a tiny hole to clamber gingerly to the top.</p><p>For those who dare, the climb is worth it. Most evenings, the golden glow of sunset bathes the old town in warm hues. Row after row of squat mud structures spread out in all directions, as though paying homage to the mosque. Five times a day, a muezzin solemnly calls the adhan to signal the time for prayer, the sound riding on the breeze. Tut-tutting tricycle and motorbike riders, and squealing from children playing in the courtyards, add to the symphony.</p><p>A once-booming Agadez has fallen on tough times since the revolt, and tourism profits have long faded. Left behind are harsh realities, evident in the lack of customers, shuttered hotels and souvenir shops, as well as deteriorating infrastructure, reflected in the sewage now spilling into sandy streets. It is also evident in the different clientele now plying those old caravan routes: irregular immigrants desperate to brave the desert to reach Algeria or Libya, and eventually, Europe, for a new life.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-10-years\">The best 10 years</h2><p>Even the veterans of the city sometimes want to leave, at least for a while, to escape the stillness.</p><p>“If I could, I would go to Algeria,” said Illo, speaking of how far he would travel to be able to sell his goods and make money. In Algeria, he said, tourism is booming. “But I am not as strong as I used to be. My heart is not strong enough. If I go, I may never come back.”</p><p>Illo first began trading back in the 1970s, barely an adult at the time.</p><p>He bought goods from locals and sold them to gallery and museum curators visiting from Europe. He even exhibited his collection in several countries. Many of his customers were German-speaking, so when he first got a store space, he named it Schmuck Laden, which means jewellery store.</p><p>His first foreign exhibition was in neighbouring Nigeria, followed by another in Germany. On his travels, Illo picked up languages, complete with accents. His German flows with a Bavarian twist. His Yoruba, although jerky, is of the Lagos variety.</p><p>Tourism was the region’s bread and butter at the time, so it was not strange for young men like Illo to double as tour guides. He would take travellers around the old city and up into the Air Mountains, about 200km (124 miles) away, which stand out in stark contrast to the low-level dunes of the desert. He took them as far as the black and ochre salt mines of Bilma, a five to six-hour drive from Agadez, where workers loaded the white stuff onto camels to transport down to Nigeria for sale.</p><p>“It’s impossible to know how many people I guided or how many were my customers,” he said. Over the years, many have kept in touch with him, sending letters from time to time, all of which he keeps safe in a big canvas bag in his home. “The best month was December because the weather is nicer and cooler. It’s our winter. We had a cook [for the tourists] who would make salads for lunch and a hot meal, like spaghetti, for dinner,” he reminisced.</p><p>Of all the years, it was the 10 from 1980 to 1990 that remain most vivid in Illo’s memory. Those were the years of the Dakar Rally, an off-road racing event that began as a race from Dakar, Senegal to Paris, France, but that has since emigrated from the continent to Saudi Arabia due to more than a decade of insecurity from armed groups swarming the Sahel, from Mali to Niger.</p><p>Back then, when the cars raced towards Agadez in dust-raising fury, the whole town would line up by the roadside to cheer them on. It was like a party, Illo said. Taxi drivers got more clients in that period, and locals would take the opportunity to rent out their houses for a few nights to the moving party.</p><p>All that excitement, those old days of good money, are over, replaced with a stillness in the city, Illo sighed in his store, wiping his forehead as though wiping the thought away. Resentment and fury at the government spiralled into armed fighting that shut the doors to that life.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857097\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857097\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF7938-1753460247.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Elhadj Illo bends in his store\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illo working in his store [Shola Lawal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"season-of-rebellion\">Season of rebellion</h2><p>Trouble began brewing in northern Niger in the late 1980s, when Tuareg armed groups formed, aiming to fight for autonomy. Across the Sahelian countries, <a href=\"/video/2014/1/9/orphans-of-the-sahara-return\">Tuareg minority communities</a> have long accused their governments of neglect, despite the mineral profits coming from their land, particularly gold. Famine in the Tuareg regions of Niger and Mali between 1982 and 1985 caused thousands to be displaced, and hundreds to become refugees in camps in Algeria and Libya, although the exact number is unclear. In the camps, those who felt aggrieved that they were experiencing famine while their governments profited from their land met and formed alliances.</p><p>The first armed attack was in May 1990. Tuareg separatists attacked a police station in the town of Tchin-Tabarenden, some 400km (248 miles) from Agadez; five people were killed, while 25 of the attackers died. Niger’s military response to the attacks was to deploy soldiers in the area, and the ensuing clashes resulted in “several hundred deaths”, researchers note.</p><p>Between 1990 and 1995, as sporadic fighting raged, foreign governments evacuated their citizens, including from the neighbouring town of Arlit, where a French company mined uranium. Western governments like the United States declared Agadez a red zone and issued travel warnings to tourists, delivering a death knell to the city.</p><p>Although a peace agreement stalled the fighting in 1995, the armed rebellion would not come to an end until 2007. By then, the local economy had collapsed.</p><p>More recently, it is armed militias and bandits that plague the region, locking the insecurity in place. The most powerful militia is the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), which operates across the Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso tri-border area. It was founded by a Tuareg fighter who took part in earlier rebellions in Mali, and it aims to establish a caliphate. Some of the groups are believed to have infiltrated Agadez: two European women have been kidnapped in the town since January. JNIM has denied any involvement.</p><p>Political instability roiling Niamey has worsened the situation. Military regimes have come and gone in rapid succession in Niger since independence from France in 1960, but there was hope after the first-ever democratic transition in 2021. A <a href=\"/features/2024/7/26/a-year-after-nigers-coup-split-political-loyalties-test-family-ties\">military coup in July 2023</a> dashed those hopes.</p><p>Under General Abdourahmane Tchiani, Niger has grown increasingly isolated, with the knock-on effect falling on the already battered tourism sector. Tchiani’s government cut ties with its ally, France, also expelling French troops, because Paris refused to back the coup. The US, too, has been ejected from its Base 201, the sprawling, expensive drone outpost just behind the small Agadez airport. The base took three years to build and employed hundreds of locals.</p><p>Niamey has also been at loggerheads with its regional neighbours, after the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) placed excruciating sanctions on the country and some of its leaders. Instead, Tchiani has banded with fellow military leaders in Burkina Faso and Mali to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). All three have turned to Russia for security and business. At the Agadez airport, Russian warplanes sit on the tarmac, and Russian military men in khaki greens loiter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857104\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857104\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857104\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF8041-1753460351.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An intersection in the town of Agadez, outside the old town area\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An intersection in Agadez, outside the old town area [Shola Lawal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"old-roads-new-travellers\">Old roads, new travellers</h2><p>As the city changed, local travel agents who once helped tourists arrive in Niger and travel in the dunes of the Sahara pivoted their trade to the scores of migrants seeking passage to Libya and onwards across the Mediterranean, towards Europe.</p><p>In the crowded bus station on the outskirts of Agadez, <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/4/12/agadez-nigers-gateway-to-the-sahara-finds-new-life-in-the-migrant-trade\">passeurs</a> – the agents who transport migrants from all over West Africa – sat at desks peering at papers, counting and recounting the names and numbers of passengers for the next convoy going into the desert. It was after midday, the time when the temperatures usually climb to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) before cooling off in the evening.</p><p>Passeurs were not always able to work openly. Under the former civilian government, collaboration with the European Union saw authorities dismantle what they called the smuggling industry that first took off in 2011 after Muammar Gaddafi’s regime fell in Libya. At the time, transporters realised there was unrestrained passage through the leaderless country, all the way to the edge of the Mediterranean.</p><p>Quickly, people seeking passage began pouring in and, soon, the population of Agadez doubled to 300,000 from the influx.</p><p>While passeurs flourished with the new trade, others grumbled. Migrant communities clash with locals frequently due to deep-seated resentment; locals believe migrants encourage vices like smoking and drugs in their deeply traditional city, but migrants say locals here are not accepting enough of their differences.</p><p>The EU deal in 2015 under President Mahamadou Issoufou momentarily criminalised travelling through the desert, forcing passeurs underground. The travels did not stop, passeurs here say, but the journey certainly got deadlier, with drivers taking longer, untested, or long-abandoned routes that got them lost or exposed them to armed groups and bandits. Since the military government took power in 2023, the EU deal has been abandoned. Now, army trucks escort the migrant convoys deep into the desert for protection.</p><p>Each passenger pays 150,000 francs ($267), said Addo, a popular passeur with a spacious office that was empty but for a single table and two chairs in a corner. A sign in front read: “Agadez-Dirkou”, referring to the Nigerien city further east where travellers will make a stop. It is only one of four stops on the route, the passeur explained from his seat. Addo’s phone rang often with his fellow passeurs calling to arrange more clients.</p><p>Sometimes, people do not make it to the other side because of bandits, or die from thirst: a broken-down vehicle or a driver losing his way could see them trapped too long without water, Addo said. Sometimes, they do, and will then push forward through the sea to Europe, he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF8109-1753459758.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Migrant travellers get into the back of a pickup truck, preparing to head out to the desert\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Migrant travellers get into the back of a pick-up truck, preparing to head out to the desert [Shola Lawal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Thirty minutes from the bus station, in the yard of a gated migrant transit house run by a young man from Agadez, a small crowd of people excitedly loaded their luggage into the back of a green pick-up truck. Young men, women and a handful of children threw their luggage and bottles of water in before clambering into the back of the truck. They were packed tight, knees squeezed together. Drivers handed out sticks to those sitting on the edge of the truck. It is a sort of seatbelt, holding travellers in place as trucks zoom through the desert, going at breakneck speed to avoid bandits and armed groups. Those who do not hold on tight enough sometimes get thrown from the trucks, but drivers rarely stop.</p><p>Aminata, a middle-aged woman sitting in the middle of the truck who asked that her real name not be used, looked around, waiting for the vehicle to load. She wore a black jilbab, and her scarf covered part of her face, shielding it from the sun that seemed to be bearing down on the truck. She had been briefed by the passeurs, said Aminata, who speaks rapidly in high-pitched Hausa. She knew the dangers on the road already: the car could break down in the middle of the desert; they could be without help for hours, or even days; armed bandits could attack them. She would spend four long days in this cramped position, in the hot desert heat, and her nights would be in the open. She knew, Aminata said, that some people never make it out of the desert. Still, she was determined.</p><p>A native of Kano State, in northern Nigeria, Aminata said she was embarking on the journey to provide for her children, whom she had left back home. There was nothing in Nigeria, she said. She was poor, and the current economic crisis there had made it impossible for her to survive. Yes, the journey could be fatal, but God was with her, she said.</p><p>About half an hour later, the loading was done. The truck driver, dressed in a loose grey kaftan and dark aviator sunglasses, got in the driver’s seat and turned the key in the ignition. He reversed slowly out of the yard. The trip was not officially approved – this set of migrants was too impatient to wait for the usual military escort, which had been delayed for a day because of some administrative reason. As they drove off in a cloud of dust, the travellers waved goodbye to their counterparts, who had spilled out of the open gates of the house’s yard to see them off. Many here are waiting for their turn to leave. The travellers were still waving when the truck turned a corner and disappeared.</p><h2 id=\"no-place-like-home\">No place like home</h2><p>In the large, sparsely furnished living room of Illo’s house, the trader sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, examining old documents. Many were letters from his friends abroad, others were odds and ends that reminded him of the good times, like an old Lufthansa plane ticket, and the flyer of an art exhibition from 1993.</p><p>One of his eight daughters lounged on a bed spread out in the corner. A fan stood in front of the door, blowing hot air. Out in the yard, a little girl – Illo’s granddaughter – chit-chatted with a friend about something. They spoke in low, serious tones, gesturing.</p><p>Modest as it is, building his home was one of Illo’s proudest moments, judging by how frequently he mentions the feat. He was barely 30 when he completed it. Before then, as a teenager, he lived with his neighbours: his father died when Illo was 16, and his mother moved back to her hometown away from Agadez, leaving just him. Illo did not want to leave the old town, though, so he simply moved next door until he saved enough to buy land and build his house.</p><p>“I stayed there [without paying rent] until I got married and got my own house,” he said, reflecting on how generous people can be in the town. “If not in Agadez, where are you going to find something like that?” Yes, it is harder these days for most people to afford to be as hospitable as they were in the past, but that spirit of giving is still strong, he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3857100\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857100\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857100\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF7964-1753460273.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Illo holds an old photo showing him and his friends in front of his old store\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illo holds an old photo showing him and his friends in front of his old store [Shola Lawal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Picking up one folded missive, Illo smiled as he examined the fading print. It was from 1982, from a man called Michel in Geneva. He started to read it aloud.</p><p>“I received your letter of March 18, in which you’re not happy,” he read. The full exchange tells of Illo asking Michel to send him 100 Swiss francs in exchange for a “promised gift”. In the end, Michel says he sent him 50 Swiss francs but never received the parcel.</p><p>“I was barely 20,” Illo laughed bashfully, rummaging again through the heap of letters before him – evidence of a lifetime of friendships the sexagenarian has built because of the city and his work.</p><p>But much of that has now changed, Illo knows.</p><p>He has heard of how hard it is for foreigners to get a visa to Niger under the military government. Authorities even seize passports from nationals of African countries they consider hostile, such as Nigeria, for a few days upon arrival.</p><p>The growing hostility to outsiders has changed the demographics of people visiting Agadez – and it is affecting locals, too. It means fewer sales at Illo’s souvenir shop, and more than that, it means some of his foreign friends may never be able to make it back to visit.</p><p>“That’s the administration, not us,” Illo said, with a rare frown. If Niger had not been open once, he would not have met his clients, made such long-lasting friendships, or travelled widely the way he has.</p><p>Loud banging on the gate of his compound interrupts Illo’s letter reading, causing him to rise and walk slowly towards the yard. A group of about 20 young men dressed in flowing purple robes, complete with elaborate headgear that fanned out like a peacock’s comb, poured into the yard, singing. They were part of the procession celebrating the Biannou Festival, which used to be held yearly, but is now every other year. The Tuareg festival often features three days of dance performances, parades and prayers, led by young men. Sometimes, performers take the party to the homes of notable people like Illo, who is revered as a sage of sorts.</p><p>One of the performers banged on a drum as the men launched into a dance, encircling Illo. The vendor reached out to take the drum and hit up a fiery beat, earning him cheers from the small crowd. After a few more minutes of dancing and drumming, the men said their goodbyes and filed out of the yard. Illo’s teenage daughter ran after them.</p><p>“That one, she’s crazy,” Illo laughed as he lowered himself back onto the mat, before reflecting that it is little moments like these that help him remember why he had always chosen to stay put here in Agadez, even when he could have left for Libya, Algeria, or somewhere else.</p><p>Like him, his children and grandchildren can travel and see the world – even though he will never allow them to join the desert travellers. But after having journeyed far and wide, the best patch of the world, he said, is right here.</p><p>“The world is full of problems right now, there’s no other place you can go that’ll be this quiet,” Illo said. “Despite all the difficulties, I can’t leave.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many believe it’s a setback from the years of reforms following the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.</p><p>The protesters held banners with slogans reading “Sham!” “Don’t make a step back, there’s an abyss there,” and “Corruption applauds” the new bill.</p><p>The rallies took place in Kyiv as well as in large cities such as the Black Sea port of Odesa and Lviv, known as Ukraine’s cultural capital.</p><p>NABU has been probing a string of senior officials and lawmakers, including those within Zelenskyy’s Public Servant party.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Oleksiy, who enlisted to join the army in 2022, wonders why he should keep fighting on the front lines of eastern Ukraine while officials engage in corruption.</p><p>“What’s the point if I go back home and my family is surrounded by corruption everywhere,” the 42-year-old construction manager told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Judges, officials, even school teachers all say, ‘Give, give, give,’” he said, asking to withhold his last name and details of his military service, in accordance with the wartime protocol.</p><p>Oleksiy, who is on a break from his service to visit his two children and ailing mother, took part in the largest antigovernment rallies in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-zelenskyy-backed-the-bill\">Why Zelenskyy backed the bill?</h2><p>The new law envisaged executive control over NABU and SAPO as the prosecutor general’s office could access their information, give them binding directives, transfer cases and close down investigations.</p><p>The bill “could finally destroy the independence of the anticorruption system in Ukraine”, NABU said.</p><p>Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the new law “risks weakening Ukraine’s democratic foundations and its future integration with Europe”. She called for the repeal of the law.</p><p>Zelenskyy, a former comedian and political rookie who came to power in 2019 on an anticorruption ticket, defended the law, claiming that the NABU and SAPO have to “get rid of Russian influence”.</p><p>His allegation followed the arrest of two NABU staffers suspected of working for Russian intelligence, and charges against outspoken anticorruption campaigner Vitaly Shabunin.</p><p>Shabunin was accused of “evading military service”, but his supporters called the charges trumped-up, and almost 60 anticorruption and nongovernmental groups signed a joint appeal in his defence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3852104\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852104\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852104\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AA-20250722-38633431-38633430-THOUSANDS_OF_UKRAINIANS_PROTEST_THE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_A_LAW_THAT_REGULATES_THE_WORK_OF_ANTICORRUPTION_INSTITUTIONS-1753260537.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kyiv residents take part in a rally against the implementation of Zelenskky's bill that undermines the power of anticorruption agencies.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People rally in Kyiv against the implementation of the draft law that regulates the work of s Special Anti-corruption Prosecutor’s Office and the National; Anti-Corruption Bureau [Danylo Antoniuk/Anadolu]</figcaption></figure><p>A Kyiv-based political analyst says there are two popular theories about why Zelenskyy initiated the bill.</p><p>“One is that NABU allegedly closed in on Zelenskyy’s inner circle,” Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>NABU accused Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, Zelenskyy’s closest ally and lifelong friend, of taking kickbacks worth $346,000 from a real estate developer in a deal that cost the government $24m.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s press office didn’t reply to Al Jazeera’s phone calls and text messages.</p><p>“Or this is an attempt to control NABU’s actions in order not to overtly politicise them, not to provoke domestic political wars during the war with Russia,” Fesenko said.</p><p>“But I think it has to do with the activisation of the NABU on political issues that may have caused suspicion in Zelenskyy’s inner circle. That it wasn’t a fight against corruption but more of a political attack on Zelenskyy,” he said.</p><p>The protests, an anticorruption expert told Al Jazeera, have weakened Zelenskyy’s support within domestic political circles. “There was a belief in his high and stable rating,” Tetiana Shevchuk from the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a Kyiv-based group, said.</p><p>But “he no longer can demand anything from the parliament,” she said.</p><p>Zelenskyy is afraid of NABU as the only law enforcement agency that won’t open or close an investigation following a phone call from his administration, she said, referring to the centralisation of power under him.</p><p>“NABU is the only body that doesn’t do that,” Shevchuk said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Fesenko from the Penta think tank says the politicians “underestimated” the bill’s “negative consequences”. They “didn’t think the public response would be that harsh”.</p><p>Zelenskyy has promised to submit the new bill – a move applauded by the country’s top anti-corruption investigator.</p><p>Semen Kryvonos, director of NABU, however, said that corrupt actors will step up a “dirty information campaign” against the anti-graft agencies.</p><p>Meanwhile, protest leaders say they would stop rallies only after the bill has been passed – tentatively, later this week.</p><p>Since the 2014 pro-democracy revolution or Revolution of Dignity, attempts have been made to root out endemic corruption.</p><p>Many bureaucratic procedures have been simplified and consume less time, money and nerves.</p><p>But corruption remains pervasive in the halls of justice. Ukraine ranks 105 out of 180 in Transparency International’s corruption index.</p><p>A criminal investigator who spent months putting together a string of lawsuits against a fraudster who duped dozens of people, including several lawmakers, told Al Jazeera that a corrupt judge could annul his work and the fraudster may walk free.</p><p>“We can’t guarantee any judge’s honesty,” the investigator said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Europe’s worst armed conflict since World War II has bred new forms of corruption.</p><p>Some officers extort bribes for letting a serviceman take leave or go to a hospital, pilfer foreign aid such as canned foods, clothes or shoes that end up on store shelves instead of the front line.</p><p>“If someone reports such an officer, they may end up in a suicide squad on zero position,” serviceman Oleksiy who took part in the protests claimed, referring to the front line positions most likely to be attacked by enemy drones.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3855859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3855859\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3855859\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AFP__20250724__67RW6NQ__v2__HighRes__UkraineRussiaConflictWarDemo-1753401429.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters hold placards during a demonstration against a law that removes the independence of the NABU and SAPO anti-corruption agencies, in Kyiv on July 24, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukraine's anti-corruption body NABU said a new bill submitted to parliament on July 24 would restore its independence, after President Volodymyr Zelensky backtracked under pressure from nationwide protests and the EU.
