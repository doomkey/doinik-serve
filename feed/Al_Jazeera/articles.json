He was particularly concerned about being blamed for an accident resulting from neglected infrastructure.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Previously, the production plant received a month of maintenance, but this was gradually cut down to 20 days, and sometimes even 15, where only the most urgent tasks were prioritised,” he said.</p><p>“The risk of a potential catastrophe was very real, both for the staff and for the surrounding communities.”</p><p>On April 20, 2016, less than a year after Ramos left, an explosion rocked the Pajaritos complex, where he had worked before transferring to the Morelos complex just five kilometres away. The incident killed 32 people and injured more than 130 workers.</p><p>Pemex, over the years, has been responsible for soil contamination, rising methane emissions, and pipeline spills, with chronic leaks impacting local communities and marine fauna. This lack of infrastructure maintenance has worsened as the state-owned giant contends with significant financial and operational constraints and a massive debt burden.</p><p>For the past two decades, Pemex has struggled to increase production as mature oil fields decline, while it carries a debt of $100bn and has failed to attract private investment. Concerns are growing for the sustainability of the oil company and the future of Mexico’s energy sector amid regional changes, financial instability and a strong reliance on imports from the United States.</p><p>Despite being a crude oil producer, Mexico remains dependent on refined products and natural gas imports from the US. Mariana Castaneda, director of Grupo Estrategia Politica, a public affairs consulting firm, told Al Jazeera that domestic fuel production currently falls 21 percent short of demand. This gap, she said, is expected to widen, even as most refineries operate at or near their maximum capacity.</p><p>Rafael Vaquera Salazar, a professor at Monterrey Technological University (TEC), told Al Jazeera that despite the country’s vast reserves and long history of extraction, the outlook for recovery remains bleak.</p><p>Now there is a new challenge.</p><p>Following the US invasion of Venezuela that resulted in the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/explosions-heard-over-venezuelan-capital-caracas-amid-us-tensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduction</a> of then-President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on January 3, the regional energy landscape has become unstable, complicating long-term planning.</p><p>While shifts in Venezuela’s oil industry could impact Mexico’s own production, Vaquera said that the timeframe and specific conditions remain uncertain.</p><p>Both Venezuelan and Mexican crude are heavy, and US Gulf Coast refineries are specifically equipped to process this type of oil. “A competitive situation could arise where whoever offers the biggest discounts will secure the refining capacity,” he pointed out.</p><p>About 60 percent of Pemex’s crude oil exports go to the US. While imports from Venezuela were limited by sanctions, volumes are expected to rise with renewed activity.</p><p>Even though oil executives told US President Donald Trump that significant reforms are needed before they commit to Venezuela, a market that Exxon CEO Darren Woods called “<a href=\"/economy/2026/1/9/trump-promises-oil-executives-total-safety-if-they-invest-in-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uninvestible</a>”, that may not really be the case.</p><p>In the oil industry, it doesn’t really matter who you do business with. What matters is the guarantee that investments will be secure and stable, Vaquera told Al Jazeera. “If I have certainty and stability, I can make investments,” he said. “Even if it means dealing with the devil.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aid-to-cuba-and-an-ailing-state-oil-company\">Aid to Cuba and an ailing state oil company</h2><p>Mexico has been sending oil shipments to Cuba since 2023 through Pemex subsidiary Gasolina Bienestar. These shipments, which were once sporadic, became consistent under the administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who framed them as humanitarian aid.</p><p>Last year, between January and September 30, Mexico shipped 17,200 barrels of crude oil per day and 2,000 barrels of refined products, according to a report submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has also defended the oil shipments as humanitarian aid, yet they continue to fuel tensions with the Trump administration.</p><p>On January 26, reports emerged that Pemex had halted oil shipments to Cuba amid rising tensions. The following day, Sheinbaum declined to confirm or deny the reports, stating that the move was a “sovereign decision” by the state oil company.</p><p>Camila Acosta, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera on January 15 that 60 percent of the island faces blackouts. These are driven by fuel shortages and crumbling infrastructure, along with declining oil shipments, the longstanding US embargo and the Trump administration’s tactic of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-seizes-a-seventh-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seizing Venezuelan oil tankers</a>.</p><p>“People are fed up with the blackouts, having to cook with firewood, not being able to refrigerate food – or having it spoil – and the lack of water because, without electricity, it can’t be pumped,” she said.</p><p>Acosta said that Mexico now stands as the Cuban regime’s “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/venezuela-and-mexico-how-trump-is-trying-to-choke-cubas-oil-supplies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifeline</a>” as Trump pledged in early January to stop Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba. However, there is growing concern over how much worse the crisis could become if Mexican shipments were to cease entirely.</p><p>“Pemex is in serious financial trouble, and given the public pressure, I don’t know how much longer they can sustain these shipments to the island,” Acosta added.</p><p>Following a series of reforms since 2013, a 2025 reform under Sheinbaum changed Pemex’s status from a “Productive State Enterprise” to a “Public State Enterprise”. This legal change prioritises public benefit over economic profitability.</p><p>Castaneda says that the current administration recognises the need for private capital to guarantee Pemex’s financial viability, provided it doesn’t compromise national sovereignty.</p><p>“The goal is to ensure that sovereignty and Mexican oil remain in the hands of Mexicans. But Pemex itself has acknowledged that without support and participation from the private sector, it is practically impossible to face the challenges Pemex has, including its debt,” she added.</p><p>Pemex owes roughly $30bn to its suppliers despite official promises to accelerate payments. Castaneda said that while the government has been making payments, the amounts remain insufficient compared with the total debt, though it does offer some reassurance to the market. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ramos, the former worker, said that this debt has severely affected local businesses, such as those providing maintenance, supplies, and technical and transportation services, which rely on those funds to stay afloat and pay their employees. He noted that in Coatzacoalcos, many residents are moving to cities like Monterrey for work.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pedro Aguirre, CEO at Verifigas, a firm that provides technical verification in Mexico’s energy sector, told Al Jazeera that the government’s push for private capital is falling short of expectations.</p><p>The combination of Mexico’s 2025 <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/5/30/what-to-know-about-mexicos-first-of-its-kind-judicial-elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">judicial reforms</a> – which increase legal uncertainty – alongside Pemex’s operational challenges and the risks surrounding payment, have caused many companies to have second thoughts.</p><p>Last year, Aguirre said, the Mexican government provided Pemex with nearly 400 billion pesos ($23bn), more than double the approved amount, to stabilise its finances and bolster its reliability.</p><p>“The uncomfortable question that remains is, how long will this deficit be sustained?” Aguirre said. “And who, in a few years, will make the decision to say enough is enough.”</p><p>For 2026, Pemex’s budget grew 7.7 percent. Its strategy relies on hitting 1.8 million barrels per day, up from last year’s average of 1.6 million, and increasing domestic fuel processing at the Dos Bocas and Deer Park refineries to reduce imports. The Ministry of Energy is not granting interviews at this time.</p><p>But the growing financial support has also raised questions about which other key sectors are being impacted.</p><p>Castaneda said that despite government efforts to ensure that overall investment continues, sectors such as health, education and infrastructure have been diminished or neglected.</p><p>“It is like a blanket, isn’t it? If you pull on one side, the other side is revealed,” Castaneda said. “In other words, if there is more on one side, there will be less on the other.”</p><p>Pemex’s precarious financial position has been further strained by fuel theft, commonly known as huachicol. While criminal organisations traditionally siphoned gasoline from pipelines, the practice has evolved into a more complex scheme, involving a network of organised crime, Mexican and US companies, and corrupt officials. Fiscal fuel theft involves misclassifying fuel imports to evade the required taxes.</p><p>“For many years, these networks were importing diesel, in particular, but labelling it as lubricants or waste. This creates a fiscal shortfall. Funds that the state did not receive and should have received,” Vaquera added.</p><p>According to Aguirre, from Verifigas, the country lost about $10bn in 2025 due to this illicit trade, resulting in a massive deficit of public funds. He describes it as an “increasingly sophisticated fraud” that exposes governance failures and has direct impacts on community safety, local market competition, and Pemex’s economy.</p><p>While the US and Mexican governments have sanctioned and arrested people for their involvement in the huachicol fiscal, many in Mexico are still calling for high-ranking politicians within the Morena ruling party to be held accountable.</p><p>In September, Vice Admiral Manuel Roberto Farias Laguna, a relative of a former navy secretary, was arrested alongside other businessmen and public officials for alleged involvement in organised crime and fuel smuggling. He is the highest-ranking official detained to date in connection with these investigations.</p><p>For Vaquera, the issue is less about the money and more about how those funds are used. He warns that it can be used to install handpicked candidates in elections, influence authorities, or facilitate money laundering.</p><p>“It’s about who kept it [the money] and the political power they acquired by having all that money or economic power,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At first, it seemed like Friday’s deadline to pass a new spending package would pass without much fuss.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But an impasse has emerged in the waning days before the deadline. The shift came amid public outrage at the latest shooting death resulting from US President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement drive.</p><p>In the days since immigration agents killed US citizen <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/who-was-alex-pretti-the-nurse-shot-dead-by-federal-agents-in-minneapolis\">Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, Democrats have drawn a stark line.</p><p>They have pledged to approve no funding increases for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the agencies spearheading Trump’s deportation drive, unless it agrees to place guardrails on its use of force.</p><p>An initial vote on Thursday saw every Democrat and, surprisingly, a handful of Republicans vote against a funding package.</p><p>That came shortly after Tom Homan, the US border security chief, said immigration agents would shift their approach in Minnesota but vowed to maintain a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/trump-border-czar-says-staying-in-minnesota-until-problems-gone\">continued presence</a> in the state.</p><p>Lawmakers in the Senate now have until midnight on Friday (05:00 GMT on Saturday) to find a solution. Here’s how we got here and what comes next:</p><h2 id=\"what-s-in-the-legislation\">What’s in the legislation?</h2><p>Republicans will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the 100-seat Senate to pass the funding legislation. They currently control 53 seats, meaning they will need both party unity and the support of at least seven members of the Democratic caucus to pass funding.</p><p>All told, the legislation includes six separate bills to fund the Department of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of the Treasury, and, most notably, DHS.</p><p>The bills are all linked in a sprawling $1.2 trillion package passed by the US House of Representatives last week. Without the funding, non-essential services in those departments would grind to a halt.</p><h2 id=\"why-not-vote-separately-on-dhs-funding\">Why not vote separately on DHS funding?</h2><p>Any changes to the House-approved package — including voting separately on DHS funding — would require overcoming lengthy procedural hurdles in the Senate.</p><p>Then, the legislation would have to return to the House of Representatives for a new vote.</p><p>The House is currently in the middle of a weeklong recess, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, is unlikely to call his chamber’s representatives back to Washington for a second vote.</p><p>Thursday’s initial 45-55 vote in the Senate scuttles the prospect of the wholesale package being quickly approved, raising the possibility over the funding bills being broken up to separate the controversial DHS funding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-funding-is-there-for-dhs\">How much funding is there for DHS?</h2><p>Compared with last year, the new spending package would add $400m more to the detention budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and $370m more for its enforcement budget.</p><p>That is on top of a $170bn windfall for DHS included in last year’s sprawling tax-and-spending law, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” It earmarked about $75bn for ICE over the next four years.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-funding-controversial\">Why is the funding controversial?</h2><p>Rights advocates have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/public-opinion-shifts-on-ice-as-advocates-warn-of-us-inflection-point\">condemned</a> the current funding bill for providing yet more funding to ICE, the agency at the heart of Trump’s deportation drive.</p><p>Just this month, US immigration officers have been connected to two high-profile shooting deaths in Minneapolis: Pretti’s killing on Saturday by two US Border Patrol agents, and the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on January 7. Both shooting victims were US citizens.</p><p>Last week, a handful of House Democrats broke with their party to vote for the spending package. At the time, seven Democrats backed the funding legislation, while 206 opposed it.</p><p>The vote was ultimately 220 to 207, with Republican Thomas Massie joining the majority of the Democrats in opposition.</p><p>This latest budget fight comes less than three months after a record-breaking, 43-day-long government shutdown came to a close on November 12, 2025. Polls show such disruptions are widely unpopular across the political spectrum.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-expectations-leading-up-to-this-week\">What were the expectations leading up to this week?</h2><p>In the run-up to Friday’s shutdown deadline, Democrats in the Senate were bracing for a similar fracture among their party members.</p><p>Several had been expected to hold their noses and vote to support the spending bill, in part fearing the political optics of another government shutdown.</p><p>On January 20, Democratic Senator Patty Murray argued against shutting down the government yet again, calling it an ineffective tactic to curb ICE.</p><p>“ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a [continuing resolution] nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,” she wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/senatorpattymurray/posts/heres-my-statement-on-the-homeland-security-funding-bill-that-was-just-releasedw/122251211276177122/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>Murray called on her party to instead focus its efforts on winning the upcoming midterm elections. “The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-has-democratic-sentiment-changed\">Why has Democratic sentiment changed?</h2><p>Pretti’s killing on Saturday changed the dynamic for Democrats.</p><p>His shooting by US Border Patrol agents was followed by a swarm of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/trump-administration-maga-allies-spread-misinformation-on-pretti-killing\">baseless claims</a> from the Trump administration, accusing Pretti — a nurse who treated US veterans — of being a “domestic terrorist”. That, in turn, fuelled further outrage at his death.</p><p>Senator Murray was among those who shifted her stance in the wake of the killing. Her response was unequivocal.</p><p>“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/PattyMurray/status/2015501477603594259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on the social media platform X. “Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences.”</p><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, also abandoned earlier assurances that a shutdown would be avoided.</p><p>Left-wing senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen and Angus King have also announced they will not vote in favour of the funding bill as is, despite having broken from party ranks to end the last shutdown in November.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/2016281815783186597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on Wednesday on X, Schumer showed little sign of yielding.</p><p>“In the wake of ICE’s abuses and the administration’s recklessness, Senate Democrats will NOT pass the DHS budget until it is rewritten,” he wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-the-party-remain-united\">Will the party remain united?</h2><p>To date, the party has yet to present a list of demands on changes to the DHS funding.</p><p>Reforms floated by Democrats include requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests, doing away with the Trump administration’s detention quotas, and mandating that federal agents unmask themselves and wear identification.</p><p>Other proposed measures involve prohibiting US Border Patrol agents from being deployed within the interior of the US and requiring that local and state authorities be involved in use-of-force investigations.</p><p>State officials in Minnesota have complained in recent weeks that they have been shut out of the federal investigations into the killings of Good and Pretti.</p><p>While Trump has distanced himself from his administration’s comments calling Pretti a “terrorist”, his more <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trump-promises-to-de-escalate-minnesota-crisis-after-alex-pretti-shooting\">conciliatory tone</a> has not extended to Democratic officials.</p><p>On Wednesday, he again blamed Democrats for escalating tensions in Minnesota and warned that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was “playing with fire” for failing to fall in line with his immigration policies.</p><p>Top Democrats, in turn, have dismissed any promises for reform not codified in law.</p><p>“If the government shuts down yet again, it will be because congressional Republicans refuse to place guardrails on this reckless president and the ICE agency,” Senator Dick Durbin said during a floor speech on Wednesday.</p><p>“In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to join us in that endeavour before [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem and her squad take another innocent life.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was also among the top apps downloaded by Apple users in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.</p><p>The app, meanwhile, is gaining thousands of new downloads as disgruntled TikTok users flock to the platform, pulled by its promise of “transparent tech”. The flood of new users momentarily crashed the platform’s servers over the weekend, UpScrolled reported.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the new app that’s stirring up the social media space:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274059\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274059\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274059\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/inY1GgyO_400x400-1769689349.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Issam Hijazi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4274059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Issam Hijazi [X/@iHijazi]</figcaption></figure><p>UpScrolled enables the trio of photos, short-form video and text posts, making it feel like a combination of X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Its interface is similar to X, and users can similarly like a post, comment under it or repost.</p><p>So far, users on the app appear to be using it more for text and photo posts, rather than for the short-form videos TikTok is popular for.</p><p>UpScrolled also has a “Discover Page” similar to Snapchat’s. By far the most popular topic on the Discover Page is Palestine. Hundreds of posts depicting the continuing suffering in the Gaza Strip, or standing in solidarity with Palestinians, are flooding the app.</p><p>Some high-profile figures joined the new flock of UpScrolled users, including <a href=\"/video/upfront/2025/10/18/chris-smalls-linking-workers-rights-and-palestinian-liberation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Smalls</a>, the American labour activist and former Amazon Union organiser who joined others on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in July 2025 to try to break the blockade on the strip.</p><p>Jacob Berger, the Jewish-American actor who starred in the popular American crime series Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and who was also on the Freedom Flotilla, is also on the app.</p><p>Some users on the app earlier this week complained that video uploads were crashing. UpScrolled, in an update on the app on Thursday, said that was a result of more user downloads, and added that the bugs have been fixed.</p><p>UpScrolled was founded in July 2025 by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian developer who formerly worked with Big Tech companies like Oracle and IBM. It is backed by Tech for Palestine, an advocacy project that funds pro-Palestine tech initiatives.</p><p>Hijazi, in an interview with tech news site Rest of World, said he was inspired to leave his Big Tech career behind and build an alternative amid Israel’s obliteration of Gaza, which was declared a genocide by a United Nations Commission of Inquiry. The rate of content censorship across the popular apps, Hijazi said, was a major driver.</p><p>“I couldn’t take it any more,” Hijazi is quoted as saying. “I lost family members in Gaza, and I didn’t want to be complicit. So I was like, I’m done with this, I want to feel useful.</p><p>“I found this gap in the market, with a lot of people asking why there is no alternative to the Big Tech platforms for their content, which was getting censored. So I thought, why don’t we build our own? I just rolled up my sleeves and built it,” he added.</p><p>In a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/un-report-lists-companies-complicit-in-israels-genocide-who-are-they\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report l</a>ast year, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese accused IBM and several other Big Tech companies of complicity in what she called “Israel’s genocide”. Social media apps like Instagram, X and TikTok have faced accusations of shadow bans by users posting pro-Palestine content.</p><p>UpScrolled claims to moderate only illegal content, such as hard drug sales, but nothing else. Hijazi said the app’s algorithm is not designed to keep people scrolling, unlike TikTok and others.</p><p>“It’s not because we don’t know how: it is very easy to design the algorithms to do that,” Hijazi said in the interview. “But I don’t want to do that because I know the effect it can have on people, mentally, especially the younger generation.”</p><p>UpScrolled says its feed remains entirely chronological, a feature that has long been removed from other popular apps despite complaints.</p><p>Posts on the Discover Page are currently ranked based on engagement, although the team is experimenting with using AI to reorganise the feed, according to user behaviour.</p><p>On its website, UpScrolled says it wants to give users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others”. The app belongs to the people who use it and “not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas,” the company says.</p><p>By Tuesday, estimates from the marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower noted that UpScrolled had been downloaded about 400,000 times in the US and 700,000 globally since launching in June 2025.</p><p>The app saw a surge in US downloads beginning on January 22 – the same day TikTok<a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/who-controls-tiktoks-us-platform-under-new-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> signed a deal</a> to create an American-controlled US version of its app.</p><p>Sensor Tower estimated that, as of Tuesday, 85 percent of UpScrolled’s downloads in the US had occurred between January 21 and 27.</p><p>On Wednesday, UpScrolled was number one in the “social networking” category in Apple’s US App Store, surpassing Meta’s Threads, WhatsApp and TikTok. It was the number six free social app on Google Play for Android users, where TikTok (and TikTok Lite) reign.</p><p>The app has also seen a high number of downloads in Canada, the UK and Australia.</p><p>“Crazy load on our servers. So exciting!” founder Hijazi posted on the platform on Sunday, after the site reported that soaring numbers of new users crashed its servers.</p><p>“Sorry about the errors and glitches, we are increasing our capacity to handle the load. We expect things to become more stable in the next 12-24 hours,” Hijazi wrote.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-censorship-concerns-regarding-tiktok\">What are the censorship concerns regarding TikTok?</h2><p>Since the TikTok US deal went live last week, the tag #TikTokCensorship has been trending on the US sites of social platforms like X and Instagram.</p><p>Users are accusing TikTok of suppressing videos in support of Palestine. The ban on Bisan Owda has only appeared to support their claims.</p><p>Many are also accusing TikTok of quelling content that’s critical of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid outrage over the force’s deadly crackdown on immigrants and US citizens alike. This week, ICE officials killed emergency nurse <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/27/health-professionals-pay-tribute-to-alex-pretti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Pretti, less than three weeks after killing another civilian, Renee Good</a>. Others say any anti-Trump criticism is similarly being shadow-banned.</p><p>Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a Tuesday post on X that he would investigate TikTok after users complained of being flagged for content about Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted child sex offender alleged to have ties to numerous high-profile figures, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/21/epstein-files-whose-names-and-photos-are-in-the-latest-document-drop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including President Trump</a>.</p><p>Separately, TikTok users have complained of video glitches on the app since last week’s business deal. Creators say they are seeing zero views on their videos and are experiencing slow uploads.</p><p>In a statement on Monday, TikTok said the glitches were caused by a “major infrastructure issue triggered by a power outage” at one of its US data centre partner sites.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-apps-have-surged-in-popularity-in-recent-years\">Which other apps have surged in popularity in recent years?</h2><p>Skylight, which launched in April last year, is another app that’s gaining prominence as a TikTok alternative.</p><p>The American short-form vertical video app has gained more than 380,000 users and saw an uptick in downloads over the weekend, according to reporting by tech website TechCrunch.</p><p>Another is Bluesky, which aims to rival X and was launched in 2024. It’s largely used by users opposed to X owner Elon Musk’s right-wing ideologies. Bluesky, owned by CEO Jay Graber, had about 1.5 million active users by September 2025.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Targeted what we’ve done for decades,” Homan said. “When we hit the streets, we know exactly who we’re looking for.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Homan portrayed the approach as business as usual, immigration observers have said the administration has increasingly used dragnet strategies in an effort to meet increased detention quotas.</p><p>State and local law enforcement officials last week even detailed that many of their off-duty officers had been randomly stopped and asked for their papers. They noted that all those stopped were people of colour.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Trump had promised to target only “criminals”, but shortly after taking office, White House spokesperson said it considered anyone in the country without documentation to have committed a crime.</p><p>Homan pledged to continue meeting with local and state officials, hailing early “progress” even as differences remain. He highlighted a meeting with the State Attorney General Keith Ellison in which he “clarified for me that county jails may notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks so ICE can take custody”.</p><p>It remained unclear if the announcement represented a policy change. Minnesota has no explicit state laws preventing authorities from cooperating with ICE and the state’s prisons have a long track record of coordinating with immigration officials on individuals convicted of crimes.</p><p>County jails typically coordinate based on their own discretion.</p><p>Homan said more cooperation with local officials would allow “us to draw down on the number of people we have here”, adding ICE and border patrol staff were drawing up plans for such a drawdown.</p><h2 id=\"i-don-t-want-to-see-anybody-die\">‘I don’t want to see anybody die’</h2><p>Trump sent Homan to replace Greg Bovino, the top border patrol official, who was sent to the state as part of a massive enforcement operation, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, that has sparked widespread protests.</p><p>Homan hinted at internal changes, but did not provide further details, just saying “no agency or organisation is perfect”.</p><p>“President Trump and I, along with others in the administration, have recognised that certain improvements could and should be made. That’s exactly what I’m doing here,” he said.</p><p>“I want to make it clear ICE  and [border patrol] officers are performing their duties in a challenging environment, under tremendous circumstances,” he said. “They’re trying to do it with professionalism. If they don’t, they’ll be dealt with. Like any other federal agency, we have standards of conduct.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Homan later added that: “I don’t want to see anybody die — not officers, not members of the community and not the targets of our operation”.</p><p>Local officials have been pushing for independent state investigations into the killing of Good and Pretti, which have so far been blocked by the administration.</p><p>Critics have voiced concerns over Trump administration officials’ immediate claims that both Good and Pretti were threatening lethal force, long before any investigation had been conducted.</p><p>The Trump administration announced earlier this week that two border patrol officers involved in Pretti’s killing had been placed on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/us-agents-involved-in-alex-prettis-killing-in-minneapolis-placed-on-leave\">administrative leave</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats in the US Senate have threatened to force a government shutdown over Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding if safeguards are not built in to restrain the conduct of immigration agents.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that they would “immediately and powerfully respond” to any new US attack.</p><p>The escalation comes seven months after US bombers <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-nuclear-sites-how-big-are-radiation-risks\">attacked Iranian nuclear facilities</a> during Tehran’s 12-day war with Israel last year.

During its war with Israel, Iran also struck several Israeli cities with missiles.</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump told Iranian protesters who were clashing with security forces that “help” was on the way, threatening to bomb Iran. However, he has since walked back his warning, seemingly accepting Tehran’s assurances that arrested protesters <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">would not be executed</a>.</p><p>As Iran and the US appear to be headed towards a new military escalation, key demands from both sides appear to be primarily the same as they have been for years.</p><p>We unpack what they are:</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-the-us-wants-iran-to-do\">What the US wants Iran to do</h2><p>Historically, the US has imposed sanctions on Iran for a range of reasons, from punishment for the hostage crisis in 1979 – when, after the Iranian Revolution, students took over the US embassy with staff inside – to supposed concern for the human rights of Iranians.</p><p>But over the past two decades, US pressure against Iran, including through crippling economic sanctions that have devastated the country’s middle class, has largely focused on Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programme.</p><h3>Nuclear programme</h3><p>The US and some of its Western allies insist that Iran’s programme is aimed at building nuclear weapons, even though Tehran has insisted that it is only developing a civilian programme to meet energy needs.</p><p>Under a nuclear deal that Iran agreed with the US during President Barack Obama’s administration – known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – Tehran capped its uranium enrichment at 3.67 percent and its enriched uranium stockpile at 300kg (660lb). This was enough for Iran to use for nuclear power plants, but far from adequate for weapons. In exchange, the US lifted most sanctions previously imposed on Iran.</p><p>At 60 percent enrichment, uranium is considered ready to be developed for weapons. At 90 percent, it is considered fully weapons-grade.</p><p>But Trump withdrew the US from this deal in his first term as president, in May 2018, and reimposed sanctions against Tehran. Iran appeared to try to stick to its end of the agreement for a while, along with European powers, Russia and China, who were all co-signatories to the Obama deal. Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, however, kept most of Trump’s sanctions in place, even though he had been Obama’s vice president.</p><p>In his second term as president, Trump has further ramped up economic coercion against Iran, which also began rapidly enriching its uranium.</p><p>In May 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) <a href=\"/news/2025/5/31/iran-increases-stockpile-of-enriched-uranium-by-50-percent-iaea-says\">warned</a> that Iran had stockpiled more than 400kg (880lb) of uranium enriched to 60 percent. Though weapons need uranium that’s more than 90 percent enriched, no non-nuclear weapons state is known to keep uranium enriched to levels as high as 60 percent.</p><p>The US and Israel cited the IAEA warning as justification for bombing Iran in June.</p><p>“There has been a consistent lobby in Washington arguing that Iran achieving nuclear weapon capability is an enormous threat to the US and the wider world, and the US government knows that this fear is widely held in America,” Christopher Featherstone, associate lecturer at the Department of Politics, University of York, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The US now demands that:</p><ul>\n<li>Iran must not build nuclear weapons, and it must abandon even a civilian nuclear programme.</li>\n<li>Iran must not enrich uranium at all – not even to very low levels that would be useless for military purposes.</li>\n<li>Iran must hand over any enriched uranium it already has.</li>\n</ul><h3>Ballistic missiles</h3><p>Israeli bombs and missiles killed more than 1,000 Iranians during the June war. But while far fewer – 32 – Israelis died in retaliatory Iranian attacks, Tehran’s ballistic missiles frequently managed to breach Israel’s vaunted <a href=\"/news/2023/10/12/whats-the-israel-iron-dome-defence-system-and-is-it-effective-all-to-know\">Iron Dome</a>, hitting several cities.</p><p>Since then, US and Israeli concerns about Iran’s ballistic missiles have grown. Iran’s Emad, Khorramshahr, Ghadr, Sejjil and Soumar ballistic and cruise missiles have ranges between 1,700km and 2,500 km (1,056-1,553 miles).</p><p>That puts Israel and all US military bases in the Middle East within the range of these missiles.</p><p>The US now demands that:</p><ul>\n<li>Iran must curb the number and range of its ballistic missiles.</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_3561192\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3561192\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3561192\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE_IRAN-MISSILE_MARCH6_2025-2-1741262892.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE_IRAN-MISSILE_MARCH6_2025 (2)-1741262892\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3561192\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h3>Regional influence</h3><p>The US’s third key demand involves Iran’s influence in its region, stitched together through alliances with governments, religious movements and armed resistance groups.</p><p>That so-called “<a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">axis of resistance</a>” has suffered body blows over the past two years. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad’s regime, a close partner, fell in December 2024; in Lebanon, Israel decimated the leadership of Hezbollah; while Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also been bloodied in wars since 2023.</p><p>Still, many of these and other groups that Iran has traditionally supported remain active and alive. Earlier this week, the Iraq-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/iraqs-kataib-hezbollah-warns-of-total-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">Kataib Hezbollah</a>, for instance, warned of a “total war” if the US were to attack Iran.</p><p>The US demands that:</p><ul>\n<li>Iran must end its support and links with armed resistance groups across the region.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-iran-wants-the-us-to-do\">What Iran wants the US to do</h2><p>Iran, meanwhile, has its own set of demands of the US.</p><h3>Economic sanctions</h3><p>US sanctions, first imposed on Iran in 1979, have grown increasingly harsh in recent years, leading to shortages, inflation and economic decline.</p><p>Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">oil exports fell</a> by 60-80 percent after Trump reimposed sanctions in 2018, robbing the government in Tehran of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenues.</p><p>The currency has crashed, hitting a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">record low of 1,500,000 rials</a> to the dollar this week and leading to soaring inflation and a surge in the prices Iran must pay for everything it imports.</p><p>As a result, Iran’s middle class has shrunk dramatically in recent years.</p><p>Iran demands that:</p><ul>\n<li>The US must end economic sanctions, including the secondary sanctions that, in effect, coerce other nations from doing business with Tehran.</li>\n</ul><h3>Nuclear programme</h3><p>Iran has consistently argued that its nuclear programme is civilian in nature.</p><p>But since the joint attacks by Israel and the US last year, and the reimposition of sanctions on Tehran in recent months by the United Nations and European nations, hardliners in the country have been pressuring the government to instead race towards producing a nuclear bomb.</p><p>While the Iranian establishment has officially not shifted its position on the subject, it wants:</p><ul>\n<li>Iran to continue to have a nuclear programme, even if with some limits.</li>\n<li>Iran to continue to be able to enrich uranium, even if with some limits.</li>\n<li>A new understanding before allowing IAEA inspectors back into the country. Iran believes that the IAEA’s report on its enriched uranium last year was designed to provide the US and Israel with justification for their attacks.</li>\n</ul><h3>Ballistic missiles</h3><p>Iran believes its ballistic missiles offer it much-needed protection against regional threats, especially Israel.</p><p>That these missiles have the capacity to batter Israeli cities and reach US bases in the region gives Tehran leverage.</p><p>Iran wants:</p><ul>\n<li>To be allowed to keep its ballistic missiles programme.</li>\n</ul><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3770251\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-US-Military-presence-in-the-Middle-East-June-2025-1749733457.png?quality=80\" alt=\"(previous version) A map showing the US military presence in the Middle East\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h3>Regional influence</h3><p>Iran’s alliances and partnerships in its neighbourhood are embedded in a complex web of ideological affiliations, political commitments – such as to the Palestinian cause – and strategic calculations.</p><p>It has lost al-Assad as an ally, and Hezbollah has been weakened. But Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei alluded in December 2024 to Tehran’s belief that:</p><h2 id=\"how-close-are-we-to-a-war\">How close are we to a war?</h2><p>This all depends on Trump and how back-channel negotiations that are ongoing between the US and Iran proceed.</p><p>US allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have said they will not allow their airspace to be used for any attack on Iran. Qatar has been leading efforts to find a diplomatic solution.</p><p>Still, the US has been beefing up its military presence off Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is now in the Arabian Sea.</p><p>In June, Trump bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, including deeply buried facilities at Fordow.</p><p>And while Trump has called for talks, Featherstone from the University of York said: “It will take an enormous diplomatic effort to see a negotiation of any real meaning.”</p><p>Given Trump’s track record of ripping apart the Obama-era nuclear deal, Iran “will be unlikely to trust him as a negotiation partner”, Featherstone said. “I also don’t think European allies will want to help Trump with these negotiations as he is so unpredictable and erratic.”</p><p>Iran has publicly stated that it does not wish to enter negotiations with the US while under threat of military action.</p><p>Despite this, Iran is likely to at least attempt talks, said Roxane Farmanfarmaian, lecturer in international relations at the University of Cambridge.</p><p>“The crippling sanctions by the US are raising food prices and squeezing an already waning middle class and working population,” she told Al Jazeera. “Thus the economic malaise is real, and the leadership has few options but to negotiate with the US to lift the sanctions, something it will likely attempt as it knows that if it fails, not only will the economy collapse, but outside interference could lead to chaos and possibly a division of Iran into different parts.”</p><p>For this reason, she said, Trump will likely continue with his plan to pressure Iran into “nuclear surrender” and avoid all-out war. “A war now might truly embroil the whole Gulf, which Trump can’t afford,” she said. “This may force Trump to the negotiating table, and a quick deal may be in the offing, but his deals tend to be self-serving – as the Venezuela one was with all of Venezuela’s oil revenues now going into a fund in Qatar that he controls – so the chances of a good deal that actually holds is low.</p><p>Another approach to pressure Iran, Farmanfarmaian added, would be for the US to seize Kharg Island, where 90 percent of Iran’s oil is processed and exported.</p><p>Doing that “would cut off Tehran’s financial lifeline”, she said. “That would make an Iran case similar to the Venezuelan case – a quick win, which Trump likes. The prospect of getting mired in a war in Iran with possible regional consequences has clearly held his hand so far.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
