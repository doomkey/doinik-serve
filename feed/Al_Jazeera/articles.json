evening, identified as Nasrallah Abu Siyam, 19, marks the first killing of a Palestinian by Israeli settler gunfire so far this year, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reports.</p><section

reports.</p><p>The attack on Mukhmas and other Palestinian towns and villages constitutes a “dangerous escalation in systematic terrorism and reflects a complete partnership between the settlers and the occupation forces,” Mu’ayyad Sha’ban, head of the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, told Wafa.</p><p>Calling for international protection for Palestinian communities, Sha’ban said that settlers have now killed 37 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since October 2023, but the escalating violence would not deter Palestinians from holding onto their land.</p><p>Mukhmas and the adjacent Bedouin community of Khallat al-Sidra have faced repeated attacks by Israeli settlers, often occurring with the protection or presence of Israeli forces, according to reports.</p><p>The governorate of Jerusalem, one of the 16 administrative districts of Palestine, said in a statement that the killing of the young man by Israeli settlers was a “fully-fledged crime… carried out under the protection and supervision of the Israeli occupation forces.”</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: Martyr of the town of Mukhmas, Nasrallah Abu Siyam, who ascended after succumbing to his injury from settler gunfire during the attack on the town northeast of occupied Jerusalem.</em></p><p>The governorate said the attack was part of a dangerous surge of violence carried out by settlers in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and characterised by the widespread use of live ammunition, direct shooting at Palestinian citizens, as well as burning local Palestinian homes, damaging vehicles and property, and seizing land.</p><p>Armed settler violence is being supported by “pillars of the Israeli government”, foremost among them far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the governorate added, according to Wafa.</p><p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since 2023, and more than 10,000 people have been forcibly displaced.</p><p>Since the start of this year alone, almost 700 Palestinians in nine communities have been displaced due to settler attacks, including 600 displaced from the Ras Ein al-Auja Bedouin community in Jericho governorate, OCHA reports.</p><p>Earlier this week, Israel’s government approved a plan to designate large areas of the occupied West Bank as Israeli “state property”, shifting the burden of proof to Palestinians to establish ownership of their land in a longstanding situation where Israel has made it all but impossible to obtain property titles.</p><p>Described as de-facto annexation of the West Bank, the Israeli government’s decision has drawn widespread international condemnation as a grave escalation that undermines the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.</p><p>Israel’s attempted land grab and killings by settlers come amid a sharp increase in Israeli military operations across the occupied West Bank, where forces have intensified raids, carried out forced evictions, home demolitions, and other repressive measures in multiple areas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote, a run-off will be held in June.</p><p>Traditionally, Peru’s president-elects are inaugurated on the country’s Independence Day in late July. That ceremony will mark the end of Balcazar’s leadership.</p><p>Balcazar’s short tenure is the latest sign of turbulence in Peru’s government. Of Peru’s last eight presidents, four have been impeached and removed from office, and two have resigned before their term’s end.</p><p>The last president to serve a complete term was Ollanta Humala, whose presidency ended in July 2016.</p><p>Balcazar’s ascent to the presidency, however, was marked by its own turmoil. In an initial round of voting, centre-right lawyer Maria del Carmen Alva, 58, and Balcazar, 83, came out ahead, with 43 and 46 votes respectively.</p><p>But they both fell short of the 59 votes needed to be president, so another round of voting was announced. The left-wing party Together for Peru, however, decided to boycott the second round.</p><p>Balcazar ultimately won after a tally of the 113 congressional votes cast.

May God help Peru.”</p><p>Balcazar hails from the left-wing Peru Libre — or Free Peru — party. Born in the northern department of Cajamarca, near the border with Ecuador, he studied law and eventually became a professor and a judge.</p><p>His time in the judiciary, however, was not without controversy. In 2004, while serving as a provisional member of Peru’s Supreme Court, he attempted to overturn a cassation ruling that was considered a final judgment under the law.</p><p>He was subjected to disciplinary hearings, and Peru’s National Board of Justice (CNM) ultimately decided not to renew his term on the high court’s bench.</p><p>Since 2021, Balcazar has been a member of Congress, briefly separating from the Free Peru for a period to join the Peru Bicentenario party.</p><p>Like many of Peru’s recent presidents, Balcazar has also been dogged by the spectre of corruption and scandal.</p><p>His defence of child marriage has raised eyebrows when Congress debated a law to outlaw the practice in 2023. And he has faced investigations for misappropriating money from the Lambayeque Bar Association and for his involvement in a bribery scandal involving former Attorney General Patricia Benavides.</p><p>But despite his prominent controversies, Balcazar’s candidacy was able to unify enough lawmakers to win the vote, no small feat in Peru’s fragmented Congress.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-to-jose-jeri\">What happened to Jose Jeri?</h2><p>Jeri, 39, was one of the youngest presidents to lead Peru. But he ultimately was the latest in a string of three consecutively impeached presidents.</p><p>His predecessor, Dina Boluarte, had been impeached in October for “moral incapacity”, amid dismal poll numbers, allegations of corruption and scrutiny over her use of force against protesters.</p><p>Boluarte, in turn, had replaced her predecessor, Pedro Castillo of the Free Peru party, who was impeached in December 2022 after he attempted what many consider a self-coup.</p><p>He was subsequently arrested and charged with rebellion and conspiracy against the state. Last November, a court sentenced him to 11 years and five months in prison.</p><p>Before becoming interim president, Jeri was the head of Congress, and he oversaw removal proceedings against Boluarte.</p><p>Since taking office, however, Jeri himself became embroiled <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/peru-to-debate-removal-of-president-jose-jeri-four-months-into-his-term\">in multiple scandals</a>. A sexual misconduct accusation was levelled against him, and there were also questions raised about late-night meetings he took in the executive office with women who later received government contracts.</p><p>One of the biggest scandals, though, has concerned his off-the-books meetings with Chinese businessmen.</p><p>Normally, Peruvian law requires official meetings to be logged on the presidential agenda. But Peruvian media obtained video showing Jeri — his face obscured by a hoodie — entering a restaurant owned by a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, late at night.</p><p>The meeting was not documented in government records. More footage emerged of Jeri at the businessman’s wholesale store, this time wearing dark sunglasses.</p><p>Yang previously received a government concession under Boluarte to construct a hydroelectric plant. But he has faced scrutiny about the project’s transparency and progress.</p><p>A second Chinese businessman, Xiaodong Jiwu, was also allegedly at the meeting. He has been under house arrest for illegal activities.</p><p>Jeri denied speaking to Jiwu, saying he simply served food. As for his meetings with Yang, Jeri said they were attempts to arrange a Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. He also excused his presence at Yang’s businesses as shopping trips.</p><p>Though Jeri has denied wrongdoing, prosecutors have launched an investigation into potential influence-peddling under his presidency.</p><p>The scandal has become known as “Chifagate”, named for the Chinese-Peruvian fusion cuisine called “chifa”.</p><p>But the uproar comes as Peru faces pressure from the United States to limit its relations with China. The US Department of State <a href=\"https://x.com/WHAAsstSecty/status/2021617772854460897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> this month that Chinese investment in the port of Chancay could leave the country “powerless” over its own territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

People everywhere will face more pollution, higher costs, and thousands of avoidable deaths,” Peter Zalzal, the associate vice president of clean air strategies at Environmental Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement.</p><p>The endangerment finding was considered a keystone policy for environmental regulations in the US, serving as the legal underpinning for policies to restrict greenhouse gas emissions and push clean-energy programmes.</p><p>But the Trump administration has led a movement to withdraw from climate-change initiatives, both domestically and on an international scale.</p><h2 id=\"withdrawing-from-clean-energy-initiatives\">Withdrawing from clean-energy initiatives</h2><p>Upon returning to office in January 2025, Trump announced he would once again pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, as he had during his first term.</p><p>More recently, on January 7 of this year, the Republican leader issued an <a href=\"http://whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> directing his government to end its engagement with dozens of international organisations and treaties, among them the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>Trump had campaigned on the platform of slashing regulations and reinvesting in fossil fuels, often using the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill.”</p><p>He has since taken steps towards new oil exploration on federal lands and offshore, and just this month, he announced the Department of Defense would <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strengthens-united-states-national-defense-with-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-power-generation-fleet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prioritise coal</a> for its energy production.</p><p>The president has coupled those actions with statements casting doubt on the science of climate change, which has been supported by decades of evidence.</p><p>In a speech to the UN General Assembly in September, for instance, Trump scolded world leaders for attempting to combat climate change.</p><p>“It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said.</p><p>He proceeded to denounce projections that the global temperatures would warm as a result of large-scale emissions. Those predictions, he said, “were made by stupid people” who had doomed their countries to “no chance of success”.</p><p>“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. And I’m really good at predicting things,” he told the world leaders in the audience.</p><h2 id=\"not-a-mere-rollback\">‘Not a mere rollback’</h2><p>Rescinding the endangerment finding, however, was one of the most consequential actions Trump has taken on the domestic front to terminate clean-energy initiatives.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hailed</a> the move as “the single largest deregulatory action in US history”.</p><p>It has also argued that eliminating the endangerment finding allows US consumers greater choice in their purchase of automobiles, which had previously been subject to emission standards.</p><p>But critics argue it effectively collapses more than a decade and a half of environmental regulations, causing tumult even in the motor vehicle industry.</p><p>“This is not a mere rollback. The EPA is attempting to completely disavow its statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases from motor vehicles,” Brian Lynk, a senior lawyer with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in Wednesday’s statement.</p><p>“This reckless and legally untenable decision creates immediate uncertainty for businesses, guarantees prolonged legal battles, and undermines the stability of federal climate regulations.”</p><p>The World Health Organization has estimated that <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-energy-and-health/health-impacts/exposure-air-pollution/worldwide-ambient-air-pollution-accounts-for-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">air pollution</a> contributes to more than seven million deaths annually. Wednesday’s lawsuit argues that the US government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from such harms.</p><p>There is also an economic angle, though. Proponents of the endangerment finding have pointed out that its repeal puts the US behind in developing innovations to address climate change and foster renewable energy.</p><p>With many countries pushing for fuel emission standards, US-made vehicles could lose export markets overseas, critics argue.</p><p>Wednesday’s lawsuit was filed in the US circuit court system in Washington, DC, and it names both the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants.</p></div></div></body></html>"

more than 99,000 households in the Odesa region.</li>\n<li>In Russia, one person was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the village of Aleynikovo in the country’s Bryansk region, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian forces seized the village of Kharkivka in Ukraine’s Sumy region and Krynychne in the Zaporizhia region, according to Russia’s state news agency TASS.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian battlefield monitoring site DeepState said that Russian forces advanced in Nykyforivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.</li>\n<li>Russian forces shot down 155

This figure represents approximately 3.4 percent of Gaza’s pre-conflict 2.2 million population and sits 34.7 percent higher than the 49,090 “violent deaths” reported by the MoH for the same period.</p><p>The Gaza Health Ministry estimates that as of January 27 this year, at least 71,662 people have been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/gazas-unequal-dead-10000-palestinians-under-rubble-one-israeli-captive\">killed</a> since the start of the war. Of those, 488 people have been killed since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on October 10, 2025.</p><p>Israel has consistently questioned the ministry’s figures, but an Israeli army official told journalists in the country in January that the army accepted that about 70,000 people had been killed in Gaza during the war.</p><p>Despite the higher figure, researchers noted that the demographic composition of casualties – where women, children, and the elderly comprise 56.2 percent of those killed – remains remarkably consistent with official Palestinian reporting.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321770\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-death-toll-exceeds-75000-Lancet-study-1771400778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza death toll exceeds 75000 Lancet study-1771400778\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"scientific-validation-of-the-toll\">Scientific validation of the toll</h2><p>The GMS, which interviewed 2,000 households representing 9,729 individuals, provides a rigorous empirical foundation for a death toll.</p><p>Michael Spagat, a professor of economics at Royal Holloway University of London and the study’s lead author, found that while MoH reporting remains reliable, it is inherently conservative due to the collapse of the very infrastructure required to document death.</p><p>Notably, this research advances upon findings <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/deaths-from-israeli-attacks-in-gaza-undercounted-by-41-percent-study-finds\">published</a> in The Lancet in January 2025, which used statistical “capture-recapture” modelling to estimate 64,260 deaths during the war’s first nine months.</p><p>While that earlier study relied on probability to flag undercounts, this report shifts from mathematical estimation to empirical verification through direct household interviews. It extends the timeline through January 2025, confirming a violent toll exceeding 75,000 and quantifying, for the first time, the burden of “non-violent excess mortality”.</p><p>According to a separate commentary in the same publication, the systematic destruction of hospitals and administrative centres has created a “central paradox” where the more devastating the harm to the health system, the more difficult it becomes to analyse the total death toll.</p><p>Verification is further hindered by thousands of bodies still buried under rubble or mutilated beyond recognition. Beyond direct violence, the survey estimated 16,300 “non-violent deaths”, including 8,540 “excess” deaths caused directly by the deterioration of living conditions and the blockade-induced collapse of the medical sector.</p><p>Researchers highlighted that the MoH figures appear to be conservative and reliable, dispelling misinformation campaigns aimed at discrediting Palestinian casualty data. “The validation of MoH reporting through multiple independent methodologies supports the reliability of its administrative casualty recording systems even under extreme conditions,” the study concluded.</p><h2 id=\"a-decade-of-reconstructive-backlogs\">A decade of reconstructive backlogs</h2><p>While the death toll continues to mount, survivors face an unprecedented burden of complex injury that Gaza’s decimated healthcare system is no longer equipped to manage. A predictive, multi-source model published in eClinicalMedicine quantified 116,020 cumulative injuries as of April 30, 2025.</p><p>The study, led by researchers from Duke University and Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital, estimated that between 29,000 and 46,000 of these injuries require complex reconstructive surgery. More than 80 percent of these injuries resulted from explosions, primarily air attacks and shelling in densely populated urban zones.</p><p>The scale of the backlog is staggering. Ash Patel, a surgeon and co-author of the study, noted that even if surgical capacity were miraculously restored to pre-war levels, it would take approximately another decade to work through the estimated backlog of predicted reconstructive cases. Before the escalation, Gaza had only eight board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons for a population exceeding 2.2 million people.</p><h2 id=\"the-collapse-of-the-health-system\">The collapse of the health system</h2><p>The disparity between reconstructive need and capacity is exacerbated by what researchers describe as the “systematic destruction” of medical infrastructure. By May 2025, only 12 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remained capable of providing care beyond basic emergency triage, with approximately 2,000 hospital beds available for the entire population, down from more than 3,000 beds before the war.</p><p>“There is little to no reconstructive surgery capacity left within Gaza,” the research concluded, warning that specialised expertise like microsurgery is almost absent. The clinical challenge is further compounded by Israel’s use of incendiary weapons, which produce severe burns alongside blast-related fractures.</p><p>The long-term effect of these injuries is often irreversible. Without prompt medical treatment, patients face high risks of wound infection, sepsis, and permanent disability. The data indicate that tens of thousands of Palestinians will remain with surgically addressable disabilities for life unless there is a huge international increase in reconstructive capacity and aid.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4013406\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_2-05-1759764785.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_HOSPITALS_DESTROYED_DAMAGED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"the-grey-zone-of-mortality\">The ‘grey zone’ of mortality</h2><p>Writing in The Lancet Global Health, authors Belal Aldabbour and Bilal Irfan observed a growing “grey zone” in mortality where the distinction between direct and indirect death becomes blurred. Patients who die of sepsis months after a blast, or from renal failure after a crushing injury because they cannot access clean water or surgery, occupy a space that risks understating the true lethality of military attacks.</p><p>Conditions have only deteriorated since the data collection periods. By late 2025, forced evacuations covered more than 80 percent of Gaza’s area, with northern Gaza and Rafah governorates facing full razing by Israeli forces. Famine was declared in northern Gaza in August 2025, further reducing the physiological reserve of injured survivors and complicating any surgical recovery.</p><p>This series of independent studies serves as an urgent call for accountability and an immediate cessation of hostilities. “The healthcare infrastructure in Gaza is being repeatedly decimated by attacks despite protection by international humanitarian law,” researchers stated. They underscored that the only way to prevent the reconstructive burden from growing further is an immediate end to attacks against civilians and vital infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Meta may have to pay damages if it loses the case, and the verdict could erode Big Tech’s longstanding legal defence against claims of user harm that liability is on the user and not the platform.</p><p>TikTok and Snap, who were previously named in the case, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached a settlement.</a> TikTok settled the same day the case began for undisclosed terms. Snap settled a week before, also for undisclosed terms.</p><p>The case is the first among a slew of similar ones that allege that social media platforms designed features that the companies knew would addict young consumers and affect their mental health. Families, school districts and states around the US have filed roughly 1,600 lawsuits against various social media giants, including Meta, TikTok, Google and Snap.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The outcome will help determine how to handle the remaining cases. The jury’s decisions will provide guidance,” Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based media law and entertainment lawyer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If the plaintiffs lose and the defendants successfully argue that the platforms are not products, that there is no causation, or that the algorithms had nothing to do with the alleged harm, and that the plaintiffs’ own circumstances are responsible, then Meta and Google’s YouTube will likely take a firmer stance in the remaining cases.”</p><p>Meta has denied the allegations made by KGM.</p><p>“We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most.”</p><p>Meta introduced new safety features in 2025, including, in April, blocking teens under 16 from going live on Instagram. In September, the company launched a school partnership programme that gives educators expedited review of complaints, such as cyberbullying.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s testimony follows Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who appeared in front of the court last week. He said he was unaware of an internal Meta study that showed that there is no link between parental supervision and teens’ attentiveness to their own social media use.</p><p>Teens with difficult life circumstances more often said they used Instagram habitually or unintentionally, according to the document shown at trial.</p><p>Paul Schmidt, one of Meta’s lawyers, did not dispute KGM’s mental health challenges, but argued that Instagram was not a substantial factor in her struggles. He attributed her difficulties to problems at home and said she used social media as a coping mechanism for deeper personal issues.</p><p id=\"the-question-for-the-jury-in-los-angeles-is-whether-instagram-was-a-substantial-factor-in-the-plaintiff-s-mental-health-struggles-the-evidence-will-show-she-faced-many-significant-difficult-challenges-well-before-she-ever-used-social-media-a-meta-spokesperson-added\">“The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles. The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,” a Meta spokesperson added.</p><h2 id=\"wide-ramifications\">Wide ramifications</h2><p>The case itself is seen as one that could fundamentally change social media, with legal experts likening it to lawsuits that faced the tobacco industry decades ago.</p><p>Social media platforms have largely been protected by Section 230, a provision added in 1996 to the Communications Act of 1934. The law protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But this latest case emboldens critics calling for reforms, according to Lovell.</p><p>“Lawmakers may need to carve out greater obligations and duties for internet and social media companies rather than maintain blanket immunity,” Lovell said.</p><p>“With the rise of artificial intelligence and ongoing online abuse, Section 230 has become an enabler for those who want to harm others. Guardrails are needed.”</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock ended the day up 0.61 percent, but is down in after-hours trading at the time of publishing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She shows him in to get his bloodwork done, and then they do not meet for the next few months.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Sanchez said she has been staying up late thinking of S and other patients with complex medical conditions, many of whom she has seen since their childhood. United States President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, would require S and other such patients to fill out paperwork every six months to determine their eligibility for Medi-Cal, the California version of the federally funded medical coverage programme known as Medicaid.</p><p>This is a complex task for patients like S, whose name is being withheld to protect patient privacy.</p><p>“It is hard for him to even grasp the changes,” Sanchez said.</p><p>The OBBBA sought to save $100bn in expenses by asking patients to fill out eligibility paperwork more often, increasing work requirements to maintain coverage for those who can work and eliminating those ineligible.</p><p>“He can’t understand why he has to fill forms so often,” Sanchez said about S. While he has a caretaker for now, she said, “patients like him can just fall through the cracks” in the new system.</p><p>Sanchez belongs to the California branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU-UHW) for health workers, which has proposed a billionaire tax, a one-time 5 percent tax on those who have assets of more than $1bn in the state, to make up for funds lost due to the federal retrenchment.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democrat from Vermont, will launch a campaign at a rally in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening to get 875,000 signatures so the tax can be voted on by California residents in the November midterms. If it passes, it will be applied retroactively from January 1 to anyone who had lived in the state then.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321485\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321485\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Sanchez-1-1771393750.jpeg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321485\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Sanchez-1-1771393750.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Karen Sanchez\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Healthcare worker Karen Sanchez’s union has proposed a billionaire tax to make up for funds lost due to the federal retrenchment [Courtesy SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West]</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed tax has already deeply divided the state.</p><p>Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have reportedly bought houses in Florida and moved some of their companies with a view to shifting their tax status.</p><p>“This isn’t a tax on billionaires; it’s a tax on California’s economy,” said Patrick Kallerman, vice president at the Bay Area Council, a San Francisco-based business association.</p><p>Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, issued a statement ahead of Sanders’ rally saying, “this $100 billion tax increase isn’t just a swipe at California’s most successful entrepreneurs, it’s a tax no one can afford because it weakens the entire economic ecosystem that supports jobs, investment, wages, and public services for everyday Californians.”</p><p>California would be the world’s fourth-largest economy if it were a country, in part due to the technology giants in the Bay Area. Tech billionaires moving away could make the state’s finances precarious.</p><p>Governor Gavin Newsom, who recently announced a nearly $3bn budget deficit, partly due to the federal funding cuts, has already distanced himself from the ballot measure.</p><p>Billionaires should not move out of the state due to a tax that is unlikely to be passed, he told Bloomberg News.</p><p>Bay Area Council’s Kallerman said California should avoid policies that “could unintentionally discourage investment or make it harder for employers to expand here”.</p><p>But even as Sanders launches his statewide campaign this week, Sanchez has already spent most evenings after work at a nearby brewery, collecting the signatures needed by the end of April deadline.</p><h2 id=\"extreme-wealth-masks-deep-poverty\">Extreme wealth masks deep poverty</h2><p>While the impact of the federal restrictions on Medicaid will be felt nationwide, California has 14.5 million recipients, more than any other state in the country.</p><p>More than a third of all its residents and half the children in the state are on Medi-Cal. This is not only because it is the most populous state, but also because it has not been as aggressive on performing eligibility checks as some other states, according to Marc Joffe, the president of the Contra Costa Taxpayers Association and a visiting fellow at the California Policy Center.</p><p>But others believe California’s extreme wealth masks the coexistence of deep poverty. Nearly 200,000 recipients could now lose their coverage due to the increased paperwork, said Suzanne Jiminez, chief of staff at the SEIU-UHW.</p><p>Darien Shanske, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, said it was the “moment of crisis” created by the OBBBA that had pushed him and others to draft the tax on the state’s estimated 200 billionaires. In exploring the various alternatives to make up for the lost funds due to Trump’s bill, he had thought about “the failure of income tax to reach the ultra wealthy”.</p><p>But critics of a billionaire tax, such as the California Policy Center’s Joffe, say that the estimates of those who would lose cover may be overblown.</p><p>For instance, he said, those who can work could be asked to work, get involved in the community or go to college in exchange for their coverage. New undocumented migrants will not be enrolled from this year, and they will have to pay $30 from next year onwards for their coverage.</p><p>“It’s not as big a deal as the unions say,” Joffe told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Most of all, it is the taxing of intangible assets, including equity shares, that has raised hackles. Successful startup founders often have their wealth in the form of equity in their companies, making them billionaires. But imposing a tax on this “punishes people for being innovative”, Joffe said. “There is the emotional aspect of it, the perceived injustice.”</p><p>This sentiment could be at the heart of the flurry of moves out of the state. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is in talks to buy a $200m home in Miami, possibly becoming the latest of several billionaires to move out of California as the prospect of the billionaire tax looms, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Days before the January 1, 2026, applicable date for the tax, should it come into place, Google cofounders terminated or moved 15 related companies from the state, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Billionaires are also funding opposition to the tax. Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, who has also reportedly moved out of the state, donated $3m to a political committee of the California Round Table to oppose the measure. More such donations are expected to flow in.</p><p>But Jiminez of the SEIU-UHW said the idea of a flight of capital and talent “is a scare tactic that will not play out”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A banner bearing portraits of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg with a slogan is seen during a demonstration against the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the eve of the WEF annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2026.

They are also strong sources of employment in these communities.</p><p>Sanchez spent Valentine’s Day evening and most evenings this month at a brewery near her house collecting signatures for the ballot measure from customers, while her kids did homework on a table nearby.</p><p>Daniel Schnur, a political analyst who also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Government Studies, said that “it would be surprising if [the measure] didn’t qualify” for the November ballots. “The timing of it may be very effective.”</p><p>While many voters who have aspired to be wealthy may looked up to Silicon Valley billionaires, they have become more disenchanted, he said.</p><p>A 2025 Harris poll found that 94 percent of respondents said that a wealth gap exists, with corporate tax loopholes being a top driver behind the disparity. Some 71 percent of the respondents said they supported a wealth tax.</p><p>California’s billionaire tax proposal also found support in a poll conducted in January by the Mellman Group for a Republican strategist, with 48 percent respondents saying they supported it and 38 percent saying they did not.</p><p>With opinion deeply divided between the state’s unions on one side and its top taxpayers on the other, Newsom, who is in his final term as governor, could face a difficult balancing act ahead.</p><p>“What is the governor’s plan?” Sanchez asked about the increased paperwork and possible loss of Medi-Cal coverage for many residents.</p><p>Given that the loss of taxpayers due to the proposed billionaire’s tax could have a detrimental impact on the state’s already precarious budget, getting signatures for the measure could be just the beginning of a rocky path ahead.</p><p>“It is likely that Governor Newsom will try to find a legislative solution to this. Legislators could seek to modify the bill if it is acceptable to the movers,” Schnur said.</p><p>California Policy Center’s Joffe said that if the measure gets voted on in November, it could also face legal challenges, and “will be litigated up to the Supreme Court”.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and conservative commentator, has said that with the billionaires moving their homes, the prospect of the tax has already <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/california-billionaire-tax-proposal-hemorrhages-1-trillion-billionaires-flee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led to $1 trillion</a> leaving the state. It is not clear how he arrived at that figure.</p><p>But “this is paper mobility”, said Shanske, the bill’s co-author.</p><p>“People club where there is talent and amenities, and gutting healthcare will make the state less attractive.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The segment in question involves an appearance from Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democrat who is vying for the US Senate.</p><p>The confirmation comes as Carr attempted to shut down claims that the government censored an interview between Talarico and late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert.</p><p>“There was no censorship here at all,” Carr said.</p><p>“Every single broadcaster in this country has an obligation to be responsible for the programming that they choose to air, and they’re responsible whether it complies with FCC rules or not, and it doesn’t, and those individual broadcasters are also going to have a potential liability.”</p><p>The controversy with Colbert likewise stems from the Trump administration’s decision to shift definitions under the “equal time” rule.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-equal-time-rule\">What is the ‘equal time’ rule?</h2><p>The rule is part of section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act. Under that law, if a broadcaster allows one candidate for public office to use its facilities, it is required to “afford equal opportunities” to all other candidates in the same race.</p><p>But the law includes exceptions for “bona fide newscasts” and “bona fide news interviews”.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, talk shows and late-night comedy programmes <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/us-fcc-notice-to-broadcasters-prompts-concerns-on-curtailing-free-speech\">were included</a> in those categories.</p><p>In January, however, the FCC issued new guidance (<a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-68A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) that significantly narrows how it interprets the “bona fide news” exemption. In a memo, it described daytime talk shows and late-night comedy as “entertainment programs” that fall outside the exception.</p><p>“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the memo reads.</p><p>The commission also suggested that many such programmes are “motivated by partisan purposes” and are therefore not “bona fide” news.</p><p>The new interpretation of the “equal time” rule, the FCC argued, is designed to “ensure that no legally qualified candidate for office is unfairly given less access to the public airwaves than their opponent.”</p><h2 id=\"controversy-with-colbert\">Controversy with Colbert</h2><p>That new interpretation came roaring into the spotlight on Monday, after a broadcast of the CBS comedy programme The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p>In one of his opening segments, Colbert alleged that the network lawyers barred him from airing a planned interview that night with Talarico.</p><p>“Let’s just call it what it is,” Colbert told his audience. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time.”</p><p>Trump has previously criticised both Colbert’s show and The View for what he considers a left-wing slant.</p><p>Instead of broadcasting his interview with Talarico on network television, Colbert instead posted the segment on the programme’s YouTube page, where it has gained more than 6 million views as of 3:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday.</p><p>According to Carr, Colbert’s show could have aired the Talarico interview if it had complied with the equal time rule.</p><p>That would have involved allowing other candidates in Texas vying for the Senate seat to come on the show. Carr also suggested that another solution could have been to restrict the broadcast in Texas.</p><p>But the FCC has continued to face criticisms for its actions. In Tuesday’s broadcast, Colbert addressed the issue a second time.</p><p>He read aloud a statement from his broadcast channel that read, in part, that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview” and that it was instead “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule”.</p><p>CBS added, in the statement, that Colbert could have invited onto the show Talarico’s rivals, including fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett.</p><p>“I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert responded. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents.”</p><p>Colbert has been a vocal critic of CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, particularly after it settled a lawsuit last year with the Trump administration for $16m in the run-up to a critical merger for which it needed government approval.</p><p>Talarico, meanwhile, accused the FCC of censoring his interviews. Nevertheless, on Wednesday, he noted that the uptick in media attention from the scandal has helped him gather donations.</p><p>“Our campaign raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the FCC banned our Colbert interview,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2024124888391287234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Milan, jumped and kicked the corner flag in celebration.</p><p>The fans at the 8,000-capacity Aspmyra Stadion were cheering again three minutes later when Hogh scored the third goal after being teed up by Ole Didrik Blomberg.</p><p>The return leg will be next Tuesday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere, Club Brugge’s Christos ⁠Tzolis ⁠tucked away a late equaliser to secure a dramatic 3-3 ⁠draw with Atletico Madrid in their Champions League playoff ⁠first leg on Wednesday as the Belgian side avoided defeat after an agonising own goal appeared to ‌have cost them.</p><p>Tzolis slammed home an angled shot in the 89th minute to level the tie, although the goal was initially ruled out for ⁠offside, but was confirmed ⁠after a VAR check.</p><p>Brugge fought back from a 2-0 half-time deficit to level ⁠the score, but then looked to have ⁠thrown it away ⁠when Joel Ordonez turned the ball into his own net in the 79th minute.</p><p>Yet ‌they head into next Tuesday’s return leg in Madrid with ‌the ‌scores level.</p><p>Bayer Leverkusen striker Patrik ⁠Schick ⁠struck twice in three minutes to steer his team to ⁠a 2-0 victory at Olympiacos in their Champions League last-16 ⁠playoff first leg on Wednesday.</p><p>The Czech forward slipped past his marker and slotted in on the hour ‌mark before quickly bagging a second goal with a downward header from Alex Grimaldo’s corner.</p><p>In the early game on Wednesday, Anthony Gordon struck four ⁠times in ⁠the first half as Newcastle United thrashed Qarabag 6-1 away ⁠in their Champions League playoff first leg to ⁠all but book their place in the last 16.</p><p>Newcastle was 5-0 up by halftime against Qarabag as Gordon completed his hat-trick in 33 minutes at the Tofik Bakhramov Stadium in Baku and got a fourth in first-half added time.</p><p>Malick Thiaw was also on target for the Premier League team, which had 16 shots in a rampant first half.</p><p>Elvin Jafarguliyev pulled one back for Qarabag, which has been one of the surprise stories of this season’s Champions League after qualifying for the playoffs. But Jacob Murphy’s deflected strike completed the rout for Newcastle, which will be the fifth English team in the last 16 if they advance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The UK, which took control of both groups of islands in the early 19th century, detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before granting the latter independence in 1968.</p><p>The UK then forcibly displaced the residents of the islands to establish the Diego Garcia base.</p><p>Mauritius won its legal battle for sovereignty over the islands in 2019, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) urged the UK to cede control. This was followed by a UN resolution giving the UK six months to hand the islands back.</p><p>The UK will maintain a 99-year lease of Diego Garcia with an option to extend, which will cost about 100 million pounds ($135m) a year.</p><p>A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said on Wednesday that the deal was “crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe”.</p><p>“The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>Trump’s comments mark the latest in the UK-US diplomatic rollercoaster over the deal.</p><p>The UK has said it had no choice but to make a deal after international court decisions threatened its ability to maintain the base under previous arrangements.</p><p>Washington last year gave its blessing to the agreement, but in January, Trump described it as an act of “great stupidity”. Earlier in February, he then said he understood the deal was the best Starmer could make, but added he would retain the right to “militarily secure” the base if needed.</p><p>On Tuesday, the US Department of State issued a statement which stated its backing for the deal.</p><p>“The United States supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago,” the statement said, announcing talks between the US and Mauritius next week.</p><p>In his Truth Social post on Wednesday, the president went on to warn that “it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack” from Iran, should it decide against making a deal on its nuclear programme with the US.</p><p>Describing the lease as tenuous, he said that the UK must “remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them”.</p><p>Diego Garcia serves as a key military base in the Indian Ocean for the US and UK.</p><p>Recent operations launched from Diego Garcia include attacks against the Houthis in Yemen in 2024 and 2025 and attacks against the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001.</p><p>Up to 2,000 Chagossians were forcibly removed from the archipelago in the 1960s and 1970s and resettled mainly in Mauritius and the UK.</p><p>The deal has been criticised by some Chagossians who accuse Mauritius of decades of neglect, an allegation Mauritius denies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2026/2/10/palestine-urges-powerful-partner-to-stop-west-bank-annexation-by-israel\">Israel’s security cabinet greenlighted measures</a> making it easier for Israelis to seize Palestinian land and directly buy property in the West Bank, while expanding Israel’s military control in the area, home to roughly 3.4 million Palestinians.</p><p>Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the measures amount to “de facto sovereignty” that will block the establishment of a Palestinian state, while Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich pledged to also “encourage” Palestinian “emigration” out of the territory.</p><p>The push comes as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a wave of intensified attacks by Israeli troops and settlers in the shadow of the country’s genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>On Wednesday, four Palestinians were wounded – two of them with live ammunition – during a settler attack in the village of Mukhmas, near occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-gaza-plan\">Trump’s Gaza plan</h2><p>Several diplomats addressed the UNSC on Wednesday, stressing the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in Gaza, who continue to face Israeli attacks.</p><p>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since a US-brokered “ceasefire” came into effect in the enclave in October, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.</p><p>Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said during the council meeting that the “ceasefire” has reduced hostilities while “the scope and the scale of humanitarian assistance” is growing daily.</p><p>While aspects of the Trump-backed plan for Gaza have moved forward, including Hamas releasing all the Israeli captives it was holding and increased amounts of humanitarian supplies getting into the territory, the UN says the level of aid remains insufficient.</p><p>A new technocratic committee has also been appointed to administer Gaza’s daily affairs.</p><p>But the most challenging steps lie ahead, including the deployment of an international security force, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">the disarmament of Hamas</a> and rebuilding Gaza.</p><p>Trump said this week that the Board of Peace members have pledged $5bn towards Gaza reconstruction and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilisation and police forces for the territory.</p><p>Indonesia’s military says up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.</p><p>“We call on all parties to support the Board of Peace,” Waltz said at the UN meeting on Wednesday. “Tomorrow, the Board of Peace will host its inaugural meeting in Washington, with a focus on bringing peace and security.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
