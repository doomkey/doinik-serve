However, that is still below the 3.3 percent growth it had projected for both years in January and the pre-pandemic historical average of 3.7 percent.</p><p>It said global headline inflation was expected to fall to 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026, but noted that inflation would likely remain above target in the US as <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/29/procter-and-gamble-to-raise-prices-to-offset-tariff-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tariffs passed through to consumers</a> in the second half of the year.</p><p>The US effective tariff rate – measured by import duty revenue as a proportion of goods imports – has dropped since April, but remains far higher than its estimated level of 2.5 percent in early January. The corresponding tariff rate for the rest of the world is 3.5 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in April, the IMF said.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has upended global trade by imposing <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/trumps-10-percent-tariff-takes-effect-raising-fears-of-global-trade-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a universal tariff of 10 percent</a> on nearly all countries since April and threatening even higher duties to kick in on Friday. Far higher tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the US and China were put on hold until August 12, with talks in Stockholm this week potentially leading to a further extension.</p><p>The US has also announced steep duties ranging from 25 percent to <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/4/donald-trumps-50-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs-take-effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 percent</a> on automobiles, steel and other metals, with higher duties soon to be announced on pharmaceuticals, lumber, and semiconductor chips.</p><p>Such future tariff increases are not reflected in the IMF numbers, and could raise effective tariff rates further, creating bottlenecks and amplifying the effect of higher tariffs, the IMF said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"shifting-tariffs\">Shifting tariffs</h2><p>Gourinchas said the IMF was evaluating new 15-percent tariff deals reached by the US with the <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/27/us-and-eu-agree-on-trade-tariffs-to-avert-economic-standoff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Union</a> and Japan over the past week, which came too late to factor into the July forecast, but said the tariff rates were similar to the 17.3 percent rate underlying the IMF’s forecast.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Right now, we are not seeing a major change compared to the effective tariff rate that the US is imposing on other countries,” he said, adding it was not yet clear if these agreements would last.</p><p>“We’ll have to see whether these deals are sticking, whether they’re unravelled, whether they’re followed by other changes in trade policy,” he said.</p><p>Staff simulations showed that global growth in 2025 would be roughly 0.2 percentage point lower if the maximum tariff rates announced in April and July were implemented, the IMF said.</p><p>The IMF said the global economy was proving resilient for now, but uncertainty remained high and current economic activity suggested “distortions from trade, rather than underlying robustness”.</p><p>Gourinchas said the 2025 outlook had been helped by what he called “a tremendous amount” of front-loading as businesses tried to get ahead of the tariffs, but he warned that the stockpiling boost would not last.</p><p>“That is going to fade away,” he said, adding, “That’s going to be a drag on economic activity in the second half of the year and into 2026. There is going to be pay back for that front loading, and that’s one of the risks we face.”</p><p>Tariffs were expected to remain high, he said, pointing to signs that US consumer prices were starting to edge higher.</p><p>“The underlying tariff is much higher than it was back in January, February. If that stays … that will weigh on growth going forward, contributing to a really lackluster global performance.”</p><p>One unusual factor has been a depreciation of the dollar, not seen during previous trade tensions, Gourinchas said, noting that the lower dollar was adding to the tariff shock for other countries, while also helping ease financial conditions.</p><p>US growth was expected to reach 1.9 percent in 2025, up 0.1 percentage point from April’s outlook, edging up to 2 percent in 2026. A new US tax cut and spending law was expected to increase the US fiscal deficit by 1.5 percentage points, with tariff revenues offsetting that by about half, the IMF said.</p><p>It lifted its forecast for the euro area by 0.2 percentage point to 1 percent in 2025, and left the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.2 percent. The IMF said the upward revision reflected a historically large surge in Irish pharmaceutical exports to the US; without it, the revision would have been half as big.</p><p>China’s outlook got a bigger upgrade of 0.8 percentage point, reflecting stronger-than-expected activity in the first half of the year, and the significant reduction in US-China tariffs after Washington and Beijing declared a temporary truce.</p><p>The IMF increased its forecast for Chinese growth in 2026 by 0.2 percentage point to 4.2 percent.</p><p>Overall, growth is expected to reach 4.1 percent in emerging markets and developing economies in 2025, edging lower to 4 percent in 2026, it said.</p><p>The IMF revised its forecast for world trade up by 0.9 percentage point to 2.6 percent, but cut its forecast for 2026 by 0.6 percentage point to 1.9 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Greene, however, is one of the most prominent faces of Trump’s right-wing Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, there has been increasing international pressure to denounce the Israeli blockade on Gaza, which has limited the entry of basic supplies into the territory.</p><p>In recent days, images of emaciated Palestinian children and evidence of mass hunger in Gaza have sharpened the criticism against Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/horrors-upon-horrors-how-us-congress-responded-to-mass-hunger-in-gaza\">in US politics</a>.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Last week, Congressman John Garamendi, a Democrat, also suggested that Israel’s policies amount to genocide.</p><p>“It’s impossible to look at the starvation caused by Israel’s dangerous and willful failure to enable humanitarian aid and not see a genocide being committed against the people of Palestine,” said Garamendi.</p><p>The US provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, as well as diplomatic backing at international forums. The Trump administration has nevertheless been reluctant to criticise Israel over its atrocities and blockade in Gaza.</p><p>Amid that anger, Fine — another <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/trump-backs-staunchly-anti-muslim-florida-lawmaker-to-run-for-us-congress\">Trump ally</a> — sparked outrage last week when he appeared to endorse Israel’s starvation campaign in Gaza while also dismissing it as “Muslim terror propaganda”.</p><p>“Release the hostages,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/RepFine/status/1947635219869139083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in a social media post earlier this week. “Until then, starve away.”</p><p>Fine, who was elected to Congress earlier this year with the endorsement of Trump and the support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has a history of Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian positions.</p><p>For example, in 2021, when a commenter sent Fine a photo of a dead Palestinian child and asked him how he sleeps at night, Fine offered a glib <a href=\"https://x.com/VoteRandyFine/status/1400916571892105221?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">response</a>: “Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!”</p><p>In September of last year, he also appeared to praise the killing of <a href=\"/news/2024/9/13/light-in-any-room-friends-hail-aysenur-eygi-us-citizen-killed-by-israel\">Aysenur Ezgi Eygi</a>, a US activist who was fatally shot by the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>“Throw rocks, get shot. One less #MuslimTerror ist. #FireAway,” Fine <a href=\"https://x.com/VoteRandyFine/status/1832198747495002573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in a social media post at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier in July, top Democrats in the House of Representatives called Fine “unhinged, racist and Islamophobic” over a social media attack on Muslim American Congresswoman <a href=\"/news/2021/8/12/aipac-accused-of-islamophobia-after-attacks-on-ilhan-omar\">Ilhan Omar</a>.</p><p>Fine had responded to Omar’s criticism of Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/netanyahu-trump-discuss-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-out-of-gaza\">Benjamin Netanyahu’s</a> visit to Washington, DC, by saying: “I’m sure it is difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your fellow Muslim terrorists.”</p><p>But the Republican congressman’s recent comments on the starvation in Gaza appear to have gone too far, even for some of Israel’s staunchest supporters.</p><p>The American Jewish Committee (AJC), a pro-Israel advocacy group, slammed Fine’s remarks last week.</p><p>“Implying that starvation is a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/israeli-attacks-forced-starvation-kill-more-than-70-palestinians-in-gaza\">legitimate tactic</a> is unacceptable,” AJC <a href=\"https://x.com/AJCGlobal/status/1948021021916729806\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response to Fine’s post.</p><p>“All those in need of humanitarian aid should receive it promptly and safely. Our leaders must focus less on scoring political points and more on doing their jobs.”</p><p>For her part, Greene warned that Fine’s “awful statement will actually cause more anti-Semitism”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We left with nothing but the clothes on our backs until we reached the nearest, safest village,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>An epicentre of conflict</h3><p>Sudan’s regular army, known as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), has fought a bloody civil war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since April 2023.</p><p>The conflict produced the worst humanitarian crisis in the world by most measures before the RSF’s recent attacks in North Kordofan, a strategic region in southern Sudan.</p><p>Over the last several weeks, the RSF has raided villages and scorched families to death. They have also shot and killed pregnant women and children, according to the Emergency Lawyers, a local monitor.</p><p>The violence has pushed tens of thousands of people to seek refuge in SAF-controlled el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan.</p><p>Hamisa and her family are struggling to survive after reaching the city on July 15. Like most displaced people, she is living in an overcrowded hut with barely enough food and clean water.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In addition, those displaced fear the RSF is trying to reimpose a siege on el-Obeid and then invade the city, a concern shared by analysts and relief workers.</p><p>“People all around us are still traumatised by the RSF. The children with us are very scared. They think the RSF will enter [el-Obeid],” Hamisa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A siege would exacerbate the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in el-Obeid and eliminate a key SAF logistics hub.</p><p>The SAF relies on el-Obeid to carry out air strikes against the RSF in the western region of Darfur, as well as to keep RSF fighters a safe distance away from the capital Khartoum, according to Nathaniel Raymond, who follows conflict dynamics in Sudan as head of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>“If SAF loses el-Obeid … they would lose a lot of their ability to project force outside of Khartoum,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3863375\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3863375\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3863375\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-Who-controls-what-in-Sudan-JULY-29-2025-copy-3-1753798269.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive map Sudan el-Obeid\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3863375\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A map showing areas under control by the RSF and SAF in and around the strategic city of el-Obeid in North Kordofan [Interactive/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h3>Strategic hub</h3><p>Back in February, the SAF managed to break the RSF’s chokehold siege over el-Obeid, providing much-needed relief to its units and fighters.</p><p>El-Obeid is located some 529 kilometres (329 miles) from North Darfur’s capital el-Fasher, where SAF forces and hundreds of thousands of civilians are currently besieged by the RSF.</p><p>Any hope of carrying out a rescue mission to break the siege requires that the SAF maintain control over el-Obeid, explained Raymond.</p><p>He added that holding on to the city would also protect Khartoum from being overwhelmed by RSF drone strikes.</p><p>Yet the looming onset of Sudan’s rainy season – accompanied by heavy fog and preceding heavy rainfall  – could give the RSF an opportunity to mount a major assault. The rainy season is arriving in Sudan late this year, but forecasts suggest it could start in the coming days or weeks, said Raymond.</p><p>“SAF pilots look out the window of their planes [when dropping bombs]. They do not have laser guidance [because they fly old planes]. When the clouds come, it’ll be an operational advantage for the RSF,” Raymond told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“[The start of the rainy season] is the sweet spot,” he added. “The roads aren’t saturated yet and the valleys aren’t full [of rain], so the RSF will have cloud cover without any impact on their manoeuvrability.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3838234\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3838234\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24162280843036-1752557353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sudanese soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces unit.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3838234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sudanese soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces unit, led by General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy head of the military council, secure the area where Dagalo attends a military-backed tribe’s rally, in the East Nile province, Sudan, on June 22, 2019 [Hussein Malla/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Any attack on el-Obeid would be catastrophic for the roughly 137,000 people seeking refuge in the city, a figure disclosed to Al Jazeera by Emmanuel Ufot, the director of Emergency Programs in North Sudan for Mercy Corps, one of the few global relief agencies active in North Kordofan.</p><p>He added that civilians would have to flee to Kosti in White Nile state if the RSF attacks el-Obeid, since all other exit points would be besieged and closed off.</p><p>Kosti is about 265 kilometres (165 miles) away from el-Obeid.</p><p>“We have to factor in the women, babies, elderly and disabled. These are people that will not be able to run when there is a lot of conflict,” Ufot told Al Jazeera.</p><h3>No safe haven</h3><p>Another pressing concern is the severe lack of humanitarian relief for civilians, according to relief workers.</p><p>Ufot from Mercy Corps said that only about 5 percent of the displaced in el-Obeid have a sturdy roof over their head because they are taking shelter in a school.</p><p>The rest live in huts or without any shelter at all.</p><p>With the rainy season coming, flooding and overcrowding could lead to the rapid spread of preventable diseases like cholera, a waterborne illness that has already infected tens of thousands of people in Sudan. Children are particularly vulnerable to cholera.</p><p>The RSF is compounding the crisis by firing drones and heavy artillery at civilian targets such as homes, basic services  – like power stations, and hospitals, according to Yousef Hederby, a local volunteer.</p><p>“El-Obeid is subjected to a lot of artillery shelling [from the RSF]. And the shelling hits civilian homes and residential areas,” Hederby told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added that four people were killed and some 20 were injured by the indiscriminate shelling in mid-July. He noted the violence came after the RSF killed more than 300 people in villages located near el-Obeid in North Kordofan between July 12 and July 15.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent written questions to the RSF’s press office asking the group to respond to credible reports that it has intentionally targeted civilians and carried out mass killings in recent weeks.</p><p>The RSF did not respond before publication.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hamisa, the elderly woman who already survived one mass killing, fears she will not survive a second if the RSF enters el-Obeid.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera that the ongoing war in Sudan is worse than the civil war in the 1990s, referring to the north-south conflict that eventually divided Sudan into two countries in 2011.</p><p>“There were limits to the civil war in the 1990s. Our village wasn’t in a lot of danger at the time,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But this war has spread to every village and area in Sudan. There is a safe place in Kordofan,” she added.</p><p>“We are all very scared.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>It has been a year since the Southport attack, which triggered furious racist riots in the streets of the United Kingdom. Unruly crowds, galvanised by false claims that the perpetrator was Muslim, went on a rampage, attacking mosques, Muslim-owned businesses, homes, and individuals they perceived as Muslim.</p><p>As the riots were raging, I was finishing my novel, The Second Coming. The book is set in a dystopian future in which a Christian militia inspired by English nationalism seizes London, bans Islam, and exiles Muslims to refugee camps in Birmingham. The events unfolding in the streets as I was writing the final chapters made me realise that today, we are much closer to the dystopian world in my novel than I had imagined.</p><p>The scenes and images that helped me shape this fictional world were inspired by the England I lived in during my youth, when racist violence was rampant. Gangs of white youth would hunt us down, especially after the pubs closed, in wave after wave of what they called “Paki bashing”.</p><p>Knife attacks and fire bombings were not uncommon, nor were the demands by far-right groups, such as the National Front and the British National Party, for the repatriation of Black (ie, non-white) “immigrants”.</p><p>Attending school sometimes meant running through a gauntlet of racist kids. In the playground, sometimes they swarmed around, chanting racist songs.</p><p>As a student, I lost count of the number of times I was physically attacked, at school, in the street, or in pubs and other places. When I lived in East London, I was with the local youth of Brick Lane, where hand-to-hand fighting took place to stop hordes of racist attackers. These assaults were not an isolated phenomenon. Similar scenes took place across the country, with the National Front and British National Party organising hundreds of marches, emboldening white supremacist gangs.</p><p>Around this time, some of my peers and I were arrested and charged with “conspiracy to make explosives” for filling up milk bottles with petrol as a way of defending our communities against racist violence; our case came to be known as the Bradford 12. These struggles, whether in Brick Lane or Bradford, were part of a broader fight against systemic racism and far-right ideologies that sought to terrorise and divide us.</p><p>The overt, street-level violence of those years was terrifying, but it came from the margins of society. The ruling political class, though complicit, avoided openly aligning with these groups. A case in point is Margaret Thatcher, who in 1978, as the leader of the Conservative Party, gave an infamous interview in which she said, “People are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.” It was a subtle nod of approval for racist mobs, but as prime minister, Thatcher still kept far-right groups at an arm’s length.</p><p>Today, that distance has disappeared. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other prominent members of Labour regularly echo far-right rhetoric, promising to “crack down” on those seeking sanctuary here. His Conservative predecessor, Rishi Sunak, and his ministers were not different. His Home Minister Suella Braverman falsely claimed grooming gangs had a “predominance” of “British Pakistani males, who hold cultural values totally at odds with British values”.</p><p>While the old crude white racism has not disappeared, a more vicious form – Islamophobia – has been fanned over the past few decades. It feels like the old “Paki” bashing gangs have been replaced by a new crusading wave that equates Islam with terrorism; sexual abuse with Pakistanis; asylum seekers with parasitic hordes about to overrun the country.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>This is the soil in which the Reform Party has taken root and flourished, in which ever cruder forms of racism are made respectable and electable. When both Labour and the Tories have become havens for a complex web of political corruption, Reform’s simple anti-migrant and Islamophobic tropes are projected as an honest alternative. This has propelled the far-right party to the top of polls, with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/local-elections-reform-labour-tories-poll-b2739478.html\">30 percent</a> of voters supporting it, compared with 22 percent for Labour and 17 for the Conservatives.</p><p>In this environment, it was rather unsurprising that for the anniversary of the riots, the Economist magazine decided to run a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/07/24/seven-in-ten-britons-expect-more-riots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> focusing on race rather than on issues of economic decline, social deprivation and the never-ending austerity to which the working people of this country have been subjected. The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of the population think that multiculturalism is not good for the country, while 73 percent thought more “race riots” will happen soon.</p><p>The nurturing of violent racism at home has run parallel with England’s long history of enacting it abroad. The new face of racism is fed on old imperial tropes of savages that need to be tamed and defeated by civilised colonial rule. These racist ideologies, which welded the empire together, have come back home to roost.</p><p>They are playing out in the racist violence on the streets and in the state’s repression of Palestine supporters. They are also playing out in the UK’s unwavering political and military support for Israel, even as it bombs hospitals and schools in Gaza and starves children. Empire taught Britain to use racism to dehumanise entire peoples, to justify colonialism, to plunder, to spread war and famine. Genocide is in Britain’s DNA, which explains its present-day collusion with genocidal Israel.</p><p>Against this backdrop of racist, imperial violence, people of all colours and religions and none have mobilised. While they may not have stopped the genocide, they have laid bare the hypocritical barefaced lies of the British political elite. Only this sort of solidarity and challenge to racism can stop the dystopic world of my book becoming a reality.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The attack was captured on video, and the shooter was identified as Yinon Levi, a settler previously sanctioned by the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States under the Biden administration.</p><p>Hathaleen, aged 31, was a beloved activist and teacher from <a href=\"/features/2025/7/10/west-bank-palestinians-prepare-to-lose-homes-as-israel-pushes-for-expulsion\">Masafer Yatta</a> in the South Hebron Hills. He also played a supporting role in <a href=\"/news/2025/3/3/israeli-palestinian-film-no-other-land-wins-oscar-for-best-documentary\">the Oscar-winning film No Other Land</a>, which depicts the story of his village, subjected to relentless attacks from settlers and settler-aligned soldiers for decades.</p><p>Hathaleen’s killing is far from isolated. He is one of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/israel-has-killed-1000-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-since-october-7-2023\">more than 1,000 Palestinians</a> killed in the West Bank since the genocide in Gaza began in October 2023. This surge in violence coincides with a sharp rise in Palestinian land seizures and home demolitions. The Israeli government has used the genocide in Gaza as cover to accelerate its takeover plans for the West Bank. Just days before entering its three-month summer recess, the Israeli Knesset passed a non-binding motion to annex the entire territory.</p><p>The Knesset’s motion comes one year after the July 2024 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that Israel’s ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories it seized in 1967 is illegal and must end. The court ordered the Israeli regime to dismantle settlements, provide reparations and facilitate the return of displaced Palestinians, setting September 2025 as the deadline.</p><p>In the months leading up to the ICJ ruling, countries including Australia, France, the UK and Canada announced sanctions on a handful of settlers and entities involved in the settlement enterprise. Hathaleen’s killer, Yinon Levi, was among those sanctioned. Yet, as expected, travel bans and financial restrictions imposed by these countries have had no impact on the ground. Levi continued his attacks on Palestinians from his illegal settler outpost, operating under full army protection.</p><p>Not only have these sanctions had no impact, but by singling out a few settlers rather than addressing the broader machinery of settler colonialism, they also allow the Israeli regime to escape accountability by presenting settler violence as an aberration rather than an extension of state policy.</p><p>By deliberately distinguishing between “extremist” settlers and the rest of the Israeli regime, states implement token measures that enable them to posture as defenders of international law while avoiding any confrontation with the regime itself.</p><p>The reality is that Israel operates as a settlement enterprise, and its state policy has always been to expand its territory across all of Historical Palestine and beyond, as demonstrated by the occupation of parts of southern Syria and Lebanon over the last two years.</p><p>Today, more than 700,000 settlers reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem across more than 250 settlements and outposts, all of which violate international law and are sustained by state infrastructure, security forces and planning agencies. This expansion has been enabled by hollow measures such as the sanctioning of Levi, where targeting a few individuals serves only to shield the regime responsible for the very system they uphold.</p><p>This political theatre is utterly absurd. One cannot meaningfully sanction settler violence while maintaining full diplomatic, economic and military support for a regime that is, by definition, a settler regime. The settler and the state are inseparable. To sanction one while legitimising the other is not accountability; it is complicity. Hathaleen’s murder is not an anomaly but the direct outcome of this system, one that is protected, financed and excused by the same states that claim to oppose it. Such actions do not challenge the status quo; they entrench and normalise it. Breaking this cycle requires states to end their support for Israel’s genocidal regime of settlement and occupation altogether, through comprehensive sanctions and real accountability that targets the system, not just its murderous foot soldiers.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

On Sunday, the US president scored his biggest victory to date, as European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, like the leader of a vassal state paying homage to an emperor, travelled to Trump’s private golf course in Scotland to offer him tribute.</p><p>It came in the form of an entirely one-sided tariff pact in which Brussels accepted a huge tariff hike and pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on US fossil fuels and military products.</p><p>The pact has changed the balance between two of the largest economic powers in the world. The EU has simply rolled over without a fight. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as a “dark day” for the union, while a European diplomat bemoaned by saying “those who don’t hang together get hanged separately.”</p><p>The economic impact on the rest of the world is likely to be worse still. Trump has declared economic war on friends and foes alike. Many countries are facing higher tariffs than the EU and are less capable of defending themselves. By giving in, Brussels has made it harder for other countries to stand firm.</p><p>A 40 percent tariff on Laos or 36 percent on Cambodia, for example, will be devastating to the export industries which US corporations encouraged them to build in recent decades. And without a united front, other countries are reluctantly coming to the table.</p><p>Last week, Trump announced a deal with the Philippines for 19 percent tariffs on all goods exported to the US and no tariffs on imported US goods; it was unclear if Manilla had fully agreed to the arrangement before the US president made it public. Indonesia’s deal is even worse, with the country forced to give up controls on its critical mineral exports and aspects of its emerging digital sector – both of which are critical to its economic development. For Brazil, US demands go beyond the economic realm, with Washington going as far as trying to interfere in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p><p>While the provisions of different trade deals vary, they all follow the same strategy: Bullying governments to change their rules and regulations in favour of US corporate interests, especially those of oligarchs who surround the president.</p><p>Trump’s trade negotiations style might be highly erratic, but his is a clear-cut end goal: To upend the world economic system, replacing rules which were already unfair with the absolute dominance of the biggest bully.</p><p>The immediate impact of this restructuring will be bad for the countries that submit to it, but this won’t be the end of the story. By giving Trump what he wants, they have strengthened his hand, and he will be back for more.</p><p>Already, the EU has little clarity around a range of additional tariffs the US president might bring in and how they will affect the “deal” that’s been made. Canada ditched its digital services tax on Big Tech to get a deal, only to be hit by higher tariffs. The Philippines now faces a higher tariff than it did in April, despite making concessions. And the UK thought it had a deal on steel, only to discover it didn’t, really.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>There’s no fairness in any of this. The only way out is to stand up to Trump; he does not respect weakness.</p><p>As a minimum, for countries that have signed a deal, that means implementing as little as they can. Governments that can retaliate should do so. That does not necessarily mean matching tariff for tariff, a policy which could inflict serious self-harm, but rather using the tools that show their strength best.</p><p>The EU has ample power to challenge the US services trade, and should have retaliated by limiting US corporate access to, for example, government contracts, financial markets and intellectual property protection.</p><p>In failing to take such action, the EU showed a profound misunderstanding of the moment we’re in. Von der Leyen seems to think Trump is a temporary anomaly who can be contained while we wait for a resumption of business as usual in four years.</p><p>But in Europe and the US, the public has had enough of a corporate-dominated global economy. There’s no return to that world. Retaliatory policies like the ones mentioned above can not only maximise the pain directed at Trump’s oligarchic friends, but they can also help unwind the power of the monopolies which are at the heart of our deeply unfair, unsustainable economy.</p><p>This last point is important. Because if we want Trump gone, as millions of Americans do, we will not get there by handing him unnecessary victories. Trump won power by building a bridge between those angry at a corporate-dominated economy and the corporate barons themselves. It was an impressive feat. But the alliance will only last as long as he’s winning.</p><p>The question now is how governments can best protect their economies long-term, and that must come through regaining sovereignty, not handing it over to the bully in the White House. What’s more, such action can show Trump for the corporate lobbyist he really is and lay a path to his eventual downfall.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
