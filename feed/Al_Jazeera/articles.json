A bail bondsman – also known as a bond agent – is an individual or company who provides a financial guarantee to a court that a defendant will appear at all required court hearings after being released from jail.</p><p>Cole lives in a single-family household in Woodbridge with his mother and “other family members”. He is described as being 5 feet 6 inches tall (168cm) and wearing corrective eyeglasses.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-cole-charged-with\">What is Cole charged with?</h2><p>Cole is charged with transporting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in interstate commerce – referring to transferring goods from one state to another – with the intent to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property.</p><p>Additionally, Cole is charged with attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-pipe-bomb\">What is a pipe bomb?</h2><p>Pipe bombs are a type of IED – any homemade or non-standard bomb constructed and deployed outside of conventional military production.</p><p>Typically, a plastic, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, sealed at each end with a cap or plug, is packed with an explosive substance – usually a powder or chemical. Pipe bombs are generally equipped with a fuse, timer or remote trigger.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-cole-alleged-to-have-done\">What is Cole alleged to have done?</h2><p>At about 1pm (18:00 GMT) on January 6, 2021, US law enforcement agencies were alerted to a suspected IED having been placed in the vicinity of the Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters in Washington, DC.</p><p>About 15 minutes later, a second IED was reported close to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Washington, DC, a few blocks away from the RNC.</p><p>According to the affidavit, both IEDs were pipe bombs made from 1‑inch by 8‑inch (2.5-20cm) pipes with end caps, containing red and black 14‑gauge electrical wires connected by alligator clips to a nine‑volt battery and battery connector, a white kitchen timer, paper clips, steel wool and homemade black powder.</p><p>The RNC and DNC are nationwide party organisations that fundraise for their respective political parties across state lines.</p><p>Members of the Hazardous Devices Section of the United States Capitol Police (USCP) deactivated both bombs before they exploded.</p><h2 id=\"do-we-know-cole-s-motive\">Do we know Cole’s motive?</h2><p>No. Authorities have not yet revealed the motive behind Cole’s actions.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-cole-identified\">How was Cole identified?</h2><p>Surveillance footage from the streets in the area showed that both bombs were placed by the same individual who was wearing a mask to obscure his face. He has now been identified as Cole.</p><p>From the video footage, the FBI deduced in January 2021 that the suspect was about 5 feet, 7 inches (170cm) tall.</p><p>In March 2021, the FBI released the surveillance footage online and offered a $500,000 reward for information about the suspect. The agency received thousands of tips in the years that followed.</p><p>The FBI said it received thousands of tips about him in the years-long investigation.</p><p>The FBI then matched Cole’s cellphone records to cell towers in the Capitol Hill area at about the time the bombs were planted. Additionally, they linked him to purchases of bomb components through bank and credit card information from 2019 and 2020, showing where he had made these purchases.</p><p>“We do not forget, we do not give up, and we do not relent. Though it had been nearly five years, our team continued to churn through massive amounts of data and tips that we used to identify this suspect,” said Darren Cox, a deputy assistant director in the FBI.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-on-january-6-2021\">What happened on January 6, 2021?</h2><p>On January 6, 2021, thousands of people descended on the US Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. They were spurred on by false claims that the previous November’s presidential election, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden, had been “rigged” against Republican incumbent Donald Trump.</p><p>More than 2,000 rioters broke into the Capitol building, forced their way inside, invaded congressional offices, smashed windows, damaged furniture and equipment and stole items.</p><p>Several people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/6/packing-up-our-things-january-6-prisoners-prepare-for-trump-pardons\">at least five people</a> died.</p><p>Thousands of people were arrested, and more than 950 people were charged with federal crimes relating to the riot, with some facing accusations of seditious conspiracy – a rare but serious offence.</p><p>Hundreds of people received prison sentences – most between three and seven years.</p><p>However, some who were affiliated with far-right extremist groups received longer sentences of between 15 and 22 years in federal prison.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In January 2025, shortly after he began his second term as president, Trump signed a presidential proclamation pardoning or commuting sentences for 1,500 defendants.</p><p>He said at the time: “These people have been destroyed. What they’ve done to these people is outrageous. There’s rarely been anything like it in the history of our country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the investigation into Cole’s role in the January 6 riots is continuing and further charges may be filed.</p><p>Local media have reported that he will appear in federal court in Washington, DC, later this week for a hearing.</p><p>If convicted, the charges he faces could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison – the maximum sentence for IED offences.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two nuclear-armed neighbours fought a brief four-day air war in May, further straining relations.</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">Meanwhile, ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have also deteriorated sharply following the ouster of former <a href=\"/features/2025/11/18/why-india-likely-wont-return-hasina-to-face-bangladesh-death-penalty\">Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> in August last year. Hasina fled to India after being deposed in a popular uprising, and New Delhi has so far refused to send the former PM back to Bangladesh, where she was convicted by a tribunal in November of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death.</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">But will most other South Asian nations — SAARC consists of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan and Afghanistan — agree to a new regional grouping that appears aimed at cutting India out, or at least limiting its influence?</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">Here is what you need to know:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-pakistan-s-proposal\" data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">What is Pakistan’s proposal?</h2><p data-start=\"68\" data-end=\"622\">Deputy Prime Minister Dar, who is also Pakistan’s foreign minister, said the trilateral initiative with Bangladesh and China aimed to “foster mutual collaboration” in areas of shared interest, and that the concept be “expanded and duplicated” to include more countries and regions.</p><p>“As I have said before, there could be groups with variable geometry on issues from economy to technology to connectivity,” he told the conclave in Islamabad.</p><p>“Our own national development needs and regional priorities cannot – and should not – be held hostage to anyone’s rigidity, and you know where I am referring to,” he said, in an apparent reference to India.</p><p>On tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, Dar pointed out that a “structured dialogue” process between India and Pakistan has remained in limbo “for over 11 years”, adding that other regional states have had their share of a “seesaw relationship with our neighbour India”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The foreign minister said Pakistan envisions a South Asia where links and cooperation replace “divisions, economies grow in synergy, disputes are resolved peacefully in accordance with international legitimacy, and where peace is maintained with dignity and honour”.</p><p>According to academic Rabia Akhtar, the proposal at this stage is likely “more aspirational than operational”.</p><p>“But it signals Pakistan’s intent to diversify and reimagine regional cooperation mechanisms at a time when SAARC remains paralysed,” Akhtar, director at the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research (CSSPR) at the University of Lahore, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-regional-organisation-saarc\">What is the regional organisation SAARC?</h2><p>SAARC was established in 1985 at a summit in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p><p>Its seven founding members were Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan joined to become the eighth member in 2007.</p><p>According to its website, the objectives of SAARC include improving the welfare and quality of life of South Asians, generating economic growth and cultural development.</p><p>Despite its lofty ambitions, the organisation has struggled to achieve its goals over the past 40 years, in large part due to the decades-long tensions between India and Pakistan, who have fought three full-scale wars since their independence from the British in 1947, which also coincided with the partition of the subcontinent.</p><p>The 19th SAARC summit in 2016, scheduled to be hosted by Islamabad, was indefinitely postponed after India pulled out, citing a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir and holding Pakistan responsible.</p><p>“The organisation requires consensus to function, and without political willingness from the two largest members to separate regional cooperation from bilateral disputes, SAARC cannot move forward,” CSSPR’s Akhtar said.</p><p>The last summit of the regional body <a href=\"/opinions/2014/11/28/a-disappointing-saarc-summit\">was held in 2014 in Kathmandu</a>, Nepal. However, analysts say while SAARC remains dormant, the organisation has potential to deliver for the region — if India and Pakistan allow it to.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-saarc-important\">Why is SAARC important?</h2><p>As of 2025, SAARC countries make up more than two billion of the world’s population, making South Asia the world’s most densely populated region.</p><p>Yet, trade within South Asia is minimal, representing only about 5 percent of the region’s overall commerce, around $23bn, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/south-asia-regional-integration/trade?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">the World Bank has said</a>. By contrast, trade between member states of ASEAN, a bloc of 11 Southeast Asian nations home to about 700 million people, represents 25 percent of their international commerce, the Washington-based institution noted.</p><p>South Asian nations could exchange goods worth $67bn – three times their current trade – if they reduced barriers, the World Bank estimates.</p><p>Trade between India and Pakistan, in particular, remains dismal. In the financial year <a href=\"/news/2025/5/1/the-10bn-india-pakistan-trade-secret-hidden-by-official-data\">2017-2018</a>, official trade between the two neighbours stood at a mere $2.41bn. It fell further, halving to $1.2bn by 2024 – though unofficial trade between them, routed through other countries, is larger, at about $10bn, experts say.</p><p>Lack of <a href=\"http://sdgs.un.org/statements/south-asian-association-regional-cooperation-saarc-15574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regional connectivity</a> is cited as one major reason for the region’s weak trade links.</p><p>In 2014, the grouping was poised to sign a Motor Vehicles Agreement that would have allowed cars and trucks to travel across South Asia, as they can in Europe. But Pakistan blocked that agreement – and a separate one on regional railway collaboration – amid tensions with India.</p><p>Since then, the grouping’s ability to come together has been limited to a few occasions, like during the COVID-19 pandemic when member states set up an emergency fund and set aside $7.7bn to help tackle the public health crisis.</p><p>“If the two countries [India and Pakistan] were able to identify even limited avenues for cooperation in the service of broader regional interests, SAARC could, in principle, be revived,” analyst Farwa Aamer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“However, given current political dynamics, such a breakthrough appears to be a distant prospect,” Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI), added.</p><p>But Pakistan isn’t the first to attempt to sidestep SAARC to build its regional partnerships. After SAARC failed to approve a regional transport pact, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal  – in a grouping called the BBIN after the country initials – inked a similar agreement among themselves.</p><p>India is also part of other regional organisations like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Aamer pointed out. BIMSTEC includes India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</p><p>Still, on the whole, Aamer said, “bilateral and trilateral arrangements will continue to dominate” over “regional multilateralism” in the “near to medium term”. That’s because dealing with just one or two countries at a time tends “to offer more flexibility, clearer incentives and a greater likelihood of producing tangible outcomes,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"will-pakistan-s-proposal-work\">Will Pakistan’s proposal work?</h2><p>Whether the proposal works will depend on two factors, academic Akhtar said.</p><p>“First, whether prospective states see functional value in smaller, issue-focused groupings at a moment when traditional architectures are stalled; and second, whether participation does not trigger political costs vis-a-vis India.”</p><p data-start=\"162\" data-end=\"354\">Akhtar said several South Asian countries may show tentative interest in Pakistan’s proposed regional initiative, though any move towards formal participation is expected to remain limited.</p><p data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"683\">“I think countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, and perhaps Bhutan may be open to exploratory engagement, particularly on connectivity, climate adaptation and economic resilience,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">However, Akhtar noted that India’s regional sensitivities and wider geopolitical rivalry with Pakistan and China “mean that actual membership uptake will be cautious”.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">Nevertheless, ASPI’s Aamer believes Pakistan’s proposition was a “strategically coherent” one.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">“The country is in a moment of diplomatic agility,” she said, adding that “it has maintained strong relations with China while simultaneously cultivating renewed and improved ties with the United States and the Gulf”.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">“This dual-track engagement has given Islamabad a sense of confidence and the ambition to reassert itself as a significant regional actor, essentially, to reclaim a seat at the centre of regional diplomacy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are scheduled to address the media before a gathering with business and trade leaders.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Neha Poonia, reporting from New Delhi, said Putin’s trip was held with “much fanfare”.</p><p>On Thursday, Modi gave Putin a warm welcome, personally greeting him on the tarmac in New Delhi with a hug and a handshake. He later hosted the Russian leader for a private dinner at his residence.</p><p>“There were a lot of hugs and handshakes,” Poonia noted. “The focus now is on the bilateral meeting on Friday.

That partially resumed last year, when Modi visited Russia.</p><p>As Western countries curtailed their reliance on Russian crude oil amid the war, India ramped up its purchases.</p><p>But in August, the US doubled the 25 percent tariffs it had previously imposed on Indian goods to 50 percent, as a penalty for India’s Russian oil purchases, as Trump looked to pressure Putin into accepting a ceasefire.</p><p>India, however, continued buying Russian oil.</p><p>That is now changing: in November, Trump’s sanctions on Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil went into effect, along with a threat of sanctions against companies from other countries that trade with these firms.</p><p>Purchases from the two companies account for about 60 percent of India’s oil imports.</p><p>New Delhi has said it was being unfairly targeted, noting that Western nations continue to do business with Moscow when it is in their interests.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Caracas, Venezuela –</strong> In the bustling plazas of Caracas, the rhythm of daily life carries on. Street vendors sell chocolates and frozen fruit, while shopkeepers stock shelves amid the afternoon rush. Yet beneath this familiar routine, <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/12/4/the-take-how-close-is-the-us-to-war-with-venezuela\">a new tension hums</a>.</p><p>With United States military assets deployed near the Venezuelan coast and rhetoric heating up between Washington and Caracas, the capital’s residents find themselves divided – a few by hope, others by scepticism, and still others by a fierce instinct to defend their homeland.</p><p>For some, the presence of foreign ships offshore represents a long-awaited answer to prayer. For others, it is an imperial affront to a sovereign nation.</p><p>“The homeland is the homeland, and my army is my army,” says David Oropeza, a 52-year-old farmer and merchant who sells frozen strawberries and blackberries he harvests himself. Despite a health condition that requires treatment three times a week, he says he would be willing to fight if the US attacked.</p><p>“I would be knee-deep in the dirt with those people. I would face [the invaders] with them [the Venezuelan army],” Oropeza tells Al Jazeera, as he waits for a bus in downtown Caracas, staring at the horizon. “I would help however I could.”</p><h2 id=\"a-positive-change\" data-start=\"710\" data-end=\"863\">‘A positive change’</h2><p>The US has conducted nearly two dozen strikes since September in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, killing more than 80 people. In the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/us-military-kills-four-in-latest-strike-on-boat-in-the-caribbean\">latest attack on Thursday</a>, four people were killed. The administration of US President Donald Trump has not presented evidence to support its claim that the targeted boats contained narcotics or smugglers, nor that they were headed to the US. It has also offered no legal justification for the operations – actions many experts say violate international law.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has also said that the US is preparing to attack alleged drug traffickers “on land”, suggesting that a direct military operation against Venezuela might be imminent.</p><p>Trump has deployed the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford; thousands of troops; and F-35 military jets to the Caribbean in recent weeks, in the biggest <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-venezuela-tensions-your-questions-answered\">show of force</a> in the region in several decades.</p><p>For some in Venezuela, this US pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is good for the country.</p><p>Carolina Tovar, 60, sits on a bench in one of the city’s busiest squares. A vendor selling chocolates and sweets, she says that with US pressure, “Venezuela is going to be free”.</p><p>“The day will come when we obtain liberty,” she says. “I think Maduro already feels a lot of pressure”.</p><p>Her comments reflect widespread frustrations and despair in Venezuela. Maduro – whose nearly 12 years in office have been marked by deep economic and social crisis, and by repeated US efforts to pressure or unseat his government – was sworn in for a third term in January.</p><p>He was declared <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-sworn-in-for-third-term-after-disputed-election\">the winner of July’s election</a> by Venezuela’s electoral authority and top court, though detailed tallies confirming his victory were never released.</p><p>According to the opposition, their count of the voting records shows their candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won by a wide margin – a result that has led the US and several other governments to recognise him as president-elect. Independent observers have also questioned the election.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151205\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151205\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151205\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25208680409697-1764889896.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nicolas Maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4151205\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro gestures after marking his ballot during municipal elections in Caracas [File: Cristian Hernandez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>But Tovar is in a minority in the country, per polls. Most Venezuelans are far more worried about daily survival, low salaries and inflation, rather than geopolitics – and they do not support US pressure or an attack on their country.</p><p>According to a poll by Caracas-based firm Datanalisis last month, a majority of Venezuelans continue to oppose economic sanctions on the country. The poll found that 55 percent of respondents disagree with sectoral, financial or oil sanctions, while only 21 percent agree with them.</p><p>When it came to a foreign military attack, 55 percent of Venezuelans opposed it, while 23 percent said they would support it.</p><p>The reasons most cited by those who oppose an attack are civilian deaths, risk of civil war, chaos and prolonged economic deterioration. Supporters of a foreign push for change in Venezuela said they believe it would help strengthen democracy, bring peace and help usher in economic improvement.</p><p>The poll suggests that most Venezuelans do not side with either the opposition or President Maduro. Sixty percent described themselves as politically unaffiliated, compared with 13 percent supporting the government and 19 percent backing the opposition.</p><p>“I can understand that some Venezuelans believe this type of pressure from the US could bring about political change and improve the situation,” says a government official with a degree in international affairs, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>“However, from my perspective, external interference is never positive in any country,” the official says. “We’ve seen that in Panama, we’ve seen it in Syria, Libya – and in many countries in the Middle East.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"the-homeland-is-the-homeland\" data-type=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph\">‘The homeland is the homeland’</h2><p>A few blocks away from Tovar, Oropeza is cynical – about Venezuela and its elites, and about Trump and his intentions. But he is clear that war isn’t the answer to any of those problems.</p><p>“Nobody wants war. We want peace,” Oropeza says. He then reflects and refers to those whom he believes do want war.</p><p>“US politics moves a lot with its weaponry, and that generates money for whoever occupies the presidency,” he argues, noting that troop mobilisation on the Venezuelan side likely enriches the local elite as well. “Who is getting rich? Them, and those we don’t know.”</p><p>Oropeza, who describes himself as a former supporter of the late President Hugo Chavez – Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, says he is not a follower of the current president.</p><p>Still, he draws a hard line in the sand regarding his sovereignty. His scepticism of the government does not translate into support for foreign attacks on his country.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151279\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151279\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151279\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-24T164809Z_1505112753_RC213IA9E6E6_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-1764894075.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A member of the Bolivarian Militia walks past a mural with the colors of the Venezuelan flag \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4151279\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A member of the Bolivarian Militia walks past a mural with the colours of the Venezuelan flag amid rising tensions [File: Gaby Oraa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>In recent months, Maduro has responded to rising tensions with his own show of force.

Unlike Oropeza’s willingness to fight, Brea’s instinct is to hide.</p><p>“I would shelter myself out of fear,” she admits.

Doing otherwise, the order said, would cause “irreparable harm” to the state.</p><p>The map in question has set off a nationwide scramble to redesign congressional districts ahead of the all-important midterm races.</p><p>Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling is likely to drive further attempts to redraw maps in favour of one party or another.</p><h2 id=\"a-nationwide-trend\">A nationwide trend</h2><p>The controversy started in June, when reports emerged that President Donald Trump was pushing Texas state legislators to adopt a new congressional map, one that would help Republicans scoop up an extra five seats in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>Texas is considered one of the largest Republican strongholds in the country, given its large population. Currently, the state has a whopping 38 seats in the House, 25 of which are occupied by Republicans.</p><p>But the Republican majority overall in the House is narrow: The party holds only 220 of the 435 total seats.</p><p>Democrats are therefore seeking to flip the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when every congressional district holds a new election. Strategists on the left see Trump’s wilting poll numbers as an opening to make gains.</p><p>Just this week, the research firm Gallup found that the Republican president’s approval score had dropped five points to 36 percent, marking the lowest rating of his second term.</p><p>But Trump and his allies have pushed back. One of their strategies has been to promote partisan redistricting, a process sometimes called gerrymandering.</p><p>The trend started with the Texas effort. Outnumbered in the state legislature, Democrats had tried to stop the process, even leaving the state entirely to avoid voting on the new congressional map.</p><p>But ultimately, they were forced to return. And in August, Texas’s Republican-led state legislature passed the new districts.</p><p>That triggered a kind of redistricting arms race across the country, with Republicans and Democrats in other states seeking to redraw their maps to angle for more congressional seats.</p><p>In September, Republicans in Missouri passed a new gerrymandered map, and in October, North Carolina followed suit. Both states are expected to earn Republicans one additional House seat apiece.</p><p>Then, in November, voters in California approved a ballot initiative championed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom that would suspend the state’s independent election commission and replace its work with a new partisan map.</p><p>That effort was designed explicitly to neutralise any gains by Texas Republicans: The new California map is intended to help Democrats nab exactly five additional House seats.</p><h2 id=\"a-legal-dilemma\">A legal dilemma</h2><p>Partisan redistricting has long been controversial in the US, with voting rights advocates warning that it disenfranchises minority communities.</p><p>Gerrymandering, however, is not strictly illegal.</p><p>Normally, states draw new congressional districts once every decade to reflect demographic changes in the US census. After all, the number of representatives each state has is a reflection of its overall population, and as the number of residents grows or shrinks, the number of districts must change accordingly.</p><p>In many states, it is up to the legislature to draw those new congressional maps, and the decisions are often partisan affairs.</p><p>While the Supreme Court has acknowledged that partisan gerrymandering can threaten democracy, it has ruled that federal courts cannot determine whether legislatures have gone too far in redrawing their maps.</p><p>There is, however, one exception: Gerrymandering on the basis of race is off-limits. The US Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 both contain protections to ensure voters are not divided and disenfranchised based on their race.</p><p>That is how Thursday’s case — Greg Abbott v the League of United Latin American Citizens — ended up before the Supreme Court.</p><p>In November, in a two-to-one decision, the US District Court for Western Texas <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/us-court-blocks-new-texas-congressional-map-while-state-officials-appeal\">sided with plaintiffs</a> who argued that the new Texas map was explicitly designed to dilute the power of Black and Latino voters in the state.</p><p>The court pointed to statements made by Trump administration officials and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, seeming to target congressional districts with non-white majorities.</p><p>But the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the district court had “failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith”. It also described the statements referenced in the lower court’s decision as “ambiguous” and “circumstantial evidence”.</p><p>Right-wing Justice Samuel Alito went a step further, arguing that it was difficult to disentangle what was legal gerrymandering and what was race-based discrimination.</p><p>“Because of the correlation between race and partisan preference, litigants can easily use claims of racial gerrymandering for partisan ends,” Alito wrote.</p><p>If the motive behind the new Texas map was simply race-based, Alito asserted that it was up to the plaintiffs to show how a partisan map would differ from a race-based one.</p><h2 id=\"race-to-the-midterms\">Race to the midterms</h2><p>Republican politicians quickly applauded Thursday’s ruling as vindication for their efforts.</p><p>“We won! Texas is officially — and legally — more red,” Governor Abbott <a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1996731423034925457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his social media account.</p><p>“The Supreme Court restored the congressional redistricting maps passed by Texas that add 5 more Republican seats. The new maps better align our representation in D.C. with the values of Texas.”</p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, meanwhile, highlighted his efforts in defending the Republican map.</p><p>“In the face of Democrats’ attempt to abuse the judicial system to steal the U.S. House, I have defended Texas’s fundamental right to draw a map that ensures we are represented by Republicans,” he said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1996721744753971636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> posted online.</p><p>“Texas is paving the way as we take our country back, district by district, state by state.”</p><p>But in a stinging dissent, Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether her colleagues on the Supreme Court had thoroughly considered the evidence.</p><p>She contrasted the lower court’s approach with what she described as the high court’s hasty one.</p><p>“The District Court conducted a nine-day hearing, involving the testimony of nearly two dozen witnesses and the introduction of thousands of exhibits. It sifted through the resulting factual record, spanning some 3,000 pages,” Kagan wrote.</p><p>“And after considering all the evidence, it held that the answer was clear. Texas largely divided its citizens along racial lines to create its new pro-Republican House map, in violation of the Constitution’s Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.”</p><p>The district court, Kagan pointed out, also explained its reasoning in a lengthy 160-page decision, not just a brief emergency order.</p><p>“Yet this Court reverses that judgment based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record,” Kagan said. “We are a higher court than the District Court, but we are not a better one when it comes to making such a fact-based decision.”</p><p>Despite the legal setback, the plaintiffs in Thursday’s case and other advocates have pledged to continue their fight against Texas’s redistricting efforts.</p><p>“Voters are supposed to choose their politicians — not the other way around,” Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democrat, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/jt_ennis/status/1996750100165431598/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> after Thursday’s ruling.</p><p>“No matter what Donald Trump or his hand-picked Supreme Court throw our way, we’re going to keep fighting.”</p><p>The Trump administration itself is in the midst of a court challenge against California’s partisan redistricting efforts. Those proceedings remain ongoing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame had <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/congolese-rwandan-leaders-meet-in-qatar-call-for-ceasefire-in-eastern-drc\">met in Qatar</a> in March, initiating the talks that led to the deal.</p><p>Thursday’s ceremony finalises the accords.</p><p>The agreement has raised hopes of ending the conflict in the DRC, where the March 23 Movement (M23), a Rwanda-backed armed group, has been advancing deeper into the resource-rich east of the country.</p><p>The renewed violence had raised fears of a <a href=\"/news/2025/3/13/people-need-a-break-drc-conflict-reignites-dark-memories-of-congo-wars\">full-blown conflict</a>, akin to the wars that the DRC endured in the late 1990s, which involved several African countries and killed millions of people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rwanda’s main grievance with the DRC focuses on accusations that the Central African country has been harbouring ethnic Hutu militias linked to the 1994 Rwanda genocide, which targeted the country’s Tutsi population.</p><p>The Trump-backed peace deal stipulates that Rwanda will end its support for M23 and the DRC will help “neutralise” Hutu militias – namely, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda.</p><p>It also requires both countries to respect each other’s territorial integrity.</p><p>On Thursday, the DRC’s Tshisekedi said the agreement’s terms mark a “turning point” for the region.</p><p>“They bring together, under a coherent architecture, a declaration of principles of a peace agreement and also the regional economic integration framework to provide to the peoples of the region a new perspective, a new outlook,” Tshisekedi said.</p><p>He added that the deal would “begin a new era of friendship, cooperation and prosperity”.</p><p>For his part, Rwanda’s Kagame said the success of the pact depends on the two countries themselves.</p><p>“There will be ups and downs on the road ahead. There’s no doubt about it,” Kagame explained. “Rwanda will not be found wanting, I can assure you of that.”</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said the leaders <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/un-sounds-alarm-over-rising-hunger-crisis-in-eastern-dr-congo\">of the DRC</a> and Rwanda appeared to acknowledge that it will take more than a signing ceremony for the agreement to stick.</p><p>The conflict, Fisher explained, “is a lot more ingrained, a lot more developed, a lot more aggressive than many people have assumed”.</p><p>“So the pressure is on the United States, on the African leaders and, of course, on the two countries to make sure that what develops from here is something that can develop into a lasting peace.”</p><p>The DRC had signed a separate deal with M23 in July. Still, the fighting in the eastern parts of the country has persisted.</p><p>“We are still at war,” Amani Chibalonza Edith, a 32-year-old resident <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/un-suspects-all-sides-in-dr-congo-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes\">of Goma</a>, a key city captured by M23 early this year, told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>“There can be no peace as long as the front lines remain active.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Trump appeared optimistic about the prospects for peace.</p><p>“We’ll see how it all works out, but I think it’s going to work out really great,” the US president said.</p><p>Trump also announced that the US will be signing bilateral deals with the DRC and Rwanda to buy rare earth minerals from the two countries.</p><p>“We’ll be involved with sending some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries,” Trump added.</p><p>“And we’re going to take out some of the rare earth, take out some of the assets and pay. Everybody is going to make a lot of money.”</p><p>Rare earth minerals are used in emerging technologies, energy production and medical devices.</p><p>Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, claiming he has resolved eight world conflicts, though that number is disputed.</p><p>During Thursday’s signing ceremony at the US Institute for Peace, a think tank, he heaped praise on the DRC and Rwanda. But his embrace of the countries’ two leaders drew a stark contrast with his insulting remarks towards another war-torn African country: Somalia.</p><p>Two days before hosting the ceremonial signing, Trump hurled insults at Somalia, describing it as “hell” and saying that “it stinks”.</p><p>He also called the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">Somali community</a> in the US “garbage”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
