They’re preparing for festivities that have long been a central facet of life in Lahore, but were banned in 2007.</p><p>Now, Basant, as the three-day festival is called, is returning, starting on Friday. The historic Mochi Gate, one of old Lahore’s 13 gates that date back to the Mughal era, is bustling once again with shops selling kites along narrow, dimly lit streets.</p><p>For the past six days, thousands of people have poured in to buy kites and related paraphernalia. Historically rooted in Vasant Panchami, Basant marks the arrival of spring on the fifth day of the month of Magh in the Hindu lunar calendar. Across Punjab, in both India and Pakistan, people celebrate with singing, dancing and — historically — with kite flying.</p><p>But for 18 years, the festival was not allowed. Several deaths linked to accidents while retrieving kites and to the use of chemical-coated kite strings caused public outrage. Despite attempts by successive governments, Basant remained shelved until now.</p><p>Its return has triggered a surge in business, boosting the local economy. Kite sellers report sales nearing one billion rupees ($3.5m) for kites and string alone.</p><p>Khalid and his cousin were among the buyers.</p><p>“We have spent a total of at least 500,000 rupees ($1,780) in the last one week on kites and strings,” he said exuberantly, clutching his prized purchases as passersby asked about their price.</p><p>Mohammad Amir Rafique Sheikh, spokesperson for the All Pakistan Kite Flying Association, said the decision to allow Basant had given local industries a much-needed lift. He predicted that total economic activity generated by the three-day festival would run into several billion Pakistani rupees, speaking between phone calls.</p><p>“Once it ends on February 8, only after that we will be able to put together a comprehensive analysis of the kind of money that was generated, but with [the hotel] business, catering business, public excitement to celebrate, all of that has contributed massively,” he added, praising the government’s decision to allow the return of the festival.</p><h2 id=\"ban-to-boom\">Ban to boom</h2><p>Basant has long been a shared legacy of subcontinental Punjab. After partition in 1947, it continued in Lahore, especially within Androon Lahore, the Walled City.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291541\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291541\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_093308438-1770344906.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"dancers in Mochi Gate\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">As buyers thronged the Mochi Gate market, musicians kept the crowd entertained by playing dhol drums and dancing [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>From the 1980s onward, the festival grew in popularity, reaching its peak in the mid to late 1990s. A one-day celebration at the time, it featured daytime and nighttime kite flying from rooftops and open grounds.</p><p>Prime rooftops overlooking the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore Fort and surrounding areas commanded hefty rents, running into hundreds of thousands of rupees.</p><p>This year, rents have soared further. Some prime rooftops are reportedly going for between 1.5 million ($5,300) and 2.5 million rupees ($8,900) for three days.</p><p>A senior official at a local bank in Lahore, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said his bank paid nearly three million rupees to secure a rooftop near Heera Mandi.</p><p>“The roof we have managed to acquire would be able to accommodate around 150 to 200 people or so, and it would oversee the Lahore Fort. We have arranged for food stalls, music performances and kite flying for our staff for three days,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Marriyum Aurangzeb, senior minister in the Punjab government and a close aide to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, told Al Jazeera that authorities spent nearly five months preparing to ensure Basant’s safe return.</p><p>Measures included enforcing a strict regulatory framework, including “revised Basant Act 2025 legislation, detailed transport and operational planning, and pre, during and post-festival arrangements”.</p><p>“Technology is at the centre of enforcement,” she said. Surveillance, she added, would be carried out through cameras, “thermal drones, and district administration monitoring systems.</p><p>“The city is draped in Basant themes, rooftops are booked and decorated, and the tallest kite ever stands proudly at the heart of the city. The atmosphere is magical, festive, and almost unreal, combining tradition, celebration and safety in a way never seen before,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"supply-meets-demand\">Supply meets demand</h2><p>Mochi Gate remains the epicentre of Basant-related activity. Business gathers pace after midday, when shops open, and continues until midnight.</p><p>Thousands stream through the congested lanes. Those fortunate enough to secure kites carry them carefully above their heads to avoid damage.</p><p>Among the crowd on Thursday were two young women — a rarity in the male-dominated bazaar — accompanied by their brother.</p><p>“We actually took a day off from our office to be able to come here and buy kites, but so far we are not happy with the quality of kites available, plus the prices are just exorbitant,” said Amina Farooq, 26, who works in a local factory.</p><p>Farooq said her father and uncles were avid kite flyers. Watching social media buzz and hearing friends talk about Basant made her want to take part.</p><p>“I don’t know how to fly a kite or anything about it, to be honest,” she confessed, adding, “but it is about being able to participate in the joyous festivities, that is what matters,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Complaints about quality and pricing were widespread. Buyers accused shopkeepers of exploiting high demand and selling substandard products.</p><p>With the government allowing only three specific kite sizes, the production cost should not exceed 100 to 150 rupees per kite — less than a dollar — depending on materials, said Ustad Javed Bhatti, a former kitemaker with nearly four decades in the trade.</p><p>“What we are seeing right now in the market is completely fraud, with shopkeepers charging margins which are 5 to 10 times more than the cost,” he said.</p><p>On February 1, a small kite sold for 120 rupees ($0.40). By February 4, the price had risen to 300 rupees ($1). The most popular medium-sized kite climbed from 200 ($0.7) to 600 rupees ($2). The largest size, initially priced between 400 ($1.4) and 500 rupees ($1.8), was selling for between 1,200 ($4.2) and 1,400 ($5) rupees when Al Jazeera visited Mochi Gate.</p><p>Ammad Ali, a wholesaler, said he ordered more than 600,000 kites in January, supplying 500,000 to retailers and keeping 100,000 for his own shop.</p><p>“We have sold out the medium and large-sized kite completely, while we still have around a few hundred left of the small-sized kites,” he said.</p><p>“Thank God, the business has been incredible,” he added with a smile.</p><p>But many prospective buyers remained frustrated. Some accused traders of hoarding and said the government had failed to regulate prices.</p><p>Ali Ahmad, a 19-year-old mobile repair technician, said he had visited the market for three days without buying anything.</p><p>Kite string isn’t available in the regular market any more, he said. “What is still available is being sold in black, and is very substandard quality,” he said.</p><p>He added that a set of two one-kilometre string rolls was selling for more than 14,000 rupees ($50), compared with a typical price of about 4,000 rupees ($14).</p><p>Sheikh, from the kite-flying association, blamed the shortage on what he described as the government’s “abundance of caution”, saying manufacturing was permitted only in January.</p><p>“We have been in the conversation with the government for months, but they decided that since it is returning after almost two decades, they allowed manufacturing only last month. Naturally, the producers in Lahore were unable to meet the demand,” he said.</p><p>Authorities said strict oversight was essential. They issued licences to 350 manufacturers in Lahore, along with 536 sellers and 127 trader groups.</p><p>The aim, officials said, was close monitoring of production and sales to prevent accidents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291545\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_105611757-1770344960.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Safety rods on Motorocyles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Punjab government has made it mandatory for motorcycles to install safety rods to avoid any injury due to kite strings [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Aurangzeb said the government ran extensive awareness campaigns. Traffic police installed more than 1.4 million safety rods on motorcycles to reduce the risk posed by kite strings. The idea: as a rider drives forward, a string sagging dangerously low hits the rod, instead of the driver.</p><p>“The aim is simple celebrate Basant safely, responsibly and within the law,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"future-of-basant\">Future of Basant</h2><p>As Lahore witnesses a cultural revival, hotels report occupancy rates nearing 95 percent, with remaining rooms priced at three to four times their usual rates.</p><p>Airfares have also surged. Return tickets from Karachi to Lahore, typically between 40,000 ($143) and 50,000 rupees ($178), climbed to more than 110,000 rupees ($392) in early February.</p><p>Amjad Parvez, a former Punjab University professor and veteran kite flyer who has written extensively on Basant’s history and kite design, praised the government for reviving the festival but urged it to preserve its essence.</p><p>“This festival was all about joy for everybody, regardless of their class or social status. Kite flying, in fact, was a great equaliser because of the skill that was required to be able to fly the kite well, and this should be the most important thing,” he said.</p><p>Abdul Mustaqeem, 30, who works in the transport sector, echoed the concern. He said the “gentrification and commodification” of Basant had dampened his enthusiasm.</p><p>“I have been a big kite flyer, but look at the way it is being promoted, as if this is meant for the elites of the society, and not us. They are now trying to rent our roofs and come to our side of town just because they want to be seen participating in Basant, which was our thing, but because of this, the prices have shot up,” he said.</p><p>Still, Mustaqeem acknowledged the government’s move as positive. If the festival passes without incident, he hopes it could pave the way for year-round kite flying.</p><p>“This was a sport, and it was affordable to us. But keeping it to only Basant will make it accessible to only the rich people, not us,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Before the tariffs, he had sales of roughly $5m and $8m to the US and Mexico, respectively. But those have since been halved.</p><p>“I have lost 50 percent of my business in Mexico and the US since the tariffs came into effect. It is a severe blow to my business as I was focusing on Mexico after the US tariffs, but the future looks bleak there also now,” he said.</p><p>US President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed</a> a 25 percent tariff on India in August and soon tacked on another 25 percent as punishment for its continuing purchase of Russian oil, which, he said, was helping to fund Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Now, within months of those punishing tariffs devastating businesses and jobs across industries in India, including diamond cutting, shrimp farming, and carpet manufacturing, businesses are dealing with equally high tariffs from Mexico, a double whammy, they say.</p><p>On January 1, Mexico implemented steep import tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent on more than 1,400 products from non-free trade nations, including India, Brazil, China, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p><p>Mexico has free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, and countries in the European Union, Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America.</p><p>The North American nation contends that the tariffs have been hiked to boost domestic production, address trade imbalances, and safeguard local employment.</p><p>However, Indian businesses have put it down to Mexico safeguarding itself from US wrath over trans-shipment and supply-chain diversion – issues that businesses from countries like China, which are dealing with high US tariffs, can undertake.</p><p>Such practices could be used by the US against Mexico in the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/13/trump-says-trade-agreement-with-mexico-canada-irrelevant-to-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming review</a> of the trade pact the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And this could push Mexico to align its tariff policy with US sensitivities.</p><p>The steep hike, however, has the Indian business community worried about its future, especially after years of investments in building those supply chains.</p><p>Chadha describes the Mexican tariffs as more disheartening than the ones slapped on by the US, which, Trump said this week, will be <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lowered to 18 percent</a> at some point, though it’s not clear when.</p><p>“The US tariffs were also imposed on our competitors,” said Chadha. “But Mexican tariffs are uneven as they have been implemented on only non-FTA nations, which has put us at a complete disadvantage with our competitors, who have an FTA with Mexico.”</p><p>To help alleviate some of the pain, the Indian government in its annual budget, presented on February 1, allowed the manufacturing units in special economic zones (SEZs) to sell a limited portion of their output to domestic buyers at concessional duty rates. Such sales typically attract the high tariff that is imposed on imports of these products, including textiles and leather goods.</p><p>The move is an attempt to address drop in demand that these exports-focused manufacturing units have been hit by on account of the punishing US tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"mexican-blow\">Mexican blow</h2><p>India exported goods worth $5.6bn to Mexico in 2024, the latest full year data available, led by vehicles and components and followed by electronic equipment. It imported goods worth $4.07bn in that period, with oil and mineral fuels being the lead imports.</p><p>India’s steel exports are facing the steepest hike of 50 percent, followed by auto and auto components that have been hit by 35 percent tariffs.</p><p>Even labour-intensive sectors like garments and ceramics will face tariffs from 25 percent to 35 percent. The plastic, aluminium and chemicals industries have been affected by tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent.</p><p>The decision has drawn severe criticism from affected countries and industry groups, while China has formally protested by raising concerns about higher consumer prices and supply-chain disruption.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>India has so far warned of “appropriate action for the unilateral” tariff hike by Mexico.</p><p>Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), told Al Jazeera that India is likely to focus on export diversification, treating the tariff hike as another sign of accelerating erosion of global trade rules rather than a dispute to be fought bilaterally.</p><p>The automobile sector, which has a strong market in Mexico, has been badly affected by the tariff hike.</p><p>Indian automobile companies exported passenger vehicles worth around $938.35m and motorcycles valued at $390.25m in the financial year ending March 31, 2025.</p><p>Even the auto components, which are predominantly used in vehicles meant for export to the US, have been slapped with tariffs of 35 percent, pointed out Vinnie Mehta, director-general of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA).</p><p>Last year, India exported auto components worth $835m to Mexico.</p><p>“Undoubtedly, the exports are clearly suffering due to the tariffs by the US, and the addition of Mexico has created a new challenge. The visible impact would be clear after the end of the second fiscal cycle in March,” Mehta told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The automobile industry, however, is shifting gears and pinning its hopes on a strong domestic demand driven by a recent reduction in India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 28 percent to 18 percent, a government move to soften the US tariff blow.</p><p>For now, various industry bodies have written to the government to sign a preferential trade agreement with Mexico to provide quick relief for the Indian business sector.</p><p>Ajay Sahai, director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), has, however, called the tariff hikes a push for the industry to increase domestic demand and look for diversification.</p><p>“The tariffs have proved that excessive dependence on single or two countries could be harmful,” he said, “and diversification is the only solution for survival and market expansion.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But unlike in that infamous incident, there is still no single widely understood and identifiable act or reason as to why gold and silver have gone through such a radical fluctuation in such a short period of time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"nobody-understands-this\">‘Nobody understands this’</h2><p>Since 2019, Lebanon has been in one of modern history’s worst economic and banking crises. But even before then, many Lebanese have looked to invest in precious metals, particularly gold, as a way to protect their money from inflation.</p><p>Whereas banks have lost the public’s trust, gold has widely been seen as a safe investment whose value has grown steadily. Precious metals have historically gained buyers during periods of geopolitical or economic uncertainty.</p><p>The last year has witnessed plenty of instability around the world, and particularly in the Middle East. Donald Trump’s return to power in the United States, his leveraging of tariffs, his pressure on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to take over Greenland, intervention in Venezuela, and threats of a war with Iran have all contributed to a volatile cocktail of instability.</p><p>When asked about the serious fluctuations, one Beiruti jeweller, who didn’t want to give his name, responded with a pithy statement. “Go ask Trump,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Nobody understands this,” said Khodr, who only wished to give his first name. Seated behind a table at a jewellery store in Beirut, gold rings were visible next to him in a glass case on a perpendicular table.</p><p>He said the effects of the sharp fluctuation<strong> </strong>in costs are still being understood, but admitted that there has been an impact on his business.</p><p>“Work has slowed down,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-no-logic\">‘There’s no logic’</h2><p>Analysts are split on the cause of the rapid change in valuation. Some speculate that more stable economic conditions and the dollar’s rise led investors to sell when the valuation was at a high.</p><p>Others disagree. They say the drop was a course correction and reflected that the commodity had become overvalued.</p><p>Going forward, however, some financial analysts said they expect gold to continue rising, with JP Morgan analysts saying it could increase in value by 30 percent before the end of 2026.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273149\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273149\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-28T135342Z_134723574_RC2CAJAZKM4M_RTRMADP_3_GLOBAL-PRECIOUS-GERMANY-GOLD-1769662398.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gold\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4273149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gold bars are stored in a safe deposit room in Munich, Germany, January 28, 2026 [Angelika Warmuth/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>But it may still take some time before buyers, or jewellers, feel comfortable buying gold again.</p><p>“It makes no sense,” Simon, the jeweller, said. “The price shouldn’t be this high. The cost of mining and turning it into bars did not change.</p><p>“There’s no logic,” Aziz added. “It’s all speculation.”</p><h2 id=\"affecting-business\">Affecting business</h2><p>Lebanon is currently debating a gap law that would, in theory, return to depositors some of the money they have been <a href=\"/opinions/2022/11/18/lebanon-bank-holdups-who-is-the-real-criminal\">prevented from accessing</a> by banks since 2019.</p><p>Since then, the country has had a severe liquidity crisis, and the currency has depreciated by more than 90 percent. Today, many rely on remittances from family working abroad. From 2020 to 2024, Lebanon averaged $6.38bn per year on remittances. That figure dropped to $5.8bn in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But many in Lebanon have long held a fragile trust in banks and the financial system, even before the crisis. For an older generation of Lebanese, 2019 was not the first time the currency spiralled in their lifetime. Many who had invested in the country lost money during the civil war when the Lebanese lira fell from about three to the US dollar to more than 1,000.</p><p>Gold has therefore been seen as a relatively safe investment for Lebanese.</p><p>Seeing the sharp spike in cost per ounce will have led some in the country to try to sell some of their gold. But jewellers like Simon are hesitant to buy at the moment.</p><p>“It’s definitely affecting business,” Simon said. “Yesterday, a customer wanted to sell me something with gold, but I couldn’t buy it. What if I bought it from him for a certain price, and the second day it costs 10 to 20 percent less?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two men in forest-green polo shirts, the cafe’s standard uniform, move briskly between the grill and the till, taking orders as the lunchtime crowd thickens, then thins again.</p><p>Inside Casablanca Cafe, the scrape of faux-leather chairs mixed with low conversation competes with traffic and the occasional siren on Whitechapel Road.</p><p>Some customers hurry through plates of chicken curry and rice during short breaks from nearby offices; others linger over fried eggs, beans and toast, chatting before heading next door for prayers at East London Mosque.</p><p>At a worn wooden table in the centre of the room, Khaled Noor cradles a tall glass of ginger and honey tea. For months now, he says, Bangladesh’s upcoming election has been a constant topic of conversation.</p><p>“Since the elections were <a href=\"/features/2025/10/28/bangladesh-expats-win-means-to-vote-could-they-sway-the-next-election\">announced,</a>” Noor, a barrister and political scientist, said, “people haven’t stopped talking about it.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291744\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291744\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291744\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jahanara-Begum-L-Romina-Khatun-R-1770358054.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C580&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jahanara Begum (L) and Romina Khatun, Bangladeshi women in London who have voted remotely ahead of the February 12 Bangladesh elections [Indlieb Farazi Saber]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291744\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jahanara Begum, left, and Romina Khatun, Bangladeshi women in London who have voted remotely ahead of the February 12 Bangladesh elections [Indlieb Farazi Saber/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-long-awaited-vote\">A long-awaited vote</h2><p>The vote, scheduled for February 12, will be Bangladesh’s first national election since the removal of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and the first in nearly two decades expected to feature genuine competition. It follows years of tightly managed polls, opposition boycotts and allegations of repression under Hasina that left many voters at home disillusioned and deepened frustration among Bangladeshis overseas who had long been excluded from the ballot.</p><p>Bangladesh’s politics has long been shaped by rivalry between the Awami League, led for years by Hasina, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), founded by former military ruler Ziaur Rahman and later led by his widow, Khaleda Zia. Under Hasina, Bangladesh saw rapid economic growth alongside deepening accusations of authoritarianism and repression.</p><p>The BNP, sidelined for much of the past decade, is seeking to reassert itself under the leadership of Khaleda Zia’s son, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/why-bnp-leader-tarique-rahmans-return-to-bangladesh-matters-ahead-of-vote\">Tarique Rahman</a>. Supporters portray Rahman, who spent 17 years in exile in London, as a symbol of resistance to one-party dominance; critics point to past convictions and accusations of corruption. The election will be the first since Khaleda Zia’s <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">death in December</a>, lending additional emotional and symbolic weight to the contest.</p><p>Meanwhile, the interim administration under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which took charge after Hasina’s ouster, has banned her Awami League from electoral politics.</p><p>Amid all of that flux, Bangladeshis living abroad have, for the first time, won the right to vote. “For years we’ve been campaigning for this moment,” Noor said. “People wanted recognition.”</p><p>But at neighbouring tables in the cafe, several people decline to speak, wary of sharing political views publicly. Noor, a former local councillor, said some Bangladeshi citizens in the UK who are technically eligible to vote but lack secure immigration status are among the most cautious.</p><p>“They’re watching the elections very closely,” he said, “but they don’t want to draw attention to themselves.”</p><p>For decades, overseas Bangladeshis, despite sending <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/top-news/remittance-inflow-hits-317bn-january-third-highest-record-1349646\">billions of dollars</a> home in remittances, had no formal say in national elections. Campaigners argued that excluding the diaspora was both undemocratic and politically expedient, particularly as many Bangladeshis abroad had left amid political <a href=\"/news/2024/1/5/bangladesh-elections-a-timeline-of-controversy\">violence or repression</a>.</p><p>Following sustained pressure, electoral authorities expanded overseas voter registration, allowing expatriates to participate remotely for the first time. According to Bangladeshi election authorities, more than seven million expatriates worldwide have registered since overseas voting was introduced — making them a substantial 5 percent of the total electorate of about 127 million.  Bangladesh’s election authorities estimate there are roughly 15 million Bangladeshis living abroad in all.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, however, just over 32,000 Bangladeshi citizens are registered to vote, a modest figure given the size of the wider community. According to the 2021 census, about <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/bulletins/ethnicgroupenglandandwales/census2021\">645,000 people</a> in England and Wales identify as Bangladeshi or British Bangladeshi, with the largest concentration in East London. In Tower Hamlets alone, Bangladeshis make up nearly 35 percent of residents, with significant communities also in Newham, and Barking and Dagenham.</p><p>The disparity highlights a central tension running through the diaspora: cultural identity does not always align with citizenship or eligibility. These demographics help explain why events in Bangladesh ripple so strongly through everyday life in East London, but they do not guarantee political engagement.</p><p>Some analysts point out that expatriate Bangladeshis could still be significant in close contests. Bangladesh’s election authorities estimate that in some constituencies overseas voters may represent nearly a fifth of registered voters, a share that <a href=\"/features/2025/10/28/bangladesh-expats-win-means-to-vote-could-they-sway-the-next-election\">could influence outcomes</a> in a first-past-the-post system.</p><p>In practice, however, eligibility to vote is limited to Bangladeshi citizens holding a national identity card (NID). Many British Bangladeshis, particularly those born in the UK,  identify strongly with Bangladesh but do not hold citizenship documents and are therefore excluded from the ballot.</p><p>Bangladeshis have lived in Britain for more than a century, but large-scale migration began only in the mid-20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s, economic hardship in what was then East Pakistan, combined with labour shortages in the UK, drew Bengali men, many from Sylhet, to London and Birmingham.</p><p>The 1971 Liberation War prompted another wave, as people fled political instability and sought work abroad. Family reunification followed, reshaping neighbourhoods like Tower Hamlets in the decades that followed.</p><p>These layered histories help explain why events in Bangladesh continue to ripple so strongly through everyday life here, but they do not guarantee political engagement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291751\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291751\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Casablanca-Cafe-interior-1770358169.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C580&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Casablanca Cafe in East London, a popular haunt among the Bangladeshi diaspora, where chatter about the upcoming election is hard to miss [Indlieb Farazi Saber/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Casablanca Cafe in East London, a popular haunt among the Bangladeshi diaspora, where chatter about the upcoming election is hard to miss [Indlieb Farazi Saber/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"between-paperwork-and-disengagement\">Between paperwork and disengagement</h2><p>Earlier in the day, in Whitechapel Road Market, two young women browse a rack of brightly coloured jalabiyas, pausing to check the stitching. Asked about the election, they shrug. They had heard older relatives talking about it, one said, but it felt distant.</p><p>“It doesn’t affect us, does it?” she asked. “We live here.” Politics in Britain, she added, felt more pressing, mentioning Labour’s struggles and the rise of Reform.</p><p>Noor explained that such apathy was common among younger British Bangladeshis. Years of disputed polls had left many hopeful but cautious, he said, while practical barriers had discouraged wider participation.</p><p>“To vote, you need a national identity card, biometrics, and then another digital process through a mobile app,” he said. “For many people, especially older voters, it’s simply too complicated.”</p><p>Patterns elsewhere underscore the contrast. <a href=\"https://www.ecs.gov.bd//?lang=en\">Election commission figures</a> show far higher participation in Gulf states, with more than 239,000 registered voters in Saudi Arabia and about 76,000 in Qatar.</p><p>Back at his office in Tower Hamlets, Noor said the difference reflected lived realities. Migrants in the Gulf are often single men with families back home and limited political or social rights in their host countries, keeping their ties to Bangladesh immediate and practical. In the UK and United States, by contrast, many Bangladeshis are settled with families, careers and children, their daily concerns anchored firmly where they live.</p><p>That divide, between older migrants invested in events back home and younger British Bangladeshis rooted firmly in the UK, runs through conversations across East London.</p><p>Several said they had registered to vote. Many arrived in Britain decades ago and still hold Bangladeshi passports. For them, the election carries the weight of memory: of the Liberation War, of years of military rule, of elections that once felt either dangerous or meaningless.</p><p>Above a convenience store on a side street close to the mosque, a narrow, worn staircase leads to the small office of Bangla Sanglap, a bilingual weekly newspaper. Its editor, Moshahid Ali, scrolls through messages from readers debating the election, correcting rumours and sharing registration information.</p><p>“People are excited about having the right to vote,” he said. “But it hasn’t been clear or straightforward.”</p><p>Many complained of limited outreach by authorities, he added. The process itself put others off: the need for an NID card, biometric registration at the High Commission with long waiting lines, followed by a further digital application through a mobile app, a series of bureaucratic thickets that sap enthusiasm.</p><p>Some learned about postal voting too late. One man said he rushed to apply for his NID card days before the deadline, only for it to arrive after registration closed.</p><p>Others said the technology itself proved daunting, particularly for older voters. “Everything is on apps now,” one older would-be voter said. “If something goes wrong, who do you ask?”</p><p>Mizanur Khan, 44, a community volunteer and hijama (cupping therapy) practitioner, said he wanted to vote but missed the registration deadline. He is now considering travelling to Bangladesh to vote in person.</p><p>“There wasn’t enough awareness,” he said. “But the main thing is free and fair elections. If they can even manage that, Bangladesh has a chance.”</p><p>The Bangladesh High Commission in London was contacted for comment, but did not respond.</p><p>Not everyone who could vote chose to. At an electrical goods stall in Whitechapel Market, as February rain began to fall, Radwan Ahmed, 23, a student in London, said he holds an NID card but decided to boycott the election. He described his decision as a protest against what he sees as a compromised political process, saying the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">ban on the Awami League</a> had undermined the vote’s legitimacy.</p><p>Across the borough, the mood remains unsettled.</p><p>A man in his forties said the election felt overdue. Bangladesh, he said, had been run by the same two parties, and the same families, for too long. He did not want his name in print, but his eyes lit up when he spoke of change. “If change doesn’t happen now, then when will it happen?” For the first time in Bangladesh’s electoral history, the Jamaat-e-Islami — the country’s largest religious party — is a serious contender to win the vote. It is in an alliance with the National Citizen Party (NCP), a group formed by leaders of the student-led uprising against Hasina.</p><p>Britain’s political significance is underscored by the presence of influential figures on both sides of Bangladesh’s political divide. Tarique Rahman’s long exile in London remains a sore point among some who were interviewed in East London. His UK presence did not necessarily translate into trust or recognition. Several people described him as distant from everyday community life, saying he rarely engaged beyond party circles.</p><p>“He’s just one man,” said one voter who declined to be named. “Part of the same system.” Another said Rahman’s long stay in the UK passed without meaningful contact with working-class Bangladeshis. “He met elites otherwise; he remained hidden,” he said. “There was no connection with people like us.”</p><p>Britain is also home to prominent figures linked to the Awami League. Among them is <a href=\"/news/2025/1/15/who-is-tulip-siddiq-and-why-has-she-resigned-as-uk-minister\">Tulip Siddiq</a>, a Labour MP and Hasina’s niece. Siddiq was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/bangladesh-court-sentences-ex-pm-hasina-uk-lawmaker-niece-in-graft-case\">recently sentenced</a> in absentia to two years’ imprisonment and a 100,000 Bangladeshi taka ($818) fine by a Bangladeshi court, a move criticised by UK-based lawyers and rights groups as politically motivated, a claim Bangladeshi authorities reject.</p><p>Several UK-based local politicians of Bangladeshi origin, including Tower Hamlets councillors Sabina Khan and Ohid Ahmed, are also standing in the Bangladesh elections, drawing criticism both in Britain and in Bangladesh over questions of accountability and dual political loyalties.</p><p>The issue is further complicated by Bangladesh’s approach to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/20/dual-citizenship-bangladeshs-latest-political-flashpoint-before-elections\">dual nationality</a>. While dual citizenship is permitted in practice, constitutional provisions restrict those who acquire foreign citizenship or pledge allegiance to another country from standing for parliament, a distinction that is often poorly understood.</p><p>Legal experts note that under UK law, for instance, a declaration of renunciation must be formally registered with the Home Office before it takes effect; until then, the applicant remains a British citizen.</p><p>“How much do they really know about politics back in Bangladesh if they’ve been living over here?” one woman asked.</p><p>For most of those Al Jazeera spoke to, however, daily concerns, jobs, family, security and life in Britain loomed far larger than the intricacies of elite politics in Bangladesh.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291756\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291756\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291756\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nargis-Akhtar-L-Romina-Khatun-R-1770358252.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C347&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Romina Khatun (R) with her daughter Nargis Akhtar.

Unlike her mother, Akhtar isn’t enthused about the elections [Indlieb Farazi Saber/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"mixed-sentiments\">Mixed sentiments</h2><p>Those priorities become clearer a few miles away, in another part of the borough.</p><p>On a quiet, tree-lined street minutes from the glass towers of Canary Wharf, the Isle of Dogs Bangladeshi Association and Cultural Centre sits almost hidden beside the local library. Once a stronghold of far-right politics, the area now reflects a different chapter in East London’s migrant history.</p><p>Inside, a small group has gathered for tea and butter biscuits. Conversation drifts between translating documents, navigating an increasingly digital world and plans for afternoon prayers.</p><p>Here, too, the election is on people’s minds.</p><p>Muhammad Saiful Miah, 44, who works in the emergency services, said he had not voted — because he doesn’t have an NID card. But he is following the election closely.</p><p>“The elections matter because that’s where my family comes from,” he said. “I’m British and Bangladeshi, so of course I care.”</p><p>Across the room, Jahanara Begum, 58, from Cumilla near Dhaka, speaking in Bangla through a translator, said she was “very happy” to have voted and had already sent her postal ballot.</p><p>“I waited years for this,” she says, hands wrapped around her teacup. “This is the first time in a long time it feels like it matters,” said Begum, who arrived in Britain just three years ago.</p><p>As a former primary school teacher and election monitor, she recalled travelling long distances, sometimes 30km by rickshaw, to count votes, often missing the chance to cast her own. The last time she voted, she said, was in 1991.</p><p>She spoke vividly of the 2008 general election when the Awami League came to power. She claimed the results recorded locally were later altered. “We saw BNP winning in many areas, but the figures announced were different.”</p><p>Now living in Britain, she still cares deeply about the outcome. “I have four children there,” she said. “It’s my country. I want peace. I want them to be safe.”</p><p>Her friend, Romina Khatun, 69, who has lived in the UK since 1985 and has also voted, nodded in agreement. For her too, the election represents a tentative hope after years of violence and uncertainty.</p><p>But Romina’s daughter, Nargis Akhtar, 45, who volunteers as the centre’s manager, remains unconvinced. Born in Sylhet but raised in London, she did not vote and does not have an NID card.</p><p>Akhtar grew up in a politically engaged household. She remembers hearing the names Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina and Hussain Muhammad Ershad — a military ruler who led Bangladesh for most of the 1980s — spoken with intensity. “I must have been seven or eight,” she said, laughing, recalling a political cartoon that once enraged her father. “I didn’t even know who Ershad was; I just knew it mattered to my parents.”</p><p>But, she said, she does not “have much faith that elections alone will change things”.</p><p>“There’s no proper welfare system, no employment rights [in Bangladesh],” Akhtar said. “People talk about creating jobs, but without protections, what difference does that make?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has transformed from a mid-sized kingmaker – which won 51 seats in 2019 and 71 in 2023 – into a conservative force now vying to become one of parliament’s largest parties.</p><p>Bhumjaithai formed the current government with support from the People’s Party, after the country’s top court removed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the Pheu Thai, over her handling of Thailand’s border crisis with Cambodia.</p><p>Anutin initially promised constitutional reform and elections within four months, but the People’s Party in December accused him of reneging on their deal. Facing the risk of a no-confidence vote, he <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/thailand-pm-moves-to-dissolve-parliament-paving-way-for-election\">dissolved</a> the House and called the snap poll.</p><p>Bhumjaithai has now rebranded itself as a staunch defender of the monarchy and has been bolstered by defections, attracting 64 of the 91 lawmakers who have switched parties since 2023.</p><p>Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at think tank Thailand Future, said Bhumjaithai is seen as “pragmatic” and has now “claimed the conservative mantle” from political parties run by former generals.</p><h2 id=\"people-s-party\">People’s Party</h2><p>The People’s Party is the third iteration of a reformist movement whose previous incarnations – most recently <a href=\"/news/2023/5/13/move-forward-galvanises-thai-voters-with-vows-of-royal-reforms\">Move Forward</a> – were dissolved by the courts. The party campaigns on reducing the political power of unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary.</p><p>While it was once outspoken in calling for changes to Thailand’s lese-majeste law – under which defaming or insulting the monarchy is a criminal offence – it has softened its stance since the court action.</p><p>Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of international relations at Chulalongkorn University, described the group as “strange and unprecedented” in Thai politics.</p><p>“It was the first party not driven by patronage or money politics, but by reform ideas and policies rather than personalities or provincial bosses,” he said.</p><h3>Pheu Thai</h3><p>Pheu Thai and its predecessors dominated Thai politics for much of the past 25 years through populist policies that secured working-class support as well as a formidable electoral machinery, particularly in the north and northeast.</p><p>Despite Thaksin’s imprisonment and the court’s removal of its prime ministers, the party has prevented mass defections and remains competitive. It is campaigning on Shinawatra nostalgia, with Thaksin’s nephew Yodchanan Wongsawat as its primary representative.</p><p>Napon of Thailand Future said he expected “a significant decline compared to the previous election”, with Pheu Thai potentially falling to third place. Still, he said the party may regain some seats from the progressive camp in its northern strongholds.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-polls-suggesting\">What are the polls suggesting?</h2><p>A January 30 survey by the National Institute of Development Administration put People’s Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut in first place for prime minister at 29.1 percent, followed by Anutin at 22.4 percent. Yodchanan trailed in fourth place.</p><p>For party lists, People’s Party led with 34.2 percent, followed by Bhumjaithai at 22.6 percent and Pheu Thai at 16.2 percent.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues\">What are the key issues?</h2><p>The People’s Party has proposed more than 200 policies, including abolishing military conscription, drafting a new democratic constitution, overhauling the bureaucracy and launching state-backed programmes to support small businesses.</p><p>Bhumjaithai has focused on economic stimulus and security, pledging to lift annual growth to 3 percent, expand welfare schemes, build border walls and make military service more attractive through paid volunteer posts.</p><p>Anutin has also promised to protect the monarchy, saying at a Bangkok rally that amending lese-majeste laws “will never happen and will never succeed because you have us”.</p><p>Pheu Thai has meanwhile centred its campaign on debt relief, as well as income support for low earners and subsidies for transport. It has also announced a “millionaire maker” programme that will award nine daily prizes of one million baht ($31,556) each.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-cambodia-factor-in\">How does Cambodia factor in?</h2><p>The clashes between Cambodia and Thailand erupted at their contested border in July and ended following <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-on-ceasefire-cambodia-defence-ministry-says\">a second ceasefire</a> in December.</p><p>The clashes have stoked nationalist fervour, strengthening Bhumjaithai’s appeal, according to Punchada Sirivunnabood, associate professor of social sciences and humanities at Mahidol University in Bangkok.</p><p>“They use this [nationalism] as a concept for support in these elections, and a lot of legislators from different political parties have moved to Bhumjaithai. This guarantees that they’re going to win a lot of seats from the district level,” she said.</p><p>On the other hand, the conflict has “hurt Pheu Thai a lot,” she said.</p><p>Paetongtarn of the Pheu Thai, who is also the daughter of its founder, Thaksin, was removed as prime minister in September over a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen, in which she was heard pandering to him and criticising a Thai commander.</p><p>Punched said questions over the Shinawatra family’s connections to Hun Sen have dogged Pheu Thai candidates on the campaign trail.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-constitutional-reform\">What about constitutional reform?</h2><p>Alongside the parliamentary election, voters will also be asked whether to replace the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule following a coup in 2014.</p><p>Even if approved, the process would be long and uncertain, according to analysts. It would require parliamentary action, Senate support to amend key clauses, and at least two further referendums.</p><p>While polls suggest overwhelming support for the “yes” vote, the referendum will not guarantee a new charter or a democratic one.</p><p>“It depends entirely on the post-election balance of power,” said Napon. “A more conservative parliament could still produce a conservative constitution.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-end-thailand-s-political-turmoil\">Will this end Thailand’s political turmoil?</h2><p>With no party expected to win an outright majority, coalition formation will be essential.</p><p>But any resulting government is “very likely to be unstable”, Napon said, noting that coalitions between any two of the big three parties would fall short of a majority if one partner withdrew.</p><p>Thitinan of the Chulalongkorn University said Thailand’s electoral history offered little encouragement.</p><p>Only once in 25 years have voting results been fully honoured, he noted. All other elections were overturned by military coups or judicial interventions.</p><p>“Establishment forces and biases are so entrenched and run so deep that the party of reform and progress would have to win a big, convincing margin of victory to have a chance at governing,” Thitinan said.</p><p>“Such a large enough margin looks like a slim chance, unless Thai voters are fed up enough to see through all the charade and shenanigans that have kept Thailand backwards and falling increasingly behind its peers,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Originally from Jabalia in northern Gaza, she now shelters in a classroom at a school in central Gaza’s Nuseirat.</p><p>Widowed in early 2023 and without children, she said displacement revives the trauma she inherited from her parents.</p><p>“History repeats itself now,” she said. “My parents lost all their money when they were forced to flee. We also used to have money, but now we are displaced and have lost everything.”</p><p>When Kefaya was a child, her family lived in tents in Gaza’s refugee camps, before they became more permanent structures in later decades. Now, she says that she is reliving that same fate.</p><p>“I don’t want to repeat history, I want to die in my own country,” she said. “Even here, being in Nuseirat, I feel like a stranger. I wish I could go back to Jabalia.”</p><p>Her home in Jabalia was destroyed during the war, meaning that, for now, she is staying in Nuseirat. But she is still adamant that it will not mean her departure from Gaza.</p><p>“I will not leave for medical treatment outside … I choose to die on my own land rather than be treated outside,” she said.</p><p>That’s despite her own medical issues – Kefaya suffers from high blood pressure, and has not been able to receive adequate medical care because of the war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hidden-crisis\">Hidden crisis</h2><p>The Rafah crossing partially opened on Monday after being largely closed by Israel since May 2024.</p><p>The opening of the crossing is part of the second phase of the Gaza “ceasefire”, even as Israel continues to violate the agreement by regularly attacking the Palestinian enclave, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/israel-suspends-evacuation-of-palestinians-via-rafah-crossing-red-crescent\">killing hundreds</a>.</p><p>Only a few dozen Palestinians have been allowed to leave so far, all patients needing treatments accompanied by family members.</p><p>Other Palestinians have also put their names on the list, some hoping to go abroad for education or simply to escape life in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 70,000 since the war began, and destroyed the majority of buildings, meaning reconstruction will likely be a years-long process, even if Israel cooperates.</p><p>“Israel is creating unlivable conditions in Gaza, denying Palestinians all essentials of life,” said Talal Abu Rukba, a political science professor at al-Azhar University in Gaza. “When people resist and stay in their homeland, they ruin the Israeli project of creating an Israeli state on a land ‘without a people'”.</p><p>Members of the Israeli right-wing, including members of the government, have repeatedly called for illegal settlements to be established in Gaza, and for Palestinians to be forced out.</p><p>The desire to stay in Gaza on the part of elderly Palestinians is despite a largely overlooked humanitarian crisis facing the demographic.</p><p>Research by Amnesty International and HelpAge International found that Israel’s blockade of aid and medicines to Gaza had contributed to a “physical and mental health crisis”.</p><p>“During armed conflict, older people’s needs are often overlooked.

Reports have indicated the expanded agenda pushed by the Trump administration repeatedly threatened to derail the talks, which are set to include Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said the US was “ready for talks”.</p><p>“In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include the range of their ballistic missiles, their sponsorship of terror organisations, and the treatment of their own people,” Rubio told reporters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, again threatened Iran in an NBC News interview on Wednesday, saying Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei should be “very worried”. However, he also recently appeared to present more narrow objectives for the talks.</p><p>Last week, Trump told reporters he wanted “two things” from Iran: “Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.”</p><p>On Thursday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt again renewed the threat.</p><p>“While these negotiations are taking place, ‌I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many ‌options at his disposal, aside ‌from diplomacy, ⁠as the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the ‌history of the world,” she told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-us-strategy\">What is the US strategy?</h2><p>Throughout Trump’s second term, his administration has pursued a mercurial foreign policy strategy, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/can-trumps-madman-theory-reshape-iran-and-the-middle-east\">described</a> by some analysts as a “madman theory” and others as mad-dash. That unpredictability has hung over Friday’s talks.</p><p>The administration struck Iran on June 22 after five rounds of talks in Oman, during which Witkoff held an in-person meeting with Araghchi. The attacks came after a two-month deadline imposed by Trump for Iran to halt nuclear enrichment passed, even as more talks were scheduled.</p><p>Tehran has for decades insisted its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes and had previously agreed to curtail enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which Trump withdrew in 2018.</p><p>“It’s unclear whether [US goals] are going to be limited to the nuclear issue, as the president says, or much more comprehensive demand for full capitulation, as Secretary Rubio suggests,” Ali Vaez, the Iran Project director at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If past is prelude, the US is going to walk into these talks without a negotiating strategy…and it would be a set of moving goalposts depending on what the Iranians are willing to put on the table,” he said.</p><p>In one scenario, Vaez said, Trump could use the talks to find an “off-ramp” to his current military posturing and threats to intervene in support of protesters in Iran. Demonstrations have since been stifled by the Iranian authorities, he noted, and any military escalation could spark not just a regional security crisis, but a global economic crisis felt in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump continues to be surrounded by several officials, including Rubio, likely to <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/trumps-cabinet-is-less-hawkish-will-that-affect-his-israel-iran-response\">push back</a> against anything seen as a concession at a time when the administration sees Iran’s strength as being diminished.</p><p>“I think any deal that will benefit the Islamic Republic could be perceived in Washington as saving a regime that is on the ropes,” Vaez said.  “That is unattractive.”</p><p>If the administration does hold onto its hard line – particularly on its ballistic missile – it is likely to find little cooperation, despite Iran’s desire to avoid further military action, George Washington University’s Azodi explained.</p><p>While Tehran may be open to codifying some range limits on its ballistic missile programme, further restrictions, including a stockpile reduction, would likely be a non-starter, he said.</p><p>“The strongest deterrent, and the only deterrent that Iran has right now is its missile programme,” he said. “Once that one is taken care of, Iran will be vulnerable to future Israeli attacks. Basically, it will lose its sovereignty.”</p><p>“That is the brightest red line.”</p><h2 id=\"regional-influence\">Regional influence</h2><p>Friday’s meeting comes amid calls for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">diplomatic de-escalation</a> from Gulf countries, which have repeatedly warned of the regional impact of a renewed conflict.</p><p>There are currently eight permanent US military bases located across Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. Following the US strike on Iran last year, Iran attacked Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, a major non-NATO US ally.</p><p>Khamenei has warned Washington that any attack on his country would result in a “regional war”. Earlier this week, the US military shot down an Iranian drone in the Persian Gulf and subsequently claimed Iranian boats “threatened” a US-flagged merchant ship in the Strait of Hormuz, further raising the prospect of military entanglement.</p><p>Meanwhile, US envoy Witkoff met earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pressed for military action against Iran while subverting diplomatic efforts. Netanyahu warned Witkoff to remain sceptical of any Iranian commitments, Reuters news agency reported.</p><p>Khalil Jahshan, the executive director of the Arab Center Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the US posture going into the talks shows a “synchronisation of positions” with the Israeli government, which has long viewed Iran’s ballistic programme as one of its most <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">significant</a> regional targets.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Jahshan said the talks may be “superficial argumentation” on the part of the US “to diffuse the objections from Arab allies”, but he did not see them as likely to divert another US or Israeli attack. In turn, he saw little hope of Iran acquiescing.</p><p>“There is no doubt [Iran] is exhausted because of the sanctions. It’s exhausted because of the domestic unrest,” he said.</p><p>“It’s exhausted because of several regional setbacks and would like to avert a US-Israeli attack on Iran. But at the same time, I don’t think it is necessarily responsive to these spurts of chaotic semi-diplomatic threats.”</p><p>Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, also acknowledged there is a camp inside of Iran that “believes the negotiations are a ruse and that the Trump administration’s ultimate goal is military attacks and regime change”.</p><p>Still, she assessed that both sides were entering the talks seeking de-escalation, even if dangerous gaps in their positions remained.</p><p>“A senior Iranian official told me they’re going into negotiations with seriousness, but also with a finger on the trigger,” Mortazavi told Al Jazeera. “They want to give diplomacy a chance, but they want to be clear-eyed about the threats of attacks.”</p><p>“It’s a dichotomy that’s very dangerous, because when the two sides are facing off, locked and loaded with very credible and serious threats, things can get out of hand, even by mistake,” Mortazavi added.</p><p>Crisis Group’s Vaez, meanwhile, said that the US may be overestimating its position, noting that despite being battered in recent months, Iran’s leaders continue to believe in their own resilience.</p><p>“The Iranian regime has been weakened significantly, but it is not weak,” Vaez said. “Those two things are not the same.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Everyone knows we have no military targets. There has been serious damage. I ‌have been out to look around,” Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app.</li>\n<li>Two people were hurt in a Russian overnight drone attack in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.</li>\n<li>Klitschko said the attack caused damage in residential buildings in one district, and in another, debris from a destroyed drone fell on the roof of an office building, causing a fire. Debris also fell close to a shopping centre and caused damage to a kindergarten.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched two ballistic missiles and 183 drones at Ukraine overnight on Thursday, with air defence units shooting down 156 of the unmanned aerial vehicles.</li>\n<li>The Russian Ministry of Defence said its air defences downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight across several regions inside Russia as well as over the Azov Sea and the Russian-annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea.</li>\n<li>Russia carried out a “massive” drone attack on railway infrastructure in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said. Railway energy infrastructure was also targeted in the attack, Kuleba said.</li>\n<li>“The enemy is trying to stop train traffic,” Kuleba said, describing the attack as “another act of terrorism” against Ukrainian logistics.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military said it carried out a series of “successful” strikes in January on a launch site for Russian intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The strikes hit a complex of hangar-type buildings used for the prelaunch preparation of intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Ukraine’s General Staff said on Telegram without specifying the date of the attack.</li>\n<li>In his nightly address on Thursday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referred to the “good results” from the Security Service of Ukraine, singling out an attack by Ukrainian-made long-range Flamingo missiles on the testing ground for Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic missiles near the Caspian Sea.</li>\n<li>Starlink internet terminals used by Russian forces in Ukraine have been deactivated, Kyiv’s defence minister said.</li>\n<li>Russian military bloggers on Thursday reported sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, after network owner Elon Musk shut them down following a plea from Kyiv.</li>\n<li>At least nine bloggers close to the Russian army said connections had been lost, adding that this could weaken Moscow’s ability to wage drone warfare and hinder coordination between units. Moscow does not have a home-produced alternative to the satellite internet terminals.</li>\n<li>Ukraine is now registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Peace talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/russia-ukraine-talks-end-with-agreement-on-prisoner-swap\">Ukraine and Russia agreed</a> on Thursday, after two days of trilateral talks with the United States in Abu Dhabi, to hold further discussions in the coming weeks, according to a communique issued by Ukraine’s top negotiator. The communique expressed thanks to the United Arab Emirates for organising the meeting and to US President Donald Trump for “his leadership in advancing efforts to end the war”.</li>\n<li>Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the delegations from the US, Ukraine and Russia had <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/5/sorry-for-being-away-ukraine-russia-swap-prisoners-of-war\">agreed to an exchange of 314 prisoners of war</a>, which took place on Thursday. It was the first such swap in five months.</li>\n<li>Russia and Ukraine exchanged 157 prisoners of war each, the Russian Defence Ministry said. Three civilians from the Kursk region were also returned to Russia.</li>\n<li>President Zelenskyy said some of the released POWs had been held for nearly four years. He said the next round of talks would be held soon, likely in the US.</li>\n<li>Witkoff, writing on the X social media platform, said: “The discussions were constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace.”</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Poland is preparing a new 200 million zloty ($55.9m) aid package for Ukraine, mainly made up of armoured equipment, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday during a visit to Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Tusk also said that Poland could give Ukraine MiG-29 fighter jets at any time, but that Zelenskyy had told him Kyiv may need other air-defence equipment as a higher priority, and that he would discuss this with Polish officials and get back to the Ukrainian president.</li>\n<li>After his talks with Tusk, Zelenskyy repeated his pleas for air-defence missiles and said Kyiv was ready to swap its drones, in which it has become a global leader, for missiles from allies or for Poland’s Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets.</li>\n<li>Slovak prosecutors on Thursday shut down investigations initiated by Prime Minister Robert Fico’s government that claimed donations of fighter jets and air defence systems by the previous Slovak administration to Ukraine were a crime.</li>\n<li>Bratislava regional prosecutor Rastislav Remeta said that the dozen Soviet-era MiG-29 jets and the S-300 and KUB air defence systems donated to Ukraine were outdated, not fully operational and lacked missiles as well as pilots. He said their donation was not a crime, as alleged by Fico and his aides.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sanctions</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old Ukraine war.</li>\n<li>Bessent said he would consider new sanctions against Russia’s shadow fleet – a step Trump has not taken since returning to office in January 2025. “I will take it under consideration. We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal warned households that planned blackouts could worsen in the coming days and Russian forces could launch a new air attack to further disable power and heating networks.</li>\n<li>More than 200 emergency crews are at work in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv restoring heating to apartment buildings after a series of mass Russian attacks in January, the minister said.</li>\n<li>A Ukrainian power plant that was damaged in Russian strikes and that supplied heating to more than 1,100 apartment buildings in Kyiv may need two months to repair, Mayor Klitschko said. The Darnytsia thermal power plant, the capital’s most important, was battered in Russia’s massive barrage on Tuesday.</li>\n<li>Sweden’s government said it will provide aid to Ukraine’s energy system worth one billion Swedish crowns ($111.1m).</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russia is ready for international cooperation over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, including with the US, a senior Russian nuclear official was quoted as saying. But the facility must be Russian, said Alexei Likhachev, head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. Russian forces have controlled the plant in southern Ukraine since shortly after the start of the war in 2022.</li>\n<li>Russia has expelled a German diplomat in response to what it said was Berlin’s groundless expulsion of a Russian diplomat last month and accused Germany of being in the grip of “spy mania”.</li>\n<li>Trump said Thursday he was giving right-wing ally Prime Minister Viktor Orban his full-throated endorsement in Hungary’s upcoming general election.</li>\n<li>“Victor Orban is a true friend, fighter, and WINNER,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, adding he “has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election” as premier. Orban responded swiftly to Trump, posting on Facebook: “Thank you Mr President!”</li>\n</ul><h3>Regional security</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Trump has rejected an offer from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments after the New START treaty that held them in check for 15 years expired on Thursday.</li>\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to proposals from Russian President Vladimir Putin.</li>\n<li>Only about a third of countries attending a summit on the military use of artificial intelligence agreed on Thursday to a declaration on how to govern the deployment of AI technology in warfare, with China and the US opting out. Just 35 out of 85 countries attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI, according to reports.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

new website that he says will lower the cost of prescription medicines, which have long stood out for their sky-high prices in the US compared with similar products around the world.</p><p>Trump announced the launch of the new website called TrumpRx, which allows consumers to buy discounted drugs directly from pharma companies, at an event at the White House on Thursday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“People are going to save a lot of money and be healthy,” Trump said, stating that some of the world’s largest drug producers have agreed to bring down prices under “Most Favoured Nation” agreements in exchange for avoiding US tariffs.</p><p>The website is launching with savings on more than 40 popular drugs, the White House said.</p><p>Users can search the site for the medication they want, then print out a coupon and present it at a pharmacy to buy at the discounted price.</p><p>The Trump administration has pitched the initiative as a populist attack on powerful pharmaceutical companies amid growing discontent over the state of the economy.</p><p>A group of 16 drug companies have agreed to discount deals, under which they will offer lower prices for certain drugs to government programmes such as Medicaid and, via TrumpRx, to US consumers.</p><p>The TrumpRx site, which promises “the world’s lowest prices on prescription drugs”, showcases more than 40 medications, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, and calls the effort “the most impactful prescription price reset in the history of our country”.</p><p>“Thanks to President Trump, the days of Big Pharma price-gouging are over,” the website states.</p><p>But analysts <a href=\"/news/2025/10/3/what-is-trumps-new-trumprx-website-and-will-it-bring-medicine-prices-down\">have

out-of-pocket costs that are still relatively unaffordable for a lot of people,” Cubanski said.</p><p>TrumpRx is representative of the US president’s personalistic style of shaping policy, seeking to cut <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\">individual deals</a> to advance his own priorities rather than using traditional regulatory and legislative means.</p><p>A previous analysis by KFF stated that the details of the Most Favoured Nation agreements with the firms “remain confidential, which means that very little is known publicly about what exactly has been agreed to”.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies remain a powerful force in US politics, with the watchdog group <a

Other footage shows masked agents deploying chemical agents and beating civilians who were documenting their activities or protesting – activities protected under the US Constitution.</p><p>To protect civil liberties and avoid further bloodshed, Democrats on Wednesday night released a series of <a href=\"https://jeffries.house.gov/2026/02/04/leaders-jeffries-and-schumer-deliver-urgent-ice-reform-demands-to-republican-leadership/\">10 demands</a>.</p><p>Many pertain to agent transparency. One of the demands was a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, and another would require them to prominently display their identification number and agency.</p><p>Body cameras would also be mandated, though the Democrats clarified that the footage obtained through such devices should only be used for accountability, not to track protesters.</p><p>Other proposed rules would codify use-of-force policies in the Homeland Security Department and prohibit entry into households without a judicial warrant, as has been common practice under US law. They would also outlaw racial profiling as a metric for conducting immigration stops and arrests.</p><h2 id=\"political-battle-over-funding\">Political battle over funding</h2><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “astounded to hear” that Republicans considered the demands to be unreasonable.</p><p>“It’s about people’s basic rights. It’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. He called on Republicans to “explain why” they objected to such standards.</p><p>In a joint statement with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Schumer appealed to members of both parties to coalesce around what he described as common-sense guardrails.</p><p>“Federal immigration agents cannot continue to cause chaos in our cities while using taxpayer money that should be used to make life more affordable for working families,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote.</p><p>“It is critical that we come together to impose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people are demanding.”</p><p>Already, Democrats succeeded in separating Homeland Security funding from a spending bill passed on Tuesday to prevent a partial government shutdown.</p><p>Some Democrats and Republicans have pushed for a second split in order to vote on funding for ICE and CBP separately from FEMA and TSA spending.</p><p>But Republican leaders have opposed holding separate votes on those agencies, with Thune arguing it would amount to giving Democrats the ability to “defund law enforcement”.</p><p>Thune added that he would encourage Democrats to submit their reforms in legislation separate from Homeland Security funding.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the two parties can agree to a compromise before the February 13 deadline. Democrats, meanwhile, have continued to push for other measures, including the removal of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p></div></div></body></html>"
