In June, in the centre of Torun, central-north Poland, a Venezuelan man stabbed 24-year-old Klaudia, a Polish woman, to death as she was walking home from work through a park.</p><p>That horrific incident led to a silent march by thousands of protesters through Torun on Sunday, July 6. Local media reported that the march had been organised by supporters of the far-right Konfederacja political alliance and people carried signs saying “stop illegal immigration”.</p><p>Then came the rumours and misinformation. On July 14, someone in Walbrzych, southwestern Poland, called the police to report a Paraguayan man who had allegedly taken pictures of children on a playground.</p><p>The police stopped the man but did not find anything incriminating on his phone. That didn’t stop two Polish men from beating him up soon afterwards. And, the next day, a group of about 50 people stormed the hostel he and other migrants were living in. Some people threw flares into the building, and the owner has since been forced to close the hostel down.</p><p>In recent weeks, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been on the rise, spurred by far-right rhetoric, which asserts that Poland has been flooded with “unconstrained illegal migration”. Claims that migrants take local jobs and that they pose a threat to Poles both physically and figuratively, with their “foreign lifestyle”, are common and even encouraged by lawmakers.</p><p>One MP from Konfederacja – Konrad Berkowicz from Krakow – told TOK FM radio: “Xenophobia is an important element of our national unity. Condemning xenophobia and stifling it in the West has led to rapes and terrorist acts, that’s why we should cherish xenophobia.”</p><p>Elmi Abdi, 62, a Somali who came to Poland in 1996 as a refugee, told Al Jazeera: “Today, migrants are seen as responsible for all of Poland’s problems; we are scapegoats that all parties attack, even though politicians know it’s all untrue.” Today, Abdi is head of the Good Start foundation, which supports migrants, offering help with access to language classes, legal assistance and other matters.</p><p>“It is sad because we [immigrants] do everything to work safely here, pay taxes, and integrate into society.”</p><p>As misinformation – such as in the Walbrzych incident – about immigrants spreads, the Polish Migration Forum, a rights group, has called the atmosphere in Poland “pre-pogrom-like”.</p><p>“What distinguishes today’s situation is the violence. We are in a very bad place,” said Agnieszka Kosowicz, head of the forum. “Acts of violence already take place, people are subject to insults, threats and displays of hostility and contempt. This is a very alarming situation that requires a decisive response from the state.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867404\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867404\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25202530527656-1-1753963975.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Belarus border\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Border guard officers stand guard at the Polish-Belarusian border, in Polowce, Poland, on Monday, July 21, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rumours-of-illegal-returns\">Rumours of ‘illegal returns’</h2><p>On July 7, Poland reinstated border controls with Germany and Lithuania. That followed similar restrictions Germany imposed earlier in the year to discourage asylum seekers from entering through Poland.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Poland is also now actively monitoring the return of migrants – both asylum and non-asylum seekers – by the German police, as per European Union rules. These are people who arrived in Poland from outside the EU before crossing to Germany.</p><p>These returns of migrants by the German authorities are legal, but as rumours on the internet about “illegal returns” of migrants continue to spread, unofficial, far-right patrols have appeared at the borders to monitor the situation and make “citizen arrests” of individuals they believe to be entering the country illegally – so far without much success.</p><p>The EU <a href=\"/news/2021/11/21/poland-says-belarus-still-bringing-migrants-to-its-border\">accused</a> Belarusian and Russian authorities of fomenting the EU’s migration crisis to destabilise the continent, by encouraging people from the Global South to travel to Belarus and then onwards into Europe via Poland.</p><p>In 2022, Poland built a fence along the border with Belarus to prevent migrants from entering the country irregularly. The fence, however, did little to physically stop migrants from coming in.</p><p>So, in March this year, Poland suspended the right to claim asylum altogether in a bid to deter people from coming.</p><p>All of this has served to stir up anti-migrant fear in Poland, which has been further amplified by far-right groups for their own political purposes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3854179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Far-right-groups-on-Saturday-march-through-central-Krakow-1753342339.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Anti-migrant protests in Poland\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Far-right groups march through central Krakow on Saturday, July 19 [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-are-being-humiliated\">‘We are being humiliated’</h2><p>The hysteria reached a new high nearly two weeks ago, when, on Saturday, July 19, anti-migrant marches organised by the far-right Konfederacja party and football fans swept through 80 Polish towns and cities, shouting racist slurs and slogans.</p><p>Sixteen-year-old Nikola, who did not want to give her surname, told Al Jazeera that she had travelled 125km (80 miles) from her home in Gorlice, southern Poland, to attend the march in Krakow. She said she came along after watching videos on YouTube claiming that, in Western Europe, people are “afraid to leave their homes” because of the number of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>She said it was important to her to join a cause that “unites Poles today”.</p><p>“I wanted to be part of a community. People are showing those at the top that they care about security and that Poland is our country. We should do everything we can to prevent what’s happening in Western Europe,” she said.</p><p>“I’d like to feel safe in my city, and I’ve already seen a few people who looked like they are not from here,” she added.</p><p>On the march, Nikola joined a large column of several hundred people, many of them wearing Polish patriotic T-shirts and emblems of the Wisla football club, walking to Market Square. On the way, they passed tourists, some of whom were filming the protesters.</p><p>Three elderly women proudly waved white-and-red Polish flags among the football fans. “The nation has had enough of what’s happening. It’s waking up because we’re living under terror, being humiliated,” said Danuta, 60, who also did not want to give her full name. “The borders are not sealed and have to be defended by civilians,” she added, referring to the right-wing groups who patrol the Polish-German border.</p><p>On Market Square in the centre of the city, the march crossed paths with a smaller counterdemonstration organised by local left-wing groups, and the two groups exchanged insults while separated by the police.</p><p>The police did not record any major incidents during the day. But Abdi and other migrants Al Jazeera spoke with by telephone said they did not dare to leave their homes on Saturday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867418\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867418\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25200488216520-1-1753964344.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Krakow demo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police officers try to separate and secure a small group of counter-demonstrators who attempt to block an anti-immigration demonstration in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, July 19, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fake-news-fans-the-flames\">Fake news fans the flames</h2><p>According to experts, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been spurred by misinformation and fake news about the number of people entering the country, which does not reflect reality.</p><p>“Poland is not experiencing any large-scale irregular migration,” said Kosowicz. “Within the Dublin procedure [under EU rules], Germany returns people who claimed asylum in Poland and then crossed into Germany. In 2024, there were 688 such people, and this year – 318. This is nothing new.”</p><p>According to the International Migration Outlook report for 2024 from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2.2 percent of Poland’s population was foreign-born in 2023. This is low compared with other European countries such as the UK (15.4 percent), Germany (18.2 percent) and France (13.8 percent).</p><p>In 2022, 152,000 immigrants obtained residence permits for more than one year in Poland, the OECD said.</p><p>At the Polish-Belarusian border, which has been used by migrants from Global South countries trying to reach Europe since 2021, incoming numbers of migrants have not been particularly high, either. According to official data, from January to late June this year, 15,022 illegal crossing attempts were recorded, of which only 5 percent were successful.</p><p>In 2024, there were nearly 30,000 attempts, out of which, by contrast, one-third (10,900) were successful. In 2021, before Poland built a fence at the border with Belarus, the number of attempts reached 52,000.</p><p>Kosowicz also blames the government, which she says has failed to build awareness about the costs and benefits of development and migration, making all foreigners potential victims of hate attacks.</p><p>“A study by Deloitte and UNHCR says that 2.7 percent of Polish GDP comes solely from the work of Ukrainian refugees. But this isn’t the information we hear from politicians,” she said.</p><p>Abdi, who is married to a Polish woman with whom he has two children, worries greatly about their future.</p><p>“When I arrived here, the Poles welcomed me wonderfully, and I care deeply about Poland; it’s my home. I want it to be safe for everyone,” he told Al Jazeera in fluent Polish.</p><p>“At the marches, people shout that they want a white Poland. I’m old enough, I’m not afraid of anything. But I am worried about my children.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Other trade partners will see tariffs of 15 percent or more.</p><p>Trump cited the “continued lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships” in a statement on the White House website announcing the reimposition of the tariffs.</p><p>“I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners,” he said.</p><p>Most of the announced tariffs will not go into effect until August 7, except for tariffs on Canada, which take effect on August 1.</p><p>The White House said the delay will give Customs and Border Protection time to adjust to the changed environment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>Adjusted rates and expectations</strong></h2><p>Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera that the tariffs were announced just hours before the latest deadline.</p><p>Trump has already hit pause on the tariffs several times since he first announced his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs on most US trade partners.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The existing legal authority for tariff modifications was set to expire at 12:01am on August 1. It was necessary to issue new rules; otherwise, everything would snap back to rates set on April 2,” she said.</p><p>Elms told Al Jazeera the latest round of rates from July 31 was based on unusual calculations.</p><p>“The numbers are all over the place. The original formula was nonsense, but at least it had a logic. These rates do not appear to fit known facts. Some countries that bargained hard got better outcomes. Some did not. Some that didn’t get a hearing went down while others were increased,” she said.</p><p>Inu Manak, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said many countries may try to negotiate tariff rates before the August 7 deadline.</p><p>“The new rates won’t be implemented for seven days, so that gives countries that were already well into negotiations another week to secure a deal and never have these new tariffs imposed,” Manak said. The incentive is high for countries with a tariff of 15 percent or more to strike a deal, she added.</p><h2><strong>Tariff calculations</strong></h2><p>The July 31 tariffs retain a 10 percent “universal tariff” for most countries with which the US holds a trade surplus, or where the US exports more goods than it receives.</p><p>The major changes were for countries with which the US holds a trade deficit, or where the US sells fewer goods than it receives.</p><p>These countries face a base 15 percent tariff, although rates vary depending on whether they reached a deal with the White House or how Trump feels about their economy.</p><p>The White House previously announced tariff agreements with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan, Thailand and the UK. It is also setting separate tariffs for key industries and exports such as semiconductors, automotive, auto parts, steel and aluminium.</p><p>Rates have dropped for most countries with which the US holds a trade deficit, although there were some surprises.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Taiwan’s initial tariff rate of 32 percent dropped to 20 percent, but the figure is still higher than a deal made by neighbouring Japan and South Korea.</p><p>India also faces a 25 percent tariff despite its close relationship with the US, while tariffs for Pakistan fell from 29 to 19 percent.</p><p>Experts were scratching their heads over the decision to raise tariffs for Switzerland from 31 to 39 percent, and set tariffs at 41 percent and 40 percent for war-torn Syria and Myanmar, respectively.</p><p>Other notable tariffs include 40 percent for Laos, 35 percent for Iraq and Serbia, and 30 percent for Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya and South Africa.</p><p>“The Trump administration takes a country-by-country approach when it comes to trade. There is no overarching theory to explain the specifics for each country. Each country gets its own tariff rate based on the view of the president at that given time, for trade reasons or otherwise,” said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore.</p><h2><strong>Canada in the firing line</strong></h2><p>In a separate White House fact sheet, Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada from 25 to 35 percent. China and Mexico, however, were notably absent from Trump’s latest list despite drawing his ire earlier this year.</p><p>Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, told Al Jazeera that Trump may still be deciding how to respond after US and Chinese officials met in Stockholm this week to discuss tariffs.</p><p>China is set to face an additional 30 percent tariff on most of its goods if an agreement is not reached by August 12.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on social media that Washington had agreed to a 90-day extension thanks to ongoing dialogue.</p><p>The US is also set to implement new rules of origin to determine tariff rates on transshipped goods in the coming weeks, the Reuters news agency reports, citing an unnamed senior Trump administration official.</p><p>Transshipped goods are those moved between vessels at an intermediate destination during transit to their final destination. The technicalities of the rules are being worked out, the official added.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: We had a very good call with the president of the United States, Donald Trump. We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow and secured 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue. I was joined by Juan Ramón de la Fuente, secretary of foreign affairs; Marcelo Ebrard, secretary of economy; and Roberto Velasco, undersecretary for North America.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They mark a significant escalation in US trade policy, leading to higher prices for consumers and bigger financial hits for companies.</p><p>Trump had initially postponed “reciprocal tariffs”, which he had announced on April 2, giving countries time to reach trade deals with the US.</p><p>On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the August 1 tariffs were a “hard deadline”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-august-1-tariffs\">What are the August 1 tariffs?</h2><p>Several countries are facing a slew of tariffs on August 1. While the situation remains dynamic, different levies are going to hit countries ranging from 15 percent on Japan and the European Union to 50 percent on Brazil.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-has-struck-last-minute-deals\">Who has struck last-minute deals?</h2><p>Trump has struck a series of bilateral trade deals in the last few days.</p><p>With the EU, the US secured $750bn in energy purchases and reduced tariffs on steel via a quota system. In exchange, it lowered auto tariffs from 30 percent to 15 percent, applying the same rate to pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.</p><p>Japan committed $550bn in investments targeting US industries such as semiconductors, AI and energy, while increasing rice imports under a 100,000-tonne duty-free quota. It will also purchase US commodities like ethanol, aircraft and defence goods.</p><p>Indonesia reportedly agreed to duty-free access for many US products and increased energy and agricultural imports, although Jakarta has only confirmed tariff cuts and key commodity purchases so far.</p><p>The United Kingdom gained aerospace and auto export benefits, while granting the US duty-free beef quotas and a 1.4 billion litre ethanol quota.</p><p>China saw its reciprocal tariffs slashed from 145 percent to the baseline 10 percent that was imposed on all countries. In addition, there’s a 20 percent punitive tariff for fentanyl trafficking. A temporary pause for the final tariff rate has been extended until August 12 while the two hammer out a deal. China matched the cut and eased non-tariff measures, resuming rare earth exports and accepting Boeing deliveries.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Deals with the Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam also include tariff adjustments and market access, though not all terms have been confirmed by those governments.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"which-sectors-are-expected-to-be-hit-worst\">Which sectors are expected to be hit worst?</h2><p>According to a Reuters news agency tracker, which looks at how companies are responding to Trump’s tariff threats, the first-quarter earnings season saw automakers, airlines and consumer goods importers take the worst hit by tariff threats.</p><p>Levies on aluminium and electronics, such as semiconductors, led to increased costs.</p><p>“When you start to see tariffs at 20 or more, you reach a point where firms may stop importing altogether,” Joseph Foudy, an economics professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/21/as-trumps-tariff-deadline-looms-economists-see-calm-before-the-storm\">told Al Jazeera</a>.</p><p>“Firms simply postpone major decisions, delay hiring, and economic activity declines,” Foudy added.</p><p>Economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs implemented so far has not been fully felt, as many businesses built up their stockpiles of inventories in advance to mitigate rising costs.</p><p>In an analysis published last month, BBVA Research estimated that even the current level of US tariffs – including a baseline 10 percent duty on nearly all countries, and higher levies on cars and steel – could slow economic growth and reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.5 of a percentage point in the short term, and by more than 2 percentage points over the medium term.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"have-prices-increased\">Have prices increased?</h2><p>According to HBS Pricing Lab reports, prices of US-made and imported goods saw modest seasonal declines through early March, with imports falling slightly more. The first 10 percent US tariff on Chinese goods (February 4) had little effect, but prices rose after broader tariffs were imposed on March 4, including a 25 percent tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports and another 10 percent tariff on China. Imported goods prices jumped by 1.2 points, while prices of domestic goods rose by half as much.</p><p>After a 10 percent global tariff was announced on April 2, “Liberation Day”, and 145 percent on China on April 10, import prices rose more sharply. A brief price dip followed the May 12 tariff rollback on Chinese goods, but trends resumed by June.

He had been under house arrest since Sunday, reports said.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p data-start=\"1395\" data-end=\"1735\">The Attorney General’s Office, controlled by the Ortega government, announced Wednesday it had launched a corruption probe against Arce, accusing him of “illegal transactions and negotiations” related to properties and businesses allegedly tied to state interests. Prosecutors claim Arce refused to cooperate or present documentation when questioned.</p><p data-start=\"1737\" data-end=\"1857\">His aide, Ricardo Bonilla, was arrested a day earlier for allegedly refusing to “render accounts”, officials added.</p><p data-start=\"1859\" data-end=\"2210\">The Nicaraguan news outlet Confidencial reported that Arce’s detention is part of a broader purge being directed by Vice President Rosario Murillo, Ortega’s wife and co-ruler, with the president’s full support. Sources close to the exiled opposition believe Murillo is consolidating power in preparation for succession, as Ortega’s health visibly deteriorates.</p><p data-start=\"2212\" data-end=\"2404\">In recent public appearances, Ortega, now 79, has appeared frail and unsteady. He is reported to suffer from lupus and kidney failure, raising speculation about who may eventually replace him.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2406\" data-end=\"2691\">Arce is the third prominent Sandinista veteran to be placed under house arrest this year. Henry Ruiz, another historic commander, was confined in March. Humberto Ortega, the president’s brother and a former army chief, was under similar restrictions before his death in September 2024.</p><p data-start=\"2693\" data-end=\"2990\">Arce and Daniel Ortega were close comrades during the 1979 Sandinista revolution that toppled United States-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza. After decades in and out of power, Ortega returned to the presidency in 2007 and has remained in office through successive elections that many have criticised as undemocratic.</p><p data-start=\"3261\" data-end=\"3465\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The arrests have sent a chilling message across Nicaragua’s political landscape, particularly among veteran revolutionaries who once stood alongside Ortega and are now facing marginalisation or detention.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s a perilous journey that has resulted in dozens of deaths over the years.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p data-start=\"1303\" data-end=\"1588\">The milestone is likely to intensify political scrutiny over Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s handling of undocumented migration. His government has pledged tougher action on smuggling networks, with Starmer vowing to “smash the gangs” responsible for transporting people across the Channel.</p><p data-start=\"1590\" data-end=\"1678\">Opposition politicians have seized on the latest numbers to criticise Labour’s approach.</p><p data-start=\"1680\" data-end=\"1967\">“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year. [And] 2025 is the worst year on record so far, and the Labour Government are doing nothing to stop the crossings,” said Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp.</p><p data-start=\"1969\" data-end=\"2227\">He added: “Their 17 in, one out deal with France will not even make a dent – it would take 10 years for [Home Secretary] Yvette Cooper to deport the illegal immigrants that have arrived since the start of this year alone under her so-called deal, which still hasn’t started.”</p><p data-start=\"1969\" data-end=\"2227\">Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced “<a href=\"/news/2025/7/10/starmer-and-macron-to-announce-one-in-one-out-migrant-returns-deal\">one in, one out”</a> returns of asylum seekers earlier this month. The pilot programme sets out that for every person returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, Starmer said at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2482\">Philp also reiterated his party’s proposal to immediately detain and deport new arrivals, warning that continued legal challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could force a Conservative government to consider withdrawing from it, a threat they have often made in and around the Brexit years when the party was in government.</p><p data-start=\"2484\" data-end=\"2720\">Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday. This means more hotels, more costs and more people who should not be here. The public have had ENOUGH!”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"2484\" data-end=\"2720\">A series of violent far-right demonstrations have been held recently outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, north of London.</p><p data-start=\"3123\" data-end=\"3304\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration platform and has been executing it during his second term with raids and deportations of immigrants,  recently praised the UK government’s efforts, saying it was “doing a fantastic thing” by addressing the issue, though he admitted knowing “nothing about the boats”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
