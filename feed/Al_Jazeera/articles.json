Under Taiwan’s election laws, organisers must secure signatures from 10 percent of a district’s registered voters to hold a recall vote.</p>\n<p>For a recall vote to succeed, 25 percent of registered voters in each district must participate, and the recall must receive more votes in favour than against.</p>\n<p>If voters choose to recall a legislator, a by-election must be held within three months.</p>\n<p>The KMT’s traditional stronghold is in the north of the country and notably around the capital city of Taipei, but recall votes will be held across Taiwan this weekend.</p>\n<p>The KMT won 52 out of 113 seats in the legislature in 2024, and with the Taiwan People’s Party and two independent legislators, holds a 62-seat majority coalition.</p>\n<p>That coalition has been strong enough to block the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which holds 51 seats, and stall the agenda of the country’s DPP President Lai during his first year in office.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3><strong>Can the recall succeed?</strong></h3>\n<p>Taiwan typically has high voter turnout during major elections, but recall votes are much more of a wildcard, said Lev Nachman, an expert in Taiwanese politics at National Taiwan University.</p>\n<p>“Our prior experience should tell us that these should not pass. However, we’ve never seen mobilisation work like this at recalls before,” he told Al Jazeera, citing the widespread involvement of common people. “We are in a bit of unprecedented times.”</p>\n<p>Ho Chih-yung, KMT member and former party spokesperson, told Al Jazeera the recall campaign had created a “national election-like atmosphere” that would test the mobilisation and engagement of Taiwan’s major political parties.</p>\n<p>The weather could also tip the scales, he said, as a tropical storm is passing north of Taiwan, and the bad weather may discourage the KMT’s older voter base from going out to vote.</p>\n<h3>Why is the recall vote international news?</h3>\n<p>The vote will determine if Lai will be a lame-duck president for the next three years, and whether he has the ability to carry out key defence and foreign policy initiatives, Nachman said.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, it’s a really big deal because every question that foreign policy people have is contingent upon whether these recalls are successful or not successful,” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue carries global significance due to Taiwan’s contested political status and the threat of a future conflict involving China in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>“The classic Taiwan problem is that it’s not just that society is split, it’s that society is split, and the clock is ticking about whether or not there’s going to be a war over this place,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Everything here is infinitely more existential.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3854260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854260\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-20T155733Z_1753368855_RC24PFANW9WO_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-POLITICS-1753343960.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of the recall movement gather in Taipei, Taiwan July 19, 2025.

Some voters believe that the party has been co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing.</p>\n<p>The CCP has threatened to one day annex Taiwan by peace or by force, and Taiwan’s two main political parties offer different approaches for how to respond to Beijing’s threat.</p>\n<p>President Lai’s DPP has taken a more outspoken approach by advocating for Taiwan on the international stage and ramping up defence spending, while the KMT follows a more conciliatory approach that favours ongoing dialogue with China.</p>\n<p>Fears surrounding China have in the past unseated some of the KMT’s most prominent members, such as party whip Fu Kun-chi, who controversially led a delegation of lawmakers to Beijing last year at a time of significant political tension in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3><strong>What does the KMT say?</strong></h3>\n<p>Party member and former KMT spokesperson Ho said the recall supporters were abusing a system designed to remove individuals deemed unfit for holding their posts for serious reasons, such as corruption.</p>\n<p>“This ‘mass recall’ campaign is not driven by the individual performance of KMT legislators, but is instead a blanket attempt to unseat opposition lawmakers across the board,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“To advance this effort, the DPP has deliberately framed the KMT as ‘pro-China’ and accused it of ‘selling out Taiwan’, a tactic designed to inflame ideological divisions and mobilise its base through fear and hostility, thereby increasing the likelihood that the recall votes will pass,” he said.</p>\n<p>A senior KMT party member also told Al Jazeera that voters may be looking for an outlet for their frustrations amid a rising cost of living and the economic stress resulting from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war and threat of tariffs on Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 32 percent on the island-nation’s export-driven economy. Over the past six months, the New Taiwan dollar has appreciated 11 percent, impacting the bottom line of thousands of small and medium domestic manufacturers who must compete with foreign goods becoming cheaper for Taiwan’s consumers as their dollars go further in terms of spending power.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3854265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-22T031229Z_1485271307_RC2TPFA2YSL1_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-POLITICS-1753344114.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: People against the recall movement gather in Taoyuan, Taiwan, July 20, 2025.

But several powerful Western countries – including the US, the United Kingdom and Germany – have refused to do so.</p>\n<p>Fellow European Union members Norway, Ireland and Spain <a href=\"/news/2024/5/28/ireland-norway-and-spain-recognised-palestine-what-has-that-changed\">indicated in May</a> that they had begun the process to recognise a Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>But Macron’s decision would make France – one of Israel’s closest allies and a G7 member – the largest and arguably most influential country in Europe to make the move.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision, saying such a move “rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy”.</p>\n<p>“A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel – not to live in peace beside it,” he said in a post on X.</p>\n<p>“Let’s be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,” Netanyahu added.</p>\n<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz also described the move as “a disgrace and a surrender to terrorism”. He added that Israel would not allow the establishment of a “Palestinian entity that would harm our security, endanger our existence”.</p>\n<p>While supporting a two-state solution remains the long-held official stance of the US, President Donald Trump has himself expressed doubts about its viability. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump suggested the US could “take over” Gaza, displace the territory’s more than two million Palestinian population, and transform it into the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/trump-says-us-will-take-over-and-own-gaza-in-redevelopment-plan\">“Riviera of the Middle East”</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump’s plan has been condemned by rights groups, Arab states, Palestinians and the UN as tantamount to “ethnic cleansing”.</p>\n<p>In June, Washington’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, also said he did not think an independent Palestinian state remained a US foreign policy goal.</p>\n<p>His comments prompted Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce to say Huckabee “speaks for himself” and policy-making is a matter for Trump and the White House.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>On Thursday, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the US will not attend an upcoming conference set to be held at the UN on the two-state solution. The conference – co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, and scheduled to take place between July 28-30 – seeks to chart a roadmap to end the decades-long conflict and recognise a Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>Speaking to reporters, Pigott said there was “nothing further” to say about the issue other than that Washington “will not be in attendance”.</p>\n<p>There is mounting pressure on Israel to end its deadly war on Gaza, waged in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which saw some 1,139 people killed and more than 200 captives taken to the Palestinian enclave.</p>\n<p>Israel’s subsequent 21-month assault on Gaza has resulted in almost 60,000 Palestinians being killed, with a further 144,000 wounded.</p>\n<p>Months-long ceasefire negotiations – brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar – have so far failed to yield a breakthrough.</p>\n<p>On Monday, 28 countries – including the UK, Japan and numerous European nations – <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/28-countries-called-for-an-end-to-israels-war-on-gaza-what-did-they-say\">issued a joint statement</a> telling Israel the war on Gaza “must end now”.</p>\n<p>The joint statement also condemned “the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Trump, however, argued that the law was necessary to stem what he described as an “invasion” of criminals into the US.</p>\n<p>Rengel was arrested on March 13 as part of that deportation sweep under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>\n<p>According to his complaint, immigration agents nabbed him in the car park outside his apartment in Irving, Texas, and accused him of being a member of the Venezuelan gang <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/us-sanctions-alleged-leader-of-venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua\">Tren de Aragua</a> based on his tattoos.</p>\n<p>Rengel was in the process of seeking legal status. He had entered the US in June 2023 after successfully receiving an appointment through the CBP One app, which was, at the time, the official portal for asylum claims and other immigration processing at the US-Mexico border.</p>\n<p>He had an appointment before an immigration judge scheduled for 2028.</p>\n<p>But according to his complaint, his life was upended when he was arrested and sent to an immigration detention facility. There, he said, members of the DHS falsely indicated he would be returned to his native Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Instead, he was placed on a deportation flight to El Salvador.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Cameras filmed the 250-plus Venezuelan men being disembarked and bussed to the CECOT prison, where their heads were shaved and they were forced to march, handcuffed and heads bowed, into cells. The facility is designed to hold up to 40,000 people.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration reportedly paid nearly $6m to El Salvador to imprison the deported men.</p>\n<p>Once inside the CECOT prison, Rengel alleges that he was struck with beaten – sometimes with batons, sometimes with bare fists – including at least one occasion where he was moved to an area where the prison had no cameras.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Rengel was part of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/venezuela-frees-10-americans-in-swap-for-deported-migrants-in-el-salvador\">a prisoner exchange</a> that saw all of the deported Venezuelan men released from CECOT and sent back to their home country, in exchange for the freedom of alleged political detainees and 10 Americans imprisoned in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Rengel has since remained with his mother, “terrified” of the prospect of returning to the US, according to his lawyers.</p>\n<p>His complaint was made in compliance with the Federal Tort Claims Act, which sets a pathway for lawsuits against the federal government. It gives the government a maximum of six months to respond to the allegations before a suit can be filed.</p>\n<p>Already, the Trump administration released a statement signalling it plans to fight Rengel’s claims. It doubled down on its accusation that Rengel was a gang member.</p>\n<p>“President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will not allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate in our country and endanger Americans,” the Department of Homeland Security told The Associated Press news agency.</p>\n<p>“We hear far too much about gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to expedite deportations has been the subject of numerous legal challenges.</p>\n<p>US District Court Judge James Boasberg had ordered the deportation flights in March to return to the US and has since indicated that the Trump administration may be in <a href=\"/news/2025/4/18/trump-faces-contempt-risk-what-happens-if-president-violates-court-orders\">contempt of court</a> for failing to do so.</p>\n<p>In June, Boasberg <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/trump-must-facilitate-legal-challenges-of-deported-venezuelans-judge\">further ruled</a> that the deported Venezuelan men must be given the opportunity to challenge their removals in US courts.</p>\n<p>His decision indicated that there was “significant evidence” that many of the men were languishing “in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

As soon as you have infrastructure or people in place within another country, you have a limited time to use them, so if that’s setting fires or setting detonations, it’s a way of keeping them active and letting Iran know they’re there.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"likelihood-of-new-war\">Likelihood of new war</h2>\n<p>Few could have predicted the complete absence of restraint with which Netanyahu, previously a figure considered to be somewhat averse to conflict, has attacked neighbouring states, Syria and Lebanon, as well as regional actors, such as Yemen and Iran, while maintaining his brutal assault upon Gaza.</p>\n<p>But while a renewed offensive upon Israel’s historical bogeyman, Iran, might prove popular in the face of growing internal division over Israel’s war on Gaza, how well received it might be by his principal ally remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>“Trump is a concern and Israel will want to keep on the right side of whatever line he’s drawn [on its actions],” Goldberg said. “But Iran is a consensus issue within Israel. People might argue about Gaza, but never Iran. If Netanyahu feels himself under threat, he’s going to want to crack the Iranian whip and unify people behind him.”</p>\n<p>Iran, for its part, won’t be caught flat-footed a second time, say analysts.</p>\n<p>Mortazavi told Al Jazeera that Iran is expecting Israel to continue its aggression, even as it still holds out hope to reach a deal on its nuclear programme through diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“I think they know that a deal will reduce the chances of an Israeli attack,” she said.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The president joked that he would back off Powell if he lowered interest rates.</p>\n<p>“I’d love him to lower interest rates,” Trump said, as Powell stood by, his face expressionless.</p>\n<p>Powell typically spends the Thursday afternoon before a rate-setting meeting doing back-to-back calls with Fed bank presidents as part of his preparations for the session.</p>\n<p>Elevated by Trump to the top Fed job in 2018, and then reappointed by former President Joe Biden four years later, Powell last met with Trump in March when the Republican president summoned him to the White House to press him to lower rates.</p>\n<p>The visit takes place as Trump battles to deflect attention from a political crisis over his administration’s refusal to release files related to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/us-federal-judge-refuses-trumps-bid-to-unseal-epstein-grand-jury-records\">convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>, reversing a campaign promise. Epstein died in 2019.</p>\n<p>White House officials have ramped up Trump’s pressure campaign on Powell in recent weeks, accusing the Fed of mismanaging the renovation and suggesting poor oversight and potential fraud.</p>\n<p>White House budget director Russell Vought has pegged the cost overrun at “$700m and counting”, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for an extensive review of the Fed’s non-monetary policy operations, citing operating losses at the central bank as a reason to question its spending on the renovation.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Those losses stem from the mechanics of managing the Fed’s policy rate to fight inflation, which include paying banks to park cash at the central bank. The Fed reported a comprehensive net loss of $114.6bn in 2023 and $77.5bn in 2024, a reversal from years of big profits it turned over to the Treasury when interest rates – and inflation – were low.</p>\n<h2 id=\"renovations-in-the-spotlight\">Renovations in the spotlight</h2>\n<p>The Fed, in letters to Vought and lawmakers, backed up by documents posted on its website, says the project – the first full rehab of its two buildings in Washington since they were built nearly a century ago – ran into unexpected challenges, including toxic materials abatement and higher-than-estimated materials and labour costs.</p>\n<p>Ahead of Trump’s visit, Fed staff escorted a small group of reporters around the construction sites. They wove around cement mixers and construction machines, and spoke over the sound of drills, banging and saws. Fed staff pointed out security features, including blast-resistant windows, that they said were a significant driver of costs, in addition to tariffs and escalations in material and labour costs.</p>\n<p>The renovation project started in mid-2022 and is on track to be completed by 2027, with the move-in planned for March 2028. A visit to the roof of the Eccles Building – a point of particular scrutiny by White House critics that the renovations were ostentatious – revealed an impressive view of the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall, the pool report said.</p>\n<p>Staff explained that rooftop seating, although inexpensive, had been removed because of the appearance of it being an amenity and was one of only two deviations from the original plan. The other was the scrapping of a couple of planned fountains.</p>\n<p>Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, a Republican who sent Powell a letter on Wednesday asking a series of questions about the cost and other details of the renovation, as well as Powell’s own statements about it, is part of the visit as well.</p>\n<p>Market reaction to Trump’s visit was subdued. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds ticked higher after data showed new jobless claims dropped in the most recent week, signalling a stable labour market not in need of support from a Fed rate cut. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.</p>\n<p>Trump’s criticism of Powell and flirtation with firing him have previously upset financial markets and threatened a key underpinning of the global financial system: that central banks are independent and free from political meddling.</p>\n<p>His visit contrasts with a handful of other documented presidential visits to the Fed. Then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited the central bank in 1937 to dedicate the newly-built headquarters, which is one of the two Fed buildings now being renovated. Most recently, former President George W Bush went to the Fed in 2006 to attend the swearing-in of Ben Bernanke as Fed chief.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"central-bank-independence-critical\">Central bank independence critical</h2>\n<p>“I think it’s important that he send a signal that he really isn’t happy with how things are going at the Fed,” said Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee. She said the visit was a “good decision” by Trump.</p>\n<p>Senator Mike Rounds, another Republican who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Thursday he also saw no problem with Trump’s visit, though he added that Powell’s independence as Fed chief is “critical for the markets. I think he’s done a good job of that”.</p>\n<p>“I think the more information the president can glean from this, probably the better off we are in terms of resolving any issues that are outstanding,” Rounds said, noting that Powell had indicated “that they have had a significant amount of money, just in terms of foundation work and so forth, that was not anticipated to begin with”.</p>\n<p>Former Fed chiefs Janet Yellen and Bernanke this week wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times warning that the public’s belief that the US central bank is willing to make hard decisions based on data and independent of politics “is an important national asset. It is hard to acquire and easy to lose”.</p>\n<p>Economic experts widely agree.</p>\n<p>“As we’ve seen through the disinflation process that has been taking place over the last few years, the credibility of central banks around the world has been instrumental in anchoring inflation expectations and in bringing down inflation across many countries in the world,” International Monetary Fund spokesperson Julie Kozack said on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“And it is also important that independence, of course, must coexist with clear accountability to the public.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

These early months suggest the plan may be to use overwhelming firepower to end fights before they begin, or before they drag on.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-trump-doctrine\">A ‘Trump Doctrine’?</h2>\n<p>Trump’s willingness to unleash lethal force abroad – and the inherent risk that the brazen approach carries of dragging the US into protracted conflict – has already roiled influential segments of the president’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) base, coming to a head over Trump’s <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/21/discordant-how-trumps-attacks-on-the-houthis-split-his-republican-base\">six-week bombing campaign</a> against the Houthis in Yemen and, more recently, his June decision to <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/how-trumps-position-has-changed-on-iran-splitting-maga-base\">strike three nuclear facilities</a> in Iran amid Israel’s offensive on its neighbour.</p>\n<p>In turn, Trump’s top officials have sought to bring coherence to the strategy, with Vice President JD Vance in late June offering the clearest vision yet of a Trump blueprint for foreign intervention.</p>\n<p>“What I call the ‘Trump Doctrine’ is quite simple,” Vance said at the Ohio speech. “Number one, you articulate a clear American interest, and that’s in this case that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon.”</p>\n<p>“Number two, you try to aggressively diplomatically solve that problem,” he said.</p>\n<p>“And number three, when you can’t solve it diplomatically, you use overwhelming military power to solve it, and then you get the hell out of there before it ever becomes a protracted conflict.”</p>\n<p>But the reality of Trump’s early diplomatic and military adventures has not matched the vision outlined by Vance, according to Michael Wahid Hanna, the US Program Director at Crisis Group. He called the statement an attempt to “retrofit coherence”.</p>\n<p>While Hanna cautioned against putting too much stock into a unified strategy, he did point to one “consistent thread”: a diplomatic approach that appears “haphazard, not fully conceived, and characterised by impatience”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>“For all of the talk about being a peacemaker and wanting to see quick deals, Trump has a particularly unrealistic view of the ways in which diplomacy can work,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>The US president had vowed to transform peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war, but an earlier pressure campaign against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has since seen Trump <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/18/trump-talks-tough-on-russia-but-will-he-follow-through\">circle back</a> to the Biden administration’s hardline approach to Russia, with little progress made in between.</p>\n<p>After an initial ceasefire in Gaza, Trump officials have failed to make meaningful progress in reigning in <a href=\"/news/2025/7/21/uk-france-and-other-countries-demand-israels-war-on-gaza-must-end-now\">Israel’s war</a>, leaving the threat of knock-on conflicts, including with Iran and the Houthis in Yemen, unanswered.</p>\n<p>Earlier diplomatic overtures to address Iran’s nuclear programme stalled as Trump took a maximalist approach seeking to block any uranium enrichment. The effort dissolved after the US failed to constrain Israel’s military campaign against Tehran, as the US continues to provide billions in military funding to the “ironclad ally”.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to argue, as Vance did, that the United States has really pushed as hard as they can on diplomacy,” Hanna told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>Under Vance’s logic, he added, “that leaves them with no other means than to respond militarily”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bomb-first-and-ask-questions-later\">‘Bomb first and ask questions later’?</h2>\n<p>The early emphasis on air attacks has been accompanied by vows by Trump and his Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth to restore a “warrior ethos” within the US military.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Trump has appeared to relish the military actions, posting a video of the attack on an ISIL (ISIS) affiliated target in Somalia on February 1, just 10 days after taking office.</p>\n<p>He made a point to draw a comparison to Biden, who tightened rules of engagement policies Trump had loosened during his first term and entered office vowing to severely limit the reliance on US strikes.</p>\n<p>Trump wrote that “Biden and his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done”.</p>\n<p>“I did! The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that “WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!”</p>\n<p>All told since taking office six months ago, Trump has carried out at least 44 air strikes in Somalia, where the US has <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/under-trump-us-strikes-on-somalia-have-doubled-since-last-year-why\">long targeted</a> both a local ISIL offshoot and al-Shabab, according to ACLED data. The Biden administration carried out just over 60 such strikes during his entire four years in office.</p>\n<p>The US president has posted <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/4/6/trump-posts-video-of-us-strike-on-yemen-which-may-have-hit-civilians\">similarly boastful</a> messages about strikes in Yemen, where his administration conducted a bombing campaign from March to May, accounting for the vast majority of overall strikes during his second term, as well as US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which Trump declared were “obliterated like nobody’s ever seen before”, long before any <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/new-reports-cast-doubt-on-impact-of-us-strikes-on-irans-nuclear-sites\">in-depth assessment</a> had been made.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Raleigh, who is also a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex, said the increase could possibly be attributed to Trump’s pivot away from the soft-power policy of Biden, which has included <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/us-state-department-begins-layoffs-in-trumps-shake-up-of-diplomatic-corps\">shearing down</a> the US State Department and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/us-senate-approves-cutting-billions-in-foreign-aid-as-trump-demands\">dismantling</a> the US foreign aid apparatus.</p>\n<p>That could further be viewed as an effort by Trump to place the US as a “player in a new internationalised conflict environment”, where overall violence by state actors on foreign soil has increased steadily in recent years, currently accounting for 30 percent of all violent events ACLED tracks globally.</p>\n<p>“But I would say there’s still no clear Trump doctrine, as much as Vance wants to claim that there is,” Raleigh told Al Jazeera. “And at the moment, it’s looking a little bit like ‘bomb first and ask questions later.'”</p>\n<p>That approach has proven to have particularly deadly consequences, according to Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars. She drew a parallel to Trump’s first term, when he also surged air strikes, outpacing those of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, who himself oversaw an expansion of <a href=\"/opinions/2016/12/23/the-troubling-legacy-of-obamas-drone-campaign\">drone warfare</a> abroad.</p>\n<p>The monitor has tracked 224 reported civilian casualties in Yemen from US strikes under Trump in 2025, nearly totaling the 258 reported civilian casualties from US actions in the country during the 23 years prior. The administration has also used particularly powerful – and expensive – munitions in its strikes, which Airwars has assessed as appearing to have been deployed against a broader set of targets than under Biden.</p>\n<p>Two of the Trump administration’s strikes on Yemen, one on Ras Isa Port and another on a <a href=\"/news/2025/4/28/at-least-8-killed-in-latest-us-air-attacks-on-yemens-capital-saana\">migrant detention</a> centre in Saada, have been deemed possible war crimes by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</p>\n<p>“That’s not typical, or necessarily something you’d expect in a campaign whose remit, as defined by Trump, Hegseth, and [US Central Command], is on largely economic targets,” Tripp told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“There’s really no reason for there to be such high levels of civilian harm,” she said.</p>\n<p>Tripp added she was still waiting to assess how the Pentagon approaches civilian casualty investigations and transparency under Trump’s second term.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions-over-efficacy\">Questions over efficacy</h2>\n<p>It remains unclear whether the administration’s reliance on swift and powerful military strikes will actually prove effective in keeping the US troops out of protracted conflict.</p>\n<p>While a tenuous ceasefire continues to hold with the Houthis, the results of the US bombing campaign “have been pretty underwhelming”, the Crisis Group’s Hanna said, noting that few underlying conditions have changed.</p>\n<p>The group has continued to strike vessels in the Red Sea and to launch missiles at Israel in opposition to the war in Gaza. An attack in early July prompted State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce to warn the US “will continue to take necessary action to protect freedom of navigation and commercial shipping”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The jury also remains out on whether Trump’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities will lead to a diplomatic breakthrough on Iran’s nuclear programme, as the White House has maintained. Little progress has been made since a ceasefire was reached shortly after Tehran launched retaliatory strikes on a US base in Qatar.</p>\n<p>Crisis Group’s Hanna assessed that Trump has relied on air strikes in part because they have become somewhat “antiseptic” in US society, with their toll “shielded from a lot of public scrutiny”.</p>\n<p>But, he added: “There are limits in terms of what air power alone can do…That’s just the reality.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
