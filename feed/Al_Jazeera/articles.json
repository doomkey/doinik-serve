The United Arab Emirates, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Israel, also said it will begin airdropping aid into Gaza “immediately”.</p>\n<p>But humanitarian experts have been warning since last year that airdrops are dangerous to people on the ground and cannot serve as a substitute for safe land routes to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/we-are-dying-palestinians-slam-worlds-inaction-as-hunger-ravages-gaza\">distribute food</a> and medical supplies.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Saturday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, called airdrops an expensive, inefficient “distraction” that would “not reverse the deepening starvation”.</p>\n<p>Lazzarini called for Israel to “lift the siege, open the gates [and] guarantee safe movements [and] dignified access to people in need”.</p>\n<p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud raised questions over the newly announced Israeli steps.</p>\n<p>He said the airdrops’ effect is “equivalent to none”.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about only seven pallets of aid filled with flour and other basic necessities. That’s almost the load of one truck, or half of a truck, coming from the crossings into the Gaza Strip,” Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>He cited witnesses who said the airdrops took place near a restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/7/20/israel-issues-forced-displacement-order-in-central-gaza-in-new-campaign\">military area</a> in northern Gaza, making retrieving them in the dark especially difficult.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Equally, Israel’s plan to allow for so-called “humanitarian pauses” in Gaza starting on Sunday will have no major effect on the starvation crisis, Mahmoud said.</p>\n<p>“Again, this is not a solution when we talk about passing the tipping point of this enforced starvation, and according to medical sources we spoke to earlier today, they confirmed that at this point we’re going to see mass scale starvation mortality,” he said.</p>\n<p>As starvation spreads, Israel has pressed on with its daily bombardment of Gaza.</p>\n<p>At least six people were killed in an Israeli drone attack on a tent camp in al-Mawasi near Khan Younis on Saturday. The area designated as a safe zone by Israel has come under constant deadly attack by its forces.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Civil Defence agency in Gaza says none of its vehicles will be able to offer lifesaving services soon due to disrepair and lack of fuel, calling on the international community to act.</p>\n<p>“We stress the need for an urgent intervention to pressure the Israeli occupation authorities to allow fuel and repair parts for vehicles to enter,” the Civil Defence said in a statement.</p>\n<p>While some Western countries have made strongly-worded statements against Israel’s policies in Gaza, advocates have been calling for <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/uk-threatens-further-action-against-israel-if-gaza-ceasefire-proposal-fails\">real consequences</a> to ensure accountability and deter further Israeli abuses. Punitive sanctions against Israel have been raised as possibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"handala-ship-intercepted\">Handala ship intercepted</h2>\n<p>Shortly after making its airdrops announcement, the Israeli military raided a ship of international activists carrying baby formula, food and medical supplies to Gaza.</p>\n<p>A livestream showed Israeli soldiers boarding and intercepting the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/18/who-is-handala-the-inspiration-behind-latest-gaza-flotilla-ship\">Handala vessel </a>with 19 activists onboard. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the aid ship, said the vessel was violently seized in international waters.</p>\n<p>“The unarmed boat was carrying life-saving supplies when it was boarded by Israeli forces, its passengers abducted, and its cargo seized,” the coalition said in a statement. “The interception occurred in international waters outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international maritime law.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>It is not clear what will happen to the advocates. Last month, Israel intercepted the Madleen aid ship and towed it to an Israeli boat before detaining the activists, and then interrogating and deporting them.</p>\n<p>Ann Wright, a member of the Freedom Flotilla Steering Committee, called for the protection of the international activists by their home countries.</p>\n<p>“Protect innocent international people who are merely accompanying a small amount of aid – medical and food – as a symbol of the international outrage at what Israel is doing,” Wright told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>The Gaza Government Media Office called the interception of Handala a <a href=\"/features/2025/6/9/what-happens-next-to-the-gaza-flotillas-madleen-and-its-crew\">crime of piracy</a>.</p>\n<p>“This blatant aggression represents a major violation of international law and the rules of maritime navigation, and it shows once more that the [Israeli] occupation acts like a bully outside the authority of the law,” the office said in a statement.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives.</p>\n<p>The case generated headlines around the world and deeply struck the Chicago area’s large and established Palestinian community amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the US. <a href=\"/news/2023/10/16/funeral-held-in-us-for-six-year-old-boy-killed-in-suspected-hate-crime\">Wadee’s funeral</a> drew large crowds, and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honour.</p>\n<p>Other similarly-motivated incidents in the US include the attempted drowning of a three-year-old Palestinian-American girl in Texas, the stabbing of a Palestinian-American man in Texas, the beating of a Muslim man in New York, a violent mob attack on pro-Palestinian protesters in California and a Florida shooting of two Israeli visitors whom the suspect mistook for Palestinians.</p>\n<p>Three young Palestinian men were also shot near a <a href=\"/news/2023/11/27/three-palestinian-students-aged-20-shot-injured-in-vermont-what-to-know\">university campus in Vermont</a> just weeks after Alfayoumi was stabbed to death.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

His physicality, intelligence and work ethic make him a perfect fit for our vision,” said Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta.</p>\n<p>The 27-year-old striker joins Arsenal after establishing himself after two outstanding seasons in Portugal, in which he fired Lisbon to back-to-back league titles with 97 goals, including 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions in the 2024-25 season, outscoring the likes of superstars Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah.</p>\n\n<p>A top-class striker has long been considered the missing element for Arsenal, which came runner-up in each of the last three Premier League seasons. The failure to bring one in during the January transfer window badly undermined its attempts to challenge Liverpool for the title last term.</p>\n<p>“The consistency he has shown in his performances and availability have been outstanding, and his goal contributions speak for themselves,” said manager Mikel Arteta. “He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.”</p>\n<p>Gyokeres returns to England after joining Brighton as a youth player and later emerging at second-tier Coventry, where his 22 goals helped the team reach the playoff final in 2023.</p>\n<p>His record of 40 goals in 97 games for Coventry caught the attention of Lisbon and led to a 20.5 million pounds ($25m) move to the Portuguese club.</p>\n<p>His explosive form over the past two seasons has seen frequent speculation about a move to one of European football’s giants, including Manchester United. But Arsenal has won the race for his signature, and the transfer represents a remarkable rise for a player who was first developed at Brommapojkarna, a Swedish club with a reputation for guiding the careers of some of the country’s best emerging talents.</p>\n<p>“He was a late developer because he was not the best striker or the best player in Brommapojkarna at age 16, 17, 18, 19,” Dalibor Savic, his former youth coach at the Swedish club, told The Associated Press in November. “If he aims at something, he will achieve it.”</p>\n<p>Gyokeres will have to prove he can make the step up to the Premier League after failing to break through at Brighton, a club known for unearthing players like Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister in recent years. He only made eight appearances for the club and was loaned to St Pauli in Germany and Swansea before his permanent move to Coventry.</p>\n<p>His performances for Sweden and in the Champions League suggest he will be able to continue that form at Arsenal.</p>\n<p>He was the leading scorer in the Nations League, with nine goals, outscoring Cristiano Ronaldo and Haaland, and hit six in eight appearances in the Champions League for Lisbon last season.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3858692\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3858692\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3858692\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2197645616-1753563080.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Viktor Gyokeres in action.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3858692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting runs with the ball during the Liga Portugal Betclic match between FC Porto and Sporting Clube de Portugal at Estadio do Dragao on February 7, 2025, in Porto, Portugal [Pedro Loureiro/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n</div></div></body></html>"

That hasn’t changed,” Bell said in a social media post.</p>\n<p>“But supporting this government’s actions – allowing children to starve and firing on civilians seeking food – is something I can’t stand by. This isn’t self-defense. It must stop.”</p>\n<p>Congresswoman Summer Lee also said on Friday that Israel is blocking humanitarian assistance to Gaza while shooting at aid seekers looking to receive food <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/7/23/live-israel-pounds-gaza-as-deaths-from-starvation-mount\">from GHF sites</a>.</p>\n<p>“People are collapsing in the streets from extreme starvation. Horrors upon horrors,” Lee said in a social media post. “The US must stop funding Israel’s manufactured famine and genocide.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"vague-statements\">Vague statements</h2>\n<p>Not all US lawmakers who spoke on the issue were as forceful as Lee when addressing the crisis.</p>\n<p>Many failed to point the finger at Israel, while others prefaced their mild criticism of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/family-of-american-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settlers-demands-us-probe\">the US ally</a> with customary condemnation of Hamas.</p>\n<p>Several congressmembers reiterated the Israeli lie that Hamas steals UN humanitarian aid – a claim that has been denied by UN agencies and aid groups on the ground, and for which the Israeli military officials <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/world/middleeast/hamas-un-aid-theft.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledge</a> they have no evidence.</p>\n<p>Congresswoman Grace Meng said in a statement that “as a mother”, her heart breaks to see children in Gaza starve, but she proceeded to repeat pro-Israel talking points about the humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>“It is important to recognize that Israel has facilitated the entry of over 1.8 million tons and over 96,000 trucks into Gaza, while Hamas continues to hold hostages, extort the aid system, and refuse ceasefire deals to stay in power and prolong the war,” Meng said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Throughout more than 22 months of war, Israel has allowed a trickle of aid to enter Gaza – but far below the needs of the population. And since March, Israel has tightened its blockade on the territory, making the deadly GHF sites nearly the only source of food for Palestinians.</p>\n<p>Hamas also denies rejecting ceasefire deals. Instead, the group says it is seeking a permanent end to the war, while several Israeli officials <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-netanyahu-meet-for-a-second-time-to-discuss-a-gaza-ceasefire\">have said</a> that Israel will proceed with its military campaign in Gaza even if a short-term truce is reached.</p>\n<p>Congressman Adam Smith called on Israel to take the “steps necessary to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza, but he focused his criticism on Hamas, echoing unfounded Israeli arguments about the group <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/hamas-says-israel-rejected-ceasefire-deal-releasing-all-captives-in-gaza\">blocking ceasefire</a> deals and stealing the aid.</p>\n<p>“I believe we can both continue to support Israel in their effort to defend themselves against Hamas, Iran and others in the region who continue in their efforts to attack and destroy Israel, and work immediately to relieve the suffering of the people in Gaza,” Smith said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Senator Cory Booker released a 172-word statement on the starvation crisis in Gaza that mentioned the word “Israel” only once – in calling for a strategy to “strengthen Israel’s security.”</p>\n<p>“It is our collective moral duty to ensure that humanitarian relief reaches those who need it most urgently,” Booker said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"criticising-trump\">Criticising Trump</h2>\n<p>At the same time, some Democrats invoked the crisis to rebuke Trump – their political rival – without denouncing Israel.</p>\n<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries set the tone for that approach with a statement late on Friday that focused on Trump but failed to explicitly criticise Israel.</p>\n<p>“The starvation and death of Palestinian children and civilians in an ongoing war zone is unacceptable,” Jeffries said. “The <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/bomb-first-trumps-approach-to-us-war-making-in-his-second-term\">Trump administration</a> has the ability to bring an end to this humanitarian crisis. They must act now.”</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>For his part, Congressman Tim Kennedy underscored that Trump has failed to deliver his promise of ending the war on Gaza.</p>\n<p>“His strategic and moral failure has led to deteriorating conditions, with new reports and images of mass starvation of Palestinians,” Kennedy said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump’s Republican Party has been largely silent about the worsening hunger in Gaza.</p>\n<p>But Congressman Randy Fine – <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/trump-backs-staunchly-anti-muslim-florida-lawmaker-to-run-for-us-congress\">a close ally</a> of the US president – appeared to at once endorse Israel’s starvation campaign in Gaza while dismissing it as “Muslim terror propaganda”.</p>\n<p>“Release the hostages,” he wrote in a social media post earlier this week. “Until then, starve away.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

the Israeli military and private contractors, understood to be American, have killed more than 1,000 people trying to access food at GHF distribution points.</p>\n<p>There are still some limited UN aid distribution operations, but they are so severely restricted that their effect cannot be felt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"does-israel-accept-that-there-s-starvation-in-gaza\">Does Israel accept that there’s starvation in Gaza?</h2>\n<p>It does not.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which is responsible for coordinating aid into Gaza, contradicted the claims of numerous aid agencies, asserting that “there is no famine in the Gaza Strip”.</p>\n<p>However, it said, there were “pockets” across Gaza where people had “issues of access to

Wednesday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said half of the 16 food distribution requests submitted to the Israeli military had been refused.</p>\n<p>“Bureaucratic … and other operational obstacles

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In Gaza, we see death in every aspect of life. Death has become an inseparable companion, lingering in the streets, the skies, and even in our homes. It is no longer a shock – it is a grim daily reality which we have been forced to adapt to.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to die in Gaza, although one does not have the luxury to choose.</p>\n<p>You may be killed in a bombing, or be struck by a sniper’s bullet as you try to collect food to stave off hunger, or starvation itself may claim your life. The Health Ministry says 116 people have died because of malnutrition, many of them babies and children.</p>\n<p>In Gaza, the simplest, most basic necessity can also be lethal. Water is one of them. Every aspect of it can be dangerous: providing it, seeking it, drinking it, swimming in it.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has relentlessly targeted Gaza’s water infrastructure. More than 85 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation structures are inoperable – including pipelines, wells, and treatment facilities.</p>\n<p>Israel has <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/gazas-water-infrastructure-desperately-needs-be-rebuilt\">blocked</a> the entry of water-related materials to the Strip, making repairs difficult. It has also targeted the warehouse of the water utility authority, destroying equipment and spare parts.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, workers trying to make repairs or operate water infrastructure have been directly targeted and killed. Working in the water sector has now become a deadly job.</p>\n<p>Most recently, on July 21, the Israeli occupation forces <a href=\"https://aje.io/zs9y5d?update=3848795\">attacked</a> a desalination plant in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City, killing five people at the site. This was one of the few functioning water stations in the city.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the water infrastructure in Gaza has forced us to go out in search of water on a daily basis. There are some war entrepreneurs who charge exorbitant amounts of money for delivering water to homes; the vast majority of people cannot afford such services.</p>\n<p>So Palestinians are forced to walk long distances and wait in long queues, plastic jugs in hand, to fetch a daily ration of water.</p>\n<p>The wait under the scorching sun is not just exhausting, but it can also turn deadly.</p>\n<p>On July 13, 11 Palestinians – seven of them children – were killed and dozens more injured when an Israeli missile struck civilians as they queued to get water from water trucks in Nuseirat refugee camp, not far from my own home.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, water trucks are not available, so people are forced to drink water that is unfit for human consumption from local wells. It is contaminated with bacteria, chemicals and other contaminants and can trigger outbreaks of waterborne diseases.</p>\n<p>I myself felt victim to one. Months ago, after drinking from a local well, I contracted hepatitis A. My skin and the whites of my eyes turned a haunting shade of yellow. Waves of nausea left me unable to eat, and a persistent fever made every breath feel difficult. But the worst was the searing pain in my abdomen – a constant, twisting ache as if my insides were being wrung out by invisible hands. For weeks, I was bedridden, my body weak, my mind consumed with fear.</p>\n<p>A visit to a clinic brought me no relief – just a prescription for a painkiller and a “salamtek” (get well). I had to fight the infection on my own.</p>\n<p>I survived, but others are not so lucky. Hepatitis, like other infectious waterborne diseases running amok in Gaza, kills.</p>\n<p>Amid the unbearable summer heat, one would think that at least the water of the sea could bring Palestinians some relief, but that too is deadly.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, the Israeli military has declared Gaza’s entire coastline a prohibited zone, effectively banning Palestinians from swimming, fishing, or even approaching the water. Anyone who gets near the sea is shot at.</p>\n<p>Even before the ban, the Israeli army was attacking Palestinians who would try to get into the sea to fish and alleviate their families’ hunger. As of December 2024, some <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/building-to-starvation-systematic-attacks-on-fishing-in-gaza-and-implications-for-livelihoods-and-protection-may-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">200 fishermen</a> had been killed, according to the UN; many more have died since then.</p>\n<p>While we are banned from the only place that used to bring us relief from the heat, just a few kilometres north, Israelis freely enjoy the same Mediterranean waves, sunbathing and swimming in peace. They also enjoy long showers and the privilege of running water. They use the luxurious 247 litres (65 gallons) per day per person.</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, a person <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza\">needs</a> 100 litres (26 gallons) of water per day to cover their basic needs. People in Gaza now get between two and nine litres (0.5 – 2.3 gallons) per day.</p>\n<p>The struggle for water is just one of the many battles Palestinians in Gaza fight daily. There is no food to feed one’s starving family, no electricity to power fans, and no medicine to treat the diseases that plague us. Every aspect of life here is a test of endurance. There is, quite literally, nothing to ease the weight of these brutal circumstances – no relief, no respite, not even the smallest comfort.</p>\n<p>I still can’t comprehend how, in the 21st century, a world of more than 7 billion people, where global leaders talk about prosperity, dignity and rule of law, we are still deprived of the most basic human necessities.</p>\n<p>In December 2024, Human Rights Watch openly declared that Palestinians in Gaza are being subjected to a “genocide,” and it based this conclusion on establishing Israel’s “water deprivation as a deliberate act”. It pointed out that “thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have died as a result of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease as of August 2024”.</p>\n<p>It has been a year since then. Countless people have died because of Israel’s weaponisation of water – numbers that are not included in the official death toll because the health authorities simply lack the capacity to track them.</p>\n<p>The truth is out in the open. It is broadcast on international media. It is visible on social media. And yet, the world remains idle, refusing to take action and stop Israel.</p>\n<p>To this world, I want to say: Your silence echoes louder than the bombs that fall on us every day. You must act now, or go down in history with your complicity in the slaughter and starvation of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It felt, to put it bluntly, like a waste of time,” Torrejon said. “The level of practice and the level of physical training both plummeted compared to what we had [at Barcelona]. It was like taking a step back.</p>\n<p>“I am told that isn’t the case now, and I am very glad to hear that.”</p>\n<p>Torrejon said she saw steps in the right direction under former Spain coach Jorge Vilda, who replaced Quereda, but felt there was still more untapped potential in the team when she retired.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3486539\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3486539\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3486539\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1622660427-1738579828.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Luis Rubiales kisses Jenni Hermoso.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3486539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Luis Rubiales, right, kisses Jennifer Hermoso of Spain, left, during the medal ceremony of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 final against England [Noemi Llamas/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-was-the-rubiales-controversy-for-spain\">What was the Rubiales controversy for Spain?</h2>\n<p>After Torrejon quit the team, some players announced in 2022 that they would no longer play for Vilda unless he ran a more professional operation.

The result was an exquisite winner from a tight angle.</p>\n<p>Torrejon said that sort of tactical insight from the staff was unthinkable a decade ago.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3853581\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3853581\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3853581\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-23T214428Z_31920422_UP1EL7N1OE3ZR_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-EURO-GER-ESP-1753307473.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C449&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"UEFA Women's Euro 2025 - Semi Final - Germany v Spain - Stadion Letzigrund, Zurich, Switzerland - July 23, 2025 Spain's Irene Paredes, Spain's Jana Fernandez, Spain's Maria Mendez and Spain's Leila Ouahabi celebrate after the match\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3853581\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spain’s Irene Paredes, Spain’s Jana Fernandez, Spain’s Maria Mendez and Spain’s Leila Ouahabi celebrate after the match [Matthew Childs/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-barcelona-played-their-part-in-spain-s-rise\">How Barcelona played their part in Spain’s rise</h2>\n<p>Spain midfielder Patri Guijarro agrees with Torrejon that the sustained investment Barcelona has provided for the past decade in the women’s game has boosted the national team.</p>\n<p>“Each and every day, we work well in our clubs and I think that is reflected in the achievements of the clubs, but also in the national team,” Guijarro said at Spain’s camp in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday.</p>\n<p>Guijarro also credits the professionalisation of Spain’s women’s league in 2021, which allowed players “to dedicate ourselves fully to football”.</p>\n<p>Guijarro is one of 11 Barcelona players on Spain’s 23-member squad. The Barcelona contingent includes Bonmati and Putellas, who have split the last four Ballon d’Or awards between them.</p>\n<p>Former Barcelona official Xavier Vilajoana oversaw the women’s team and the club’s training academy from 2015-2020. During that time, the club dramatically increased its funding for women’s football and built a training programme for girls.</p>\n<p>Vilajoana said one critical decision was having the same coaches train the boys’ and girls’ teams. That way, the Barcelona style was instilled in all the kids, and that ball-possession, short-passing and pressure became fundamentals of the women’s teams as well.</p>\n<p>“Let’s not fool ourselves, we spent many years in a very sexist society, and that was reflected in women’s football. So clearly the change in the mentality of society has helped,” Vilajoana said. “But I also believe that Barca’s style of play has helped us see women players in the same way [as men].”</p>\n<p>In the background, Spain’s strong feminist movement helped get the public behind the players as they made strides for equality and success.</p>\n<p>“There were many of us players who gave it our all for the national team but weren’t able to get this far,” Torrejon said. “The one thing we knew is that we had talent. We just needed more support.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"england-team-news\">England team news</h2>\n<p>Lauren James faces a race to be fit after picking up a knock in the semifinal against Italy.</p>\n<p>Beth Mead could take the attacker’s place on the wing should James fail to recover.</p>\n<p>Esme Morgan was given her first start in tournament football alongside captain Leah Williamson in defence and is set to retain her place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spain-team-news\">Spain team news</h2>\n<p>Laia Aleixandri returns from a one-match ban for yellow card accumulation in the tournament.
