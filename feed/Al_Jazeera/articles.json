Their display was part of Pakistan’s latest offer to the Trump administration: The country was willing to open up its minerals to US investment.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Less than five months later, a cloud has moved over that promise. Most of Pakistan’s richest mineral deposits are in the province of Balochistan. The province – the country’s largest by area and its most impoverished – has long witnessed a separatist movement driven by anger over perceptions that the interests of the local population have been ignored by the federal government. On Saturday, coordinated attacks across Balochistan in which fighters killed 31 civilians and 17 security personnel while the military gunned down 145 fighters served up an urgent reminder of the challenges that Pakistan – and potential investors – face in the province.</p><p>Balochistan is also at the heart of China’s investments in Pakistan, making Saturday’s attacks particularly sensitive for Islamabad.</p><p>Within hours of the attacks across at least 12 locations, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi blamed neighbouring India. “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists,” Naqvi said without offering any evidence to back up his claims.</p><p>The attackers belonged to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">a separatist group</a> that has long sought independence for Balochistan and has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Pakistani state alongside several other armed groups.</p><p>In a video posted on social media, BLA leader Bashir Zeb said the attacks were part of the group’s “Herof 2.0” operation, a follow-up to a similar coordinated assault launched in <a href=\"/news/2024/8/26/whats-behind-pakistans-deadly-balochistan-attacks-which-left-43-dead\">August 2024.</a></p><p>India on Sunday rejected Pakistan’s allegations, calling them an attempt to divert attention from what it described as Pakistan’s “internal failings”.</p><p>“Instead of parroting frivolous claims each time there is a violent incident, it would do better to focus on addressing long-standing demands of its people in the region,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement.</p><p></p><p>Amid this blame game, analysts said the roots of Pakistan’s crisis in Balochistan run deeper than any one incident – and ignoring them won’t help Islamabad as it tries to woo both the US and China to invest in the province.</p><h2 id=\"roots-of-the-unrest\">Roots of the unrest</h2><p>Balochistan is home to about 15 million of Pakistan’s 240 million people, according to the 2023 census. It is the country’s poorest province despite its vast natural resources wealth.</p><p>It holds significant reserves of oil, coal, gold, copper and gas, resources that generate substantial revenue for the federal government.</p><p>With Pakistan having promised parts of this resource wealth to China, its closest ally, and to the US under a landmark agreement signed last year, concerns persist that escalating violence could not only jeopardise projects worth billions of dollars but also threaten the country’s fragile economic recovery.</p><p id=\"annexed-by-pakistan-in-1948-soon-after-partition-from-india-it-has-been-the-site-of-a-separatist-movement-almost-since-the-country-s-founding\">Annexed by Pakistan in 1948 soon after partition from India, Balochistan has been the site of a separatist movement almost since the country’s founding.</p><p>The province has witnessed at least five major rebellions since then. The latest phase began in the early 2000s when demands for greater control over local resources gradually escalated into calls for full independence.</p><p>The government’s response has been marked by heavy-handed security operations. Human rights groups accuse authorities of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of ethnic Balochs suspected of being involved in or having sympathy for separatist groups.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/deadly-pakistan-train-hijack-what-happened-and-whats-next\">March</a>, BLA fighters carried out one of their most audacious attacks, attempting to hijack a passenger train, the Jaffer Express, travelling from Quetta to the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. More than 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which at least 33 fighters were killed.</p><p>The incident was part of a broader uptick in violence across Balochistan along with the rest of the country. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025, a 26 percent increase from the previous year, resulting in more than 400 deaths.</p><p>The latest wave of violence came just days after Pakistan hosted a minerals summit aimed at attracting Chinese companies.</p><p>China has already invested heavily in the province, including in the development of Gwadar, Pakistan’s only deep-sea port. The port is a key node in the <a href=\"/news/2024/6/3/sharifs-beijing-trip-can-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-be-revived\">$60bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC), which aims to connect southwestern China to the Arabian Sea.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">September</a>, USSM, a US-based mining firm, also signed a $500m memorandum of understanding to invest in mineral excavation in Pakistan.</p><p>Saher Baloch, a Berlin-based researcher focusing on Balochistan, said there was a “core contradiction” in Pakistan’s efforts to court international partners by emphasising the province’s resources without addressing its political grievances.</p><p>“Balochistan’s instability isn’t episodic. It is structural and rooted in longstanding grievances over ownership, political exclusion and militarisation,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As long as violence persists, she said, large-scale extraction projects will remain high-risk and heavily securitised, making them viable primarily for “state-backed actors like China, not market-driven Western investors”.</p><p>And “even Chinese projects under CPEC have faced repeated attacks, forcing Pakistan to deploy thousands of troops just to secure limited infrastructure,” she added.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, offered a different perspective, arguing that the province’s main investors, China and potentially the US, are already fully aware of the risks.</p><p>“China has CPEC investments in the country, and the US signed a minerals deal in September last year, a whole year after Herof 1.0, so they both know the risk profiles and what they are getting into,” Basit told Al Jazeera, referring to another coordinated BLA attack across multiple locations in August 2024.</p><p>“Obviously, such attacks do shake investor confidence, but these are government-to-government deals. These are part of strategic investment calculus, and neither the US nor China will pull out their investment,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283684\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283684\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2025-01-1770042211.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"economic-stakes-rise\">Economic stakes rise</h2><p>Pakistan’s economy, which has long struggled, has faced sustained pressure in recent years. The country only narrowly avoided default in the summer of 2023, securing a last-minute bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Since then, Pakistan has regained some stability under its latest IMF programme, the 25th time it has turned to the lender, securing $7bn in funding.</p><p>Despite official efforts to market Pakistan as an attractive investment destination, foreign direct investment (FDI) has remained weak.</p><p>Central bank figures released last month showed a sharp decline from July to December. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, the country received just $808m in FDI during the first half of the fiscal year 2026, down from $1.425bn in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies, said the surge in violence in Balochistan and elsewhere was deterring investors.</p><p>“No sane national or international investor will risk their money in an extremely volatile situation,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the crisis was “rooted in problems centred in the province itself and linked to Islamabad’s approach”.</p><p>Balochistan also shares a long and porous border with Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. That adds to the region’s perception as a “high-risk zone” for investors.</p><p>“Persistent attacks suggest that even heavily guarded projects are vulnerable,” she said. “Absence of local consent increases the likelihood of a backlash.”</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"external-vs-internal-issue\">External vs internal issue</h2><p>The Jaffer Express train attack in March was followed a month later by an assault in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir, which killed at least 26 people.</p><p>Those incidents escalated into a four-day military confrontation between India and Pakistan in May, marked by missile strikes, drone attacks and cross-border shelling.</p><p>Pakistan has <a href=\"/news/2025/3/14/pakistan-links-train-hijacking-to-afghan-handlers-and-indian-mastermind\">repeatedly accused India</a> of training and facilitating Baloch rebels and, after the Jaffer Express attack, formally designated Baloch separatist groups as “Fitna al-Hindustan”, a term implying Indian involvement.</p><p>But Basit said such claims must be backed by credible evidence.</p><p>“This attack was carried out in broad daylight and done by locals. This is a straight-up failure of intelligence and local security apparatus. While the response time was quick and they were able to restore control, the question is why such an attack, in main cities, was able to take place at all,” he said.</p><p>Saher Baloch described Islamabad’s focus on India as a familiar tactic that may provide short-term diplomatic cover but does little to address deeper issues.</p><p>“Pakistan seeks to reframe Balochistan from a political conflict to a security problem in order to attract diplomatic sympathy and deflect scrutiny internally,” she said, adding that the approach has limits.</p><p>“There is a lot more awareness now that Balochistan’s unrest is driven primarily by domestic factors, such as enforced disappearances, lack of political autonomy and economic marginalisation,” she said.</p><p>Gul said that while local grievances are central, prolonged instability could still serve the interests of external actors.</p><p>India, he argued, could benefit by limiting China’s footprint in the region. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are external motives and that is why money is poured into violence and militancy to keep Balochistan on tenterhooks,” he said.</p><p>Basit said the involvement of both China and the US already gives the conflict an international dimension but stressed that the roots of the violence remain local.</p><p>“External elements are always secondary as internal fault lines are the primary reasons of why there is conflict and violence in the province. The government must bridge the gap to ensure that those external elements do not exploit those internal issues,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Last week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-t-do-anything-without-the-internet\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">‘Can’t do anything without the internet’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Pezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/protests-grow-as-irans-government-makes-meager-offer-amid-tanking-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic reforms and cash subsidies</a>.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Simin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Saeed Mirzaei, who works at an immigration agency in the capital, said 46 employees at his company had to go on mandatory leave for weeks amid the shutdown.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He told Al Jazeera that they suddenly lost all contact with foreign counterparts, were unable to get updated information from embassies, and missed deadlines to apply for universities on behalf of their customers wishing to leave a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heavily sanctioned Iran</a> for better opportunities.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“We can’t do anything without the internet because our work deals directly with it,” Mirzaei said.</p><h2 id=\"national-internet-a-bitter-joke\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">National internet a ‘bitter joke’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">During the blackout, Iran’s theocratic establishment even struggled to sustain basic services using the so-called National Information Network, a limited nationalised intranet.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The connection to the intranet was slow and patchy, many companies remained disconnected from it, and those that were allowed to connect retained only a fraction of their customer base amid <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/why-is-irans-economy-failing-prompting-deadly-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general economic stagnation</a> across the country.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Hashemi, the communications minister, said a demand by hardliners within the establishment to <a href=\"/news/2024/2/24/iran-unveils-plan-for-tighter-internet-rules-to-promote-local-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">move away from using the international web</a> in favour of a domestic connection was a “bitter joke” that is not feasible to enforce.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He said his ministry estimates that the country’s online businesses could survive under a blackout for roughly 20 days, signalling that the state had no choice this week but to gradually restore internet bandwidth.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Figures for economic damages incurred by the blackout published by officials reflect only the visible costs and do not account for hidden losses, according to Abazar Barari, a member of Iran’s Chamber of Commerce.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“In the import and export sector, processes are heavily dependent on the internet from the very initial stages – such as price negotiations, issuance of pro forma and other invoices – to coordination with transportation companies and the verification of documents. As a result, the internet shutdown effectively disrupted foreign trade,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“During this period, customer attrition also occurred, with the damage being particularly severe in certain food commodities, as many countries are unwilling to tie their food security to unstable supply conditions.”</p><h2 id=\"they-have-no-right-to-do-this\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">‘They have no right to do this’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">In a tumultuous country with one of the highest inflation rates in the world, numerous Iranians who tried to make money online to stay afloat are now deeply anxious as well.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">From owners of small online businesses to teachers, chefs, crypto traders, gamers and streamers, people are taking to social media to ask others for extra support after the gradual reconnect this week.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Mehrnaz, a young video editor in Tehran, said she only went back to work this week after her company put her on forced leave without pay from the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start of the protests in the city’s business district</a> in late December.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“I was on the verge of having to move back to my parents’ house in another city. I’m only 25, and I hit near-zero for the second time this year. There might not be another time,” she said, pointing out that the first time was during the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> with Israel and the United States in June.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran’s National Post Company announced on Sunday that postal deliveries experienced a 60-percent fall at the height of the blackout, mainly damaging small and home-based businesses that depended on mailing their products.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But beyond livelihoods, many in Iran are also angered by the fact that the state can cut off communications on command, violating the people’s right to benefit from the internet.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“They had the nerve to create a tiered internet and decide which type of use is ‘essential’,” said a woman who asked not to be identified for safety reasons.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“My child wants to search about his favourite animation movies, my mom wants to read news on Telegram, and my dad wants to download books. I want to go online and write that they have no right to do this.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Pakistan has spent decades battling a separatist movement in Balochistan, where fighters have been targeting state forces, foreign nationals and people from other parts of Pakistan in the mineral-rich province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.</p><p>The outlawed <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">Balochistan Liberation Army</a> (BLA) claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, according to the AFP news agency.</p><p>The group said it targeted military installations and police and civil administration officials in gun attacks and suicide bombings in nine districts of Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest but least populated and most impoverished province</p><p>On the same day as the attack, Naqvi accused India of being behind the attacks in Balochistan as he spoke to local media with the province’s chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti.</p><p>“These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists,” Naqvi said without presenting any evidence.</p><h2 id=\"but-weren-t-tensions-already-building-up-over-the-world-cup\">But weren’t tensions already building up over the World Cup?</h2><p>Yes. On January 24, the International Cricket Council (ICC) kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament, replacing it with Scotland, after Dhaka refused to play its matches in India, which is cohosting the World Cup with Sri Lanka.</p><p>Amid rising tensions between India and Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Cricket Board asked that its games be shifted from India to Sri Lanka, but its request was rejected by the ICC.</p><p>Bangladesh cited security concerns, but the ICC said there was no “credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team in India”.</p><p>The monthlong tournament, which begins on Saturday, will be the first time Bangladesh will miss a men’s T20 World Cup.</p><p>When Bangladesh was not allowed to play in Sri Lanka, Naqvi criticised the ICC for “double standards”. The ICC in the past has allowed India to avoid playing in Pakistan when Pakistan has hosted tournaments and instead hold those games in third nations. And under a deal involving India and Pakistan, the ICC has now allowed Pakistan to do the same. When India hosts a series like the World Cup, Pakistan is allowed to play in third countries, like Sri Lanka in this case.</p><p>“You can’t have double standards. You can’t say for one country [India] they can do whatever they want and for the others to have to do the complete opposite,” Naqvi said. “That’s why we’ve taken this stand and made clear Bangladesh have had an injustice done to them. They should play in the World Cup. They are a major stakeholder in cricket.”</p><p>Pakistan will play all of its matches in Sri Lanka instead of India amid a flare-up in tensions between the South Asian neighbours.</p><p>After an attack on tourists in April in India-administered Kashmir that India blamed on Pakistan, India and Pakistan engaged in May in a heated aerial war. They used drones and missiles to target each other’s military bases. A ceasefire was eventually brokered on May 10.</p><p>Scepticism towards India has been on the rise in Bangladesh since the summer of 2024 when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in mass antigovernment protests and fled to India.</p><p>On January 3, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) removed fast bowler <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/india-bangladesh-tensions-rock-cricket-as-sport-turns-diplomatic-weapon\">Mustafizur Rahman</a> from the Indian Premier League, Bangladesh’s only cricketer in the tournament.</p><p>The BCCI did not state the reason behind this decision, citing only “developments all around”.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-impact-the-world-cup\">How will this impact the World Cup?</h2><p>The match between India and Pakistan was expected to have been the most watched match of the entire tournament. Losing it will likely slash viewership for that slot by tens of millions of people.</p><p>In 2021, the India-Pakistan match at the T20 World Cup registered a record 167 million viewers, making it the most watched T20 international in history, according to Star India, the tournament’s official broadcaster.</p><p>Due to its high viewership, the India-Pakistan match is the most valuable advertising window of the World Cup. If the match is cancelled, broadcasters lose out on revenue.</p><p>Similarly, Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium, which was due to host the game, loses a major match day revenue opportunity from ticket sales.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-pakistan-s-chances-at-the-world-cup\">What does it mean for Pakistan’s chances at the World Cup?</h2><p>The Pakistani team will forfeit two points in the group stage because of the boycott, which India will gain without playing the game.</p><p>With two points awarded for every win at this World Cup, Pakistan now have less room for error and must win more of their remaining games to ensure their chances of advancing.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Pakistan and India have not played any bilateral cricket since 2012 and face each other only in multination events.</p><p>Under a deal signed last year, India and Pakistan agreed not to travel to each other’s countries in cases in which either hosts an ICC event, instead playing at neutral venues.</p><p>Pakistan boycotting the match against India in the neutral venue possibly sets a new precedent for India to take similar action in future tournaments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was most unfortunate. [An] intrusion of politics. I think the Bangladeshi reaction was an overreaction, but it is also a reflection of the same, and Pakistan is trying to show its solidarity with Bangladesh. ”</p><p>Tharoor, who is a member of India’s main opposition party, said the situation was “spiralling out of control”.</p><p>“Sports, especially a sport like cricket which means so much to all the people, should be a means of bringing us together at least on the playing field, rather than allowing this to go on like this,” he said.</p><p>The 69-year-old, who is also an author of several books on history and politics, called on the ICC to help mend the ties.</p><p>“This is now a wake-up call for all concerned to contact each other on an emergency basis. The ICC could be the platform for it. Just say, ‘Let’s call off this nonsense’. You can’t go on like this forever.”</p><p>Pakistan’s decision, which came six days before the start of the World Cup, has cast a shadow on the marquee fixture of the group stage.</p><p>India and Pakistan were scheduled to play in Colombo on February 15 in a game that attracts millions of viewers from across the world and is seen as a major revenue-generating fixture for the tournament’s organisers and sponsors.</p><p>Outspoken former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said Pakistan could face sanctions from the ICC, but such a move would be hypocritical as teams have boycotted games at previous World Cups.</p><p>“Where was ICC when Australia and West Indies forfeited their matches in 1996; England refusing to travel to Harare and New Zealand to Nairobi in 2003,” he said on X.</p><p>Latif, who played 37 Tests and 166 one-day internationals (ODIs), feared that Pakistan may be sanctioned by the ICC.</p><p>“They [Pakistan] don’t seem to care about it,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"would-pakistan-refuse-to-play-the-final\">‘Would Pakistan refuse to play the final?’</h2><p>Should Pakistan keep their word and boycott the group game, they will forfeit two points, which could have an impact on their standings in Group A.</p><p>Pakistan and India could meet again in the tournament, in the final on March 8, but with the multiple stages of progress between the group game and the final, it is unclear how that match would pan out.</p><p>Former England captain Kevin Pietersen questioned whether Pakistan would boycott the tournament decider as well.</p><p>“Would Pakistan refuse to play the World Cup final?” he asked.</p><p></p><p>Cricketers from across the border condemned Pakistan’s boycott of the game.</p><p>“This isn’t about guts at all, this is about foolishness,” Madan Lal, a former Test cricketer and coach, told Indian media.</p><p>“Because Pakistan wants to show India down, that’s why they’re taking all these decisions. That’s the reason their growth isn’t happening, either.

The demonstrations, which were triggered by economic distress and the collapse of the country’s currency, morphed into a direct challenge to the government.</p><p>However, Trump’s approach has since transformed into a demand for a nuclear deal as the US and European Union are concerned that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Tehran insists its programme is strictly civilian.</p><p>While Iran suggested on Monday that it is moving closer to agreeing to reopen talks, it is understood that the US has set some conditions.</p><p>Iranian sources told the Reuters news agency that for talks to resume, Trump has demanded that Iran agree to end enrichment of uranium, curtail its missile programme and halt support to its network of allied armed groups in the region.</p><p>In the past, Iran has shown flexibility in discussing the nuclear file, but missiles and regional allies have long been treated as nonnegotiable.</p><p>It is not clear whether Iran would change its position now that the country urgently needs sanctions relief to improve the economy and stave off future unrest.</p><p>In June, American and Iranian officials had kicked off negotiations in Oman, but the process stalled after Israel attacked Iran and then the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>On Sunday, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/1/trump-says-iran-and-us-are-talking-to-avert-military-escalation#flips-6388625704112:0\">Trump said</a> Iran was “seriously talking” with the US but insisted, “We have very big, powerful ships heading in that direction.”</p><p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has also maintained a defiant tone, warning on Sunday that any attack would result in a “regional war”.</p><p>As officials in the region geared up their diplomacy to avoid another confrontation, the EU last week designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”.</p><p>On Monday, Iran said it had summoned all EU envoys in recent days over the move, adding that it was considering “countermeasures”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Israeli army has set up a checkpoint called Regavim in an area under its control outside the crossing for those entering Gaza from Egypt.</p><p>As the first trickle of humanity passed through the gates on Monday, official Israeli military documents gave it a name that indicates the facility is no longer being treated as a border crossing but as an operation for population control.</p><p>In an official statement published on its website on Sunday, the Israeli army announced the completion of what it called the “Regavim Inspection Nekez”.</p><p>While the Israeli military frames this technical language as routine, analysts told Al Jazeera that the choice of the words “Regavim” and “Nekez” indicates Israel’s long-term intentions.</p><p>Al Jazeera spoke to Israeli affairs experts who argued that these terms reveal a dual strategy: invoking Zionist nostalgia to claim the land while using engineering terms to dehumanise the Palestinian people.</p><h2 id=\"historical-code-clod-after-clod\">Historical code: ‘Clod after clod’</h2><p>For analyst Mohannad Mustafa, the name Regavim is not random; it is a deliberate ideological trigger intended to resonate with the Israeli government’s far-right base.</p><p>“In Hebrew, Regavim means ‘clods of earth’ or patches of arable land,” Mustafa explained. “But it is not just a word. It is a trigger for the Zionist collective memory of land redemption.”</p><p>The term is inextricably linked to the <a href=\"https://www.zemereshet.co.il/m/song.asp?id=262\">Zionist children’s song</a> and poem Dunam Po Ve Dunam Sham (A Dunam Here, a Dunam There) by Joshua Friedman, which was an anthem for the early settlement movement. The lyrics celebrate the acquisition of land: “Dunam here and dunam there/Clod after clod (Regev ahar regev)/Thus we shall redeem the land of the people.”</p><p>“By officially naming the Rafah corridor Regavim, the army is sending a subliminal message,” Mustafa said. “They are framing their presence in Gaza not as a temporary security mission but as a form of ‘redeeming the land’ identical to the ideology of the early pioneers.”</p><h2 id=\"political-code-the-west-bank-model\">Political code: The ‘West Bank model’</h2><p>Beyond the historical nostalgia, the name has a direct line to the present-day architects of Israel’s annexation policies: the Regavim Movement.</p><p>This far-right NGO, cofounded in 2006 by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has been the primary force behind the expansion of Israeli control in the occupied West Bank. A 2023 investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz detailed how the organisation essentially became the “intelligence officer” for the state, using drones and field data to map and demolish Palestinian structures in Area C, the 61 percent of the occupied West Bank under full Israeli control.</p><p>Mustafa argued that applying this name to the Rafah crossing signals the transfer of the “civil administration” model from the West Bank to Gaza.</p><p>“It suggests that Gaza is no longer a separate entity but a territory to be managed with the same tools used to prevent Palestinian statehood in Judea and Samaria,” Mustafa said, using the Israeli terms for the West Bank.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"operational-code-a-political-brand-and-a-drain\">Operational code: A ‘political brand’ and a ‘drain’</h2><p>Analyst Ihab Jabareen takes the name Regavim a step further. He argued it has evolved beyond its linguistic meaning into a modern “political brand” for the settlement right and is being used to normalise a long-term Israeli presence.</p><p>However, Jabareen said the use of the term Nekez in the Israeli military statement portends even more danger.</p><p>“While Regavim operates as a political brand, Nekez reveals the cold, engineering mindset of the military,” Jabareen told Al Jazeera. “A Nekez is a drainage point. It is a hydraulic term used for managing sewage, floodwaters or irrigation – not for processing human beings.”</p><p>Jabareen argued that describing a human border crossing as a “drain” reflects three chilling assumptions now formalised in military doctrine:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Dehumanisation:</strong> “The Palestinian is no longer a citizen. They are a ‘fluid mass’ or a ‘flow’ that must be regulated to prevent overflow,” Jabareen said.</li>\n<li><strong>The end of negotiations:</strong> “You do not negotiate with a drain. Rafah is no longer a political border subject to sovereignty. It is an engineering problem to be managed.</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure, not a border:</strong> “Security is now being managed like a sewage system – purely technical, devoid of rights.”</li>\n</ol><p>“This is colder and more dangerous than standard settlement rhetoric,” Jabareen warned. “It converts the political issue of Gaza into a permanent technical function.”</p><h2 id=\"a-formula-for-quiet-control\">A formula for ‘quiet control’</h2><p>Both analysts agreed that the official adoption of these two terms points to a reality that is neither a full withdrawal nor declared annexation.</p><p>“It is a formula for ‘quiet control’,” Jabareen explained. “Israel doesn’t need to declare immediate settlement to control the territory. By treating the land as ‘Regavim’ (soil to be held) and the people as a ‘Nekez’ (a flow to be filtered), they are establishing a long-term reality where Gaza is an administered space, never an independent entity.”</p><p>Mustafa concurred: “The name ‘Regavim’ tells the settlers: ‘We have returned to the land.’ And the official designation ‘Nekez’ tells the security establishment: ‘We have the valve to turn the human flow on or off at will.'”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4279179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4279179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4279179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Rafah_February1_2026_INTERACTIVE-Proposed-Rafah-crossing-Gaza-plan-Israel-process-1769935391.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Proposed Rafah crossing Gaza plan February 1\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4279179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

The two main parties competing for power in this month’s polls are the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JIB), both of which began <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/campaigning-begins-in-bangladesh-for-first-election-after-hasinas-ouster\">campaigning</a> in late January.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Awami League, which has historically had close ties with India, has been barred from these elections because of its role in the brutal crackdown on student-led protests in 2024. Hasina, 78, currently in exile in India, was found guilty of allowing lethal force to be used against protesters, 1,400 of whom died during the unrest.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">She was tried in absentia by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh in November last year – and sentenced to death – but so far India has refused to extradite her.</p><p>Hasina has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/exiled-leader-hasina-denounces-upcoming-bangladesh-polls-after-party-ban\">denounced</a> the upcoming elections, telling The Associated Press news agency last month that “a government born of exclusion cannot unite a divided nation”.</p><p>Since her ousting, political analysts say, Bangladesh’s geopolitical positions have undergone a “paradigm shift”.</p><p>“Bilateral relations with India have witnessed a historic low in contrast to a warm rapprochement with Pakistan. Furthermore, strategic ties with China have deepened significantly,” Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, lecturer of global studies and governance at the Independent University, Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera</p><p>“[Hasina’s] 15-year tenure was marked by several key features that defined the foreign and security policy of Dhaka in terms of external engagement. Significant among these features were developing a close and holistic bilateral tie with India; strategic negligence and diplomatic isolation in terms of bilateral relations with Pakistan; and maintaining a strong but calculated defence, trade, and infrastructure development partnership with China,” he said.</p><p>“This predictive and patterned alignment of Dhaka has now been reversed with respect to India and Pakistan or revised with respect to China,” he said.</p><p>So, how do India, Pakistan and China see the upcoming elections? Does the election outcome matter to these three nations?</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"how-are-india-bangladesh-relations\">How are India-Bangladesh relations?</h2><p>Until the toppling of Hasina, India largely viewed Bangladesh as an important strategic partner and ally with respect to maintaining security in South Asia.</p><p>India is also Bangladesh’s largest trading partner in Asia. Between April 2023 and March 2024, before Hasina’s ousting, India sold goods, including textiles, tea, coffee, auto parts, electricity, agriculture, iron and steel and plastics, worth $11.1bn and imported readymade garments, leather and leather products, among other items, worth $1.8bn.</p><p>Since Hasina fled to India, both countries have imposed restrictions on each other’s exports, from land and sea, due to ongoing tensions.</p><p>Over the decades since Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, which India supported in 1971, their relationship has had ups and downs depending on which political party is in power in Dhaka.</p><p>Hasina, who served as prime minister from 1996 to 2001 and again from 2009 to 2024, maintained close ties with India.</p><p>“In the last five to six years, India and Bangladesh have scripted a golden chapter of bilateral ties and given a new dimension and direction to our partnership,” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated in March 2020.</p><p>But opposition parties in Bangladesh often criticised Hasina for being “very weak” when it came to dealing with India.</p><p>According to the Indian daily Economic Times, in 2016, a key BNP adviser called on Hasina to <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/many-bangladeshis-anti-india-due-to-ties-with-awami-league/articleshow/53874517.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scrap</a> certain joint venture power-sharing projects with India since they could be detrimental to Bangladesh’s environment.</p><p>For decades, the BNP has also had an alliance with JIB, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist group that advocates for stronger ties with Pakistan, India’s archenemy, and that opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.</p><p>Anti-India sentiment gained momentum in Bangladesh after Hasina’s ousting in 2024 and India’s refusal to return her to the country.</p><p>The relationship between the two countries has further soured over the past year, especially after the murder of <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/23/making-sense-of-bangladeshs-hadi-effect-shaping-the-vote\">Osman Hadi</a>, a 2024 protest leader who was vocally anti-Indian, which also led to protests against India in Bangladesh late last year.</p><p>India has also alleged the ill-treatment of the Hindu minority under the interim government in Bangladesh.</p><p>Last December, a Hindu Bangladeshi man was lynched in the country’s Bhaluka region after being accused of making derogatory remarks against the religion of Islam. The incident took place amid widespread protests after Hadi’s death.</p><p>Also last month, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) requested that all of its team’s ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup matches scheduled in India be shifted to Sri Lanka.</p><p>But the International Cricket Council (ICC) responded to this demand last weekend by expelling Bangladesh from the tournament instead. In a show of solidarity, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) swiftly threw its weight behind Bangladesh and, on Sunday, Pakistan said it would refuse to take part in its match against India, scheduled for February 15.</p><p>“India suffered a significant strategic loss when Hasina was ousted, and it has been very uncomfortable with the interim government. New Delhi felt that it [Bangladesh] was heavily influenced by Jamaat and other religious actors that, in India’s view, threaten its interests,” Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, amid ongoing tensions, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yunus held their first meeting on the sidelines of a BIMSTEC summit in Bangkok, Thailand, in April last year. Vikram Misri, India’s foreign secretary, told reporters that Modi had “reiterated India’s support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh”.</p><p>Misri added that Yunus and Modi also discussed Hasina’s extradition. But to date, Hasina remains in India.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-india-view-the-upcoming-elections\">How does India view the upcoming elections?</h2><p>Analysts said the stakes are high for India.</p><p>“India is hoping that this upcoming election will produce a government that is willing to engage with India and will not be influenced by the types of actors that India feels threaten its interests,” Kugelman said.</p><p>It is unlikely that any new government would ignore worsening tensions with India, said Rejwan of Independent University, even if it includes JIB or other Islamist parties.</p><p>“Any government coming to power in Dhaka will find it difficult to neglect its largest neighbour and a regional power like India for the sake of mutual interest regarding nontraditional security threats, trade and food security, cultural and human ties,” he said.</p><p>“It is easy to give inflammatory and popular rhetoric against India when you are competing for votes, but when you are in government, the populist posture ultimately changes while dealing with a powerful and influential neighbour.”</p><p>Driven by New Delhi’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, which focuses on maintaining friendly relations with neighbours to safeguard India’s security, Indian policymakers have often stressed that the subcontinent needs to maintain a friendly relationship with Bangladesh.</p><p>Last month, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar wished Bangladesh “well” for its upcoming elections. “We hope that once things settle down, the sense of neighbourliness in this region will grow,” he said.</p><p>Jaishankar also <a href=\"/features/2026/1/6/new-phase-india-eyes-bangladesh-thaw-with-bnp-before-elections\">visited</a> Dhaka in early January for the funeral of former Bangladeshi Prime Minister and BNP leader Khaleda Zia. He later wrote on X that he had conveyed his condolences on behalf of India to Zia’s son, Tarique Rahman, and “expressed confidence that Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our [India and Bangladesh’s] partnership”.</p><p>Kugelman said India is likely to be concerned from political and security standpoints if JIB wins the election but would be “comfortable” with a BNP-led government.</p><p>“Today’s BNP no longer has an alliance with Jamaat, and the party has expressed its interests about wanting to engage with India,” he noted.</p><p>“I think that India will be ready to pick up the pieces of what has been a shattered relationship with Bangladesh. … It obviously would have preferred the Awami League to be leading the next government. But India also recognises that the Awami League is not going to be a political factor for quite some time and is not going to try to push for ways to bring the Awami League back into the mix. It would accept a government led by the BNP and would be willing to work with it,” Kugelman added.</p><p>But with polls suggesting the Jamaat and BNP are in a neck-and-neck race, India has been reaching out to both. In an interview this month, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman revealed that an Indian diplomat had met him in December. And the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, Pranay Verma, met BNP leader Tarique Rahman on January 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-are-pakistan-bangladesh-relations\">How are Pakistan-Bangladesh relations?</h2><p>Since Hasina’s ousting, Pakistan’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">relationship</a> with Bangladesh has grown warmer.</p><p>In 2024, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Yunus twice, seeking to strengthen military and diplomatic ties. In September last year, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Dhaka, seeking to “reinvigorate” a relationship that had been fractured since Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence with Pakistan.</p><p>After India and Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, Pakistan was created as a Muslim-majority state with two geographically separated regions, with Bangladesh being known as East Pakistan. In 1971, India supported Bangladesh’s liberation struggle in which the Pakistani military carried out atrocities, killing hundreds of thousands of people and allegedly raping an estimated 200,000 women. Bangladesh continues to seek an apology from Pakistan.</p><p>But according to analysts, Yunus’s interim government has been seeking to boost economic ties with Pakistan. Last February, the two nations resumed direct trade for the first time since the 1971 war under a new agreement negotiated by Yunus. Last week, they resumed direct flights after 14 years. Flight services had been stopped in 2012, with Dhaka citing security concerns. The two nations have also held military and defence dialogues over the past year.</p><p>“Pakistan primarily wants to develop closer bilateral ties by extending its defence and cultural diplomacy with Bangladesh,” Independent University’s Rejwan said. “This is because, in reality, given its own economic challenges, it has very little to offer to Bangladesh in terms of trade and investment. By doing so, it wants to heighten India’s security concerns to its east by developing close strategic ties with Dhaka.”</p><p>He added that while Pakistan has generally refrained from commenting on the ousting of Hasina directly, it does aim to take advantage of the ongoing political change in Bangladesh.</p><p>“[Pakistan] has tried to sideline the dark genocidal legacies of 1971 during the liberation war of Bangladesh by utilising the rising anti-India and Islamist sentiment in Bangladesh,” he said. “Moreover, it has also been the most active proponent of creating a Bangladesh-China-Pakistan trilateral regional arrangement, something about which Dhaka has expressed its reservations until now.”</p><h2 id=\"how-does-pakistan-view-the-upcoming-elections\">How does Pakistan view the upcoming elections?</h2><p id=\"pakistan-um-i-think-pakistan-also-would-be-okay-with-with-whatever-comes-the-um-i-think-that-for-pakistan-the-wild-card-the-wild-card-scenario-of-jamaat-somehow-uh-putting-itself-in-a-position-to-lead-the-next-government-that-would-be-ideal-for-pakistan-um-pakistan-would-clearly-be-the-only-regional-player-that-would-most-prefer-a-jamaat-government-i-do-think-that-s-unlikely-if-we-see-a-bnp-led-government-i-think-pakistan-would-be-okay-with-that-but-it-would-be-looking-for-signals-that-the-bnp-would-not-want-to-let-its-inclination-to-try-to-patch-things-up-with-india-diminish-efforts-in-recent-months-by-bangladesh-to-work-toward-a-better-relationship-with-bangladesh-and-i-think-that-for-islamabad-it-would-be-okay-with-the-scenario-where-a-bnp-led-government-essentially-tries-to-balance-its-growing-ties-with-pakistan-with-um-a-an-effort-to-patch-up-ties-with-india\">According to Kugelman, Pakistan will be happy with either of the two main parties coming to power in the upcoming elections, but a JIB victory would be ideal.</p><p>“Pakistan would clearly be the only regional player that would most prefer a Jamaat government,” he said.</p><p>“If we see a BNP-led government, I think, Pakistan would be OK with that,” he said.</p><p>But he warned that Islamabad would be eager to ensure that BNP does not try to patch Bangladesh’s ties with India.</p><p>“That would diminish Islamabad’s recent efforts to work towards a better relationship with Bangladesh.”</p><p>Still, Rejwan pointed out, “if Jamaat comes to power, there is a high chance that despite having close ties with Islamabad, they might also develop an understanding with New Delhi for their own interest rather than being overtly confrontational,” he said.</p><p>“BNP, in contrast, will keep all the channels of cooperation open with Pakistan but will not … tilt heavily on Islamabad. BNP’s policy is loud and clear; it’s Bangladesh first, which means national interest comes first, which means avoiding bandwagoning a foreign power and, rather, strategically hedging with a diverse range of external partners,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-are-china-bangladesh-relations\">How are China-Bangladesh relations?</h2><p>China’s influence in South Asia has been growing in recent years, and the country has been making efforts to boost <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/4/bangladesh-elections-mark-a-pro-china-tipping-point-in-south-asia\">military and economic ties</a> with Bangladesh.</p><p>While China backed Pakistan during Bangladesh’s 1971 liberation war, since 1975, the two nations have been diplomatic partners, and Beijing has maintained cordial relations with Dhaka irrespective of the governing party.</p><p>Under Hasina, the two signed several economic agreements. That trend has continued under Yunus, whose administration has secured approximately $2.1bn in Chinese investments, loans and grants and encouraged more investment from the world’s second-largest economy in Bangladeshi infrastructure.</p><p>China has also pledged assistance for Bangladesh in managing the influx of refugees to Cox’s Bazar, where hundreds of Rohingya have fled persecution in Myanmar, placing pressure on Bangladesh’s infrastructure.</p><p>Last year, Yunus said he had discussed the possible purchase of fighter jets during his visit to China, though a deal has yet to be signed.</p><p>“China has been pragmatic and realistic about Hasina’s ouster,” Rejwan said. “Beijing warmly welcomed the formation of the interim government and was one of the first external partners to extend all kinds of support under the new political realities in Bangladesh.”</p><p>“Due to this Chinese charm offensive, the interim government in Dhaka further bolstered the existing bilateral cooperation with Beijing,” he added. “Indeed, it can be said that the Sino-Bangladesh relations were strong during Hasina’s regime and even stronger under the current interim administration, and are perceived to remain as so irrespective of whoever comes to power in Dhaka after the election,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-china-view-the-upcoming-election\">How does China view the upcoming election?</h2><p>China appears to be taking an active interest. Over the past year, Chinese leaders have been meeting leaders from Bangladesh’s political parties ahead of the elections.</p><p>In April last year, a senior Chinese Communist Party delegation met a delegation from the Jamaat. In June, Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sun Weidong met BNP secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. In both these meetings, the upcoming elections were discussed.</p><p>Kugelman said China will watch the elections closely as it views Bangladesh as a key trade and investment partner.</p><p>“For Beijing, political stability in Dhaka is key due to its investments in the region. Beijing wants to ensure that the law-and-order challenges and other security concerns in Bangladesh would not impact Chinese interests on the ground,” he said.</p><p>Rejwan said, for China, the upcoming elections are also important since Bangladesh, for its strategic influence over South Asia, a region which has long been considered India’s sphere of influence.</p><p>“Unlike India, China has refrained from interfering in the domestic politics of Bangladesh and has historically maintained close ties with political parties like BNP and JIB even during the peak of Hasina’s rule,” he said.</p><p>But when it comes to the election outcome, Rejwan said, China has no explicit favourites.</p><p>“Whoever wins the majority, it will give its full support to that regime and, side by side, will maintain interaction with other major political parties. Beijing prefers inclusive rather than exclusive interactions with all the political players in Bangladesh,” he said.</p><p>“China’s primary challenge will be to prevent any US influence over the party that secures the majority in the polls and forms the government,” Rejwan added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But as the weeks and months passed, his condition deteriorated.</p><p>Eventually, family members convinced him to consult a physician, and he was first admitted to Sally Mugabe Central Hospital. Doctors initially suspected he’d suffered a stroke. But on further inspection, they told the family he may have a kidney-related issue and needed to see a specialist, a nephrologist whose consultation fee was $600.</p><p>With no savings, Ganda’s family spent a month late last year trying to gather the money, hoping it would save his life. But it was too late.</p><p>“We couldn’t raise that amount,” Mutambararo, 39, told Al Jazeera. “He died barely a month after the admission.”</p><p>Soon after, the funeral was held. And while Ganda had spent his last months in pain and relative poverty, the service that bid him farewell was enviable: a casket, a hearse, burial equipment and a 65-seat bus to carry mourners on the 135km (85-mile) journey from Harare to his hometown of Wedza.</p><p>While Ganda could not afford health insurance, which averages about $200 per month and would have covered his diagnosis and treatment, he never missed his $11 monthly payment to a funeral services company, Nyaradzo Group, which paid his post-death costs.</p><p>Ganda is no exception. In Zimbabwe, data show more people are preparing for death than for survival as funeral insurance has eclipsed medical cover to become the most widely held financial product in the country.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283153\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283153\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283153\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ganda-1770025127-e1770025220230.jpeg?w=573&amp;resize=573%2C382&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283153\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ngoni Mutambararo sprinkles water on his uncle’s grave in Wedza shortly after his burial [Tafadzwa Mwanengureni/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Although health insurance is accessible through employers and monthly premiums are deducted automatically from salaries, <a href=\"https://gga.org/zimbabwe-one-vast-informal-business/\">fewer than 900,000 Zimbabweans</a> are formally employed.</p><p>About <a href=\"https://zimstat.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/demography/zdhs/zhds2023_24_report.pdf\">16 million people</a>, or roughly 90 percent of the population, have no health insurance and must fund medical care out of their own pockets, according to 2023-2024 data from Zimbabwe’s National Statistics Agency.</p><p>At the same time, experts said funeral policies offer a cheaper, culturally resonant form of support, especially in a society in which dignity in death often takes precedence over safeguarding life itself.</p><p>Of all insured Zimbabweans, <a href=\"https://finmark.org.za/Publications/FinScope_Zimbabwe_2022_Consumer_Presentation.pdf\">72 percent</a> hold funeral insurance policies while 30 percent have health insurance, according to a 2022 report from the financial inclusion nonprofit FinMark Trust.</p><h2 id=\"life-after-death-is-important\">‘Life after death is important’</h2><p>For most Zimbabweans, medical cover is a luxury they cannot afford, so they forgo private healthcare for government services. Public health fees can start at about $5 per month, but government-run facilities suffer from poor infrastructure, limited drug supplies and staff shortages caused by the migration of healthcare professionals, which many said lead to low-quality care.</p><p>Although some private insurance premiums start at about $10 per month, others run into tens and even a few hundred dollars, putting plans beyond the reach of many households in a country where <a href=\"https://borgenproject.org/facts-about-poverty-in-zimbabwe/\">60 percent</a> of the population lives on less than $3.65 a day.</p><p>In comparison, funeral insurance plans are widely accessible and relatively low cost. The funeral cover provider Ecosure, for instance, offers plans starting at $0.75 while Zimnat’s policies begin at $1.</p><p>“Funerals are immediate, unavoidable events that come with significant financial and communal expectations,” said Innocent Tshuma, the public relations manager at Doves Holdings Group, a funeral services provider.</p><p>“In contrast, access to comprehensive medical aid remains limited due to affordability challenges, exclusions and unpredictable out-of-pocket costs.”</p><p>He argued that Zimbabweans place deep importance on dignity, respect and collective responsibility at times of death and funeral insurance offers certainty in cost and service delivery, “which explains its strong appeal in an environment of constrained household incomes”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4282989\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4282989\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4282989\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/3-1770021898.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C669&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4282989\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representatives for Doves Holdings, a funeral services provider, meet prospective policyholders in Harare, Zimbabwe [Tafadzwa Mwanengureni/ Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Vivek Solanki, a physician and member of the Zimbabwe Medical Association, agreed.</p><p>“In Zimbabwean culture, the aspect of life after death is very much important, and it’s actually not a financial one,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On the other hand, he added, “it’s almost a taboo to think about how and when [someone is] going to get sick … because it’s like you are attracting bad things to happen.”</p><p>Solanki also attributed the low numbers of people with health insurance to a legacy of post-independence policies when citizens relied on government-funded healthcare and rarely worried about costs. But things have been deteriorating since the public system began collapsing in the 2000s after Western <a href=\"/economy/2019/10/25/thousands-in-zimbabwe-denounce-evil-western-sanctions\">sanctions</a> were imposed.</p><p>“But today, even to receive proper healthcare in public hospitals, private funds are required,” Solanki said. “For many people in Zimbabwe, covering the financial burden of emergencies, chronic illnesses and noncommunicable diseases has become extremely challenging.”</p><p>Low prioritisation of medical insurance remains a significant hurdle in Zimbabwe, where <a href=\"https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/Country-Profiles/MPI/ZWE.pdf\">25 percent</a> lack access to basics like food, healthcare and education. To address this, the country plans to launch a national health insurance scheme in June as it aims to expand access to quality healthcare for all.</p><p>Itai Rusike – the director of the Community Working Group on Health, a network of civic organisations, and a public health activist – said the initiative “affirms the government’s commitment to ensure universal health coverage”.</p><p>However, he expressed concerns about the government’s capacity to sustain the programme, given the current challenges of high public debt, currency fragility and persistent inflation facing Zimbabwe.</p><p>“To fully achieve the full potential of a National Health Insurance scheme, actions to address the social determinants of health must be implemented,” he said. “These include economic stability, community and physical environment, education and social context, and the healthcare system.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283005\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283005\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283005\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP20070446698304-1770021946.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A coffin maker displays a coffin for sale while working on another one on the streets of Harare [File: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"death-insurance-a-commercialisation-of-life\">Death insurance: A ‘commercialisation of life’?</h2><p>The public health system currently is in a state of collapse after years of chronic underfunding. With just 1.7 hospital beds per 1,000 people and a maternal mortality rate of 462 per 100,000 live births compared with a global rate of 197 deaths per 100,000 live births, thousands are locked out of essential care.</p><p>Funeral insurance, on the other hand, is accessible and booming with <a href=\"https://www.newsday.co.zw/theindependent/opinion/article/200029774/ceteris-paribus-funeral-assurance-in-zim-a-look-into-market-viability\">66 percent of all life assurance revenue</a> in 2024 coming from funeral policies.</p><p>According to EcoSure, funerals typically cost $800 to $3,000 in Zimbabwe depending on the city, number of attendees and type of service. For many, this makes funeral insurance a worthwhile investment.</p><p>However, African spiritualist and traditionalist Pearson Takaingei Marinda calls the trend a “commercialisation of life”.</p><p>“Culturally, we appreciate and celebrate life and transition [death], but in the modern day, we are forced to prepare for death more than life,” Marinda told Al Jazeera. “Traditionally, funerals and burials are facilitated by the society and the deceased would be buried covered in animal skin, but due to commercialisation, people are forced to pay for coffins.”</p><p>In line with newer traditions, those who cannot afford formal funeral policies are turning to informal, community-based burial schemes, joining grassroots efforts to ensure their families can preserve dignity in death.</p><p>Ellie Mlambo, whose father died last year after a long battle with a heart condition, spent nearly a year consulting traditional healers and prophets because their services were far cheaper than medical insurance and hospital bills.</p><p>When he passed, two burial savings groups – Chirongwa Chemadzimai Chekuviga and Tashinga Burial – attended Mlambo’s father’s funeral in Machavangu, 100km (62 miles) southeast of Harare, supporting her bereaved mother. The former collects $1 per member per month and helps contribute to eventual funeral costs while the latter collects $2 per member monthly and contributes $120 towards a coffin.</p><p>“My mother paid up for two burial savings, but since my father was on my funeral policy, the money was given to my mother for other uses,” Mlambo told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4282991\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4282991\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4282991\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4-1770021905.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C674&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4282991\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Doves Holdings representatives speak to potential customers in Harare [Tafadzwa Mwanengureni/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Some informal burial groups often go beyond covering funeral costs and provide mealie-meal, a traditional corn-based dish, vegetables and cooking utensils to support the bereaved.</p><p>In Jegede village, a rural area in Zaka, community members established the Jegede Burial Society last year after an elderly woman died without the means to afford a coffin, a proper burial or food for those attending her funeral. Traditionally, the bereaved family would provide for the funeral, and neighbours would simply gather to offer moral support, but the community now helps ensure basic needs are met.</p><p>The chairperson of the Jegede Burial Society, Chomudisa Jegede, said the incident reminded the community of the importance of having a contingency plan for funerals.</p><p>“Our community responded well, and we are now made up of 44 members and each is obliged to contribute $10 when a member dies,” he told Al Jazeera. “It is working very well because so far we have managed to assist some five members during funerals of their immediate families.”</p><p>However, Jegede noted that the community needs to go beyond death and also focus on the need for health insurance.</p><p>His sentiments were echoed by Solanki from the Zimbabwe Medical Association.</p><p>“Education and public awareness on the importance of medical insurance and providing funds towards healthcare is the way to go in an era where health is no longer free,” he said.</p><p>He also urged Zimbabweans in the diaspora to contribute to the initiative, noting that their experience with health insurance in the countries where they work gives them a clearer understanding of its benefits.</p><p>“Perhaps the diasporians could fund or pay towards health insurance of their families in Zimbabwe,” he said, “I think that’ll be one of the ways to encourage people, educate them and create awareness of the essential need for health funding in case of any emergency or health ailments.”</p><p><em>This article is published in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.egab.co\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Sending lists about employees to Israel “would potentially endanger the lives of our staff”.</p><p>Medecins du Monde said, “Humanitarian access is not optional, conditional, or political. Israel is unconditionally obliged to facilitate relief schemes under international humanitarian law.”</p><p>Since Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza began in October 2023, its military has killed more than 550 aid workers, including 15 MSF staff.</p><p>On January 1, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/which-aid-groups-is-israel-banning-from-gaza-now-and-what-will-it-mean\">withdrew</a> the licences of 37 aid organisations, saying they had not shared data about their employees, funding and operations. According to rules set out by Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, the information to be handed over for the sake of “security and transparency” includes copies of passports, CVs and names of family members, including children.</p><p>Al Jazeera contacted all 37 aid groups. Overall, 10 have said they will refuse to provide Israel with staff lists, four said they would not comment and the rest did not respond. The International Rescue Committee said it was “in touch with relevant authorities” and was seeking a way to sustain the delivery of life-saving aid.</p><h2 id=\"pretext-to-obstruct-humanitarian-assistance\">‘Pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance’</h2><p>Action Aid said the requirements “form part of a relentless campaign to undermine and dismantle the systems that sustain Palestinian life”.</p><p>The measures, it said, compel charities to “accept political and ideological conditions unrelated to humanitarian work, violating our duty of care, international data-protection standards, labour laws and core humanitarian principles”.</p><p>Israel has weaponised aid throughout the genocide and officials have incited violence against Palestinian humanitarian workers by accusing some of them, without evidence, of aligning with Hamas.</p><p>It has claimed that MSF had employed fighters, an allegation the group rejects.</p><p>On Sunday, the Israeli ministry ordered MSF, which operates 20 health clinics in Gaza, to cease its activities by February 28.</p><p>“This is a pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance,” MSF said, adding that it did not hand over the names of its employees because Israeli authorities “failed to provide the concrete assurances required to guarantee our staff’s safety, protect their personal data and uphold the independence of our medical operations”.</p><p>“For Israel, the genocidal project did not stop,” Ghassan Abu Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon who volunteers in Gaza, told Al Jazeera. “The destruction of the health system, which is a central tenet of the genocidal project, needs to continue into the ‘ceasefire’.”</p><p>He said the work of aid groups has become “more important” since Israel destroyed the Palestinian health system.</p><p>“These NGOs, by and large, particularly NGOs like MSF, rely almost exclusively on the services being provided by their Palestinian staff. And so all of the clinical work is now provided by Palestinian doctors.”</p><p>MSF had earlier agreed to the registration requirements but reversed the decision, saying Israel had failed to allay its fears about its staff’s safety.</p><p>MSF provides 20 percent of Gaza’s hospital beds. In 2025, it held 800,000 medical consultations and assisted in one in three births in the enclave – “services that cannot easily be replaced”, the medical charity said.</p><h2 id=\"fears-of-another-ghf-style-intervention\">Fears of another GHF-style intervention</h2><p>In its statement on banning MSF, the Israeli government said, “concurrently, assessments are being made to provide alternative medical solutions” after MSF’s “departure”, a statement that concerned experts and doctors.</p><p>James Smith, an emergency physician who has volunteered in Gaza, said, “The great fear … is that Israel will do what it did with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).”</p><p>The GHF was a United States- and Israel-backed scheme with the stated aim of distributing food in Gaza. But Israeli forces and foreign military contractors regularly fired at those seeking aid. More than 850 Palestinians were killed around GHF sites during its six-month operations in 2025.</p><p>“[Israel] will create these pseudo-humanitarian organisations,” Smith warned. “It will use the language of humanitarianism to create alternative systems over which it has complete control, and those systems will be used to enact violence and suffering rather than to deliver on humanitarian objectives.”</p><p>He added that Israel is “committing genocide” by denying the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p><p>“You commit genocide with bullets and bombs, and you also commit genocide by ensuring that people don’t have access to clean water, nutritious food, safe and dignified shelter, or effective medical care.”</p><p>Medico International told Al Jazeera that the purpose of the registration drive was to make NGOs subservient and complicit to Israeli actions “or if they refuse, to deny and criminalise them”.</p><p>The push against NGOs “cannot come as a surprise for anyone familiar with the years of smear campaigns against Israeli and Palestinian human rights organisations”, it said.</p><p>Medical Aid for Palestinians said it will not engage in a registration process, describing the order as a “deliberate political attack designed to silence, control and censor humanitarian organisations”.</p><p>“Under international law, Israel is required to facilitate rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance – not obstruct, politicise or criminalise it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
