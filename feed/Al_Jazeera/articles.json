Tony’s not making $30m a year.”</p><p>Barak replied: “Yeah, but he’s become quite … I can judge from the style of his watches that he’s …”</p><p>“Yes, but he’s making $10m a year,” says Epstein.</p><p>Barak then responds: “Probably he [gets] the money and he leaves some of it to the others, probably some of the providers.”</p><p>Leaked emails suggest that Epstein served as a trusted financial adviser, fixer, concierge, sounding board and even <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/israels-ex-pm-ehud-barak-and-jeffrey-epstein-had-close-relationship-emails-reveal\">friend to Barak </a>during their long-running relationship, which continued for years after the disgraced financier became a convicted sex offender following a controversial plea deal in 2008.</p><p>The US Justice Department has not confirmed when the recorded conversation took place.

Rights groups and scholars have dubbed Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide. Despite a “ceasefire” agreed upon in October, Israel has killed more than 500 Palestinians, including 21 on Wednesday, and has reneged on many of the terms of the deal.</p><p>Blair’s participation in Trump’s project has been a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/28/why-is-the-divisive-tony-blair-now-touted-for-post-gaza-war-interim-role\">major source of contention</a>, given his prominent role in the Iraq war, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.</p><p>To this day, critics in the Middle East and the UK brand Blair a “war criminal”, and he remains a toxic figure in some quarters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

After that, it would agree to limit enrichment of uranium to below 1.5 percent.</p><p>Its current stock of highly enriched uranium – including about 440kg (970lb) that has been enriched to 60 percent – would be transferred to a third country.</p><p>The proposed framework goes beyond Iran’s nuclear programme with mediators proposing that Iran should agree not to transfer weapons and technologies to its regional, nonstate allies.</p><p>Tehran would also pledge to not initiate the use of ballistic missiles under this framework. This falls short of a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\">US demand</a> that Iran curb the number and range of its ballistic missiles.</p><p>A “nonaggression agreement” between Tehran and Washington is also being proposed by the three mediators, one of the sources said.</p><p>It is not yet known how Washington or Tehran have responded to the proposed framework.</p><p>For its part, the US has made it clear that any deal must include regulations on Iran’s nuclear programme, missiles and proxies.</p><p>In the past, Iran has been willing to compromise on nuclear development, including in 2015 when it signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal with  other countries, including the US, to limit nuclear enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. Three years later, however, Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.</p><p>But Tehran has so far refused to talk about limiting its support for nonstate allies in the region and curtailing its ballistic missiles.</p><p>On Wednesday, Iran was still holding firm to the line that it would “exclusively” discuss the nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.</p><h2 id=\"defiant-tone\">Defiant tone</h2><p>The mediators’ framework was presented to the US and Iran just before Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his spy chiefs during a visit to Israel on Tuesday.</p><p>The US is entering negotiations with significant leverage as Iran faces an unprecedented mix of external and internal pressures.</p><p>A US aircraft carrier, fighter jets and navy destroyers are now <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\">positioned</a> in the Arabian Sea, presenting Tehran with a credible military threat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iran has been rocked by nationwide protests in December and January, which culminated in the country’s most brutal episodes of violence in decades.</p><p>Still, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has maintained a defiant tone, and observers remained cautious about whether he would be willing to compromise on key issues, considering the degree of mistrust towards the US in Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"reviving-diplomacy\">Reviving diplomacy</h2><p>This is not the first time Iranian and US officials have met in a bid to revive diplomacy between the two nations, which have not had diplomatic relations since 1980. In June, US and Iranian officials gathered in the Omani capital, Muscat, to discuss a nuclear agreement, but the process stalled as Israel bombed Iran.</p><p>The Israeli strikes kicked off a 12-day war, which ended with the US bombing key Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran making a symbolic strike on Al Udeid military base in Qatar, which hosts US forces.</p><p>Since then, Tehran has claimed it has replenished its stockpile of ballistic missiles and has warned countries it would use them if attacked. Washington is particularly eager to limit Iran’s ballistic missiles because, during the 12-day war, some Iranian missiles succeeded in breaching Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome defence system.</p><p>In the meantime, tensions remained high. On Tuesday, the US shot down an Iranian drone that had come close to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. And on the same day, US officials said Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, a Gulf waterway critical to global trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Omar Shakir, who has worked for the rights group for more than 10 years, told Al Jazeera he has lost faith in the organisation after its new chief, Bolopion, blocked a report accusing Israel of committing “crimes against humanity” in its denial of Palestinian refugees’ right of return.</p><p>Shakir said on Tuesday that the report “sought to connect the erasure of camps in Gaza with the emptying of camps in the West Bank, with the full assault led by the Israeli government against UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees and underscoring how in the midst of this Nakba 2.0 that we’re seeing unfold beyond us, it’s critical that we learn the lessons from Nakba 1.0”.</p><p>The Nakba, which means catastrophe, refers to the forced displacement of 750,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes and land by Zionist militias leading up to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine\">Ukraine</h2><p>In Ukraine, Russia’s “indiscriminate bombing, coercing Ukrainians in occupied areas to serve in the Russian military, systematic torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war, the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, and the use of quadcopter drones to hunt and kill civilians” have not been met with meaningful pressure.</p><h2 id=\"russia\">Russia</h2><p>Russia’s intensifying crackdown on dissent and civil society includes authorities using ill-treatment of those in custody as a “tool of repression” and wielding legislation to target “foreign agents” and “undesirable” organisations.</p><p>The head of the election monitoring group Golos, Grigory Melkonyants, was sentenced to five years in prison. Three lawyers were sentenced to prison terms for providing legal services to the Anti-Corruption Foundation’s founder, Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in 2024.</p><p>“Authorities throughout the country continued to prosecute people for commemorating Navalny’s memory, sharing information about him, using his name, or displaying his portrait,” the report said.</p><p>The foundation was also designated a “terrorist organization” by the country’s Supreme Court. International rights groups, including HRW, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders and the International Federation for Human Rights, have also been banned in Russia.</p><h2 id=\"china\">China</h2><p>In China, authorities “systematically deny the rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and religion, and persecute government critics”, the report says.</p><p>With the state controlling all significant channels of information and some of the world’s “most stringent surveillance and censorship”, critics face imprisonment and forced disappearance. Human rights defenders are frequently harassed and tortured, while those who belong to “illegal” religious groups are harassed and detained by police.</p><p>As Tibetans and Uighurs are forced to assimilate, the government released draft legislation, Promoting Ethnic Unity and Progress, which “seeks to justify existing repression of minorities and facilitate intensifying ideological controls both at home and abroad”.</p><h2 id=\"filling-the-vacuum\">Filling the vacuum</h2><p>The report stresses there is an “urgent need for a new global alliance to support human rights”.</p><p>HRW said it is “critical to look beyond the usual suspects”, pointing to countries such as Costa Rica, Ghana, Malaysia, Mexico, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Vanuatu, which have “played important roles on specific human rights initiatives in key international forums”.</p><p>Chile’s Democracy Forever summit brought together leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Spain and Uruguay, who pledged to engage in “active democratic diplomacy”, while The Hague Group was formed in solidarity with Palestinians and in defence of international law.</p><p>Student protests in support of Palestine, protests against ICE abuses in the US and Gen Z protests in Nepal, Indonesia and Morocco were cited as examples of enduring people power.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the US is reported to be backing away from this suggestion.</p><p>On Monday, US President Donald Trump announced the launch of a strategic minerals stockpile for the US called <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile\">Project Vault.</a> It will be funded by $2bn of private capital along with a $10bn loan from the US Export-Import Bank.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-critical-minerals-ministerial\">What is the Critical Minerals Ministerial?</h2><p>The meeting is the first of the new Critical Minerals Ministerial, a US initiative to build alliances aimed at countering China’s control over critical mineral supply chains around the world.</p><p>The main meeting of representatives takes place on Wednesday.</p><p>Currently, China controls most of the world’s rare earth minerals, including metals that are necessary for the manufacture of many technological items, from smartphones to fighter jets. China has 60 percent of these minerals and processes 90 percent of the world’s supply.</p><p>According to the US Department of State, the ministerial is being hosted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and is taking place at the State Department building close to the White House.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-attending\">Who is attending?</h2><p>The US will host delegations from more than 50 countries, according to the State Department.</p><p>This includes representatives from the Group of Seven countries – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US – as well as from the European Union, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>On Tuesday, Rubio met with Cho Hyun, the foreign minister of South Korea on the sidelines of the ministerial. In an X post, Rubio wrote that he and Cho discussed recent commitments by Seoul to increase “investments to rebuild critical US industries and the importance of diversifying and securing critical mineral supply chains to bolster our economic and national security”.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to discuss cooperation over critical minerals.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-critical-minerals-and-why-do-they-matter\">What are critical minerals and why do they matter?</h2><p>They are nonfuel minerals used to manufacture batteries, clocks, wiring, military hardware and semiconductors among other technological products.</p><p>The US describes them as “essential to the economic or national security of the US” and having “a supply chain vulnerable to disruption”.</p><p>Nickel, cobalt, lithium, aluminium and zinc are among the best-known critical minerals. For 12 critical minerals, the US relies entirely on imports. For 29 additional critical minerals, the US imports at least half of what it needs.</p><p>Critical minerals also include 17 rare earth elements – 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, scandium and yttrium. China has deposits of 12 of these.</p><p>Rare earth metals have special magnetic properties and are necessary for the production of permanent magnets, used for industrial automation, electric vehicle motors, renewable energy generators, electronics and many medical devices.</p><p>Because of China’s near-total control of rare earth metals, Western nations have said they worry about their access to these minerals. Currently, Europe’s supply of permanent magnets, for example, comes almost entirely from China.</p><p>The processing costs for rare earths are high, and mining them involves heavy use of chemicals that generate toxic waste harmful to the environment.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2229177\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/INTERACTIVE-What-minerals-are-used-in-electric-vehicles_2-1685964574.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - What minerals are used in electric vehicles_2-1685964574\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"which-country-dominates-critical-minerals-now\">Which country dominates critical minerals now?</h2><p>According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), global rare earth reserves were estimated at about 110 million tonnes as of 2024.</p><p>China has the most rare earth metals and a “near monopoly”, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported in 2024.</p><p>It has also filed thousands of patents for the processing technologies it has developed.</p><p>Last year, China began restricting exports of the 12 rare earth metals it possesses. In April, China <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/12/why-chinas-rare-earth-exports-are-a-key-issue-in-trade-tensions-with-us\">imposed restrictions</a> on exports for seven rare earth minerals. Then in October, it <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters\">added</a> the five remaining metals to the list.</p><p>In late October, Trump reached a trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. China agreed to put the restrictions for the five final metals on hold for one year while the two countries continue trade negotiations. In return, Trump dropped his threat of 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3543003\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/INTERACTIVE-UKRAINE-RARE-MINERALS-GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION-FEB27-2025-1740694424.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-UKRAINE-RARE MINERALS-GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION-FEB27, 2025-1740694424\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues-on-the-meeting-s-agenda\">What are the key issues on the meeting’s agenda?</h2><p>On Wednesday, US Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley and Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg will deliver opening remarks.</p><p>The countries attending the conference will discuss setting a minerals price floor – a minimum price for a mineral or group of minerals. Those calling for a minimum price to be set said it would reduce risks for investors, keep supplies coming from a larger number of places and prevent large players from leveraging cheap prices to exclude smaller competitors.</p><p>The Trump administration, however, is stepping back from plans to guarantee such a minimum price, according to the Reuters news agency, which quoted unnamed sources for its report. Australian mining stocks dropped as a result.</p><p>Australia, which also has a large supply of rare earth metals, is among those countries pushing hard for a price floor as it positions itself as an alternative to China by investing heavily in developing its own processing capacity.</p><p>The ministerial will also be an opportunity for the US to get other countries to fall into line over its own policies for critical minerals, analysts said.</p><p>“The US is likely to push partner countries to sign minerals deals by which US companies get preferential or at least access to mineral deposits,” Raphael Deberdt, a postdoctoral fellow at the Copenhagen Business School, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Deberdt, who researches critical minerals, explained that while the US has access to these deposits, Washington will also want to invest in those countries to expand production of specific minerals, particularly rare earth elements, cobalt, nickel and graphite.</p><p>“The US is also likely to work on a reshuffling of critical minerals supply chains to orient processing towards its own territory and the territories of allied nations,” Deberdt said.</p><p>“However, this is still prospective as the US has little processing capabilities and remains far from Chinese dominance.”</p><p>He said the Washington conference, therefore, is more likely to be about making US policy on critical minerals visible rather than achieving “real advances in the onshoring, reshoring or friend-shoring of critical minerals”.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-developing-rare-earth-capacity\">Which other countries are developing rare earth capacity?</h2><p>Australia has the world’s fourth largest rare earth reserves, including metals such as neodymium, which is used to make magnets in wind turbines.</p><p>In October, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Trump signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/can-australia-provide-us-with-rare-earth-metals-which-china-has-restricted\">critical minerals agreement</a> that will give the US access to Australian rare earth minerals in return for investment.</p><p>But while Australia’s rare earth reserves are large, they are still only <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/can-australia-provide-us-with-rare-earth-metals-which-china-has-restricted\">one-seventh</a> the size of China’s, according to the USGS. That’s why experts said the US will likely try to <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/we-are-exploited-congolese-fear-losing-out-as-us-makes-minerals-deals\">court other countries</a> for supplies as well.</p><p>Greenland, which Trump has said he wants to take over and make part of the US, is also rich in critical minerals, including rare earth metals. Greenland has limited mining, however, as the practice is largely opposed by Indigenous Inuit residents.</p><h2 id=\"are-countries-stockpiling-their-own-critical-minerals\">Are countries stockpiling their own critical minerals?</h2><p>Yes, as well as the US Project Vault, other countries are stockpiling critical minerals to protect themselves from supply chain disruptions in response to China’s dominance of the market.</p><p>In March 2020, Japan introduced an international resource strategy that reinforced a stockpiling system for its rare earth minerals.</p><p>Similarly, South Korea maintains a longstanding stockpile of critical minerals managed by the state-run Korea Mine Rehabilitation and Mineral Resources Corporation.</p><p>In December, the European Commission adopted the RESourceEU Action Plan to secure the EU’s critical minerals supply. The commission said it will also establish a European Critical Raw Materials Centre early this year to diversify supply chains, including through stockpiling.</p><p>In January, Albanese’s government announced new details of Australia’s $1.2bn Critical Minerals Strategic Reserve to secure the supply of key critical minerals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The market for critical minerals, he believes, is attracting the “covetousness” of major world powers who are lining up for an “increasingly geopolitical” battle.</p><p>But at the end of the day, for the DRC, Koko says the benefits – or lack of them – will depend on the will of the Congolese leadership.</p><p>“If this deal will allow us, the Congolese people, to have roads from point A to point B, to have clean water, to have hospitals, to have water, I think it’s a good deal,” he told Al Jazeera, urging Congolese leaders to make sure the DRC does not come out empty-handed.</p><p>Before Trump came to office, former US President Joe Biden visited the region, in part to discuss the <a href=\"/features/2025/1/2/modern-plunderers-lobito-corridor-plans-bring-fear-hesitation-in-drc\">Lobito Corridor</a> railway infrastructure project, which is currently in disrepair in DRC but will connect the country’s mining provinces to Angola, along the Atlantic Coast – a key port for the export of minerals from Africa to the US.</p><p>According to satellite image analysis carried out by <a href=\"https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/thousands-in-drc-could-face-eviction-from-lobito-corridor-railway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Global Witness</a>, up to 6,500 people could be affected by displacement linked to the development of the Lobito corridor in the DRC.</p><p>The campaign group said it conducted interviews with different social groups last year in DRC’s Kolwezi, and also visited the railway tracks that will be cleared during the rehabilitation.</p><p>It said it had found that the railway line runs through vulnerable communities that have benefitted little from the mining boom in Kolwezi, highlighting a “complex” legal situation where the status of houses and buildings along the railway line was disputed, as was the size of the area to be cleared.</p><p>For Global Witness, the Lobito corridor will be a “litmus test” for Western partners who claim that the project represents a more equitable model for resource exploitation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287052\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287052\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287052\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25136541701680-1770183750.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287052\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Miners work at the D4 Gakombe coltan mining quarry in Rubaya, DRC [File: Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"local-communities-negatively-affected\">Local communities ‘negatively’ affected</h2><p>Gentil Mulume, 35, is an activist in Goma, working on matters of transparency and good governance.

Will the population benefit from this?” he asked.</p><p>For Kuda Manjonjo, a Just Transition adviser with PowerShift Africa, a think tank based in Kenya, Africa holds a disproportionate share of the critical minerals essential to the energy transition, but remains marginalised in global value chains.</p><p>“This disparity reflects an unfair exploitation model that hinders local development,” he said, stressing the importance of rebalancing the situation, calling for fairer governance, local investment in mineral processing and transformation, and better African representation in strategic decisions on these resources.</p><p>Another resident of Goma, Daniel Mukamba, accused many multinationals of seeking to keep countries that are rich in natural resources burdened by the “resource curse” – which he believes becomes a “cancer” that is difficult to cure.</p><p>“If you look at the examples of Walikale and Rubaya, these are cities that produce a lot of minerals, including coltan, gold, cassiterite, and tourmaline, but the population remains poor,” Mukamba told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Both these resource-rich eastern cities are now held by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group, which seized control of much of the east of the country last year.</p><p>A January <a href=\"https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/tracing-opaque-gold-supply-chains-and-deals-central-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> published by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime indicates that in South Kivu province in the east, opaque gold supply chains continue to be linked to conflict, human rights violations, and environmental damage.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287040\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287040\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-12-04T192330Z_268626762_RC2V9IA8X53Y_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RWANDA-CONGO-1770183675.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump shakes hands with President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Felix Tshisekedi during a signing ceremony at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, December 4, 2025 [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"war-means-illegal-exploitation-of-resources\">War means illegal exploitation of resources</h2><p>Despite the US-brokered peace deal between DRC and Rwanda and a separate one brokered by <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">Qatar</a> between DRC and the M23 rebel alliance, fighting continues in eastern DRC and has approached regions rich in critical minerals.</p><p>In December, M23 seized the city of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/we-dont-care-about-politics-violence-hit-uvira-locals-just-want-peace\">Uvira</a>, some 300km (190 miles) from the lithium-rich province of Tanganyika. Although they have since withdrawn, several observers say there are clashes not far from Tanganyika province.</p><p>Many fear that increasing fighting could cause the risk of “uncoordinated” exploitation of mineral resources and are calling for a rapid resolution to the conflict.</p><p>“When there is war, there is illegal exploitation of our minerals,” said Chirac Issa, an environmental activist based in Tanganyika province. “There is no government order to regulate the work of miners. From an environmental standpoint, we fear that uncontrolled mining could contribute to pollution and endanger ecosystems.”</p><p>After the “resources-for-security” US-brokered deal with Rwanda was first reached in June, Congolese President Tshisekedi was optimistic about it, saying it aimed to “promote our strategic minerals, particularly copper, cobalt, and lithium, in a sovereign manner”, while “ensuring a more equitable distribution of economic benefits for the Congolese people”.</p><p>He also said it would “pave the way for local transformation, the creation of thousands of jobs, and a new economic model based on sovereignty and national added value”.</p><p>Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) allied with the M23 – which now administers the capitals of North and South Kivu provinces – however, called the mining partnership between the DRC and the US “deeply flawed and unconstitutional”. He said the plan suffers from a lack of transparency and last week criticised the “opacity surrounding the negotiations”. At a news conference in August, he also denounced the “sell-off” of the DRC’s natural resources.</p><p>Tshisekedi said last year that “the resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo will never be sold off or handed over to obscure interests,” and that the country “will sell neither its future nor its dignity”.</p><p>DRC’s resources, he affirmed, “will benefit the Congolese people above all”.</p><p>But for those same Congolese in Goma – watching this week as foreign officials in suits discuss plans for their resources at a formal event thousands of kilometres away – the future is not as secure as their president might believe.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

These are, after all, countries whose own stability is directly affected by the crisis between the US and Iran.</p><p>This marks a clear break from the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was built around a transactional arms control logic. In 2026, the tensions are fully of a military nature. Regional actors are no longer peripheral observers. They have a direct strategic interest in containment, de-escalation, and preventing a spillover.</p><p>The timing reflects that shift. Over the past few days, Iran and regional nations have intensified their diplomacy. Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, travelled to Moscow on June 30 for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held consultations in Istanbul last Friday.</p><p>Building on those meetings, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani visited Tehran over the weekend. Shortly afterwards, Larijani publicly stated that a structured negotiating framework was beginning to take shape.</p><p>According to multiple sources, what is now being prepared is not a partial or interim arrangement, but a roadmap towardsa comprehensive agreement.</p><p>Washington, however, is keeping ambiguity in play. US President Donald Trump told Fox News this week: “Iran is talking to us, and we’ll see whether we can do something, otherwise we’ll see what happens.” The message combined diplomatic engagement with pressure, preserving uncertainty as leverage.</p><p>Does this mean the risk of war has disappeared? No. But it has receded – if only for the moment.</p><p>Even confidence-building measures, such as transferring or downblending Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, do not resolve the core disputes. Major issues remain unresolved, most notably Iran’s ballistic missile programme and the broader question of its regional deterrence.</p><p>This is where the real negotiation lies. The US no longer appears interested in a deal that merely manages risk. Iran, for its part, does not want an agreement tied to a single presidency or vulnerable to reversal. What both sides are now probing is whether structural concessions can be exchanged for structural guarantees. Everything else – formats, venues, participation – is secondary.</p><p>For now, diplomacy is moving, war is deferred, and the window remains open. Whether it stays that way will depend on whether substance follows structure.</p></div></div></body></html>"
