Until this year, the FTO label was largely limited to groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) with political motives.</p><p>On Monday, Washington formally designated the Cartel de los Soles for allegedly shipping narcotics into the US. The administration says the network includes Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials, though it has provided no evidence. Venezuela denounced the move, calling it a “ridiculous” effort to sanction a “non-existent” group.</p><p>The designation follows earlier measures against eight Latin American criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. US officials claim the Cartel de los Soles has collaborated with Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang – itself designated an FTO – to move drugs northward.</p><p>Officials have rarely identified which groups they believe are behind the boats targeted by US strikes. Hegseth said last week the new designation would provide a “whole bunch of new options to the United States” in dealing with Maduro. Asked whether such options might include land strikes inside Venezuela, he said “nothing is off the table, but nothing’s automatically on the table.” Sanctions experts have noted that the FTO statute does not authorise military action.</p><h2 id=\"caracas-pushes-back\">Caracas pushes back</h2><p>Maduro’s government denies involvement in criminal operations and accuses Washington of seeking regime change to control Venezuela’s resources.</p><p>“They want Venezuela’s oil and gas reserves. For nothing, without paying. They want Venezuela’s gold. They want Venezuela’s diamonds, iron, bauxite. They want Venezuela’s natural resources,” said Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez on state television.</p><p>Foreign Minister Yvan Gil echoed that view, saying the US designation revives “an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organised crime, has described the cartel narrative as an “oversimplification”, saying it “is more accurately described as a system of corruption wherein military and political officials profit by working with drug traffickers”.</p><p>The US campaign has also drawn sharp domestic debate within the country. A Reuters poll suggested that only 29 percent of Americans support killing suspected traffickers without judicial oversight. A former senior Treasury official said FTO designations were never intended to justify military operations. “Never had it been suggested that by designating an entity as an FTO it would … meet the standard for military action,” the official said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Bureau of Labour Statistics in 2024 estimated that the scale of the damage was around $32.2m when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>As many as 300 residents of Tulsa were killed and another 700 injured, the report said, although the final tally is unknown because many were buried in unmarked graves.</p><p>Survivors like Fletcher and her family were forced to leave the area.

Such reforms, it notes, could significantly lift the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $340bn in 2024.</p><p>“Based on cross-country analysis of the reform experience of emerging markets, IMF analysis projects that Pakistan could generate between a 5 to 6.5 percent increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years,” the report said.</p><p>Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised the Pakistani government on economic reforms, said that he agreed that the absence of accountability in corruption cases was eating away at the country’s economic potential.</p><p>“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Here is what we know about the IMF report, the areas of weakness it highlights, the policy recommendations it makes, and what the experts say.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-imf-report-say\">What does the IMF report say?</h2><p>Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958, making it one of the fund’s most frequent borrowers.

Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.</p><p>At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.</p><p>The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.</p><p>These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.</p><p>Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.</p><p>He pointed to the <a href=\"/news/2021/4/13/elite-privilege-consumes-17-4bn-of-pakistans-economy-undp\">2021 UNDP report</a> and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”</p><p>“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p><p>It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).</p><p>The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.</p><p>The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.</p><p>Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.</p><p>“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"judiciary-and-rule-of-law\">Judiciary and rule of law</h2><p>The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.</p><p>The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.</p><p>Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.</p><p>The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.</p><p>While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.</p><p>The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.</p><h2 id=\"was-the-report-necessary\">Was the report necessary?</h2><p>The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.</p><p>Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.</p><p>Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.</p><p>He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.</p><p>“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.</p><p>Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.</p><p>“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120683\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120683\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP22154336836269-1763683560.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistani rickshaw drivers chant slogans during a protest against the recent increasing in petrol prices, Friday, June 3, 2022.

The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.</p><p>Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.</p><p>“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.</p><p>Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.</p><p>“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.</p><p>For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.</p><p>He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.</p><p>“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.</p><p>Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.</p><p>For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.</p><p>“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”</p><p>“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In 2022, it received approximately $44bn.</p><p>At the same time, countries on the continent spent almost $90bn servicing external debt in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-progress\">No progress</h2><p>Shortly before the release of the G20’s final communique, 165 charities condemned the group’s slow progress on debt sustainability and urged President Ramaphosa to implement reforms before transferring the G20 presidency over to the US in December.</p><p>“While this year’s G20 has been put forward as an ‘African G20’, there is no evidence that any progress has been made on the debt crisis facing Africa and many other countries worldwide during the South African presidency,” the group said in a letter.</p><p>The missive called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell its gold reserves and set up a debt relief fund for distressed governments. It also backed the creation of a ‘<a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/8/why-the-global-south-needs-a-borrowers-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">borrowers club</a>’ to facilitate cooperation among low-income countries.</p><p>The call for a unified debtor body reflects growing frustration with existing frameworks, notably the Paris Club, in which mostly Western governments, but not China, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies of debtor nations.</p><p>In May 2020, the G20 launched a multibillion-dollar repayment pause to help poor countries cope with the COVID‑19 crisis. Known as the <a href=\"/news/2020/10/12/world-bank-g20-may-agree-to-only-6-month-debt-relief-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debt Service Suspension Initiative</a>, the programme is continuing to provide relief to some participating countries.</p><p>The launch of the Common Framework, soon afterwards, was designed to coordinate debt relief among all creditors. At the time, the initiative was hailed as a breakthrough, bringing together the Paris Club, China and private creditors to help prevent a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries.</p><p>But coordinating equal treatment, including government lenders, commercial banks, and bondholders, has made the process slow and prone to setbacks.</p><p>To date, none of the countries that joined the Common Framework – Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, and Chad – have completed their debt restructuring deals.</p><p>And even then, the programme has relieved just 7 percent of the debt costs for the four participating nations, according to ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.</p><h2 id=\"outmanoeuvred\">‘Outmanoeuvred’</h2><p>In March, South Africa convened an expert panel – headed by a former finance minister and a former Kenyan central banker – to explore how to assist heavily indebted low-income countries, particularly in Africa.</p><p>In a report released earlier this month, the panel echoed many of the ideas put forward by the 165 charities that wrote to Ramaphosa in October, calling for measures like an IMF-backed special debt fund and the formation of a debtors’ club.</p><p>But the experts’ proposals “weren’t even acknowledged at the leaders’ summit”, Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, told Al Jazeera. He said that the G20 presidency “failed to address the scale of the global debt problem”.</p><p>“Ultimately,” Gallagher added, “South Africa was outmanoeuvred by larger, more economically important members of the G20 who saw little benefit to themselves in reforming the international financial architecture on debt.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"double-whammy-of-debt\">‘Double whammy’ of debt</h2><p>In the early 2000s, the IMF, World Bank and some Paris Club creditors cancelled more than $75bn of debt – roughly 40 percent of external obligations – under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.</p><p>Since then, however, many developing countries have slipped back into the red. After the 2008 financial crisis, private creditors poured money into low-income economies, steadily replacing the cheaper loans once offered by institutions like the World Bank.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, almost 40 percent of external public debt repayments from lower-income countries went to commercial lenders. Just one-third went to multilateral institutions, according to <a href=\"https://debtjustice.org.uk/press-release/debt-payments-to-private-lenders-three-times-higher-than-to-china?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Debt Justice</a>, a United Kingdom-based charity.</p><p>China has also emerged as the world’s largest single creditor, especially in the Global South, committing more than $472bn through its policy banks – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank – between 2008 and 2024.</p><p>“On top of debt becoming more expensive over the past 10 or 15 years, there is now a wider universe of lenders that developing countries have turned to,” says Iolanda Fresnillo, a policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad, a civil society organisation.</p><p>“It’s been a double whammy. Debt is now costlier and harder to resolve,” she said, noting the difficulty of coordinating creditors in a restructuring. Protracted debt crises slow growth by squeezing public investment.</p><p>Overcoming these hurdles is made harder when creditors pursue competing commercial interests. Fresnillo says an independent debt-restructuring body, designed to shorten negotiation times and limit economic costs, could help.</p><p>In September, the head of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan, said, “There is no permanent institution or system that is there all the time dealing with debt restructuring … maybe we can create new momentum.”</p><p>However, talk of an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism isn’t new. The IMF spearheaded a push for a neutral body – which would be akin to a US bankruptcy court – in the late 1990s.</p><p>The Fund’s proposed restructuring mechanism faced swift pushback. Major creditor countries, particularly the US, opposed ceding power to an international body that could override its legal system and weaken protections for US investors.</p><p>Still, “the need for this type of international solution is obvious”, says Fresnillo. “Having a basic set of rules, as opposed to an ad hoc negotiation for every new debt crisis, should be a bare minimum.”</p><p>She added that “adopting a global standard on <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taxing transnational corporations</a> could also guarantee a baseline of revenues for low-income countries. But with multilateral cooperation so weak right now, I wouldn’t hold my breath.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Monday’s <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1992999267967905905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a> came after President Donald Trump repeatedly called for criminal charges against Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers involved in the video.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Pentagon chief <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america\">Pete Hegseth</a> said later on Monday that Kelly is facing a probe because he is the only lawmaker in the video who falls under the jurisdiction of military law as a retired Navy captain.</p><p>“As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation – lending the appearance of authority to his words,” Hegseth wrote on X.</p><p>“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”</p><p>The senator was quick to respond with defiance to the Pentagon’s move.</p><p>“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly said in a statement. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”</p><p>The Pentagon had suggested that Kelly is accused of “actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.</p><p></p><p>Last week, Trump described the legislators as traitors and went as far as arguing that they should face <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/punishable-by-death-trump-threatens-democrats-with-sedition-charges\">the death penalty</a> for sedition: in other words, speech that is designed to incite a rebellion.</p><p>Kelly, a former US Navy captain who now represents Arizona in the Senate, was one of six former military and intelligence officers featured in the video, released on November 18.</p><p>“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” they said in the video.</p><p>The Pentagon stressed that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) — which spells out military laws and guidelines — service members have a legal obligation to “obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful”.</p><p>“A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it wrote in Monday’s statement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/us-sells-700m-nasams-missile-system-to-taiwan\">The Pentagon</a> added that Kelly could face recall “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures”.</p><p>Retired military personnel who continue to receive benefits after their service remain subject to military law, according to the UCMJ.</p><p>But it is rare for military courts to prosecute former service members, especially for alleged offences committed after their tenure.</p><p>In recent days, Democrats have expressed outrage over Trump’s response to the lawmakers’ videos, which they say amounts to a death threat.</p><p>Democrats have also argued that the video simply reaffirms a fact of military law: Service members are required to refuse orders they know to be in violation of the US law, as part of their oath to the Constitution.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Charlie Kirk</a> in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.</p><p>Trump first invoked the death penalty on Thursday, sparking a firestorm of criticism. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>Despite the outrage, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/trump-again-slams-democrats-who-urged-us-troops-to-refuse-illegal-orders\">Trump doubled down</a> on his stance late on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the legislators who released the video “SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW”.</p><p>The Pentagon’s move on Monday signals that federal agencies, led by Trump appointees, are willing to respond to the president’s political grievances.</p><p>The Department of Justice pursued criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey in now-dismissed cases that critics say were political.</p><p>Comey was charged with lying to Congress, while James was facing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally\">mortgage fraud accusations</a>.</p><p>Later on Monday, the White House expressed support for the Pentagon’s investigation of Kelly. “You can’t have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks. And that’s what these Democrat members were encouraging,” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And it is our position that Lindsey Halligan is extremely qualified for this position – but more importantly, was legally appointed to it.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, also said that an appeal by the Justice Department was “almost certain”.</p><p>“But for the moment, this is a victory for James Comey and also a victory for Letitia James, and a defeat for Donald Trump and his Department of Justice”.</p><h2 id=\"a-controversial-choice-as-prosecutor\">A controversial choice as prosecutor</h2><p>Halligan had been appointed in September to serve as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>Trump had a public falling-out with Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to file charges against James due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>That triggered outrage in the White House. Siebert announced his resignation on September 19, and the following day, Trump took to social media to declare that he had fired the prosecutor himself.</p><p>“He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”</p><p>The president also addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi in the message, saying that the Department of Justice needed to move forward with charges against James, Comey and a US senator, Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote.</p><p>He urged Bondi to act immediately to secure indictments, signalling that Halligan would help.</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p><p>Before her appointment, Halligan had no prosecutorial experience, and her background was largely in insurance law. Previously, she served as a personal lawyer to Trump.</p><p>Within days of taking up her role as US attorney, Halligan had secured <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/ex-fbi-director-comey-says-he-is-innocent-after-us-court-indictment\">an indictment against Comey</a> for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a Senate proceeding.</p><p>Then, on October 6, Halligan unveiled a second indictment against James, accusing her of mortgage fraud.</p><p>A third indictment arrived on October 16, this time against Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.</p><p>All three have denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges were acts of political retribution. Comey, James and Bolton have all criticised Trump publicly, and James even successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump in New York state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"comey-james-seek-dismissal\">Comey, James seek dismissal</h2><p>Lawyers for the defendants have explored multiple channels to have the cases dismissed before trial.</p><p>On November 13, Judge Currie heard opening arguments in one petition brought by James and Comey.</p><p>They asserted that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid, since she did not have judicial approval.</p><p>Normally, interim US attorneys may only stay in the position for a span of 120 days. After that period, federal judges in the district may decide who fills the role.</p><p>Siebert had served for a 120-day period and had gotten judicial permission to continue as acting US attorney until the Senate could confirm a permanent occupant for the role.</p><p>But Halligan did not have the judges’ approval. That made her appointment as US attorney illegal, according to lawyers for Comey and James.</p><p>Lawyers for the Justice Department, however, argued that the issue amounted to a mere “paperwork error” – and that Attorney General Bondi had signed off on the indictments.</p><p>Still, the hearings in Currie’s courtroom raised serious questions about the validity of the indictments.</p><p>Currie raised concerns that the grand jury transcript in Comey’s case was incomplete, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment\">an issue later echoed</a> by Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in a separate ruling on November 17.</p><p>He said the records indicate “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”, including misleading statements from the prosecutor and the use of an unrelated search warrant. He also pointed out that it seemed the final indictment against Comey had never been fully presented to the grand jury, as required.</p><p>In another courtroom last week, overseen by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/justice-department-admits-grand-jury-did-not-review-final-comey-indictment\">Justice Department acknowledged</a> that it had indeed failed to give the grand jury a chance to review the final Comey indictment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Another 236 applications from Myanmar were pending as of November 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce immigration into the US.</p><p>It has therefore attempted to rescind Temporary Protected Status for several groups, including citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela and other countries facing instability.</p><p>Just last Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115590786862216464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on his platform Truth Social that he was “hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota”, accusing gangs of Somali nationals of “terrorizing” the state.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Legal experts, however, question whether a president can revoke Temporary Protected Status from a specific group in a specific state. Some have accused Trump of attempting to intimidate immigrants, in order to force them to leave the country.</p><p>Under Trump, the federal government has also restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">its cap on refugee admissions to 7,500</a>, a historic low.</p><p>In addition, the Trump administration has sought to strip hundreds of thousands of immigrants of another temporary protection called “humanitarian parole”. That programme allows immigrants to come into the country on a short-term basis due to emergency situations or humanitarian concerns.</p><p>Several of those efforts face ongoing legal challenges. So far, however, the Supreme Court has largely sided with the Trump administration.</p><p>In an unsigned May 30 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1079_p86b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a>, for instance, a majority on the high court lifted a lower court’s ruling that had barred the Department of Homeland Security from ending humanitarian parole for nearly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.</p><p>Two left-leaning justices — Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor — issued a dissent, warning that removing the pause would cause great harm to US immigrants while the legal challenge proceeds.</p><p>The decision, Brown Jackson wrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unrest-in-myanmar\">Unrest in Myanmar</h2><p>In the case of Myanmar, the Department of State has issued a level-four travel advisory — the highest tier — warning against transit through the country.</p><p>It cited the risk of “armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions”.</p><p>In February 2021, the military toppled the government of President Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country has grappled with civil war ever since, marking the latest chapter in a nearly eight decades of internal unrest.</p><p>The military leadership is locked in a fight with members of the exiled government as well as armed ethnic groups and civilian opposition groups.</p><p>It has led a campaign of heavy air strikes, some of which reportedly targeted schools and hospitals. Both rebels and soldiers have been accused of human rights abuses, including torture.</p><p>The United Nations estimates the long-running conflict has created nearly 1,585,298 asylum seekers and refugees as of October, with many seeking protection in nearby countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.</p><p>Members of the persecuted Rohingya ethnic group have been rendered stateless amid the fighting.</p><p>Citizens from Myanmar were initially given Temporary Protected Status in the US under former President Joe Biden in May 2021.</p><p>The administration then extended the protection designation twice: once in September 2022 and again in May 2024. The latest 18-month extension was slated to expire on Tuesday, November 25.</p><p>The termination of the Temporary Protected Status will take effect 60 days after the Federal Register notice is officially published.</p><p>In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Noem had deemed conditions in the country sufficiently safe for its citizens to return.</p><p>“Burma [Myanmar] continues to face humanitarian challenges due in part to continued military operations against armed resistance and the need for humanitarian assistance,” the notice said.</p><p>“There have, however, been improvements in Burma’s governance and stability at the national and local levels.”</p><p>The notice added that allowing Myanmar citizens to stay ran “contrary to the U.S. national interest”.</p><p>In March, the Department of Homeland Security told Congress that 9,590 Myanmar citizens were eligible for the protection, but had yet to apply.</p><p>Just this month, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/21-dead-search-continues-after-refugee-boat-sinks-near-malaysia-thailand\">another boat sank off</a> the Myanmar shore, as Rohingya refugees attempted to flee to safety.
