Right now, Israel, Iran and the US are on a path to potential conflict.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Abdi echoed that assessment. “This action reinforces every doubt and suspicion about US intentions, and gives more credence to those in Iran who say engaging the US is useless and [that] developing a nuclear deterrent is vital,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"iran-venezuela-alliance\">Iran-Venezuela alliance</h2><p>The US raid that abducted Maduro and brought him to the US came after months of intensifying rhetoric from Trump against the Venezuelan government.</p><p>US officials have accused Maduro of leading a drug organisation, and Trump and his aides have been <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">increasingly arguing</a> that Washington is entitled to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also been emphasising Maduro’s ties to Iran, accusing Caracas, without evidence, of providing the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah a foothold in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Maduro is a close ally of Iran, and the two <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-issues-iran-venezuela-sanctions-over-alleged-drone-trade\">heavily sanctioned</a> countries have been pushing to deepen their trade ties, which are estimated to be in the billions of dollars.</p><p>So, with Maduro gone, Iran’s small network of allies may shrink further, after the fall of leader Bashar al-Assad in Syria and the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/hezbollah-weapons-deadline-whats-next-for-lebanon-amid-israeli-strikes\">weakening of Hezbollah</a> in Lebanon.</p><p>The Iranian government was quick to condemn the US attack on Venezuela, calling on the United Nations to intervene and halt the “unlawful aggression”.</p><p>“The US military aggression against an independent state that is a member of the UN represents a grave breach of regional and international peace and security,” the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p><p>“Its consequences affect the entire international system and will further expose the UN Charter-based order to erosion and destruction.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Saturday, Rubio suggested that Maduro’s abduction carried a message to all of Washington’s rivals in the Trump era.</p><p>“​​When he tells you that he’s going to do something, when he tells you he’s going to address a problem, he means it,” the top US diplomat told reporters.</p><p>But Iranian Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/irans-khamenei-says-rioters-must-be-put-in-their-place-amid-protests\">Ali Khamenei</a> doubled down on his defiant rhetoric after the US raid in Caracas.</p><p>“We will not give in to the enemy,” Khamenei wrote in a social media post. “We will bring the enemy to its knees.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-threats\">Trump’s threats</h2><p>Last week, Trump hosted Netanyahu in Florida and threatened to bomb Iran again if the country rebuilds its missile or nuclear programmes.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said. “We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them.”</p><p>Israel launched a <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/16/iranians-flee-israeli-attack-in-tehran\">war against Iran</a> in June, killing the country’s top military commanders, several nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>The US joined in the attack, bombing Iran’s three main nuclear sites.</p><p>While Trump has often reiterated that the US strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme and celebrated the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/trump-says-he-was-very-much-in-charge-of-israels-june-13-attack-on-iran\">war as a success</a>, the Iranian governing system survived the assault.</p><p>Tehran responded with barrages of hundreds of rockets against Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s multi-layered air defences, and Iranian forces were able to keep firing until the final moments of the war, before the ceasefire came into effect.</p><p>Some critics argue that regime change was and remains Israel’s goal in Iran, and Trump appears to be increasingly buying into that objective.</p><p>On Friday, Trump warned that the US is “locked and loaded” and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/trump-and-top-iranian-official-exchange-threats-over-protests-in-iran\">ready to attack</a> Iran if the Iranian government kills protesters amid the ongoing but sporadic antigovernment demonstrations across the country.</p><p>He renewed the same threat late on Sunday. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” the US president said.</p><p>So, could the US carry out a Venezuela-style government decapitation in Iran?</p><p>NIAC’s Abdi noted that Israel has already tried to kill the country’s top leaders, including President <a href=\"/news/2025/7/13/iranian-president-lightly-wounded-while-escaping-israeli-attack\">Masoud Pezeshkian</a>, in June.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump also repeatedly threatened Khamenei with assassination, and Israeli officials confirmed <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/we-wanted-to-eliminate-khamenei-israels-defence-minister\">that they sought</a> to “eliminate” the supreme leader during the war.</p><p>“Iranian officials have said they accordingly have plans in place so that killing or removing senior leaders does not paralyse or topple the regime,” Abdi said.</p><p>“It would be far messier to run a ‘snatch and grab’ operation on Iran, given their ability to retaliate against US interests and personnel.”</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-without-maduro\">Venezuela without Maduro</h2><p>Even in Venezuela, removing Maduro has not translated into a regime collapse, at least for now.</p><p>On Sunday, Vice President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, now Venezuela’s acting president, stressed that Maduro remains the country’s only leader and condemned the US attack.</p><p>She also suggested that Israel was involved in the abduction of Maduro, a vocal critic of the US ally.</p><p>“Governments around the world are shocked that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has become the victim and target of an attack of this nature, which undoubtedly has Zionist undertones,” Rodriguez said.</p><p>Trump responded by threatening the acting Venezuelan president, telling The Atlantic magazine that she would pay a “very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she did not acquiesce to US demands.</p><p>So, the US president’s plans for “running” Venezuela and taking its oil are not complete yet, and will likely require more military action.</p><p>“I doubt Venezuela can be a ‘one and done’ or a quick ‘in and out’ situation, which is Trump’s favourite model. His brand is that he engages in quick shows of force, not forever wars,” Mortazavi said.</p><p>She cited swift operations that Trump has ordered, including the killing of ISIL (ISIS) leader <a href=\"/news/2019/10/27/us-targeted-isil-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-us-officials\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> in 2019, the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020, and the attack on Iran’s nuclear sites in June.</p><p>“Most Americans are tired of forever wars, especially in the Middle East, so the Trump administration knows they can’t sell more forever wars to Americans,” Mortazavi said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump has already floated the prospect of a ground invasion of Venezuela.</p><p>“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We don’t mind saying it, but we’re going to make sure that that country is run properly. We’re not doing this in vain.”</p><p>Abdi said that a long-term US involvement in Venezuela could indirectly stave off war with Iran.</p><p>“There is also the possibility that the US gets bogged down in ‘running’ Venezuela and doesn’t have the bandwidth to wage, or to support Israel launching, the next Iran war,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Iran was next on the menu after the US invaded Iraq in 2003, and we know what happened there, and Trump may not <a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">want to pronounce</a> ‘mission accomplished’ just yet.”</p><h2 id=\"the-oil-question\">The oil question</h2><p>Still, some critics – including Republican US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – have argued that if the US succeeds in controlling Venezuela’s oil resources, it will be able to offset energy market disruptions from a possible war with Iran.</p><p>“The next obvious observation is that, by removing Maduro, this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran,” Greene wrote on X on Saturday.</p><p>About 20 percent of the world’s oil flows through the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\">Strait of Hormuz</a>, which Iran may push to shut down in the case of an all-out war.</p><p>Abdi said that Venezuelan oil “could theoretically provide some cushion” to the loss of exports from the Gulf region.</p><p>“But this would mean a lot of things going right for the US in Venezuela, and it is probably far too soon to make that judgement,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Let me tell you,” Trump said, referring to Petro.</p><p>When asked if he meant an operation by the US on Colombia, Trump said, “Sounds good to me.”</p><p>The comments prompted an immediate backlash from Petro, who called on all countries in Latin America to unite or face being “treated as a servant and slave”.</p><p>“The US is the first country in the world to bomb a South American capital in all of human history,” he wrote in a lengthy post on X. “The wound remains open for a long time,” he said, but revenge was not the answer.</p><p>Latin America must unite, Petro said, and become a region “with the capacity to understand, trade, and join together with the whole world” and one that does not look “only to the north but in all directions”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"warnings-to-venezuela-mexico\">Warnings to Venezuela, Mexico</h2><p>Trump’s comments came a day after US forces abducted and detained  Maduro and his wife in a surprise attack on Caracas. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are due to appear in court on drug-related charges in New York on Monday.</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also insisted that the US was “in charge” of Venezuela, even though the country’s Supreme Court has appointed Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as interim leader.</p><p>He also reiterated a threat to send the US military back to Venezuela if it “doesn’t behave”.</p><p>He said “a lot of Cubans” were killed in the US raid on Venezuela, and added that military intervention in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/cuba-says-32-cubans-killed-during-us-raids-on-venezuela\">Cuba</a> was unlikely because the island appears to be ready to fall on its own.</p><p>“Cuba is ready to fall. Cuba looks like it’s ready to fall. I don’t know how they, if they, can hold that, but Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil,” Trump said.</p><p>“They’re not getting any of it. Cuba literally is ready to fall. And you have a lot of great Cuban Americans that are going to be very happy about this.”</p><p>The US president went on to warn neighbouring Mexico, saying the country “has to get their act together because they’re [drugs] pouring through Mexico and we’re going to have to do something”.</p><p>He described Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as a “terrific person” and said he has offered to send US troops to Mexico every time he spoke to her. The Mexican government is capable of addressing the issue, “but unfortunately the cartels are very strong in Mexico,” he said.</p><p>“The cartels are running Mexico whether you like it or not,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"don-roe-doctrine\">‘Don-roe Doctrine’</h2><p>Al Jazeera’s John Holman, reporting from Cucuta on the Colombia-Venezuela border, said the comments came amid a “bigger pattern” of Trump targeting left-leaning countries in Latin America and trying to assert US dominance in the region.</p><p>“He’s saying that Latin America is our area, and we need to be dominant there and after what’s happened with Nicolas Maduro, those threats and comments are going to be taken a bit more seriously,” Holman said.</p><p>Trump has made no secret of his ambitions to expand the US presence in the Western Hemisphere and revive the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which states that Latin America falls under the US sphere of influence.</p><p>Trump has called his 21st century version the “Don-roe Doctrine”.</p><p>The US president’s comments on Sunday were not his first threats against Colombia and Cuba.</p><p>Following the US actions over the weekend, Trump said that Petro has to “watch his a**” and that the political situation in Cuba was “something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation”.</p><p>Experts told Al Jazeera it was too soon to tell whether Trump would make good on his threats to Cuba and Colombia, or whether he was aiming to coerce them into cooperating with Washington</p><p>“It’s very hard to predict. If you look at the way Trump operates, what he always hopes is other countries will do what he wants them to do without him having to use very much force. These short, spectacular displays of force like the bombing in Iran, this operation in Venezuela scare other countries into doing what Trump wants them to do,” said David Smith, an associate professor of the University of Sydney’s US Studies Centre.</p><p>“Maduro seems to have tried to call his bluff in this case, and it turned out it wasn’t a bluff,” Smith told Al Jazeera. “They don’t know whether he’s bluffing now when he makes threats towards other countries, or renewed threats towards Venezuela.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The missile appears to be the Hwasong-11, which was showcased at a parade in October, Hong said, citing his analysis of images ‌published in state media reports.</p><p>Hong added that the Kim government is emphasising its ability to launch such missiles at any time, an ‍effort to complicate US-South Korea’s missile defence system and prevent its preemptive interception.</p><p>The possession of a functioning hypersonic weapon would give North Korea the ability to penetrate the US and South Korea’s missile defence shields. In past years, North Korea has performed a series of tests to acquire it, but many foreign experts question whether the tested missiles have achieved their desired speed and maneuverability during flights.</p><p>In recent weeks, North Korea has test-fired what it called long-range strategic cruise missiles and new anti-air missiles. It has also released photos showing apparent progress in the construction of its first nuclear-powered submarine.</p><p>Observers say North Korea aims to demonstrate or review its achievements in the weapons development sector ahead of the ruling Workers’ Party Congress, the first of its kind in five years. Keen attention is on whether Kim would use the congress to set a new approach to relations with the US and resume long-dormant talks.</p><p>Separately, North Korea’s nuclear programme is expected to be discussed when Lee and Xi meet for a summit later on Monday.</p><p>Lee’s office earlier said he would call for China, North Korea’s major ally and economic pipeline, to take “a constructive role” in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So again, I’m against it,” said one protester named Niven.</p><p>Trump on Saturday delivered a speech in which he made little mention of the so-called “war on drugs” – which for months had been his main justification for <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/trump-bombs-venezuelan-land-for-first-time-is-war-imminent\">bombing Venezuelan ship and assets</a> – but argued that Venezuela had “stolen” oil from the US and that it would now be taken back.</p><p>The United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Saul, said the US actions in Venezuela were illegal, calling on Trump to be investigated and impeached. “Every Venezuelan life lost is a violation of the right to life. President Trump should be impeached and investigated for the alleged killings,” he said in a social media post.</p><p>The UN Security Council (UNSC) was set to meet on Monday to discuss the situation in Venezuela. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed” by the US strikes, which a spokesperson said could “constitute a dangerous precedent”.</p><h2 id=\"uncertainty-in-venezuela-after-maduro-s-abduction\">Uncertainty in Venezuela after Maduro’s abduction</h2><p>Some Venezuelans in Caracas have welcomed the US’s seizure of Maduro, but others said the action could worsen conflict in the country, with protests denouncing the US taking place.</p><p>“There should be a positive change for all Venezuelans, because it has been 28 years of government, and now is the time for transition in this country,” said Ronald Gaulee, a motorcycle rider in Caracas.</p><p>Merchant Juan Carlos Rincon was more cautious. “The truth is that there is a lot of manipulation behind all this,” he told the Reuters news agency. “We want to be at peace, move forward, and for Venezuela to have, like any other country, the right to choose its own destiny and its own leaders.”</p><p>Baker Franklin Jimenez said he would heed the government’s call to defend the country. “If they took him away, I think they shouldn’t have done so, because this will create an even worse conflict than the one we have now,” he said. “And as for the bombings and all that, we have to go out, we all have to go out into the streets to defend our homeland, to defend ourselves.”</p><p>Some Venezuelans decided to flee the country amid the uncertainty, crossing the Venezuela-Colombia border to reach the Colombian town of Cucuta. Karina Rey described a “tense situation” in the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal, just across the border.</p><p>“There are long lines, and people are very paranoid, or on edge, over food. Supermarkets are closing,” Rey told Al Jazeera. “The lines are very long just to stock up on food, because we don’t know what will happen in the coming weeks. We’re waiting to see what happens.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti, reporting from Cucuta, said many Venezuelans there initially felt jubilant after Maduro was ousted. “But that quickly shifted to uncertainty,” he said.</p><p>“Several people said they expected the United States to immediately bring opposition leader Maria Corina Machado back into the country, along with Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who many Venezuelans believe won the last presidential election,” Rampietti continued.</p><p>“Instead, with much of the existing leadership still in place and with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez appointed as interim leader, there is growing fear about what could happen next.”</p><p>Tiziano Breda, a senior analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, said what happens next hinges on the response of Venezuela’s government and armed forces.</p><p>“So far, they’ve avoided direct confrontation with US forces, but deployments on the streets point to efforts to contain unrest,” he said. “A smooth transition remains unlikely, and the risk of resistance from pro-regime armed groups – including elements within the military and Colombian rebel networks active in the country – remains high.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The weight of uncertainty brought the city to a sombre pause, one that closed in on him and felt unlike anything he had experienced before.</p><p>“It’s like being in a field with nothing else around. It’s a mournful silence; I can’t describe it,” he said.</p><p>That uncertainty was felt by many Venezuelans on Sunday morning.</p><p>Venezuela has had a socialist government since 1999, first under President Hugo Chavez and later Maduro, a period that began with oil-funded social programmes but unravelled into economic mismanagement, corruption and repression – with international sanctions further squeezing the population.</p><p>Momentum around the 2024 presidential election raised hopes that the opposition alliance would take control. But when Maduro declared victory, despite opposition claims of a landslide win for <a href=\"/news/2024/11/19/us-recognises-venezuelan-opposition-leader-gonzalez-as-president-elect\">Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia</a>, a crackdown on dissent followed. It left many Venezuelans concluding that any real transition might depend on pressure — or even intervention — from outside the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deathly-silence\">‘Deathly silence’</h2><p>In southeastern Caracas on Saturday, 54-year-old Edward Ocariz was jolted awake by a loud crash and the vibrating windows of his home near the Fort Tiuna military barracks. He thought it was an earthquake, but when he looked outside, he saw unfamiliar helicopters flying low above smoke rising in the city.</p><p>“The noise kept coming,” he said. “I could immediately tell the helicopters were not Venezuelan because I had never seen them here.”</p><p>Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.</p><p>“There was a deathly silence,” Ocariz said, adding that the brief suspension of mobile phone services and power outages contributed to the silence. “We were waiting to understand what was happening.”</p><p>Fear accompanied the fragments of information that did manage to seep through, Ocariz said. “But it was a fear mixed with joy – tremendous joy. It’s hard to explain.”</p><p>On Sunday, when images of a blindfolded and handcuffed Maduro began circulating, Ocariz reflected on the suffering he had endured under the president’s regime.</p><p>The human rights activist said he was wrongfully charged with “terrorism” and spent nearly five months as a political prisoner in Tocuyito prison, a maximum-security facility in Carabobo state.</p><p>Under Maduro, the country had a long history of jailing those who dissent. After the disputed 2024 election, nearly 2,500 protesters, human rights activists, journalists and opposition figures were arrested. While some were later released, others remain behind bars.</p><p>“I felt satisfied. A process of justice is finally beginning,” Ocariz said, fully aware that Maduro will not have to endure the dire prison conditions he did, or be denied food and legal representation.</p><p>Despite the joy he and other Venezuelans now feel, Ocariz warns that much remains to be done.</p><p>“The population still feels a huge amount of fear [from the authorities] — psychological fear — because it’s well known how the police and justice system use their power to criminalise whoever they choose.”</p><p>So far, key institutions remain in the hands of figures from Nicolas Maduro’s inner circle, including Vice President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, who has been named acting president.</p><p>But for many Venezuelans — including Castro and Ocariz — seeing a senior Chavista figure still in power is unsettling, particularly as the Trump administration continues to engage with her.</p><p>“It is certainly frustrating for me. However, I understand that Venezuela needs to continue with its administrative, functional, and operational management as a country, as a nation,” Ocariz said, adding that the US must maintain some order to control the power vacuum and stamp out repression.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-US-Venezuela-relations-in-2025-JAN-4-2026-1767520761.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - US-Venezuela relations in 2025 - JAN 4, 2026-1767520761\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"economic-concerns\">Economic concerns</h2><p>Venezuela remains heavily militarised, and fears of further unrest linger.

Under Maduro, he has long struggled to afford basic items.</p><p>“People in the street were going crazy yesterday,” he said. “Everyone was buying food with half of what they had in their bank accounts, buying what they could, because we don’t know what the future holds.”</p><p>The scenes brought back memories of the shortages of 2016, when hyperinflation and scarcity plunged the country into crisis, forcing people to queue for hours and rush between shops with limits on how much each person could buy.</p><p>But a day after the attack, Castro said Venezuelans are reflecting on the future of their country and the uncertainty of that future.</p><p>“There’s happiness, there’s fear, there’s gratitude, there’s the ‘what will happen next?’” he said. “For my next birthday, I want total freedom for Venezuela – and hopefully, God willing, we will have it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also declined to endorse the opposition leader, exiled Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, saying she does not have the approval or “respect” of the people.</p><p>What the US wants from Rodriguez is likely to revolve around Venezuela’s oil, which Trump and other US officials have characterised as US oil – based on the South American country’s nationalisation of its oil industry between the 1970s and the 2000s, forcing most US oil companies out.</p><p>“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights, they took all of our oil from not that long ago. And we want it back,” said Trump in December.</p><p>In his typically forthright manner, Trump has also said that Venezuela’s oil reserves would cover any costs the US incurs from its attack on the country, and “the damages” allegedly caused by Venezuela to the US.</p><p>Oil is vital to Venezuela, and the US had used its importance to pressure the country prior to the abduction of Maduro.</p><p>US sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil have been a core element of US policy toward Venezuela since 2017, especially under combined Trump-era directives. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) is blacklisted, and Washington has taken measures restricting the shipment of diluents that are needed for heavy crude.</p><p>A host of oil traders, companies and ships that transport the goods have been sanctioned, including last month, while Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters, which led to at least two tankers being confiscated.</p><p>US sanctions and pressure are some of the main reasons why Venezuela’s oil exports are not comparable to the country’s oil reserves.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil exports averaged about a meager 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and the US “oil embargo” knocked them down to around 500,000 bpd last month, according to preliminary figures based on ship movements.</p><p>In comparison, major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia export millions of barrels per day on average.</p><p>Francisco Rodriguez, the former head of the economic advisory of the Venezuelan National Assembly, said gold and oil reserves are among the country’s main hopes for economic recovery.</p><p>“If the US moves to remove the sanctions and clear the hurdles for investors to come back in, you can get the oil output to 2.5 million barrels per day in the scope of three to five years,” he told Al Jazeera from the US state of Colorado, pointing out that production currently stands at below one million barrels per day.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“I think what the Trump administration is saying is that we need to prioritise the recovery of the oil sector and get the economy on a manageable basis so that we think about more orderly political transition,” the former official said.</p><p>“But if you try to directly hand over the power to the opposition right now without having set the basis for economic recovery, that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to chaos.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-opec-and-others\">What does this mean for OPEC and others?</h2><p>At least in the short term, the Venezuela developments do not mean a major change for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But things could drastically change with time.</p><p>Venezuela cannot quickly raise production due to its ageing infrastructure, and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-seizes-second-oil-vessel-off-venezuela-coast-officials-say\">unilateral US seizures of tankers</a> near Venezuela’s waters only led to an uptick in oil prices before another stabilisation.</p><p data-start=\"480\" data-end=\"636\">Venezuela’s upstream oil infrastructure, particularly under PDVSA, has suffered from more than a decade of underinvestment, so some wells are mechanically compromised, restarting shut-in wells often requires full workovers or redrilling, not simple reactivation, and routine preventive maintenance largely ceased after the US embargoes.</p><p data-start=\"640\" data-end=\"767\">The crude cannot flow or be exported without diluents, which are being blocked by the US, while storage, blending, and upgrading facilities are bottlenecked, with many operating well below nominal capacity.</p><p>But theoretically, if a US-directed Venezuela manages to rapidly boost output in the future, OPEC will face a supply glut or will have to adjust quotas. This would give Washington indirect but major influence inside the group and over global supply, disrupting the delicate balance members have been trying to keep for years.</p><p>West Asia neighbours like Iran and Saudi Arabia are also directly affected if Caracas leans towards the US in the long term.</p><p>The anti-US and Israel establishment in Iran has lost another major ally in Maduro, after the fall of top leaders of the <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">Tehran-backed “axis of resistance”</a> over the past two years.</p><p>Iran has also been hampered in efforts to develop its oil sector due to stringent Western sanctions, and like Venezuela under Maduro, Iran sends most of its oil at heavily discounted prices through a shadow fleet of ships to China. A robust return of Venezuelan oil to the market would further undermine Iranian oil.</p><p>Saudi Arabia was not a close ally of the Maduro establishment like Iran, but it also risks future oversupply that may push global prices down if Venezuela makes a comeback. That may force Riyadh to cut production and weaken its price leadership in the global market.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Military campaigns were inseparable from missionary efforts as conversion to Christianity became both a justification for empire and a tool of control. Faith and force advanced together, reshaping societies across the Americas.</p><p>Through the conquests of the Aztec and Incan empires, the documentary shows how Spanish power was established through violence, alliances and religious authority. The mission system spread across the Americas, reorganising Indigenous life around churches, labour regimes and colonial administration. Conversion promised salvation but enforced obedience and cultural destruction.</p><p>The film also examines the economic foundations of Spanish imperial power. Vast quantities of gold and silver were extracted from the Americas alongside the exploitation of Indigenous and enslaved labour. These resources fuelled European economies, financed global trade and helped integrate the Americas into an emerging world system built on extraction and inequality.</p><p>By tracing how faith, conquest and wealth operated together, the documentary reveals how Spanish colonialism shaped global capitalism, religious power and imperial governance. It shows how the legacies of conquest, forced conversion and resource extraction continue to influence social inequality, cultural identity and economic structures in the modern world and how current global superpowers like the United States and China adopt this model to their benefit. It also draws on the parallels between the erasure of cultural artefacts then and today’s “algorithmic colonisation”.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 4 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">4 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

How did he come to lead Venezuela? And how did he end up abducted by the US? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"maduro-s-early-life\">Maduro’s early life</h2><p>Maduro was born in a working-class family on November 23, 1962, in the El Valle neighbourhood of Caracas.</p><p>His parents are Nicolas Maduro Garcia, a trade union leader, and Teresa de Jesus Moros, who also had three daughters together: Maria Teresa, Josefina, and Anita Maduro.</p><p>Maduro was raised under the significant influence of his father’s politics.</p><p>Maduro once shared that his grandparents were of Sephardic Jewish descent, and converted to Catholicism upon arriving in Venezuela.</p><p>Growing up, Maduro was a fan of Western rock music and often quoted artists including John Lennon.</p><p>He attended a public high school, the Liceo Jose Avalos, in El Valle, where he was involved in student politics and reportedly served as the student union president; however, there are no records that show he graduated.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rise-to-power\">Rise to power</h2><p>Maduro’s political rise began in organised labour.</p><p>He is believed to have joined the Socialist League of Venezuela, a Marxist-Leninist party, in the early 1980s.</p><p>At the age of 24, in 1986, Maduro was sent as a representative of the Socialist League to Cuba for a year of political training at<span> the Escuela Nacional de Cuadros Julio Antonio Mella, run by the Union of Young Communists (UJC).</span></p><p>Upon his return, he started working as a bus driver in Caracas city’s metro system, and then founded and led the SITRAMECA, or Sindicato de Trabajadores y Trabajadoras del Metro de Caracas, in 1991.</p><p>Maduro became active in the transport workers’ union during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and founded one of the company’s first informal labour syndicates, gradually entering the power centres through union politics.</p><p>A 2006 cable from the US Embassy in Caracas, made public by WikiLeaks, noted that Maduro was on the national committee of the Socialist League and he “reportedly turned down a baseball contract from a U.S. Major League Baseball scout.”</p><p>He was moved by the leadership of Hugo Chavez, a Venezuelan lieutenant colonel who led the armed Bolivarian movement rebelling against the so-called “Puntofijismo” system, Venezuela’s two-party democracy system, and the sitting President Carlos Andres Perez, citing corruption.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the early 1990s, Maduro joined MBR-200, the civilian wing of the movement, and later continued to campaign for Chavez’s release after he was jailed for the failed 1992 coup.</p><p>Maduro met his future wife, Cilia Flores, when she headed the legal team that won freedom for Chavez in 1994.</p><p>After Chavez was pardoned and released, Maduro joined the Movement of the Fifth Republic, a socialist political party, in 1997 to run in the 1998 elections. Maduro was elected to the National Constituent Assembly while Chavez won the presidency.</p><p>Maduro was close to Chavez during the drafting of a new constitution in 1999, and after six years in office, he was designated the<span> minister of foreign affairs. In October 2012, Maduro became vice president of Venezuela amid the rapidly deteriorating health of Chavez.</span></p><h2 id=\"consolidation-of-power-in-caracas\">Consolidation of power in Caracas</h2><p>In December 2012, as the charismatic Chavez fell ill and was flying to Cuba for cancer treatment, he anointed Maduro, then the vice president, as his political successor in a televised address.</p><p>In elections after Chavez’s death, Maduro won by a slim margin in April 2013.</p><p>He began his presidency by expelling US diplomats, calling them “historical enemies” and accusing them of poisoning Chavez.

Maduro cracked down on them, killing at least 43 protestors.</p><p>Facing increasing opposition pressure and plummeting popularity, Maduro established a pro-government constituent assembly in 2017 to neutralise the legislature, now controlled by the opposition. Another round of protests and further crackdown followed, with Venezuelan forces killing more than 100 people.</p><p>All the while, the economy tanked, with Venezuela’s nearly 30 million population facing shortages of essentials, and oil production dropping to margins.</p><p>In the next election in 2018, Maduro was declared the winner unopposed, but 45 countries, including the US, did not recognise him, and he jailed some opposition leaders and forced others into exile.</p><p>In 2024, Maduro was again chosen the winner in the presidential election, widely seen as non-transparent, with the election council failing to show the tally sheets. More mass protests followed, met with a harsh crackdown.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4213603\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213603\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213603\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-07-25T110051Z_870521246_RC2W1Y9PYO1D_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ELECTION-MADURO-PROFILE-1767513250.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C534&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4213603\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro gestures during an event in Caracas, Venezuela, December 8, 2022  [Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-did-trump-decide-he-needed-to-remove-maduro\">Why did Trump decide he needed to remove Maduro?</h2><p>After US President Trump returned to office for a second term in January last year, he upped the ante against the Venezuelan leader.</p><p>The Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on Caracas, doubled the bounty on Maduro, and imposed sanctions on his family members.</p><p>Since September, US forces have conducted strikes on vessels off the Venezuelan coast, which the White House alleges were involved in “narco-terrorism”.</p><p>Saturday came the tipping point, when Maduro and his wife were abducted by US special forces and taken to the US to face trial on charges brought against them in the US.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4213600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4213600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4213600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2018-08-04T232211Z_1404503989_RC1198793F00_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-MADURO-1767513238.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C460&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4213600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro attends a military event in Caracas on August 4, 2018 [Miraflores Palace/Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Return of the mac.”</p><p>“Been away for a while but I’m back now, 37 years old and still punching,” he said. “Nothing better to do than punch men in the face and get paid for it.”</p><p>Before his two bouts with Usyk, Fury was unbeaten in 35 fights, winning 34 and drawing one.</p><p>Fury did not mention potential opponents, but his announcement comes after increased speculation about a clash with British rival Joshua in 2026. Joshua, who is also a former world champion, last month knocked out YouTube star Jake Paul. But he was injured in a fatal car crash that killed two of his friends in Nigeria this week, which has resulted in uncertainty over his immediate plans.</p><p>Fury is a two-time world champion. He ended the reign of Wladimir Klitschko with a points win in 2015 that saw him crowned Super WBA, IBF and WBO champion.</p><p>He didn’t fight again until 2018 – but a thrilling trilogy with American Deontay Wilder resulted in a draw and two victories for him to claim the WBC title.</p><p>Fury previously said he was retiring after he beat Dillian Whyte in 2022, but was back in the ring the following year.</p><p>A fight with Joshua has long been anticipated.
