The convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Epstein <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">died by suicide</a> in a United States prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2021, Giuffre sued Mountbatten-Windsor for sexual assault. She claimed she had been forced to have sex with him on multiple occasions when she was 17, a minor under US law. Giuffre <a href=\"/news/2025/4/26/epstein-prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-by-suicide-family\">died by suicide</a> in April last year after reaching a settlement in this case.</p><p>When he was still a prince, Mountbatten-Windsor served as the UK’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, only stepping down when controversy over his links to Epstein intensified. Throughout his time in the role, he faced persistent criticism over his “party prince” image, his conduct on overseas trips, and the cost of his lavish taxpayer‑funded trips and hospitality.</p><p>But Mountbatten-Windsor is far from the first British royal to be engulfed in scandal. In 1936, the monarchy was rocked when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II largely kept the institution steady in the early decades of her reign, but as her children reached adulthood, a new wave of marital crises and personal controversies engulfed the family.</p><p>Here is a closer look at some of the major scandals to have roiled the royals and their reputation in recent decades.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1992-queen-elizabeth-s-annus-horribilis\">1992: Queen Elizabeth’s ‘annus horribilis’</h2><p>During a speech to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession in November 1992, Queen Elizabeth II described the year as her “annus horribilis”, which is Latin for “horrible year”, following a series of scandals.</p><p>Three of her children’s marriages had failed: Then‑Prince of Wales – now King – Charles and Princess Diana separated, as did Mountbatten-Windsor and his wife, Sarah Ferguson. Princess Anne and Mark Phillips got divorced.</p><p>In August 1992, while separated but still married to Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson was photographed on holiday in the south of France with her American financial adviser John Bryan. Bryan was seen kissing her toes, much to the uproar of the general public.</p><p>The same year, a phone call between Diana and her friend, James Gilbey, was leaked and became tabloid fodder. It was believed that the call had been illegally recorded and sold to the media. The intimate and emotional nature of the call led to speculation that Gilbey and Diana were more than friends. On the call, Gilbey called Diana “Squidgy”, and hence the incident became known as “Squidgygate”.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4324805\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"1993-camillagate\">1993: Camillagate</h2><p>An end to the Queen’s “annus horribilis” was not to be.</p><p>Soon after Squidgygate came “Camillagate”. In 1993, the recording of a salacious phone call between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was leaked. The call was from 1989 when Charles and Diana were still married and revealed that Charles and Camilla were in an intimate relationship.</p><p>Public anger over the affair endured for years, but Charles and Camilla eventually married in 2005 and remain married today, with Camilla now serving as Queen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326526\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326526\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-618251936-1771588406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C611&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Charles and Camilla 2005\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles attend a Royal Gala together in 2005, the year they finally married [File: Pool Photograph/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1995-diana-s-panorama-interview\">1995: Diana’s Panorama interview</h2><p>Diana was interviewed by journalist Martin Bashir on the BBC programme Panorama that was broadcast on November 20, 1995.</p><p>During the interview, Diana commented on several controversies, including the relationship between Charles and Camilla. About the affair, she said: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,” which garnered huge public sympathy. She also spoke openly about her mental health struggles – in particular with the condition bulimia nervosa.</p><p>Diana’s candid interview opened the lid on life in the royal family, and she was widely viewed as the “people’s princess” after it was aired.</p><p>Following the interview, Queen Elizabeth II recommended that the couple divorce quickly – the marriage was legally dissolved the following year.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding the interview came under scrutiny more than 20 years later when Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, alleged that Bashir had used false documents and other dishonest tactics to enlist him to persuade Diana to do the interview.</p><p>The BBC appointed a retired senior judge in 2020 to lead an investigation into the matter. A report from the inquiry said Bashir used “deceitful behaviour” and breached BBC rules by mocking up fake bank statements and showing them to Spencer to gain access to the princess.</p><p>In 2021, Princes William and Harry – Diana’s now-grown children – issued a strong criticism of the BBC and British media for what they called unethical practices after the investigation concluded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-52103891-1771587553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C522&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diana, Princess Of Wales, visits The National Children’s Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in February 1995, the year she was interviewed on Panorama [Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1997-death-of-diana\">1997: Death of Diana</h2><p>Two years after the Panorama interview, the princess died aged 36 in a Paris traffic accident as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi photographers.</p><p>On August 30, 1997, a group of paparazzi had camped outside the Ritz hotel in Paris in hopes of obtaining shots of Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.

Both Diana and Fayed were killed.</p><p>The public outpouring of grief over Diana’s death contrasted sharply with what was seen as stony silence from the royal family in the immediate aftermath. The family, including the queen, was strongly criticised for not quickly appearing in public and failing to lower the flag over Buckingham Palace to half-staff.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326520\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326520\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-534249928-1771588216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana death\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners left thousands of bouquets, cards and photographs outside Kensington Palace to mark the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 [File: Ralf-Finn Hestoft/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"2002-princess-anne-s-criminal-conviction\">2002: Princess Anne’s criminal conviction</h2><p>In November 2002, Princess Anne, the Queen’s only daughter, pleaded guilty to losing control of her dog, an English bull terrier, who then proceeded to bite two children in Windsor Great Park.</p><p>Anne was fined and became the first working royal in modern times to have a criminal record.</p><h2 id=\"2005-prince-harry-s-nazi-costume\">2005: Prince Harry’s Nazi costume</h2><p>Photos of Prince Harry wearing a Nazi armband at a costume party in 2005 caused global outrage and forced him to issue a public apology.</p><p>In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Harry claimed that his older brother, the now-Prince of Wales William and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Kate Middleton had encouraged the choice of outfit and “howled” with laughter when they saw it.</p><h2 id=\"2020-megxit\">2020: Megxit</h2><p>After years of rising tensions with the media, Prince Harry and his wife, the former actor Meghan Markle – now styled the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – announced plans to quit their senior royal duties, move part-time to North America, seek financial independence and withdraw from regular media scrutiny.</p><p>The couple believed that Meghan’s lack of popularity in the UK was down to the mostly negative media coverage she received from the British press.

Not much is known about his life there, although he occasionally sends WhatsApp audio messages to his supporters at home.</p><p>His political party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), continues to enjoy significant support. Although the former president does not have much political influence in The Gambia, a segment of society, especially in his home region, maintains that he committed no crimes and should be allowed to live freely.</p><p>Still, momentum is slowly building to hold him to account.</p><p>In 2024, The Gambia passed laws creating a Special Prosecutor’s Office and Special Accountability Mechanisms. It aims to prosecute crimes identified by the TRRC and hold the main perpetrators to account, including Jammeh; Sanna Manjang, one of his enforcers responsible for much of the killing; Yankuba Touray, a former Jammeh ally who is already serving a life sentence; and others who remain at large in The Gambia, like the former vice president, Isatou Njie Saidy.</p><p>With support from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the country is also establishing a hybrid Special Tribunal involving Gambian and international judges, which intends to try perpetrators of rights violations, including Jammeh, if he ever returns to The Gambia.</p><p>Separately, international courts have acted. Switzerland sentenced former interior minister Ousman Sonko to 20 years in prison for torture and other crimes in 2023. Courts in Germany and the United States have also convicted former members of Jammeh’s paramilitary unit, “the Junglers”, such as Bai Lowe, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2022.</p><p>Kebba Jome, head of The Gambia Center for Victims of Human Rights Violations, which provides psychosocial support and legal advocacy to victims, said the tribunal has renewed hope among survivors.</p><p>“We are grateful ECOWAS supported this initiative,” he told Al Jazeera. “Victims must remain at the heart of the justice process.”</p><p>Founded in 2017, the centre has registered more than 1,500 victims. Photographs of many of them line its walls, a stark reminder of the country’s past.</p><p>Yet, Jome acknowledged that justice had already come too late for some.</p><p>“The deaths of victims waiting for accountability show how delayed justice can fail survivors,” he said.</p><p>Human rights lawyer Imran Darboe also welcomed the start of reparations but warned they cannot replace justice.</p><p>“Compensation is welcome,” he told Al Jazeera. “But without transparency, engagement and dignity, reparations risk becoming a transaction rather than a path to healing.”</p><p>Darboe said accountability efforts are growing at home and abroad.</p><p>“Justice may be slow,” he said, “but Jammeh is surrounded by accountability mechanisms. Exile is not impunity.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323770\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323770\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Picture-1771481445.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gambia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323770\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Gambia is still recovering from 22 years of Yahya Jammeh’s rule [Kaddy Jawo/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"still-waiting\">Still waiting</h2><p>According to the Reparations Commission, the TRRC identified 1,009 victims eligible for reparations.

But the remains are still being held in a Banjul morgue, pending use as evidence in future tribunal cases.</p><p>“We want to bury our brother properly,” Sillah told Al Jazeera, lamenting that even their mother died in 2024, still waiting. “We want closure,” he said.</p><p>As The Gambia continues its fragile transition from dictatorship to democracy, survivors say the nation’s struggle now is to confront its past before time runs out.</p><p>Mbye sits quietly as his mother prepares to wheel him back inside as the cool evening sets in.</p><p>“People keep saying justice is coming,” he said softly. “But will it ever arrive?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Morales’ coca-growing union, Radio Kawsachun Coca, released footage of the former leader smiling in dark sunglasses as he arrived via tractor at a stadium to address his supporters.</p><p>Morales endorsed candidates for next month’s regional elections and pointedly accused the US under President Donald Trump of wanting “to eliminate every left-wing party in Latin America”.</p><p>Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, serving from 2006 until his fraught <a href=\"/opinions/2019/11/26/how-and-why-evo-morales-lost-in-bolivia\">2019 ouster</a> and subsequent self-exile, explained that he had come down with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne ailment with no treatment that causes fever and severe joint pain, and suffered complications that “caught me by surprise”.</p><p>He dismissed

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260108__89ZE2YQ__v1__HighRes__YemenConflict-1771570516.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"352\" data-end=\"801\">It is no longer possible to interpret the Yemeni landscape solely through the lens of politics. The developments witnessed in the southern Yemeni governorates under government control in recent months clearly indicate that security and military affairs have become the decisive factor in determining the course of power on the ground. Any governmental or political arrangements will be unsustainable unless the issue of security control and the unification of military command are resolved.</p><p data-start=\"803\" data-end=\"1029\">Nor can the escalating Saudi–Emirati rift between two allies who have militarily, politically and economically shaped southern Yemen in recent years be overlooked, given its direct impact on the balance of power and stability.</p><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1868\">Over the past years, a complex security structure has taken shape across the southern governorates, comprising official units and others that emerged during the war. Some of these units are linked to state institutions, while others were established with Emirati support, such as the Southern Transitional Council’s forces, which number in the tens of thousands, or through local arrangements shaped by the circumstances of the conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1868\">Although recent months have seen moves to restructure this landscape following the defeat of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which declared its dissolution in Hadhramaut and al-Mahra on January 3, 2026, security control remains uneven from one governorate to another. Furthermore, the STC’s security and military formations have not disappeared entirely; some have been redeployed, while the fate of others remains unknown.</p><p data-start=\"1387\" data-end=\"1846\">In Aden, the temporary capital, security agencies operate within a complex structure. Some units formerly affiliated with the STC have seen their personnel and weapons disappear, while others have been renamed or redeployed. However, longstanding networks of influence remain, and the transfer of leadership or redeployment of camps reflects attempts to rebalance power rather than a definitive resolution of the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1848\" data-end=\"2118\">The same applies, to varying degrees, to Lahij, Abyan, Dhale, Shabwah and Hadhramaut, where the state’s ability to assert effective authority varies, as does the level of coordination between official security forces and the formations that emerged during the war.</p><p data-start=\"1231\" data-end=\"1826\">The most sensitive issue at this stage is the integration of military and security formations into the Ministries of Defence and Interior. The state seeks to end parallel security authority, but the process faces complex challenges, including differing sources of funding for some units, varying political loyalties, fears among some commanders of losing local influence, and considerations related to the composition of these forces. As a result, integration appears gradual, relying more on redeployment and restructuring than on decisive measures that could risk triggering confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"1258\" data-end=\"1451\">The government now based in Aden, southern Yemen, finds itself facing a delicate equation: it must impose its security authority without plunging the country into renewed internal conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1453\" data-end=\"1828\">The transition from multiple armed groups to a state monopoly on the use of force requires political consensus, regional support and international backing. Any hasty move could reignite internal clashes, particularly given existing political and regional sensitivities, as well as fears that the Saudi–Emirati dispute could once again trigger confrontation on the ground.</p><p data-start=\"1830\" data-end=\"1934\">For this reason, government efforts are focused first on establishing a stable security environment.</p><p data-start=\"1225\" data-end=\"1457\">This trajectory cannot be understood without considering the regional dimension. Saudi Arabia views Yemen as a direct strategic depth for its national security and seeks the emergence of a stable state along its southern border.</p><p data-start=\"1459\" data-end=\"1807\">The dispute between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, particularly after Yemen requested the withdrawal of Emirati forces from its territory, has become a significant factor shaping the course of the crisis, especially amid Saudi accusations that Abu Dhabi continues to support the STC and consolidate its influence on the ground.</p><p data-start=\"4345\" data-end=\"4884\">Yemen today is part of a broader regional landscape, intertwined with Red Sea dynamics and maritime routes, competition for influence in the Horn of Africa, and tensions stretching from Sudan to Somalia to the Gulf. For this reason, international actors — particularly the United States — are keen to keep the situation in Yemen under control, fearing that a security collapse could trigger intra-Gulf conflict, threaten international shipping, create space for a new wave of armed groups, or allow the Houthis to exploit the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1051\" data-end=\"1347\">In the next phase, the government is likely to continue efforts to consolidate security control in Aden and other southern governorates, including Hadhramaut, which borders Saudi Arabia, while gradually integrating military units and maintaining political balances to prevent renewed conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\">The success of these efforts will determine whether the country is moving towards gradual stability or another round of reshaping power centres. Given this reality, the central question remains: who truly possesses the ability to impose security on the ground, particularly as some actors continue to push the Southern Transitional Council towards escalation that could reignite the conflict?</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

been killed and four others wounded in a drone attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on an aid convoy in Sudan’s South Kordofan state, according to the Sudan Doctors Network, in the latest carnage against civilians caught up in the nation’s brutal civil war.</p><p>The convoy of trucks carrying food and humanitarian supplies was targeted by the RSF, and its ally, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North, while travelling through the Kartala area on its way to the cities of Kadugli and Dilling on Thursday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“The network strongly condemned the deliberate targeting of humanitarian convoys, describing it as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and of all norms prohibiting attacks on humanitarian workers,” wrote the Sudan Doctors Network in a social media post.</p><p>The network said that this attack marked the “second such incident in less than a month, following the shelling of a United Nations aid convoy in the town of Al-Rahad,” adding: “this dangerous escalation threatens the safety of humanitarian operations and further exacerbates civilian suffering”.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network reiterated its call to the “international community, the United Nations, and human rights organisations to exert urgent and effective pressure on the leadership of the Rapid Support Forces to ensure the protection of aid convoys and their workers, to open safe and sustainable humanitarian corridors, and to hold those responsible for targeting aid accountable”.</p><p>Al Jazeera could not independently verify the latest RSF attack, which came a month after the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) announced that it had <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/sudan-army-says-nearly-two-year-rsf-siege-of-key-town-broken\">broken a nearly two-year-long RSF siege</a> on Dilling.</p><p>Dilling lies halfway between Kadugli – the besieged state capital – and el-Obeid, the capital of neighbouring North Kordofan province, which the RSF has sought to encircle.</p><p>The RSF and the SAF have been waging a brutal civil war for control of Sudan since April 2023, which has killed thousands of people and displaced millions.</p><p>After being forced out of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has focused on the Kordofan region and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/un-finds-sudans-el-fasher-a-crime-scene-first-access-since-rsf-takeover\">el-Fasher</a> city in North Darfur state, which was the military’s last stronghold in the sprawling Darfur region until the RSF seized it in October.</p><p>Reports of the paramilitary carrying out mass killings, rape, abductions and looting emerged after el-Fasher’s takeover, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) launched a formal investigation into “war crimes” by both sides.</p><p>On Wednesday, the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/un-mission-finds-rsf-destruction-in-el-fasher-bears-hallmarks-of-genocide\">determined</a> that the RSF carried out “a coordinated campaign of destruction” against non-Arab communities in and around el-Fasher during its 18-month siege of the city, the hallmarks of which amount to genocide.</p><p>The fact-finding mission, which was mandated by members of the UN Human Rights Council, said that the RSF had committed at least three out of the five criteria of what constitutes a genocide.</p><p>According to the report, they included killing members of protected ethnic groups (in this case, the Zaghawa and Fur communities), causing serious bodily and mental harm, and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part.</p><p>Following the report’s release, the United States announced sanctions on RSF Brigadier-General Elfateh Abdullah Idris Adam, Major-General Gedo Hamdan Ahmed Mohamed and field commander Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed for their roles in the “horrific campaign” of the siege and capture of el-Fasher.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he said.</p><p>“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, Trump had criticised Obama for his remarks regarding aliens, telling reporters that Obama “was not supposed to be doing that” and implying that the former president’s comments bordered on classified information.</p><p>“He made a big mistake,” Trump said of Obama.</p><p>No evidence has yet been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth, and the Pentagon in 2024 released a report stating that it had no proof that UFOs were alien technology, most being spy planes, satellites and weather balloons.</p><p>Nevertheless, messages of support poured in swiftly on social media and from Capitol Hill following Trump’s announcement to release all documents.</p><p>“Thank you POTUS!” wrote Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who chairs a congressional task force on unidentified aerial phenomena.</p><p>“As the Chairwoman of the Task Force that investigates these subjects, we are incredibly grateful for you doing this! I look forward to going through all the footage, photos, and reports with the public!” she wrote.</p><p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman also <a href=\"https://x.com/Acyn/status/2024660562828013762\">voiced support</a> during an appearance on Fox News, calling Trump’s decision “fantastic” and saying that “America and the world deserve this”.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
