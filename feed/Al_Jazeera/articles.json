independent state,” protester Yacoub al-Safyani told the AFP news agency.</p><p>The public show of solidarity came after a successful <a

As the team to beat, people will try to find all sorts of reasons to say Morocco has an advantage,” Regragui said after his team’s 2-0 win over Cameroon in the quarterfinals Friday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“The only advantage that Morocco has at this Africa Cup is playing in front of 65,000 spectators. The rest is on the field, we speak on the field.”</p><p>On the field, however, Cameroon might have had two penalties if experienced referee Dahane Beida hadn’t decided in favour of the home team.</p><p>Morocco defender Adam Masina was involved in both, appearing to catch Bryan Mbuemo’s right boot after missing the ball when Cameroon was trying to level the match, then, in the final minutes, appearing to strike Etta Eyong’s head with his elbow in the penalty area.</p><p>Beida, who refereed the final at the last edition, also decided not to show Bilal El Khannouss a second yellow card for stopping Danny Namaso on a counterattack shortly before Ismael Saibari wrapped up the win.</p><p>“Many people want to believe or make others believe that we have advantages from the referees. Personally, I saw penalties that could have been awarded to us. As for the referees, I never talk about the referee,” Regragui said.</p><p>The Morocco coach then spoke about a penalty his team was not awarded against South Africa in the previous tournament in the Ivory Coast, and wrongly said he was “suspended for no reason” at that tournament.</p><p>Regragui was suspended for two games at the previous edition for his role in a dispute with Congo captain Chancel Mbemba at the end of their game that led to a melee between players and team officials.</p><p>“The statistics always show us as better than the others,” Regragui said, getting back to this edition. “We create far more opportunities than our opponents. Not a single goal was disallowed for Cameroon, or for any other team. When you want to get rid of something, you find a pretext.”</p><p>Mali and Tanzania also had penalty claims against Morocco rejected in previous games, while Morocco also had a penalty awarded after a VAR check in the draw against Mali.</p><p>Thousands of whistling Moroccan fans tried to help referee Abdou Abdel Mefire make up his mind while he consulted replays before he eventually decided to penalise Mali’s Nathan Gassama for handball. He initially ignored Jawad El Yamiq’s penalty-area foul on Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko before awarding it some minutes later after a VAR check.</p><p>There did not appear to be any VAR checks against Cameroon on Friday.</p><p>Morocco has played all its matches at the nearly 70,000-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where the vast majority of supporters are shouting for the home team, creating an intimidating atmosphere for opponents and referees.</p><p>“Today, Cameroon played the match they needed to play. I think they lost against a better team. I don’t think any player, coach, or anyone else is going to talk about the refereeing because there were a lot of physical battles today. This is Africa. But today, I think we deserved our victory,” said Regragui, who added his team also deserved to win all its previous games.</p><p>“That’s it. We’re trying to play on that field. I don’t think it’s fair play from those who want to see us fall. The best team will win this tournament, inshallah,” he said.</p><p>Morocco will play either Nigeria or Algeria in the semifinals on Wednesday. The final will also take place at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium on January 18.</p><p>The Atlas Lions are among the heavy favourites to win the tournament, having become the first African nation to reach the semifinals of a FIFA World Cup at the Qatar 2022 edition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In his first public <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/irans-khamenei-says-rioters-must-be-put-in-their-place-amid-protests\">remarks</a> since mass protests broke out in Iran, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sought to draw a sharp line between what he deemed the “legitimate” grievances of the bazaar and outright rebellion across the country. “We talk to protesters; the officials must talk to them, but there is no benefit to talking to rioters. Rioters must be put in their place,” he said.</p><p>The distinction was deliberate. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/cdredxekrylo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Khamenei went on to praise the bazaar</a> and its merchants as “among the most loyal sectors” of the Islamic Republic, insisting that the enemies of the state could not exploit the bazaar as a vehicle to confront the system itself.</p><p>Yet his words failed to mask the reality on the ground. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/live/clym7k4mv30t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Protests continue in the Tehran Bazaar</a>, prompting authorities to deploy tear gas against demonstrators chanting antistate slogans, including ones targeting the supreme leader. The state’s attempt to symbolically separate the bazaar from the broader unrest failed in practice, exposing the limits of its narrative control.</p><p>Khamenei’s invocation of the revolutionary legacy of the bazaar is rooted in historical facts. The bazaar played a decisive role in the 1979 revolution that overthrew Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and remained aligned with conservative political networks in the following decades. But this historical loyalty no longer guarantees political quiescence.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the economic standing of the bazaar has been steadily eroded by state favouritism towards the economic machinery of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and large religious-revolutionary foundations (bonyads), sanctions management, and chronic inflation. As a result, what was once a staunch base of the regime has become another casualty of systemic dysfunction.</p><h2 id=\"from-power-to-marginalisation\">From power to marginalisation</h2><p>In the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, powerful bazaar merchants, often operating through the bazaar-affiliated Islamic Coalition Party, were folded directly into the architecture of the new state. They gained influence over key institutions and ministries, including the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, the Ministry of Labour, and the Guardian Council.</p><p>This political access translated into material advantage. Despite the enthusiasm of powerful figures in the new revolutionary state for total nationalisation, including control over foreign trade, the bazaar maintained a dominant role in Iran’s commercial trade throughout the 1980s. Bazaar merchants secured import licences, ran the largest trading firms under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce, and benefitted from preferential access to the official exchange rate, which was far below market value. These imported goods were sold to Iranians at market prices, generating substantial profits.</p><p>When the Islamic Republic turned towards economic liberalisation in the 1990s, political forces tied to the bazaar, often described as the “traditional right”, backed President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in sidelining Islamist leftists from both the cabinet and the Majles. Although some of Rafsanjani’s market reforms later collided with bazaar interests and gave rise to the so-called “new right”, most notably the Servants of Reconstruction Party, the bazaar and its allies retained substantial influence within the state.</p><p>The reformist agenda of Rafsanjani’s successor, President Mohammad Khatami, also did not fundamentally threaten the economic position or political clout of the bazaar. Key institutions—the Guardian Council, the Assembly of Experts, and the judiciary—remained firmly under the control of the “traditional right”, insulating the bazaar from meaningful challenge.</p><p>Although the bazaar overwhelmingly supported the presidential bid of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005, the economic and foreign policies of his administration ultimately accelerated the erosion of its economic power.</p><p>During Ahmadinejad’s presidency, “privatisation” became a vehicle for the transfer of major state assets to firms affiliated with the IRGC and bonyads. Reclassified as “public, nongovernmental entities” under a new interpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution, these bodies absorbed vast swaths of the economy. Backed by the supreme leader and a cabinet dominated by military and security figures, many of them former IRGC officers, this redistribution of wealth encountered little institutional resistance.</p><p>The result was a profound shift in Iran’s political economy. The IRGC emerged as a dominant economic actor, expanding its reach across infrastructure, petrochemicals, banking, and beyond. Major bonyads, including the Mostazafan Foundation, the Imam Reza Shrine Foundation, and Setad, similarly consolidated their power by acquiring state firms and building sprawling corporate empires. Together, these entities formed an extensive web of interlocking conglomerates that fused revolutionary foundations with military institutions, giving rise to a powerful new political bloc within the state: the Principlists.</p><h2 id=\"the-bazaar-s-discontent\">The bazaar’s discontent</h2><p>This consolidation came directly at the expense of the bazaar and the political forces historically aligned with it. Disillusioned by the economic policies of the Ahmadinejad government, bazaar merchants coordinated their first open act of defiance since the revolution, staging strikes in several cities in 2008.</p><p>Their position deteriorated further as international sanctions escalated in response to the hardline nuclear policies of Ahmadinejad’s government. By 2012, US and EU restrictions on Iran’s oil and banking sectors and its exclusion from the SWIFT system placed the country under severe economic constraints.</p><p>The state responded by developing sanction-evasion mechanisms, including smuggling routes through neighbouring countries. The IRGC played a central role, exploiting ports and airports under its control to import goods. Over time, this sanctions economy entrenched the dominance of the IRGC and bonyads while further marginalising the bazaar.</p><p>Politically, the consequences were equally stark: the Principlists consolidated control over the state, sidelining the “traditional right” and dismantling the longstanding arrangement that had traded the bazaar’s loyalty for access and influence within the Islamic Republic.</p><h2 id=\"a-challenge-to-the-regime\">A challenge to the regime</h2><p>The ongoing bazaar protests are not an anomaly but a warning. They reveal a political-economic transformation years in the making—one that is hollowing out even the traditional backbone of the state.</p><p>For decades, the regime relied on the bazaar as a stabilising force: a guarantor of economic compliance in times of crisis and a bedrock of political loyalty. Yet the unrest originated in the bazaar and continues there, even as Khamenei insists on their loyalty. His remarks signal not confidence, but anxiety, and the bazaar’s open defiance demonstrates that the challenge confronting the Islamic Republic is far harder to contain.</p><p>In theory, the Islamic Republic could still seek to win back the bazaar by easing sanctions and curbing the dominance of IRGC-linked conglomerates. In practice, this is increasingly difficult to do. Sanctions relief remains remote amid deepening tensions with the United States and Europe over Iran’s nuclear programme, while rolling back the economic and political power of the IRGC and the bonyads offers the regime little incentive and even less strategic logic. Confronted with these constraints, the state’s room for manoeuvre is narrow, leaving repression as its most readily available option, even at the cost of further alienating a traditional constituency it once relied on for stability and loyalty</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>We should have come out of the holiday season in Sweden jolly, rested and ready for a happy new year. But we didn’t. We should have finished the previous year with a sense of love and togetherness. But we didn’t. Everything bad has reached new levels and may well go even further.</p><p>We finished 2025, a year full of racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, with the right-wing Sweden Democrats still dominating the political discourse, Greta Thunberg being maligned for her political activism, and the government cutting <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-cut-development-aid-five-countries-divert-money-ukraine-2025-12-05/\">10 billion kronor</a> ($1.09bn) in development aid.</p><p>Just in time for the holidays, a Quran with bullet holes was hung on the Central Mosque’s fence in Stockholm, while an Iranian couple – both assistant nurses who had worked for a decade in Swedish hospitals – and their children were slated for deportation to Tehran.</p><p>In the new year, we are facing an election where the toxic political rhetoric about expelling criminals and others who do not “behave” and “adapt” will likely determine the outcome.</p><p>What comes next in Sweden deeply worries me.</p><p>As a Bosnian Swede, I want both my countries to be the best they can be. I want them to be great again, to use this charged phrase, because I do not think they are that great now. Yes, I look at both with some nostalgia because I remember what they were in different periods of my life.</p><p>I want Bosnia to be free from the nationalist poison and be a proper democratic state like Sweden. I want Sweden to regain its spirit of empathy that once upon a time made it accept thousands of us Bosnians during its worst economic crisis. Sweden did very well, and we Bosnians are said to be the best-integrated and most successful minority.</p><p>Today, we no longer have people like the Swedish priest who jumped on a plane and delivered aid at Sarajevo airport during the violent siege of the Bosnian capital.</p><p>Land, unload, escape. A quick in and out amid shelling. I cannot imagine anyone taking such a risk today.</p><p>What is worse, we have developed a resistance to empathy, and we look upon anyone who tries to make a difference as a weird outlier.</p><p>Back then, countries refused to defend the Bosnians and let us defend ourselves. Nowadays, they help perpetrators.</p><p>I remember a different Sweden.</p><p>During the first two years of the war, I met a comic book collector in Banja Luka whose daughter had escaped to Sweden. He showed me a letter she sent him through the Red Cross. It was wintertime, and she was describing this place called Vargarda as a pristine Nordic landscape, so beautiful and innocent.</p><p>It would be my fate to come to the same refugee camp in 1993. I was excited – I was going to a place where I knew there would be a lot of comic books.</p><p>Shortly after our arrival, we were transferred to this military building in Uddevalla, where it felt like the constant wind blew straight through my mind. We were closed off but had some contact with Swedish high-school students. I tried to learn Swedish, but since we didn’t know if we’d stay, we had no Swedish classes yet.</p><p>I didn’t experience much Swedishness in the camp. It was just us Bosnians with PTSD, a mix of people from all parts of Bosnia, and it felt like we were from different cultures entirely. Same people, total strangers.</p><p>I had cousins – also refugees – who were stationed in Trollhattan. One winter day, before a transfer to Mullsjo, I decided to visit them. It snowed a lot, and the only shoes I had were fake Converse sneakers with holes in the soles. I arrived in this cosy little town with an address in hand. It turned out to be a P O Box. Boy, did I feel like a stupid little refugee lost in the beautiful streets of Trollhattan.</p><p>I was cold, so I went into a record store. The place smelled amazing. The most exotic smell I’d ever smelled. I didn’t expect that in Sweden. In Bosnia, we’re not exactly famous for exotic spices. We like things plain and simple. It was in Sweden I’d learn about the world.</p><p>The man who worked in the store saw I was cold and gave me mulled wine with Christmas spices, which I’d later learn was called glogg. It was hot and strong, and it blew my mind. This is the Proustian moment I will probably remember until I die. I couldn’t speak any Swedish, but somehow I communicated that I was looking for the refugee camp. The man showed me where to go.</p><p>I found the buildings and saw some Bosnians who told me how to find my cousins. They had already started integrating, probably because they were fewer and lived closer to the Swedes.</p><p>During my stay, my cousin made tiny cinnamon buns, which she froze. Her daughter and I would steal those and eat them frozen, while watching Married…with Children on Swedish TV. In a few days, I fell in love with glogg and cinnamon buns.</p><p>In the refugee camp in Mullsjo, in the Swedish Bible belt, I trained judo in a local club, the music of Nordman blasting in the background. Small place, nice people, with some standard prejudice about Muslims, but still driven by a sense of decency. I was always taken care of.</p><p>There was one Swedish guy who worked in the camp who was always looking for bad things to say about us. Once, when I complained about an electricity bill being too high, the guy said we immigrants were just using the system and should learn to respect the law. Go figure.</p><p>People like him were few back then. Now there are so many. Companies that did not want to give us jobs because we didn’t speak Swedish well were also few back then. Now there are many.</p><p>In my twenties, I moved to Stockholm, got married, and started working as a carer for an old Swedish man in a wheelchair. I was next to him for 11 years. He taught me how to have compassion and empathy and how to adore the sweet buns called “semlor”.</p><p>I respect the National Semla Day because of him. I developed a good relationship with his sister, whom we would often meet at IKEA for weekend breakfasts.</p><p>Eventually, breakfast at IKEA every Saturday became a tradition for my family, too. It was a place where you could see all kinds of people waiting impatiently outside for it to open so they could run in and grab a cheap breakfast: Two buns, some slices of cucumber, chicken breast, and cheese, and of course, unlimited coffee. That was the best coffee in town.</p><p>After a few months, we got to know the faces of many regulars, like the old Greek couple who were somehow always first in line, and if they were not, they were not happy. Or the old Arab who’d always sit alone by the window facing the motorway. Or all the young Swedish couples who’d explain things to their small children way too loudly.</p><p>With time, breakfast at IKEA started to change. It gradually turned into a brunch – a huge feast – but then they got stingier, and there was less on offer. Prices went up just as our kids grew.</p><p>At some point, breakfast at IKEA lost the sense of what it was supposed to be. It lost its identity in trying to be commercial; it was no longer about the diversity of families it attracted. And somehow, we lost that tradition.</p><p>I love change. And I hate it. Like everyone, I suppose. I love the fact that Sweden has come to offer a much richer culture, and I hate that it has grown increasingly colder towards “the other”. People like Greta now stand out and cause wonder.</p><p>I long for that glogg I tasted as a young refugee just as much as I long for those strong hearts and minds like that priest who delivered goods to Muslims under fire.</p><p>Maybe by the time I have grandchildren, things will change. I will go back to our family tradition of breakfast IKEA, one that will be richer and yet very much the same old, same old.</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

United States President Donald Trump has also rejected the claim that such an attack took place.</p><p>According to Ukraine, the latest strikes killed four people and injured at least 22 in Kyiv.</p><p>Russia also hit critical infrastructure in Lviv with an unidentified ballistic missile travelling at about 13,000km/h (more than 8,000mph), according to Mayor Andriy Sadovyi and Ukraine’s Air Force, which said the exact type of missile was still being determined.</p><h2 id=\"where-in-ukraine-was-the-oreshnik-attack\">Where in Ukraine was the Oreshnik attack?</h2><p>According to Russia, the strike in Lyiv was from the Oreshnik.</p><p>The western Ukrainian city of Lviv is about 550km (340 miles) away from the capital, Kyiv.</p><p>Lyiv is near the border with Poland, roughly 70km (45 miles) away.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-oreshnik\">What is the Oreshnik?</h2><p>The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range ballistic missile — the word means hazel tree in Russian. The missile’s multiple warheads fall in streaks of light, apparently resembling the tree.</p><p>Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 – five times the speed of sound – and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.</p><p>The Oreshnik is also a nuclear‑capable weapon, meaning it is designed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead, even if it is not always deployed with one.</p><p>The Oreshnik is believed to be a medium-range missile, with its use so far suggesting a range of about 1,000 to 1,600km (620 to 990 miles).</p><p>Russia has only fired the Oreshnik once before, in November 2024. Back then, Moscow said that it had attacked a Ukrainian military factory.</p><p>This attack came days after the US government led by former Democratic President Joe Biden authorised Ukraine to use US-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike targets in Russia.</p><p>In 2024, the Pentagon said that the Oreshnik was based on the “RS-26 Rubezh” intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) first developed in 2008.</p><p>Putin has ⁠said that the intermediate-range Oreshnik missile is impossible to intercept because of speeds reportedly more than 10 times the speed of sound and that its destructive power is ‌comparable with that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.</p><p>On December 30, 2025, Russia <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/russia-deploys-hypersonic-oreshnik-missiles-in-belarus-amid-europe-tensions\">deployed</a> the Oreshnik system in Belarus in a move which could strengthen Moscow’s ability to target Europe in a potential future conflict.</p><h2 id=\"why-was-this-attack-particularly-significant\">Why was this attack particularly significant?</h2><p>During the attack in November 2024, the Oreshnik missiles were equipped with dummy warheads as a test attack, according to Ukrainian sources, Reuters news agency reported.</p><p>Hence, the dummy warheads did limited damage to Ukraine back then.</p><p>If the missiles were equipped with explosives during the recent attack, it would mark the first time that Russia used the Oreshnik missiles to their full non-nuclear capacity while striking Ukraine.</p><p>Another reason why this attack is significant is the location of the target.</p><p>Back in November 2024, the missiles hit Dnipro, which is in east-central Ukraine and is not close to Ukraine’s borders with other countries.</p><p>However, this time, the missiles hit close to Poland, which is a member of NATO.</p><p>Kyiv has labelled the use of the weapon close to the European Union and NATO border a “grave threat” to European security.</p><p>“Such a strike close to [the] EU and NATO border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community. We demand strong responses to Russia’s reckless actions,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on social media.</p><p>“Vladimir Putin is using this to communicate with the West, because he could undoubtedly achieve the same operational effects without this missile,” Cyrille Bret, a Russia expert at the Paris-based Montaigne Institute, told the AFP news agency.</p><p>A UK government spokeswoman said that, in a call on Friday, the leaders of United Kingdom, France and Germany condemned Russia’s use of the missile as “escalatory and unacceptable”.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-this-matter\">Why does this matter?</h2><p>The latest Russian attack comes as peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine continue to stall. In February, the war will enter its fifth year.</p><p>The latest attack risks undermining those ceasefire negotiations, at a time when the two sides remain far apart on core issues such as territory.</p><p>Observers and analysts have previously told Al Jazeera that the issue of territorial concessions remains a major sticking point.</p><p>Trump’s<a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\"> 28-point peace plan</a> for Ukraine, which he unveiled in November 2025, involved Ukraine ceding not only large amounts of land that Russia has occupied during nearly four years of war, but also some territory that Kyiv’s forces currently control. Zelenskyy has stated on numerous occasions that this is unacceptable to Ukraine.</p><p>Most analysts are sceptical that any progress has been made on this point and said the latest intensification in fighting will not, by itself, add to the already significant complications in talks.</p><p>“I don’t think there is anything to derail at this point,” Marina Miron, an analyst at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera in December 2025.</p><p>The peace process “is not going well due to disagreements on key issues between Ukraine and Russia”, she said.</p><p>Mikhail Alexseev, a professor of political science at San Diego State University, told Al Jazeera that Moscow’s goal is not to “end or derail” peace talks, but instead it is to “keep them going as a cover and an enabler of continuing Russian brutal invasion in an attempt to wipe Ukraine off the world’s map regardless of human cost”.</p><p>“Russia started the war and Putin can end it in five minutes if he wanted to do so. All he needs to do is to agree to [US] President [Donald] Trump’s unconditional ceasefire proposals made early this year.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, it is one thing to hear his stage rhetoric and another to see his worldview codified in official doctrine. Its core claim: Europe will be “unrecognisable in 20 years” due to “civilisational erasure” unless the United States, “sentimentally attached” to the continent, steps in to restore its “former greatness”.</p><p>Trump is right, Europe has problems. But they are not what he claims.</p><p>Decades of underinvestment in people, persistent political incentives to ignore excluded communities and a reluctance to confront how demographic and economic decline interact, go unaddressed. Political leaders largely avoid this conversation. Some deny these problems, others concede them privately while publicly debating symptoms but not addressing the root causes.</p><p>A clearer perspective can be found among those who live with these failures. Across Europe, millions in the working class struggle to survive amid shuttered factories, underfunded schools, unaffordable housing and broken public services. Among them, the Roma sharpen the picture. As Europe’s largest and most dispossessed minority, their experience exposes the continent’s choice to treat entire populations as collateral damage. When Trump presses on Europe’s wounds, these communities confirm where it hurts.</p><h2 id=\"what-trump-gets-right-about-europe\">What Trump gets right about Europe</h2><p>The NSS argues that Europe’s “lack of self-confidence” is most visible in its relationship with Russia. Yes, Europe’s paralysis towards Moscow contrasts with its aggression towards weaker groups at home. This reflects the lack of confidence in European values.</p><p>Trump is right. We’re weak. If we were strong, we would stand up for European values of democracy and pluralism. We would not demonise our minorities.</p><p>But we do. Across the continent, Roma communities face racist policies. In Slovenia, following a bar fight that spiralled into public hysteria, the national legislature passed a law in November to securitise Roma neighbourhoods.</p><p>In Portugal, Andre Ventura of the far-right Chega party put up posters saying “G****es have to obey the law” as part of his presidential campaign. In Italy, far-right politician Matteo Salvini built an entire political brand on anti-Roma paranoia. In Greece, the police shoot at Roma youth for minor crimes.</p><p>Leaders over-securitise the Roma while overcompensating for their caution towards Russia.</p><p>The NSS also highlights Europe’s declining share of global gross domestic product, from 25 percent in 1990 to 14 percent today. Regulations play a part, so does demographic decline, but the deeper problem is Europe’s failure to invest in all its people.</p><p>Twelve million Roma, the youngest population in Europe, remain locked out of education, employment and entrepreneurship through structural barriers and discrimination, even though surveys show their overwhelming willingness to contribute to the societies they live in and their high success rates when they run businesses that receive support.</p><p>If Roma employment in Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria – where their unemployment rates are currently 25 percentage points above those of the majority population – matched national averages, the combined GDP gain could be as much as <a href=\"https://romaforeurope.org/work/articles/report-the-ten-billion-euro-opportunity\">10 billion euros ($11.6bn)</a>. In a continent losing two million workers a year, letting this labour potential go unused is self-sabotage.</p><p>Trump is right about Europe’s declining share of GDP. If Europe were serious, it would not believe it can leave Roma people on the scrap heap.</p><p>The NSS further warns of “subversion of democratic processes”, and while he is not talking about minorities, it is true that Europe does fall short.  Proportionally, according to our estimates at the Roma Foundation, they should hold over 400 seats.</p><p>The European Parliament includes seats for Malta and Luxembourg, states with populations of 570,000 and 680,000, respectively; yet, it does not include any seats for the Roma community.</p><p>Trump is right that we have a democratic deficit. But it’s not because of laws against hate speech and constitutional barriers to the far right. The most pressing deficit is that 12 million Roma are not represented.</p><p>A continent that wastes its population cannot be competitive, and one that suppresses parts of its electorate cannot claim to be representative. Political exclusion reduces voter turnout and registration rates, leading to systematically underrepresentative institutions, while economic exclusion makes communities easier targets for vote-buying, coercion and political capture.</p><h2 id=\"what-europe-really-needs\">What Europe really needs</h2><p>Trump’s proposed solution for Europe’s crisis would not resolve anything. He seems to assume that far-right pseudo-sovereigntists, opposed to immigration and minorities alike, can reverse Europe’s decline.</p><p>The evidence suggests otherwise. Countries where xenophobia influences policy have not performed well. In the United Kingdom, where the far right drove a campaign to leave the European Union over fears of migration, experts have calculated that GDP is 6-8 percent lower than it would have been without Brexit. In Hungary, where the government of Viktor Orban has enacted various anti-migrant and discriminatory policies, there is stagnant economic growth, a high budget deficit and frozen EU funds. Exclusion weakens economies and makes democracies vulnerable.</p><p>Empowering the ideological heirs of forces that the United States once helped Europe defeat would not aid the continent’s recovery. In fact, this “restoration” to power of extremist right-wing ideology would deepen Europe’s dependence on Washington, then Moscow.</p><p>It is also true that Europe cannot survive global realpolitik, leaning on liberal nostalgia, multilateral summits or rhetorical commitments, either.</p><p>What Europe needs is inclusive realism: the recognition that investing in all people is not charity but a strategic necessity. China’s rise illustrates this. Decades of investment in health, education and employment have expanded human capital, increased productivity and reshaped global power balances.</p><p>Europe cannot afford to waste its own population potential while expecting to remain a relevant player. The real choice is not between liberals and the far right, but between deepening its wounds by sidelining millions or beginning to heal by investing in the people it has long treated as expendable.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
