We have nothing to eat,” the distraught father told Al Jazeera, breaking down in tears with his wife under the blue tarpaulin where they are sheltering.</p><p>Khaled reported his son’s disappearance to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and every official body he could reach, to radio silence. To this day, he has received no answers on Ahmed’s whereabouts.</p><p>Khaled’s story is all too common under Israel’s ongoing punishing blockade of Gaza, where the largely displaced population faces a stark choice between starvation and braving the bullets fired by Israeli soldiers and United States security contractors in a bid to get food from Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sites. These distribution points have been dubbed “death traps” and “human slaughterhouses” by the United Nations and rights groups.</p><p>It is a life-or-death gamble that has taken the lives of nearly 1,400 people, shot dead mainly by the Israeli army, at the aid sites since they started operations in late May and along food convoy routes, according to figures released by the UN last week. That is, without counting the untold numbers of missing aid seekers, like Ahmed.</p><p>Human rights monitors have been collecting harrowing firsthand accounts of people who have gone missing in Gaza, only to be found later, killed by Israeli forces.</p><p>“In many cases, those who went missing are apparently killed near the aid distribution points, but due to the Israeli targeting, their bodies remained unreachable,” Maha Hussaini, the head of media at the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Many Palestinians left home with empty hands, hoping to return with a bag of flour.

Israel’s Channel 12 cited an official as saying that Netanyahu was tending towards expanding the offensive.</p><p>The announcement came on another bloody day in the Strip, with at least 74 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks since dawn on Monday, including 36 aid seekers, according to medical sources.</p><p>Among the attacks, at least three people were killed by an Israeli strike on a house in Deir el-Balah, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.</p><p>A source at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City reported that seven people were killed in Israeli shelling on multiple areas in the Shujayea neighbourhood, east of Gaza City.</p><p>Emergency services said that two were killed in an Israeli bombing of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza.</p><p>It also emerged on Monday that a nurse at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah was killed when he was hit by an airdropped box of aid.</p><p>This week, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, described the dangerous airdrops as a “distraction” and smokescreen.</p><p>On Monday, UNICEF warned that 28 children – essentially an entire “classroom” – are dying each day from Israeli bombardment and lack of aid.</p><p>“Gaza’s children need food, water, medicine and protection. More than anything, they need a ceasefire, NOW,” said the UN agency on X.</p><p></p><p>The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called on the UN Security Council to “assume its responsibilities” by enforcing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, conducting an official visit to the territory and implementing calls at a recent UN conference in New York for a two-state solution.</p><p>In a statement posted on social media on Monday, the ministry warned that more than two million Palestinians in Gaza are “living in a tight death circle of killing, starvation, thirst, and deprivation of medicine, treatment, and all basic human rights”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Starvation is always something that is done by one person to another. It’s intended to be protracted and to maximise suffering,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Soon, metabolism slows, the ability to regulate temperature is lost, kidney function becomes impaired and, critically in Gaza, the immune system begins to falter and the body’s ability to heal from injury is reduced.</p><p>Once the body’s reserves are used up, it loses the ability to channel nutrients to vital organs and tissues. As a result, essential organs like the heart and lungs become less effective. Muscles shrink and people feel weak.</p><p>Eventually, as the body’s protein stores are ravaged, the body’s tissues are broken down, with death not far away.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h2 id=\"how-long-does-it-take-the-human-body-to-die-of-starvation\">How long does it take the human body to die of starvation?</h2><p>While scientific research on the subject has been limited for ethical reasons, it’s estimated that a typically well-nourished and otherwise healthy adult could survive without food for between 45 and 61 days.</p><p>However, after 22 months of war, few people in Gaza could be described as well nourished or healthy, leaving them susceptible to malnutrition and the many infectious diseases prevalent in the enclave.</p><p>“With starvation, the body loses the ability to launch an immune response to diseases or injuries it could normally deal with, such as gastroenteritis, trauma or a respiratory infection, so it’s often malnutrition plus an infection that kills,” Dr Smith continued.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2801992\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2801992\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2801992\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Interactive_Starvation_Huan_Body_March27-01-1711536181.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Starvation_Human_Body_March27\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2801992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-people-who-are-most-at-risk-of-starving-to-death\">Who are the people who are most at risk of starving to death?</h2><p>The old, the young, those already ill and, cruelly, those who are alone.</p><p>“A child will die earlier from starvation. The loss of muscle and fat occurs almost immediately. Equally, those in older age groups will also die quicker,” Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a Palestinian British surgeon who spent 43 days working in Gaza, said.</p><p>“However, it isn’t just age. There are social differences, too,” he continued.</p><p>“There are currently thousands of orphans roaming Gaza. There is no one to feed them or risk their lives to get food for them, so they’re also more likely to die,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-people-who-are-dying-of-hunger-in-gaza\">Who are the people who are dying of hunger in Gaza?</h2><p>There is overwhelming evidence that, through the various blockades Israel has imposed on Gaza, the threat of death by starvation has spread from the vulnerable to everyone in Gaza.</p><p>In February 2024, five months into Israel’s war on Gaza, the World Health Organization estimated that one in six children under the age of two, especially in Gaza’s north –  at the <a href=\"/news/2024/2/22/israeli-siege-turns-gazas-nasser-hospital-into-a-place-of-death\">time under Israeli siege </a>–  were acutely malnourished.</p><p>As of August 2025, 82 adults have starved to death over the last five weeks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-has-been-limiting-gaza-s-food-for-years-how-has-that-affected-the-people-there\">Israel has been limiting Gaza’s food for years.

However, the proposal removed a scheduling provision that would have affected workers’ ability to earn overtime pay.</p><p>“We’re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40 percent average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules,” said Dan Gillian, Boeing Air Dominance vice president and general manager, and senior St Louis site executive.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers.”</p><p>Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security business accounts for more than one-third of the company’s revenue. But Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told analysts last week that the impact from a strike by the machinists who build fighter jets, weapons systems and the US Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft would be much less than a walkout last year by 33,000 workers who assemble the company’s commercial jetliners.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,” Ortberg said. “So we’ll manage through this. I wouldn’t worry too much about the implications of the strike.”</p><p>The 2024 strike shut down Boeing’s factories in Washington state for more than seven weeks at a bleak time for the company. Boeing came under several federal investigations last year after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.</p><p>The <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/23/boeing-reaches-deal-with-us-doj-to-avoid-prosecution-over-737-max-crashes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Aviation Administration</a> put limits on Boeing plane production that it said would last until the agency felt confident about manufacturing quality safeguards at the company. The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the planes crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.</p><p>Ortberg told analysts that the company has slowly <a href=\"/economy/2024/12/6/us-judge-rejects-boeing-plea-deal-in-fatal-max-737-crashes\">worked its way up</a> to an FAA-set 737 Max production cap of 38 per month and expects to ask regulators later this year for permission to go beyond it.</p><p>Last week, Boeing reported that its second-quarter revenue had improved and its losses had narrowed. The company lost $611m in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $1.44bn during the same period last year.</p><p>Boeing’s stock tumbled on the news of the strike.

I forget what prompted the disclosure, though I do recall it was made not to elicit pity but rather as a matter-of-fact explanation of the way things were: sleeping more than three hours a night simply did not allow her sufficient time to simultaneously maintain her professorship and tend to her baby.</p><p>This, of course, was before the era of smartphones took the phenomenon of rampant sleep deprivation to another level. But modern life has long been characterised by a lack of proper sleep – an activity that happens to be fundamental to life itself.</p><p>I personally cannot count the times I have awakened at one or two o’clock in the morning to work, unable to banish from my brain the capitalist guilt at engaging in necessary restorative rest rather than being, you know, “productive” 24 hours a day.</p><p>And yet mine is a privileged variety of semi-self-imposed sleep deprivation; I am not, for example, being denied adequate rest because I have to work three jobs to put food on the table for my family.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States, approximately one-third of US adults and children under the age of 14 get insufficient sleep, putting them at increased risk for anxiety, depression, heart disease, and a host of other potentially life-threatening maladies. As per CDC calculations, a full 75 percent of US high schoolers do not sleep enough.</p><p>While the recommended amount of sleep for adults is at least seven hours per day, a 2024 Gallup poll <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx\">reported</a> that 20 percent of US adults were getting five hours or less – a trend attributable in part to rising stress levels among the population.</p><p>To be sure, it’s easy to feel stressed out when your government appears more interested in sending billions upon billions of dollars to Israel to assist in the ongoing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/28/israeli-human-rights-group-israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">genocide of Palestinians</a> in the Gaza Strip than in, say, facilitating existence for Americans by offering <a href=\"/opinions/2024/12/9/no-surprise-americans-are-rooting-for-the-unitedhealthcare-ceos-killer\">healthcare</a>, education, and housing options that don’t require folks to work themselves to death to afford.</p><p>Then again, pervasive stress and anxiety work just fine for those sectors of the for-profit medical establishment that make bank off of treating such afflictions.</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking of the Gaza Strip, residents of the occupied territory are well acquainted with acute sleep deprivation, which is currently a component of the Israeli military’s genocidal arsenal for wearing Palestinians down both physically and psychologically. Not that a good night’s sleep in Gaza was ever really within the realm of possibility – even prior to the <a href=\"/opinions/2023/10/15/israel-and-the-weaponisation-of-empathy\">launch</a> of the all-out genocide in 2023 – given Israel’s <a href=\"/opinions/2022/8/12/israel-normalising-terror-one-dawn-at-a-time\">decades-long terrorisation</a> of the Strip via periodic bombardments, massacres, sonic booms, the ubiquitous deployment of buzzing drones, and other manoeuvres designed to inflict individual and collective trauma.</p><p>A study on trauma and sleep disruption in Gaza – conducted in November 2024 and published this year in the peer-reviewed journal BMC Psychology – notes that, in the present context of Israel’s round-the-clock assault, “the act of falling asleep is imbued with existential dread”. The study quotes one Gaza mother who had already lost three of her seven children to Israeli bombings: “Every time I close my eyes, I see my children in front of me, so I’m afraid to sleep.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Of course, Israel’s penchant for killing entire families in their sleep no doubt exacerbates the fear associated with it. The study observes that children in Gaza have been “stripped of the simple peace that sleep should offer, forced to endure nightmares born from real-life horrors”, while overcrowded shelters have rendered the pursuit of shut-eye ever more elusive.</p><p>Furthermore, mass forced displacement in the Gaza Strip “has deprived families of their homes, severing the link between sleep and security”.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/sleep-human-right-and-its-deprivation-torture/2024-10\">article</a> in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics argues that sleep is a human right that is integral to human health – and that its deprivation is torture. It seems we can thus go ahead and add mass torture to the list of US-backed Israeli atrocities in Gaza.</p><p>Naturally, the US has engaged in plenty of do-it-yourself torture over the years, as well, including against detainees in Guantanamo Bay – where sleep deprivation was standard practice along with waterboarding, “rectal rehydration”, and other so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques”.</p><p>In her 2022 <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3927&amp;context=mlr\">study</a> of sleep deprivation as a form of torture, published by the Maryland Law Review, Deena N Sharuk cites the case of Mohammed Jawad, an Afghan teenager imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay in 2003 and subjected to what was “referred to as the Frequent Flyer Program”, whereby detainees were repeatedly moved between cells in order to disrupt their sleep.</p><p>According to Sharuk, Jawad was moved “every three hours for fourteen consecutive days, totaling 112 moves”. The young man subsequently attempted suicide.</p><p>Now, the ever-expanding array of immigration detention facilities in the US offers new opportunities to withhold sleep, as victims of the country’s war on refuge seekers are crammed into cages illuminated at all hours by fluorescent lights.</p><p>And while a well-rested world would surely be a more serene one, such a prospect remains the stuff of dreams.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The people were angry about the exorbitant prices that the shop owners were charging for goods that had clearly been looted from aid convoys.</p><p>Two weeks later, I was at the same market and witnessed another angry protest. People were chanting, “You thieves!” and cursing the merchants.</p><p>Having no fear of God, shop owners are exploiting the famine without mercy, selling aid as if it were rare luxury items when in fact it is supposed to be distributed for free. The greed and exploitation have gone too far, and the people are taking things into their own hands. Across Gaza, there are protests against price speculation. In some places, shops are being forcibly closed.</p><p>Indeed, the prices of essential goods have soared to unimaginable levels, beyond anything dictated by the forces of supply and demand. People cannot understand why goods cost so much despite their minimal purchasing power. The prices I saw while walking at the market were insane: a kilo (2.2lb) of flour – 40 shekels ($12), a kilo of rice – 60 shekels ($18), a kilo of lentils – 40 shekels ($12), a kilo of sugar – 250 shekels ($73), a litre (1 quart) of cooking oil – 200 shekels ($58).</p><p>Since Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza in March, the normal aid distribution through the United Nations – something that has to happen unabated in any warzone – has ceased.</p><p>To stave off global criticism, Israel set up humanitarian hubs to supposedly distribute aid. But they have been nothing more than death traps. Many of those who come to collect aid are shot at, and thousands have been killed or wounded.</p><p>In parallel, the Israeli government started allowing in a very small quantity of aid trucks, but a large portion of those are looted once they enter Gaza. The goods are then resold at outrageous prices.</p><p>Those who control this supply of looted food are powerful merchants and brokers, often protected by local influential actors or benefitting from indirect coordination with Israel. These actions are not spontaneous. They take place within a deliberately created atmosphere of chaos. With the collapse of state institutions and absence of legal accountability, exploitation has become the rule, not the exception.</p><p>It is clear to the Palestinians that the occupation doesn’t merely aim to show that Gaza is weak. It actively seeks to prove that it is ungovernable. To achieve this, closing the borders isn’t enough. The people of Gaza must be pushed into a state of constant chaos and friction.</p><p>Starvation is a key instrument here. Hunger doesn’t only kill. It also changes human nature. A starving person, stripped of the bare minimum needed to survive and subjected to daily humiliation, slowly loses the ability to think clearly, to judge or to restrain themselves from turning against those they perceive – rightly or wrongly – as contributing to their suffering.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>There are black markets and war profiteers in every conflict. But in this one, the occupying power is encouraging these criminal activities, not because it is earning money from them, but because it serves its overall goal. The Palestinians who choose to participate in this form of extortion are motivated by greed, blackmail or survival.</p><p>This slow unravelling is exactly what the occupation has aimed for. It wants chaos in the streets of Gaza so Israeli and international media can be quick to point a finger at the Palestinians and declare: “Look, the Palestinian people are imploding. They can’t govern themselves. They don’t deserve a state.” But the truth is, this is not a sign of a failed nation. It is evidence of the occupation’s success in dragging it to the brink.</p><p>It is not the people who have lost control. Control has been forcibly stripped from them – through starvation, the systematic destruction of healthcare and sanitary infrastructure, the dismantling of state institutions and the empowerment of criminals.</p><p>Yet Gaza will not break. People may grow angry and desperate, cry out and protest, but they still retain a moral compass. This collective outcry is not infighting. It is a clear warning that society will no longer tolerate betrayal. Those who raise prices mercilessly in times of siege are traitors, and they will be held accountable before institutions of justice when Gaza rebuilds.</p><p>The occupation may be revelling now in the unfolding collapse, but it would be wrong to think it has defeated the Palestinians. Every crisis breeds new awareness. Every betrayal gives birth to new resistance. The vast majority of Palestinians refuse to become tools in the hands of their torturers. They refuse subjugation and erasure. They refuse to exploit and harm their fellow citizens.</p><p>Palestinian national solidarity is still alive.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

China’s estimated GDP is about two-thirds that amount.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>US government data on trade, employment, consumer spending and GDP are considered important signals for the direction of the global economy and are closely followed by businesses and investors from London to Dubai and Tokyo.</p><p>Many countries, including democratic states, have faced accusations of fiddling with economic statistics for political reasons, often with serious reputational consequences.</p><p>In 2010, the European Commission published a withering report accusing Greece of deliberately falsifying data to conceal the poor state of its public finances.</p><p>In 2013, the International Monetary Fund officially censured Argentina for providing what it said was inaccurate data on inflation and economic growth.</p><h2 id=\"economic-data-manipulation\">‘Economic data manipulation’</h2><p>Some research suggests that countries run by strong-arm leaders are especially prone to misrepresenting the state of their economies.</p><p>A 2024 study published in the European Journal of Political Economy found that economic openness and democracy decreased the likelihood of governments manipulating statistics although there were no observable positive effects from media freedom or the independence of the statistical office.</p><p>In a 2022 paper that used satellite imagery of nighttime light as a proxy for economic development, Luis Martinez, a professor at the University of Chicago, estimated that autocratic countries artificially inflated their annual GDP growth by about 35 percent.</p><p>“Economic data manipulation is pervasive in history, especially in autocracies and dictatorships to create narratives for the people – typically to embellish standards of living,” Tomasz Michalski, an associate professor of economics at the HEC Paris business school, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“What is rarer, though, is to find such deliberate behaviour in countries that strive to be democracies or are more developed.”</p><p>After Trump’s firing of McEntarfer, a career economist who was appointed in 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support, critics were quick to note parallels to tactics attributed to strongman leaders seeking to bolster public approval for their policies.</p><p>“It’s one more step on our rapid descent into banana republic status,” Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said on Substack, a subscription-based newsletter platform.</p><p>Lawrence Summers, who served as US Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, described the firing as the “stuff of democracies giving way to authoritarianism”.</p><p>Scott Sumner, a professor of economics at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said Trump’s move made the US “look more like a banana republic” although it remained to be seen whether he would seek to directly manipulate the government’s economic figures.</p><p>“It’s actually hard to fool the public, and almost no one was fooled by the Argentina manipulation,” Sumner told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s too soon to say whether Trump will try to do the same. Any attempt to do so would likely fail.”</p><h2 id=\"the-quality-of-us-economic-statistics\">‘The quality of US economic statistics’</h2><p>The quality of US economic data has been a growing concern for some time due in part to the Trump administration’s freeze on hiring federal employees and staff cuts at numerous agencies.</p><p>In March, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dissolved two expert committees that advised the government on its economic statistics, prompting concern among some economists.</p><p>In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced that it had stopped collecting price-related data in three US cities – Buffalo, New York; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Provo, Utah – due to limitations in “current resources”.</p><p>But even before Trump’s return to the White House in January, declining response rates to surveys among the public in recent years had made the collection of data increasingly difficult, raising concerns about accuracy.</p><p>In a poll published by the Reuters news agency last month, 89 of 100 policy experts surveyed said they had at least some concerns about the quality of US economic statistics.</p><p>“Some data is just unreliable because people stopped responding to surveys or the responses became so biased given the nonhomogeneous response rates,” said Michalski, the HEC Paris associate professor.</p><p>“There are no easy remedies often for improving data collection given that many people are not using landlines, are unreachable or provide careless answers to investigators,” he said.</p><p>Even with sound methodology, data are always at risk of manipulation once politicians get involved, Michalski added.</p><p>“Even with correct numbers, it is possible to spin a story about inflation or GDP growth by changing the base years or selecting some specific periods to weave narratives,” he said.</p><p>“The incentives to manipulate and falsify are clearly there. There is little or no punishment.”</p><p>Groshen said that while she does not expect US economic data to stop being reliable in the immediate future, “we seem headed in that direction.”</p><p>“For now, the BLS will continue to operate as it has before,” she said.</p><p>“We will need to start worrying if and when the president’s people are embedded there.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
