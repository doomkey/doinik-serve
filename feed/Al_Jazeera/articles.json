            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On July 27, the Palestinian Ministry of Education released the results of the secondary education certificate exams, also known as tawjihi. Like every year, families sat together, eyes fixed on phone screens, hearts pounding, everyone hoping to be the first to access the ministry’s website and break the news with a jubilant shout. There were joyful tears and celebrations.</p><p>Thousands of students, who had endured months of pressure, sleepless nights and fragile hope, had the exam results in their hands that would determine whether and where they could continue their education.</p><p>But thousands of others – those in Gaza – were sitting in their tents and ruined homes in despair. I am one of them. This is the second year I, along with 31,000 other Palestinians born in 2006, was unable to take the tawjihi. For another year, we have been stripped of our right to continue our education and of the hope to build a future beyond the ruins. Now, we are joined by almost 40,000 students born in 2007, who are also stuck in this dreadful limbo.</p><p>Last year, when the tawjihi results were announced, I was huddled in front of a crackling fire near a tattered tent, far too small to hold my big dreams. The deep frustration I felt didn’t fade – it settled in my mind and stayed. All I could think about was how all my sacrifices, tears, and relentless effort during a full year of studying under difficult circumstances had been for nothing.</p><p>This year, it feels even worse. Not only are my dreams of education crushed, now I struggle to keep myself and my family alive, as Gaza is starving to death.</p><p>In these two years, I have watched our education system destroyed, classroom by classroom. My school, Shohada al-Nusierat, once a place of learning and dreams, first became a shelter housing displaced families and then a target for Israeli bombing. My schoolbag – once filled with notebooks and study materials – now carries essential documents and a change of clothes, always packed and ready in case we are forced to flee our home again. The academic calendar, with all its important dates, has been replaced by a grim schedule of air strikes, displacement, and loss of friends and loved ones.</p><p>Amid this devastation, the Education Ministry has struggled to keep an educational process going. Wanting to give Gaza’s children and youth hope, it has undertaken various initiatives to try to keep students motivated. Makeshift schools have been organised wherever possible, while some university students have been able to continue their education online.</p><p>For us, the tawjihi students, efforts were repeatedly made to set up our exams. Last year, the ministry announced it would conduct the exams in February. I kept studying, despite the harsh reality and the collapse of everything around me, believing this was my chance to move forward.</p><p>February passed, and nothing happened. The ministry then announced that the exams would be held in April. But once again, they were postponed due to the unsafe conditions. Then, in June, the ministry scheduled an online exam for July for students born in 2005 who had either failed their tawjihi or missed some of its exams; they were supposed to have done this exam in December 2023. Some 1,500 students were able to take the tests online.</p><p>This gave me a bit of hope that my turn would also come, but that quickly faded. The Ministry of Education hasn’t given us any updates on the process, and it feels like we’ve been completely forgotten in the shadow of war and starvation.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Some readers may ask themselves, why amid a genocide are Palestinians so preoccupied with an exam?</p><p>You have to understand, tawjihi is a milestone in every Palestinian’s life – a decisive moment that shapes future paths for at least the next five years. It determines whether we can pursue our education in the field we desire and gain admission to top universities.</p><p>But beyond academics, tawjihi carries a much deeper cultural and emotional weight. It is not just an educational phase – it is part of our identity, a symbol of perseverance. In a place where the occupation closes nearly every door, education is able to keep a few doors still open.</p><p>That’s why we celebrate it like a national holiday; the day tawjihi results are released feels like a third Eid for Palestinians. It gives families hope, brings pride to entire neighbourhoods, and keeps alive the dream of a better future.</p><p>Over the many months I waited for the tawjihi, I held on to my dream to study medicine at a prestigious university abroad. I kept applying for scholarships and sending emails to universities across the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, hoping for special consideration as a student affected by war. I pleaded with university administrators to waive the tawjihi certificate requirement.</p><p>But the responses were painfully consistent: “Unfortunately, we cannot consider your application unless you provide your final diploma.”</p><p>Today, despair and helplessness are not the only unwanted visitors I have. Hunger is another one. The starvation has destroyed not only my body but also my mental health.</p><p>Most days, we manage to have one meal. We survive mostly on canned beans, dry bread, or rice without any vegetables or protein. Our bodies are weak, our faces pale, and our energy almost nonexistent. The effects go beyond the physical. Hunger fogs the brain, dulls memory and crushes motivation. It becomes nearly impossible to focus, let alone study for a life-changing exam like the tawjihi. How can I prepare for the most important exam of my life when my stomach is empty and my mind clouded by fatigue and worry?</p><p>It feels as though my youth has been stolen before my eyes, and I can do nothing but watch. While my peers around the world are building their futures, I remain stuck in a place of overwhelming pain and loss.</p><p>As a tawjihi student trapped in a warzone, I urgently call on educational authorities and international institutions to step in and implement immediate solutions to ensure our right to education is not buried under the rubble of war.</p><p>We are not asking for much. Giving us a chance to finish our secondary education in Gaza is not just a matter of logistics, but a matter of justice and future survival.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He called Medvedev’s statements “highly provocative”, adding that his actions were a precaution.</p><p>“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump wrote.</p><p>In the run-up to his presidential campaign, Trump promised to end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours; however, several discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin have since not yielded any results.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3698434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3698434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3698434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-04-26T120300Z_400437346_RC2L5EAM2BY8_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-TRUMP-1746789400.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C568&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3698434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump meet while they attend the funeral of Pope Francis, at the Vatican, April 26, 2025 [Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-submarines-trump-says-he-will-reposition\">What do we know about the submarines Trump says he will reposition?</h2><p>Not much – and we do not know which submarines Trump is referring to.

But, in this case, the social media spat with Medvedev seems to have tipped him over into action.</p><p>Trump and the Russian military leader have been engaged in mud-slinging on social media platforms for some time.</p><p>Earlier, responding to Trump’s new deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Medvedev wrote in a post on X that Trump was playing an “ultimatum game” with Russia.</p><p>“Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!” Medvedev had said.</p><p>Earlier in the week, while announcing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\">trade tariffs for India</a> – along with an extra penalty for buying Russian oil – Trump stated that he did not care if India and Russia “take their dead economies down together”.</p><p>In a Telegram post on Thursday, Medvedev wrote that Trump should “revisit his favourite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical ‘Dead Hand’ can be”.</p><p>Russia’s “Dead Hand system” is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear retaliation mechanism designed to launch a counterstrike even if the Russian leadership is wiped out in a first strike.</p><p>Trump replied: “Tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!”</p><p>Speaking to reporters after his post about the nuclear submarines, Trump said on Friday: “We just have to be careful. And a threat was made and we didn’t think it was appropriate, so I have to be very careful.</p><p>“A threat was made by a former president of Russia, and we’re going to protect our people.”</p><h2 id=\"who-has-more-nuclear-power-russia-or-the-us\">Who has more nuclear power: Russia or the US?</h2><p>Combined, the US and Russia account for nearly 87 percent of the world’s total nuclear arsenal. The geopolitical rivals control about 83 percent of the nuclear warheads actually deployed or ready for operational use.</p><p>Despite significant post-Cold War reductions, global nuclear arsenals remain at a “very high level”, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists. As of January 2025, just nine countries are estimated to possess a total of approximately 12,241 nuclear warheads.</p><p>Today, according to the nonprofit Arms Control Association, the US deploys 1,419 and Russia deploys 1,549 strategic warheads on several hundred bombers and missiles.</p><p>The US conducted its first nuclear test explosion in July 1945; the following month, it dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of <a href=\"/news/2020/8/6/seared-to-death-the-atomic-bomb-attack-on-hiroshima\">Hiroshima</a> and Nagasaki. Four years later, the Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test explosion.</p><p>As of 2025, the US Navy operates 71 submarines, all nuclear‑powered, making it the largest undersea force. This fleet includes 14 Ohio‑class ballistic missile subs (SSBNs), four Ohio‑class converted guided‑missile submarines (SSGNs) loaded with Tomahawk missiles for strikes or special operations, and about 53 fast‑attack submarines designed for intelligence gathering, anti‑submarine warfare and cruise‑missile support.</p><p>By comparison, the Russian Navy fields fewer than 30 nuclear‑powered submarines, including approximately 10 strategic SSBNs, a mix of modern Borei and older Delta IV classes, that carry Bulava missiles.</p><p>It also operates several strategic‑missile cruise boats and about six Akula‑class attack submarines equipped for anti‑ship and multi‑role missions. Russia is investing in modern fleet expansion through the Yasen‑M class.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2774545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2774545\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2774545\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AFP__20240315__34LL93C__v3__HighRes__TopshotRussiaPoliticsVote-1710506193.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dmitry Medvedev,\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2774545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In this pool photograph distributed by Russia’s state news agency Sputnik, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president now serving as deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, casts his ballot in Russia’s presidential election in the Moscow region on March 15, 2024 [Yekaterina Shrukina/Poll/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"has-russia-responded-to-trump-s-submarine-manoeuvre\">Has Russia responded to Trump’s submarine manoeuvre?</h2><p>No. Neither the Kremlin nor Medvedev has publicly responded to Trump’s order to move two nuclear submarines following their war of words.</p><p>Viktor Vodolatsky, a senior Russian lawmaker and deputy chairman of the State Duma’s committee on Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) affairs, however, stated that Russia possesses “significantly more nuclear submarines in the world’s oceans” than the US, claiming US subs have “long been under their control” and, therefore, no specific response is required.</p><p>Last month, the US President said he was “disappointed” with Putin.</p><p>“We’ll have a great conversation. I’ll say: ‘That’s good, I’ll think we’re close to getting it done,’ and then he’ll knock down a building in Kyiv,” he told the BBC in an interview.</p><p>On Friday, in an apparent reference to Trump’s comment, Putin said: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.”</p><p>On a ceasefire with Kyiv, Putin said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine; however, he has not given any indication that Russia is willing to achieve it any quicker.</p><h2 id=\"will-this-move-escalate-or-de-escalate-tensions\">Will this move escalate or de-escalate tensions?</h2><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2017, during his first term as US president, Trump announced that he had sent two nuclear submarines to the Korean Peninsula. The move appeared to de-escalate tension. Soon afterwards, he held a meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.</p><p>Whether this latest move will lead to a new meeting with Putin is yet to be seen, however.</p><p>However, Hans M Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s move “is an escalation of rhetoric and potentially of tensions”.</p><p>Kristensen said it was inappropriate for the US to be hinting at a nuclear threat at this stage. “Despite challenges, US-Russian relations are nowhere near the point where nuclear weapons serve a direct role other than in the background as a generic deterrent,” he said, adding, “Russia has discovered this the hard way by making so many nuclear threats that the West began to consider them to be just words.”</p><p>Furthermore, it is unlikely that Trump’s move will spur Russia on towards a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine any sooner, Kristensen said.</p><p>“The US nuclear submarines are always deployed, including in the Atlantic, and Russia knows that,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed “long before” the end of Trump’s term in office in January 2029.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-paragraph\">She also said that the president and other donors would pay for the renovations, but declined to give details.

The North Portico followed in 1829 during Andrew Jackson’s presidency, establishing the iconic facade of the White House as it is known today.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-paragraph\">Over the course of the 19th century, amendments were made slowly. Running water, gas lighting, and furnishings were gradually added.
