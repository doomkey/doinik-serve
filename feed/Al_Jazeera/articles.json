He originally moved to the US without documentation as a teenager.</p><p>He then became the highest-profile case among more than 200 people sent to the notorious <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/1/why-trump-and-bukele-are-destroying-kilmar-abrego-garcias-life\">El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison</a> as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in the US.</p><p>He was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March. A court later ordered his return to the US, where he was detained again, as immigration officials sought to deport him to a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/us-judge-asks-for-assurance-abrego-garcia-wont-be-deported-to-liberia\">series of African countries</a> instead of El Salvador.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"judicial-activism\">‘Judicial activism’</h2><p>The Department of Homeland Security slammed Thursday’s ruling and said it would appeal, labelling the decision as “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during President Barack Obama’s administration.</p><p>“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.</p><p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said he expected his client’s ordeal was far from over, and he was preparing to defend him against further deportation efforts.</p><p>“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.</p><p>“We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”</p><p>The lawyer said the judge’s ruling had made it clear that the government could not detain a person indefinitely without legal authority, adding that Abrego Garcia had already “endured more than anyone should ever have to”.</p><h2 id=\"legal-battles-ongoing\">Legal battles ongoing</h2><p>Abrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him due to the attention his case received.</p><p>Since his return, federal authorities have also filed charges against Abrego Garcia for alleged human smuggling related to a 2022 traffic stop.</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.</p><p>In her ruling on Thursday, Judge Xinis said Trump lawyers “affirmatively misled” the court, including falsely claiming that Costa Rica had rescinded an offer to accept Abrego Garcia.</p><p>Abrego Garcia has said he was willing to resettle there in the event he was deported from the US.</p><p>In a separate proceeding, Abrego Garcia has also petitioned to reopen his immigration case to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/kilmar-abrego-garcia-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us-in-bid-to-avoid-deportation\">seek asylum</a> in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In Al-Gezira state, witnesses described RSF forces singling out lighter-skinned girls and women aged 14 to 30 as “trophies”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Just last week, the Sudan Doctors Network, a medical monitoring organisation, documented 19 additional rape cases at al-Afad Camp in al-Dabba, where women fleeing the recently fallen city of el-Fasher were attacked by RSF forces. Two survivors are pregnant and receiving care.</p><h3>Fighting for control of Kordofan</h3><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The main fighting has shifted from Darfur, following the RSF capture of el-Fasher in October, to the vast central Kordofan region, which sits between territory controlled by the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the east and RSF-held areas in the west.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The paramilitary force currently holds a commanding position and has been advancing on urban centres across West Kordofan.</p><p>After RSF forces <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/south-sudan-army-to-secure-critical-heglig-oilfield-in-sudan-war-spillover\">captured</a> the Heglig oilfield near the South Sudan border on December 8, both warring parties agreed to allow South Sudanese troops to secure the site, which serves as a critical economic lifeline for both countries.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>South Sudan confirmed that seven of its soldiers were killed on Thursday in a drone strike by the SAF.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On December 5, RSF fighters attacked a preschool in Kalogi locality, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/rsf-kills-dozens-mostly-children-in-war-torn-sudans-kalogi-saf-sources\">killing</a> more than 100 people, including 46 children. The attackers then targeted paramedics and civilians who rushed to assist victims in what authorities described as deliberate suicide drone strikes.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/un-warns-sudans-kordofan-faces-mass-atrocities-as-fighting-spreads\">warned</a> days earlier that Kordofan faces “another wave of mass atrocities,” saying history was “repeating itself” after international warnings before el-Fasher’s fall went largely unheeded.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Since late October, the UN has documented at least 269 civilian deaths from bombardment, artillery fire and summary killings in the region, though communication blackouts suggest the actual toll is far higher.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The conflict has displaced 12.4 million people and forced 3.3 million to flee as refugees since erupting in April 2023.</p><p>Massad Boulos, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, met this week with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, with both governments committing to “cut external financial and military backing for the belligerents” fuelling the war.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Washington sanctioned four Colombian nationals this week for running a recruitment network that has brought more than 300 military veterans to fight for the RSF, though the measures did not target a United Arab Emirates company that investigators say arranged the deployments.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The UAE has repeatedly denied supporting the paramilitary force.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Anyone doubting the intentional lethality of coercive economic measures would do well to recall the 1996 <a href=\"/opinions/2022/3/25/lets-remember-madeleine-albright-as-who-she-really-was\">response</a> of then-US ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright to the estimate that half a million Iraqi children had thus far perished as a result of the US sanctions regime: “We think the price is worth it.”</p><p>Sanctions on Venezuela were then drastically intensified by Trump in 2019, with an eye to assisting <a href=\"/tag/juan-guaido/\">Juan Guaido</a> – the little-known right-wing character who had spontaneously appointed himself interim president of Venezuela – in his efforts to oust Maduro.</p><p>Those efforts were unsuccessful, and Guaido ended up in Miami, but sanctions continued to wreak devastating havoc. In March 2019, Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href=\"https://2017-2021-translations.state.gov/2019/03/11/remarks-to-the-press/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boasted</a> eloquently to the press of the effectiveness of economic warfare: “The circle is tightening. The humanitarian crisis is increasing by the hour … You can see the increasing pain and suffering that the Venezuelan people are suffering from.”</p><p>Indeed, while the official narrative is that sanctions are meant to target the powers that be, it is the general public that pays the price. In the years following Guaido’s failed auto-election, the “suffering that the Venezuelan people are suffering from” became ever more apparent, and by 2020, former UN Special Rapporteur Alfred de Zayas <a href=\"https://venezuelanalysis.com/sanctions-kill/\">estimated</a> that 100,000 Venezuelans had died on account of sanctions.</p><p>In 2021, UN expert Alena Douhan reported that the economic blockade had rendered more than 2.5 million Venezuelans severely food insecure. This is to say nothing of <a href=\"/video/the-stream/2023/6/13/how-are-us-sanctions-affecting-life-in-venezuela\">outbreaks of previously controlled diseases</a>, stunted growth among children, and shortages of water and electricity.</p><p>It can meanwhile be safely filed under the “can’t make this sh*t up” category that, at the very moment he is going after alleged narco-traffickers in Venezuela, Trump chose to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/juan-orlando-hernandez-pardon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pardon</a> Juan Orlando Hernandez, the right-wing former narco-president of Honduras who was <a href=\"/opinions/2024/3/17/the-criminal-hypocrisy-of-hernandezs-drug-conviction-in-a-us-court\">convicted</a> last year in a US federal court.</p><p>In October, Trump <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/23/venezuela-a-not-so-covert-cia-disaster-in-the-making\">authorised</a> the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela – the same CIA, mind you, that has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/23/venezuela-a-not-so-covert-cia-disaster-in-the-making\">up to its eyeballs</a> in the drug trade since forever. Now with the tanker hijacking, the administration has underscored its acute disregard for anything resembling civilised diplomacy.</p><p>The other day, I spoke with a young Venezuelan man whom I met in the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/22/the-darien-gap-closure-border-theatre-in-the-jungle\">Darien Gap</a> in 2023 as he made his way towards the US – one of millions of Venezuelans forced to leave home in search of a life that is economically sustainable.</p><p>After almost drowning in the river as he crossed from Mexico into the US, he was detained for a month and then provisionally released into the country. Two years later, he was captured by ICE agents in California, detained for several more months, and then deported to Caracas.</p><p>When I asked him his thoughts on Trump’s current machinations in Venezuela, he said simply: “I have no words.”</p><p>And as the US barrels towards another surreal war armed with blatant lies, words are indeed often hard to come by.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Africa’s forests and woodlands have historically served as a carbon sink. Now, they are contributing to widening the global greenhouse gas emissions gap that needs to be filled to stay within the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report stated.</p><p>The 2015 Paris Agreement is a treaty between 196 countries acting to mitigate <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/un-climate-talks-go-into-overtime-as-divisions-over-fossil-fuels-persist\">climate change</a> and to keep the world’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-study-found\">What has the study found?</h2><p>In short, Africa’s forests are facing “increasing pressures” which have led to a decline in their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Currently, Africa’s forests are responsible for about one-fifth of global carbon removal. The largest of the continent’s forests is the Congo rainforest – the second largest in the world after the Amazon, and often dubbed the “lungs of Africa”.</p><p>The report found that between 2011 and 2017, Africa’s forests lost 106 million tonnes in biomass – living organisms such as plants – each year. This means their ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere has been severely reduced.</p><p>The worst-affected areas were reportedly the tropical broadleaf forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and other parts of West Africa.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-caused-this\">What has caused this?</h2><p>Carbon output has risen exponentially in the industrial age and is largely caused by burning <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/cop30-draft-text-urges-more-funds-for-poorer-countries-omits-fossil-fuels\">fossil fuels</a> such as coal, oil and gas.</p><p>While forests were adept at absorbing this excess carbon for some time, their ability to do so has been impacted by increased logging to make way for agricultural land and to provide materials for infrastructure projects.</p><p>“The observed trends may be further exacerbated in the future by population growth in Africa, the increasing export demand, particularly from Asia, and the resulting pressure on natural resources (agricultural expansion for commodity crop, timber and fuelwood),” the report found.</p><p>“The long-term persistence of these trends will depend on local governance and whether resources are used sustainably,” it added.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-carbon-sink-and-how-does-it-work\">What is a carbon sink, and how does it work?</h2><p>A “sink” is any area of land or sea that absorbs more carbon dioxide than it produces.</p><p>On land, these areas tend to be abundant in bio material such as plants and trees, which absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store it in their biomass and in the soil. Farming, however, can disrupt this process in the soil.</p><p>The largest carbon sink in the world is the ocean, which absorbs about one-quarter of the Earth’s carbon output, according to ClientEarth, an environmental organisation. Carbon dioxide dissolves on the surface of the water and marine organisms absorb it via photosynthesis.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-areas-of-the-world-are-at-risk\">Which other areas of the world are at risk?</h2><p>The Amazon rainforest is another area of concern.</p><p>Last year, the United States-based nonprofit Amazon Conservation found that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was also eliminating trees that could absorb carbon.</p><p>Cleared land is often used for farming and livestock. These also tend to produce more emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat and produce carbon dioxide.</p><p>But due to the Brazilian government’s crackdown on deforestation, fears that the Amazon could also stop being a carbon sink have so far been averted.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental non-governmental organisation, the loss of the world’s forest carbon sinks will have “catastrophic consequences for people and the planet”.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-solution\">What’s the solution?</h2><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The authors of the report noted that a Brazilian initiative, known as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), is trying to raise $100bn, which will be used to compensate countries that leave their forests untouched. So far, however, only $6.5bn has been raised by a small number of donor countries.</p><p>The report, therefore, called for more efforts to be focused on protecting Africa’s carbon sink and countering climate change.</p><p>“The world otherwise risks losing an important carbon sink needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report found.</p><p>“Reversing biomass losses in Africa requires actions in the political, economic and societal spheres, to promote capacity building [and] improve forest governance,” it added.</p><p>Ultimately, however, more must be done to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, experts say.</p><p>Heiko Balzter, professor of physical geography at the University of Leicester and one of the authors of the report, told New Scientist magazine: “If we are losing the tropical forests as one of the means of mitigating climate change, then we basically have to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning even faster to get to near-zero emissions.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

With Storm Byron descending upon the enclave, a sense of terror has seized a population already exhausted from two years of <a href=\"/features/2025/12/2/israels-genocide-in-gaza-has-not-stopped-despite-ceasefire-analysts\">Israel’s genocidal war</a> with its unrelenting bombardment, starvation and chaos.</p><p>For the 1.5 million Palestinians living under plastic sheets and tattered tarps, the storm means something more than just bad weather. It’s another danger piled on top of the current <a href=\"/features/longform/2023/12/24/staying-warm-in-gaza-a-battle-for-survival\">battle for survival.</a></p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>For several days, meteorologists have warned that heavy rainfall and strong winds could hit the strip today, tomorrow and over the weekend, risking flash flooding and significant wind damage. What is certain, though, is that Gaza is not facing this storm with ready infrastructure, stocked shelters or functioning drainage systems.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It faces it with tents propped up with pieces of scrap metal, paths that become mud rivers after only one night of rain and families who have nothing left to protect.</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-a-survival-strategy\">Solidarity a survival strategy</h2><p>In the camps of Gaza City, the scenes of vulnerability are everywhere. Most tents are constructed from aid tarpaulins, pieces of plastic salvaged from rubble and blankets tied to recycled wooden poles. Many sag visibly in the middle; others are erected inadequately, so much so that they quiver and flap violently under the slightest breeze.</p><p>“When the wind starts, we all hold the poles to keep the tent from falling,” said Hani Ziara, a father sheltering in western Gaza City after his home was destroyed months ago.</p><p>His tent was flooded last night in the heavy rain, and his children had to stay outside in the cold. Hani wonders painfully what else he can do to protect his children from the rain and strong winds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167385\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167385\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture4-1765452701.jpg?w=430&amp;resize=430%2C330&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Palestinian father taking shelter in a tent in Gaza City.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hani Zaira, a Palestinian father taking shelter in a destroyed building in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In many camps, the ground was already soft from previous rainfall. Wet sand and mud stick to shoes, blankets and cooking pots as people shuffle through. Trenches dug by volunteers to divert water often collapse within hours. With nowhere else to go, families who live in low-lying areas are preparing for the worst: that floodwaters will be pushed directly into their tents.</p><p>Stocking up on food, storing clean water and securing shelter are the most basic steps when people prepare for a storm, but that is considered a luxury for the displaced of Gaza.</p><p>Most families receive scant water deliveries, going sometimes days without enough to cook or wash. Food supplies are equally strained, and while irregular aid distributions provide basics like rice or canned beans, the quantities seldom last more than a few days. Preparing for a storm by cooking ahead, gathering dry goods or storing fuel is simply not possible.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167412\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167412\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture5-1765453479.jpg?w=438&amp;resize=438%2C275&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mervit, a Palestinian mother of 5 children displaced near the Gaza Sea Port.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“We could not sleep last night. Our tent was flooded with rainwater. Everything we had was flushed out by water. We want to prepare, but how?” asked Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port. She added, “We barely have enough food for tonight. We can’t save what we don’t have.”</p><p>Despite poverty, solidarity has become Gaza’s strongest survival strategy. Neighbours, with whatever they have, help secure the tents. Young men go through the rubble and scavenge for metal and wood remains to serve as temporary posts. The women organise collective cooking so that hot meals can be distributed to families in need, particularly those with young children or elderly family members, whenever possible.</p><p>These unofficial networks become more active the closer a storm gets. Volunteers trudge from tent to tent, helping families raise sleeping areas off the ground, patch holes in canopies with plastic sheets, and dig drainage channels. Crowds try to move those who are in precarious, extremely exposed areas to other locations, sharing information about safer places.</p><h2 id=\"we-are-exhausted\">‘We are exhausted’</h2><p>Beyond physical danger, the psychological impact is deep. After months of displacement, loss and deprivation, another crisis – this time, not war, but forces of nature – feels overwhelming.</p><p>“Our tents were destroyed. We are exhausted,” said Wissam Naser. “We have no strength left. Every day there is a new fear: hunger, cold, disease, now the storm.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture1-1765454064.jpg?w=480&amp;resize=480%2C311&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Many residents describe the feeling of being sandwiched between the sky and the ground, exposed on both ends and unable to protect their families from either.</p><p>As clouds mass along Gaza’s shore, families prepare to take a hit. Some weigh down tent walls against the wind with rocks and sandbags. Others push children’s blankets to the driest corner, hoping a roof will last. Most don’t have a plan. They just wait.</p><p>The storm will not be another single-night affair for the displaced in Gaza. It would be a further reminder of how fragile life has become, how survival depends not on preparedness but rather on endurance.</p><p>They wait because they have no alternative. They prepare with what little they have. They pray that this time, the winds will be merciful.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s the only state,” the president said, before referencing his three presidential bids. “It’s funny because I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn’t working on it very hard.”</p><p>Trump then proceeded to denounce the Indiana Senate president, Rodric Bray, and threatened to support a primary challenge against the Indiana leader.</p><p>“He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does,” Trump said.</p><p>“It’s, I think, in two years, but I’m sure he’ll go down. He’ll go down. I’ll certainly support anybody that wants to go against it.”</p><h2 id=\"fractures-in-the-caucus\">Fractures in the caucus</h2><p>Currently, Indiana sends nine Congress members to the US House of Representatives, one for each of its nine districts. Two of those seats are currently occupied by Democrats.</p><p>Republican leaders in the state, however, had proposed a new map of congressional districts that sought to disempower Democratic voters in the state, clearing the way for conservative candidates to claim all nine seats in next year’s midterm races.</p><p>The proposed map was part of a nationwide effort by the Trump administration to defend Republican control in the US Congress.</p><p>Already, the partisan map had passed the lower chamber of Indiana’s legislature. On December 5, Indiana’s House of Representatives voted 57 to 41 to send House Bill 1032 to the state Senate.</p><p>The bill had the backing of Indiana’s Republican Governor Mike Braun, who encouraged the state senators to emulate their colleagues in the lower chamber.</p><p>But even before the bill arrived in the state Senate, there were cracks in the Republican caucus. Twelve Republicans in the state House broke ranks to vote against the map.</p><p>And certain Republican state Senators likewise expressed reticence.</p><p>Some Republicans, like Indiana state Senator Greg Walker, had a history of opposing redistricting efforts. He was quoted in the Indiana Capital Chronicle as saying, “I cannot, myself, support the bill for which there must be a legal injunction in order for it to be found constitutional.”</p><p>Partisan redistricting has long been a controversial practice in US politics, with opponents calling the practice undemocratic and discriminatory.</p><p>Critics also pointed out that the Indiana proposal would force some voters in urban centres like Indianapolis to commute more than 200 kilometres (124 miles) for in-person voting.</p><p>Walker joined a total of 21 Republican state Senators, including Bray, in voting against the redistricting bill on Thursday.</p><h2 id=\"a-nationwide-campaign\">A nationwide campaign</h2><p>But the Trump administration had invested significant time and effort into swaying the vote.</p><p>In October, Vice President JD Vance travelled to the Hoosier State to try to convince wary Republicans. US House Speaker Mike Johnson reportedly made personal phone calls to state leaders. And a day before the critical state Senate vote, Trump took to social media with a mixture of cajoling and pressure.</p><p>“I love the State of Indiana, and have won it, including Primaries, six times, all by MASSIVE Majorities,” Trump began in a winding, 414-word <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115698333420423237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“Importantly, it now has a chance to make a difference in Washington, D.C., in regard to the number of House seats we have that are necessary to hold the Majority against the Radical Left Democrats. Every other State has done Redistricting, willingly, openly, and easily.”</p><p>Currently, the US House of Representatives holds a narrow 220-member Republican majority, out of a total of 435 seats.</p><p>All of those seats, however, will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections, and Democrats are hoping to flip the chamber to their control.</p><p>Starting in June, reports began to emerge that Trump was petitioning the state legislature in the right-wing stronghold of Texas to redistrict, in an effort to help conservative candidates sweep up five extra congressional seats.</p><p>Texas Republicans complied, and in August, the state legislature <a href=\"/news/2025/8/29/texas-governor-greg-abbott-signs-trump-backed-redistricting-bill\">embraced a new redistricted map</a>, overcoming a walkout from state Democrats.</p><p>Republicans in other states, including Missouri and North Carolina, have followed suit, passing new maps that seek to increase right-wing gains in the midterm races.</p><p>But Democrats have fired back. In November, California voters passed a referendum to suspend their independent districting commission and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/california-proposition-50-on-redistricting-set-to-pass-in-blow-to-trump\">adopt a Democrat-leaning map</a> created by state lawmakers.</p><p>Indiana, however, appeared poised to buck <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps\">the redistricting trend</a>. In Wednesday’s lengthy post, Trump warned that the state could put Republican power “at risk” if it failed to pass a new map.</p><p>He also called Bray and other Republican splinter votes “SUCKERS” for the Democrats.</p><p>“Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“One of my favorite States, Indiana, will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!”</p><p>In the wake of Thursday’s defeat, Trump and his allies doubled down on their threats to remove the 21 Republican state senators who voted against the bill from office.</p><p>“I am very disappointed that a small group of misguided State Senators have partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity,” Governor Braun <a href=\"https://x.com/GovBraun/status/1999234066680512867\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media, calling it a decision to “reject the leadership of President Trump”.</p><p>“Ultimately, decisions like this carry political consequences. I will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Zelenskyy said the main issues of contention were control of the Donetsk region in the Donbas, and future governance of the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-situation-critical-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant\">Zaporizhzhia</a> nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control.</p><p>Zelenskyy pushed back against the idea of a unilateral withdrawal of troops from the Donetsk, where Ukraine controls one-fifth of the territory. “Why doesn’t the other side of the war pull back the same distance in the other direction?” he said, adding there were “a great many questions” still unresolved.</p><p>After talks on Thursday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Ukrainian president said that security guarantees were “among the most critical elements for all subsequent steps.</p><p>The document on security guarantees would, he said, have to provide “concrete answers” on actions that would be taken if “Russia decides to launch its aggression again”.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"conflict-is-at-our-door\">‘Conflict is at our door’</h2><p>On Thursday, NATO chief Mark Rutte warned that Russia could be ready to use military force against the alliance within five years, urging members to “rapidly increase defence spending and production”.</p><p>“Conflict is at our door,” he said in a speech in Berlin. “We are Russia’s next target. I fear that too many are quietly complacent. Too many don’t feel the urgency. And too many believe that time is on our side. It is not. The time for action is now.”</p><p>In other developments, Ukraine’s allies in the so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/zelenskyy-rallies-key-allies-as-ukraine-faces-russian-and-us-pressure\">Coalition of the Willing</a> discussed progress on mobilising <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine\">frozen Russian sovereign assets</a> during a virtual meeting on Thursday, according to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office.</p><p>The European Commission is pushing to tap some 200 billion euros ($232bn) of Russian central bank assets immobilised in the bloc after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to provide Kyiv with much-needed funding.</p><p>The sanctions freezing the Russian funds currently require unanimous renewal twice a year, leaving them vulnerable to a veto from Hungary, the EU country closest to Russia.</p><p>But a majority of ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 nations agreed on Thursday on a way of keeping Russian funds frozen as long as required without the need for renewal every six months.</p><p>The idea, which still needs formal approval by the finance ministers meeting on Friday, is not a done deal. Belgium, which, as the home of Euroclear – the organisation holding most of the funds, fears legal or financial retribution from Moscow.</p><p>Trump has largely sought to sideline <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/ukraines-allies-say-efforts-to-end-russias-war-at-critical-moment\">European nations</a> from the peace process, preferring to deal directly with Moscow and Kyiv in shuttle diplomacy led by special envoy Witkoff and, lately, his son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>On Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met Rutte in Berlin, said further talks with the Americans were planned this weekend, and an international meeting on Ukraine could happen at the start of next week.</p><p class=\"p2\">Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine said Merz and Rutte “agreed that Ukraine was closer to a ceasefire than has ever been”.</p><p class=\"p2\">“They also agreed that any territorial concessions to be made by Ukraine must be approved by Kyiv, and that in any peace negotiations moving forward, that European leaders must be involved,” she said.</p><p>The White House said Trump would send a representative to talks in Europe this weekend if there was a real chance of signing a peace agreement.</p><p>Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US president was “extremely frustrated with both sides” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"russia-claims-to-hold-strategic-initiative\">Russia claims to hold ‘strategic initiative’</h2><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to portray himself as negotiating from a position of strength, claimed on Thursday in a call with military leaders that Russian armed forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” on the battlefield.</p><p>In 2022, Russia claimed to formally annex the Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, despite not having full control over them. Putin has said that Moscow is ready to fight on to seize the land it claims if Kyiv does not give it up.</p><p>Lieutenant General Sergei Medvedev told Putin on Thursday that troops had taken the city of Siversk in the Donetsk region, where fighting has been fierce in recent months.</p><p>The claim was denied by the Ukrainian military’s Operation Task Force East unit, which said Russia was “trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavourable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches”.</p><p>The task force also said Ukrainian forces were holding the northern districts of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/ukraine-reports-large-russian-mechanised-assault-in-battle-for-pokrovsk\">Pokrovsk</a>, a key former logistics hub in Donetsk that Russian commanders said came under Moscow’s control last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian long-range drones hit a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea belonging to Russian oil company Lukoil, according to a report by The Associated Press, citing an anonymous official in the Security Service of Ukraine.</p><p>The rig reportedly took four hits, halting the extraction of oil and gas from more than 20 wells, according to the official. Russian officials and Lukoil made no immediate comment.</p><p>Ukraine also launched one of its biggest drone attacks of the war overnight, halting flights in and out of all four Moscow airports for seven hours.</p><p>Zelenskyy told the Coalition of the Willing meeting that a ceasefire was needed for elections to be held in Ukraine. The leader, whose term expired last year, is facing renewed pressure from Trump to hold a vote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Netflix’s move came with widespread antitrust concern, with progressives like Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren saying it would limit access for consumers and filmmakers in Hollywood. The White House also said it would watch the deal with heavy scrutiny.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery, however, was undercut by a slew of conflicts of interest and connections to the administration of United States President Donald Trump, and accompanying concerns about freedom of expression.</p><p>Those come in addition to recent changes at CBS News, where a conservative opinion writer has been brought in as the top boss, and there is pressure on coverage critical of Trump, including by late-night show hosts.</p><h2 id=\"kushner-conflict\">Kushner conflict</h2><p>One of the sources of funds for Paramount’s bid is Jared Kushner’s investment firm Affinity Partners, alongside financing from both Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds. Kushner is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and served in an advisory role during the first Trump administration.</p><p>“If you were teaching a class at business school on conflicts of interest, this would be Exhibit A,” Nell Minow, chair of Portland, Maine-based ValueEdge Advisors, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Trump on Monday told reporters that neither Paramount nor Netflix “are friends of mine” and that he had not spoken to Kushner about the deal.</p><p>However, just last week, Trump told reporters that he would be involved in the decision about whether the Warner Bros-Netflix merger was to go through.</p><p>“I’ll be involved in that decision,” Trump told reporters as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for its annual awards show.</p><p>The Kushner connection is far from the only conflict looming over the hostile takeover. Paramount is now owned and led by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder and a close ally of the president.</p><h2 id=\"pressing-the-press\">Pressing the press</h2><p>In the weeks before Paramount’s merger with Skydance, its CBS News network settled a lawsuit brought by Trump over an interview with then Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been doctored.</p><p>The network described the allegations as baseless, but settled anyway for $16m. On the heels of that decision, Bill Owens, the executive producer of the show 60 Minutes that had been at the heart of Trump’s attacks, resigned. National Public Radio, citing two CBS staffers, said that Owens had “lost independence from corporate”.</p><p>Days later, late-night host Stephen Colbert, also on CBS, called the settlement a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bribe</a>”, and soon after the company announced that The Late Show, which he has hosted since 2015, would be cancelled in 2026.</p><p>Although the show was losing money, the timing of the decision to cut it was widely viewed as political.</p><p>Paramount’s merger with Skydance was approved a few weeks later. Since then, CBS News – which the president has long accused of being unfair to him – has made decisions that, critics say, are increasingly aligned with Trump’s preferences.</p><p>Among them was the appointment of ombudsman Ken Weinstein, tasked with overseeing fairness and adjudicating bias allegations. His appointment itself has been viewed as partisan. Weinstein was once a nominee to be the ambassador to Japan during Trump’s first term and has no media background.</p><p>In October, Paramount purchased The Free Press, a right-leaning publication, for $150m and installed its founder, Bari Weiss, as CBS’s editor-in-chief even though she had no prior TV experience.</p><p>“They hired an opinion columnist, Bari Weiss, to run a news network, paying enough for her services, [money they could have used] to retain plenty of the journalists they laid off. Not because running a successful Substack somehow qualifies her to manage a broadcast news giant, but because her politics are aligned with their own and, to a large degree, Trump’s,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Since her appointment, prominent anchors and producers have resigned. Claudia Milne, who oversaw standards and practices, and John Dickerson, co-anchor of the CBS Evening News, who has been with the network since 2009, both said they were leaving, as did the show’s other anchor, Maurice DuBois.</p><p>On Wednesday, CBS News announced that Tony Dokoupil would anchor the flagship evening news programme. Dokoupil has been serving as a co-anchor for CBS Mornings and joined the network in 2016.</p><p>In August, Margaret Brennan, moderator for another prominent CBS show, Face the Nation, a Sunday public affairs programme, interviewed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The interview was edited, a standard practice given time constraints. The administration complained, and the network changed its policy.</p><p>But that directive wasn’t the case for 60 Minutes. In October, longtime CBS News talent Norah O’Donnell asked the president about his pardoning of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. In 2023, Zhao had pleaded guilty to money laundering but now had business dealings connected with the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.</p><p>The network opted not to run that part of the segment, which Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1985230247093047608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a> was comparable to the very same allegation Trump made against the Harris interview of being “doctored”.</p><p>The network also cut the president’s remarks about the settlement.</p><p>“Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen in a transcript</a> of the full 73-minute interview that was published online.</p><p>The network complied with the president’s request. It did not air that part of the interview.</p><p>The president continues pressuring the network, while simultaneously praising the new management’s apparent friendliness.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After 60 Minutes aired an interview with outgoing Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – who has recently become more critical of the president – Trump erupted on social media.</p><p>“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor; it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!” he wrote on Truth Social.</p><h2 id=\"political-manoeuvring\">‘Political manoeuvring’</h2><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery includes CNN, another major news network.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that David Ellison, on a trip to the White House, told the president that Paramount would make “sweeping changes” to CNN, a frequent focus of Trump’s anger, if the merger were to go through.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump weighed in on the possible sale, saying, “I think CNN should be sold.”</p><p>On CNBC, David Ellison floated the idea of merging the networks and their respective newsgathering operations.</p><p>“We want to build a scaled news service that is basically, fundamentally, in the trust business, that is in the truth business, and that speaks to the 70 percent of Americans that are in the middle,” Ellison told the network’s David Faber.</p><p>But media experts are wary of such a move.</p><p>“It’s fair to say that a Netflix purchase of Warner Brothers would raise legitimate antitrust questions. However, the alleged political manoeuvring by Paramount to bring CNN and CBS under the same corporate roof – with implicit pledges to make both outlets’ news coverage more friendly to this administration – is even more concerning,” Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This would constitute a dramatic increase in the concentration of news media under the control of a single owner with close ties to the party in power. It’s a choice between two bad options, but as currently structured, a Paramount purchase would be objectively worse for American democracy and freedom of the press.”</p><p>The Guardian also reported that Larry Ellison even floated cutting anchors critical of the president, including Erin Burnett, who hosts a primetime show on the cable network. The elder Ellison is not directly involved with Paramount-Skydance.</p><p>“Throwing out the credibility of CNN and other WBD [Warner Bros Discovery] holdings might benefit the Ellisons in their efforts to curry favour with Trump, but it’s not going to benefit anyone else, including shareholders, in the long run,” Stern added.</p><p>Neither Paramount-Skydance nor Warner Bros responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>If Netflix ends up as the buyer instead, CNN would not face similar concerns. The focus would shift to the merger’s potential impact on the film and TV production industry, particularly fears that it could limit competition.</p><p>Netflix has shown no interest in acquiring CNN or other legacy cable properties such as TNT and TBS. Those would instead be spun off into a standalone company called Discovery Global.</p></div></div></body></html>"
