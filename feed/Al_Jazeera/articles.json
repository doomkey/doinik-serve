The incident has thrust Minneapolis into the international spotlight, with conflicting interpretations of the 40-second confrontation dividing officials and activists.</p><p>Trump administration officials have been accused of blatantly lying about the shooting events and appear to be clearly contradicted by video analysis.</p><p>Social media has been flooded in recent weeks with dozens of videos showing federal agents interrogating members of the Somali community and demanding proof of citizenship, amplifying fears among residents.</p><p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the operation has been carried out “indiscriminately” and showed a lack of knowledge of the status of the city’s population.</p><p>“I think the initial impetus to come to Minnesota, was go to Minnesota, arrest and deport a bunch of Somali people,” Frey said at a news conference last week.</p><p>“And then they get here and they realize that the Somali people who would be arrested or deported are all legal. They’re all US citizens.”</p><p>Speaking on Monday, Frey outlined the devastating effect on daily life across the Twin Cities.</p><p>“The damage that we are suffering right now … it’s schools shutting down, it’s businesses closing, it’s people being afraid to go out and get groceries and therefore are going hungry,” he said. “This is intentionally putting us in a very difficult position that is not pro-business and is not pro-safety.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“If this were about fraud, then you’d see an invasion perhaps of accountants. But that’s not what you see. What you see is people being indiscriminately taken off our streets,” he said.</p><p>St Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American immigrant, revealed she now carries her passport and identification documents everywhere. “Because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained,” she said. “We are being attacked as American citizens right now.”</p><p>On Monday evening, hundreds assembled at a strip mall parking area in St Cloud, northwest of Minneapolis, after word spread that more than two dozen ICE officers had gathered near Somali-owned businesses.</p><p>Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar described the situation as “a dangerous time” and called the government’s actions “unconscionable”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ellison said Minnesota’s non-citizen immigrant population stands at just 1.5 percent, half the national average and lower than Utah, Texas, and Florida, suggesting the state has been targeted for political reasons.</p><p>“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to like our state very much,” he said.</p><p>The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, a legal advocacy organisation for migrants, said the federal operation that began more than a month ago was happening under what it termed “the racist pretense of fraud investigations targeting the Somali community”.</p><p>DHS has defended the operation, with Secretary Kristi Noem telling Fox News on Sunday that additional officers would ensure agents “do so safely” amid ongoing protests.</p><p>More than 2,000 arrests have been made since December.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, its transponder was transmitting a military tail number.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The report, if true, offers new details that complicate the narrative around the Trump administration’s boat-bombing campaign and the inaugural September 2 strike.</p><p>The Trump administration has repeatedly argued that attacking the boats is necessary to prevent illicit drugs from reaching US shores from South America.</p><p>In a memo to Congress, Trump also <a href=\"/news/2025/10/2/trump-memo-says-us-in-non-international-armed-conflict-with-cartels\">indicated</a> that he considers the US to be in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, whom he described as unlawful combatants.</p><p>However, there is no legal basis for such a determination, and drug trafficking is considered a criminal offence, not equivalent to an armed attack.</p><p>Human rights experts, including at the United Nations, have also characterised the attacks as an act of extrajudicial killing and a violation of international law.</p><p>In describing the September 2 attack, Trump accused the targets of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation “operating under the control” of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/explosions-heard-over-venezuelan-capital-caracas-amid-us-tensions\">Venezuela’s then-President Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>The US military earlier this month abducted Maduro and brought him to New York to face criminal charges related to drug trafficking.</p><p>A brief 29-second video accompanied Trump’s announcement of the attack, showing a boat engulfed in a single blast.</p><p>But in December, The Washington Post reported that the attack had instead been a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/us-lawmakers-urge-release-of-video-of-double-tap-boat-strike-in-caribbean\">“double tap”</a>, with US Navy Admiral Frank Bradley allegedly authorising a second missile blast to kill two previously unreported survivors.</p><p>That reporting likewise raised concerns that a war crime had taken place, as it is considered illegal to attack shipwrecked adversaries even in a wartime context.</p><p>The new report from The New York Times raises further questions about that “double-tap” strike, including whether the survivors might have saved themselves had the aeroplane’s military markings been visible.</p><p>The sources told the Times that the aircraft swooped in low enough for the people on board the boat to see it.</p><p>“Two survivors of the initial attack later appeared to wave” at the disguised aircraft while clinging to wreckage, the Times reported. The second strike then killed them.</p><p>The newspaper contrasted their reactions to those of survivors in a later attack on October 16.</p><p>The initial blast in that October attack likewise left two survivors – but those survivors swam away after the first strike hit. They were later retrieved from the water and <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/trump-says-us-will-repatriate-survivors-of-submarine-attack\">repatriated</a> to their home countries, Colombia and Ecuador.</p><p>Members of Congress have been shown an extended video of the September 2 attack, and the Times reported that questions about perfidy were privately raised during closed-door briefings with military leaders.</p><p>“US military manuals about the law of war discuss perfidy at length, saying it includes when a combatant feigns civilian status so the adversary ‘neglects to take precautions which are otherwise necessary’,” the Times said.</p><p>The newspaper, however, pointed out that the US military has switched to clearly marked military aircraft, including MQ-9 Reaper drones, to conduct subsequent boat strikes after the September 2 attack.</p><p>It also quoted Trump administration officials as defending the military actions as well within the US government’s legal authority. The Trump administration has denied taking any illegal actions at any point in the boat-bombing campaign.</p><p>At least 35 strikes have been conducted in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since September 2, with as many as 114 people killed and one presumed dead.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Army Operations Authority as saying: “We have observed the arrival of more armed groups to the deployment points of the SDF organisation in the eastern Aleppo countryside near Maskana and Deir Hafer.”</p><p>The agency added: “According to our intelligence sources, these new reinforcements included a number of fighters from the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/26/kurdish-pkk-announces-its-withdrawing-fighters-from-turkiye-to-iraq\">Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK),</a>” which last year began withdrawing all its forces from Turkiye to northern Iraq as part of a peace process with Turkiye, bringing an end to a months-long disarming process following a four-decade armed conflict that killed tens of thousands of people.</p><p>The SDF denied the Syrian Ministry of Defence’s accusations that it had deployed military forces to the Deir Hafer front in the eastern Aleppo countryside.</p><p>It said there were no unusual movements or preparations in the area, adding that the gatherings that took place were limited to civilians from northern and eastern Syria to receive the wounded from the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods in the city of Aleppo.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"residents-return-after-battles\">Residents return after battles</h2><p>Syrian government forces on Monday were carrying

parts.</p><p>Residents of Ashrafieh, the first of the two neighbourhoods to fall to the Syrian army, began returning to their homes to inspect the damage, finding shrapnel and broken glass littering the streets on Sunday.</p><p>“Most people are returning to Ashrafieh, and they have begun to rebuild as there has been a lot of destruction,” said Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Aleppo.</p><p>He added that this was not the case for Sheikh Maqsoud, where government forces were still searching for explosives.</p><p>Smith added that Syrian forces were also looking for opposition prisoners arrested by the SDF during the rule of former leader Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown in December 2024 by forces led by the current president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p><p>United States envoy Tom Barrack met al-Sharaa on Saturday and afterwards issued a call for a “return to dialogue” in accordance with the <a

He does not speak Bangla fluently, and he knows that his accent could give him away as an Indian – an identity he desperately wants to mask these days, if he can.</p><p>Khan came to Bangladesh in April 2024 from his home in Nuh in the northern Indian state of Haryana, after failing to secure a government medical seat in India. At the time, Dhaka felt welcoming. He would go out with classmates, eat at restaurants, and travel outside the college on weekends.</p><p>“Those outings helped me release the stress of studies,” Khan said. But in July 2024, when protests erupted against then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government, his routine changed. Fearing that the environment outside was no longer safe, Khan confined himself to his small room.</p><p>The college advised him and other Indian students to remain within the campus premises. It has stayed that way since then. Khan says he feels trapped, and the city that once felt like a second home no longer offers a sense of safety.</p><p>He is among more than 9,000 Indian medical students currently enrolled in Bangladeshi colleges, at a time when anti-India sentiments are soaring in the country, 16 months after former Hasina sought exile in New Delhi.</p><p>Hasina, who was ousted in August 2024 by a popular student-led uprising amid a brutal crackdown by her security forces, has long been seen in Bangladesh as a close ally of India.</p><p>In November, a tribunal in Dhaka sentenced Hasina, in absentia, to death for the killings carried out by her security forces in 2024. But <a href=\"/features/2025/11/18/why-india-likely-wont-return-hasina-to-face-bangladesh-death-penalty\">despite repeated requests</a> from the interim Bangladeshi government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, India has so far not agreed to send Hasina back, amplifying sentiments against New Delhi on the streets of Bangladesh.</p><p>That anger, say Indian students, has left them feeling vulnerable, especially after a recent incident that has sent shockwaves through the community.</p><p>An Indian student from East West Medical College, 16km (10 miles) outside Dhaka, was attacked by local goons on December 19. The attackers snatched the student’s mobile phone and wallet. The incident was recorded on a security camera, and the video spread rapidly across the student community, triggering panic and fear among Indian students, many of whom began avoiding public spaces and restricting their movement out of safety concerns.</p><p>“The entire student community is shaken,” said Vaibhav, an Indian student who did not want his full name shared because he fears a backlash at his institute. He enrolled at Dhaka National Medical College in 2019, and is now an intern at the hospital attached to the medical school.</p><p>“We fear for our safety every day.”</p><p>Earlier, Vaibhav said, he and his friends explored almost every corner of Dhaka and nearby cities without hesitation or fear.</p><p>Now, that sense of ease has vanished. Vaibhav rarely steps outside, avoids local markets and common spaces, and even inside the hospital, he is cautious while speaking to patients.</p><p>He hides his Indian identity. “I think twice before saying anything in public now, one wrong word can make you a target,” he said.</p><p>Though he was never interested in politics, he now constantly checks news updates to assess the situation. “Every night, we go to sleep unsure of what the next day might bring,” Vaibhav added.</p><p>Each day of the internship feels like time to be endured, as he waits for the moment he can return home.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4234535\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234535\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4234535\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP21337318432259-1768272092.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C511&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Osmania Medical College students shout slogans during a protest against the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) PG counselling delay in Hyderabad, India, Friday, Dec. 3, 2021.

But this still means that almost 19 out of 20 aspirants end up without a shot at medical school. And the high fees charged by private Indian medical schools – anywhere between $78,000  and $166,000 for the full course – mean they are out of reach for students like Khan, whose father is a government employee.</p><p>Instead, the family opted for Bangladesh, where private undergraduate medical programmes are comparatively cheaper, with total course costs ranging between $38,000 and $55,000.</p><p>This also involved sacrifice: Khan’s father spent nearly all of his life savings to get his son into college.</p><p>According to Khan, life in Bangladesh was stable when he arrived in early 2024. However, the situation deteriorated rapidly after the protests against Hasina broke out. “We started feeling unsafe. I desperately wanted to go back home,” he recalled.</p><p>When internet services were suspended as security forces cracked down on protesters in the summer of 2024, Khan went to Dhaka airport to book a ticket in person. “I spent two nights at the airport. All flights were full,” he said, adding that he eventually managed to fly to Kolkata in eastern India after two days.</p><p>Khan stayed in India for several months before returning to Bangladesh in October. By then, he said, everything felt different: classes were disrupted, exams delayed and insecurity lingered. “It felt like something had changed completely,” he said.</p><p>Faisal Mahmud, the press minister at the Bangladesh High Commission, said that in recent weeks, the Bangladeshi government had “stepped up its vigilance to maintain law and order, as a national election is scheduled to take place in just over a month”.</p><p>“This has included the deployment of the maximum number of law enforcement personnel, alongside members of the armed forces, who were earlier granted magistracy powers to help ensure public security and protect both citizens and foreigners,” he told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>But the leadup to Bangladesh’s election, scheduled for February 12, has also seen a surge in political violence, anti-India rhetoric and a growing sense of fear among students.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4234538\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234538\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4234538\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-07-20T134432Z_716298331_RC2MI5AU3U5D_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-PROTESTS-INDIA-1768272232.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C551&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of India's Border Security Force (BSF) escort Indian students, who study in Bangladesh, after they crossed over at the Akhaura check post of the India-Bangladesh border in the northeastern Indian state of Tripura, following protests against government job quotas in Bangladesh, July 20, 2024.

But the calm was shattered on December 15, when <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/who-was-osman-hadi-why-is-bangladesh-on-fire-over-his-death\">Sharif Osman Hadi</a>, a prominent leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 student-led uprising, who had taken publicly anti-India positions, was killed by bikers. Bangladeshi police have said that Hadi’s killers have crossed over into India.</p><p>Since the killing, a Hindu Bangladeshi man has been lynched, and India had to temporarily close down visa services at some diplomatic missions in Bangladesh because of major protests outside.</p><p>As an Indian Hindu, Vaibhav said that he feels particularly vulnerable. He recalled a viva in college after Hasina’s ouster, where he said the examiner’s tone changed, and became much harsher, once they realised where he was from, and the faith he practised.</p><p>Since August 2024, minority rights groups in Bangladesh say that attacks on religious minorities, especially Hindus, have gone up. Some of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies over the past 12 years, which multiple international rights groups have criticised as discriminatory against Muslims, have also led to anger in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.</p><p>The Bangladeshi government under Yunus, however, insists that the attacks against Hindus in the country have been motivated by politics, not religion. Traditionally, many Bangladeshi Hindus have supported Hasina’s Awami League party.</p><p>Still, for students like Khan and Vaibhav, giving up on their education in Bangladesh is not an option.</p><p>“We have put in too much money and time to walk away,” Vaibhav said.</p><p>He urged both governments to intervene. “We are living in constant fear. Nights are sleepless. This has turned into a nightmare,” he said.</p><p>Mahmud from the Bangladesh High Commission said that the law-and-order situation has not worsened to the extent of posing a threat to lives, especially those of foreign nationals. He added that, overall, conditions remain largely stable, with crime levels broadly consistent with the period before 2014.</p><p>“Additional precautionary measures have been put in place as part of heightened vigilance ahead of the election,” he said in his statement.</p><p>However, Jitendra Singh, the president of the All India Medical Students’ Association (AIMSA), a national student body that represents the interests of medical students across India, said the organisation has received hundreds of distress calls and emails from Indian students enrolled in medical colleges across Bangladesh.</p><p>The students, he said, were “deeply shaken and scared”, adding that AIMSA had written to Modi about the concerns over the safety of Indian students in Bangladesh. “We have requested the prime minister and the Ministry of External Affairs to intervene immediately and treat the safety and security of Indian students as an absolute priority.”</p><p>He said that AIMSA had asked the Modi government to consider evacuating Indian students from Bangladesh if their security is threatened.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4234547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234547\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4234547\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-07-16T103813Z_246817095_RC29W8AE24R5_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-PROTESTS-1768273179.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling party Bangladesh Awami League, and anti-quota protesters engage in a clash at the Dhaka College area, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 16, 2024.

However, his graduation was derailed by the anti-Hasina protests in 2024.</p><p>Classes and exams were postponed, and some students went back to India before returning months later. Now, a year later, he said, We are [still] stuck here, even though we should have completed our degrees by now.”</p><p>Like Vaibhav, Mohammad requested that his full name not be revealed, as he fears retribution from college authorities.</p><p>Students like him, he said, had already suffered because of disruptions to the COVID-19 pandemic. “First, COVID delayed our studies, then political unrest. Now, there is nowhere to go – except to wait,” Mohammad said.</p><p>The uncertainty over the future, he said, has taken a toll on students’ mental health.</p><p>“No one knows what will happen next, and fear is always there,” he said.</p><p>Amid the rise in anti-India sentiment, several colleges have imposed tighter movement restrictions on students.</p><p>Khan said Indian students now largely stay on their college campus and go only to nearby local markets. According to him, hostel curfews have also been advanced sharply.</p><p>“Earlier, the hostel gates used to close at 10pm. Now, they shut as early as 8pm,” he said, adding that college authorities have issued strict instructions not to venture out late at night or move beyond the immediate vicinity of the campus. “We don’t go outside late any more. We lock ourselves inside the hostels by or before 8pm.”</p><p>He said the early curfews have turned hostels into spaces of confinement rather than rest. Even routine movements now carry anxiety, with students constantly alert to what might be happening outside the campus gates.</p><p>“There is a constant fear that if something goes wrong, we will have no one to turn to,” Khan said, adding that the uncertainty has left many students tense and unable to focus fully on their studies.</p><p>It is very different from early 2024, when he first arrived on campus.</p><p>“Back then, the college felt like a second home. Now it feels like a jail,” he said.</p><p>“I wish I had never come here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It said the missile was fired in response to Ukraine’s attempt to strike one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residences, a claim that Kyiv has denied and the US has dismissed as inaccurate.</p><p>Last week’s large-scale Russian attack came days after Ukraine and its Western allies reported progress towards an agreement to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/ukraine-reports-concrete-results-from-talks-with-western-allies\">US-led peace deal</a> is struck.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/deliberate-torment-ukrainians-left-without-heating-after-russian-strikes\">attack also coincided</a> with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington.</p><p>The Kremlin recently condemned the US seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic, calling the military action a violation of international law.

The Board again reiterates the link to a terror attack I had nothing to do with, nor did any Palestinian.”</p><p>The announcement of the festival’s cancellation came hours after Louise Adler, the director of the event, said in an op-ed that Abdel-Fattah, who had been scheduled to discuss her new novel Discipline, had been disinvited by the festival’s board despite her “strongest opposition”.</p><p>Writing in The Guardian, Adler called Abdel-Fattah’s removal from the festival lineup a blow to free expression and a “harbinger of a less free nation”.</p><p>“Now religious leaders are to be policed, universities monitored, the public broadcaster scrutinised and the arts starved,” Adler wrote.</p><p>“Are you or have you ever been a critic of Israel? Joe McCarthy would be cheering on the inheritors of his tactics,” she added, citing a figure in Cold War history commonly associated with censorship.</p><p>The festival’s board announced last week that it had decided to disinvite Abdel-Fattah, a well-known Palestinian advocate and vocal critic of Israel, after determining that her appearance would not be “culturally sensitive” in the wake of the December 14 <a href=\"/video/the-listening-post/2025/12/24/the-spin-and-misinformation-around-bondi-was-inevitable\">mass shooting</a> at Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach.</p><p>Fifteen people were killed in the attack, which targeted a beachside celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah. Authorities have said the two alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram and his son Naveed Akram, were inspired by ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>Abdel-Fattah had called her removal “a blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism” and a “despicable attempt to associate me with the Bondi massacre”.</p><p>On Monday, New Zealand’s former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that she would not go ahead with her scheduled appearance at the festival, adding her name to a boycott that swelled to some 180 writers, including former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and award-winning novelist Zadie Smith.</p><p>Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia, as well as several federal politicians and a number of Jewish groups, had backed the revocation of Abdel-Fattah’s invitation.</p><p>Abdel-Fattah’s critics pointed to statements critical of Israel to argue that her views were beyond the pale, including that “the goal is decolonisation and the end of this murderous Zionist colony”, and that Zionists “have no claim or right to cultural safety”.</p><p>In her op-ed on Tuesday, Adler accused pro-Israel lobbyists of using “increasingly extreme and repressive” tactics, resulting in a chilling effect on speech in Australia.</p><p>“The new mantra ‘Bondi changed everything’ has offered this lobby, its stenographers in the media and a spineless political class yet another coercive weapon,” she wrote.</p><p>“Hence, in 2026, the board, in an atmosphere of intense political pressure, has issued an edict that an author is to be cancelled.”</p><p>Separately on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would hold a national day of mourning on January 22 to honour the victims of the Bondi Beach attack.</p><p>He said the day would be a “gathering of unity and remembrance”, with flags to be flown at half-mast on all Commonwealth buildings.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It also names the Department of the Navy and its secretary, John Phelan, as defendants.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“I filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense because there are few things as important as standing up for the rights of the very Americans who fought to defend our freedoms,” Kelly, a veteran, wrote in a statement on social media.</p><p>Kelly’s <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> is the latest escalation in a feud that first erupted in November, when a group of six Democratic lawmakers – all veterans of the US armed services or its intelligence community – published a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/1990774492356902948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> online reminding military members of their responsibility to “refuse illegal orders”.</p><p>Democrats framed the video as a simple reiteration of government policy: Courts have repeatedly ruled that service members do indeed have a duty to reject orders they know to violate US law or the Constitution.</p><p>But Republican President Donald Trump and his allies <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/punishable-by-death-trump-threatens-democrats-with-sedition-charges\">have denounced the video</a> as “seditious behaviour” and called for the lawmakers to face punishment.</p><h2 id=\"a-focus-on-kelly\">A focus on Kelly</h2><p>Kelly, in particular, has faced a series of actions that critics describe as an unconstitutional attack on his First Amendment right to free speech.</p><p>A senator from the pivotal swing state of Arizona, Kelly is one of the highest-profile lawmakers featured in November’s video.</p><p>He is also considered a rising star in the Democratic Party and is widely speculated to be a candidate for president or vice president in the 2028 elections.</p><p>But before his career in politics, Kelly was a pilot in the US Navy who flew missions during the Gulf War. He retired at the rank of captain. Kelly was also selected to be an astronaut, along with his twin Scott Kelly, and they served as part of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>His entry into politics came after his wife, former Representative Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head during a 2011 assassination attempt. On Monday, Kelly described the Senate as “a place I never expected to find myself in”.</p><p>“My wife Gabby was always the elected official in our family,” he told his Senate colleagues. “If she had never been shot in the head, she would be here in this chamber and not me. But I love this country, and I felt that I had an obligation to continue my public service in a way that I never expected.”</p><p>Kelly’s participation in the November video has placed him prominently within the Trump administration’s crosshairs, and officials close to the president have taken <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/why-has-trump-blasted-democrats-for-seditious-comments\">actions to condemn</a> his statements.</p><p>Shortly after the video came out, for instance, the Defense Department <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1992999267967905905?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it had opened an investigation into Kelly. It warned that the senator could <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-says-it-is-investigating-us-senator-over-illegal-orders-video\">face a court-martial</a> depending on the results of the probe.</p><p>The pressure on Kelly continued this month, when Hegseth <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/2008189258528665898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revealed</a> on social media that he had submitted a formal letter of censure against the senator.</p><p>That letter accused Kelly of “conduct unbecoming of an office” and alleged he had “undermined the chain of command” through his video.</p><p>Hegseth explained that the letter sought to demote Kelly from the rank he reached at his retirement, as well as reduce his retirement pay.</p><p>“Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth wrote on the platform X.</p><p>“As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice.”</p><h2 id=\"attacking-political-speech\">Attacking political speech</h2><p>Kelly responded to that claim by alleging that Hegseth had embarked on a campaign of politically motivated retribution, designed to silence any future criticism from US military veterans.</p><p>“Pete Hegseth is coming after what I earned through my twenty-five years of military service, in violation of my rights as an American, as a retired veteran, and as a United States Senator,” Kelly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SenMarkKelly/posts/pfbid027eLTbgaCsnT8K8iUqVztG1vGDKrzCBje4UaagrBLNVydQcUmbUugfMduX78E6yPkl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on Monday.</p><p>“His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: if you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.”</p><p>Kelly also took to the floor of the Senate on Monday to defend his decision to sue officials from the Trump administration.</p><p><b>“</b>Every service member knows that military rank is earned. It’s not given. It’s earned through the risks you take,” Kelly told his fellow senators.</p><p>“After my 25 years of service, I earned my rank as a captain in the United States Navy. Now, Pete Hegseth wants even our longest-serving military veterans to live with the constant threat that they could be deprived of their rank and retirement pay years or even decades after they leave the military, just because he or another secretary of defence or a president doesn’t like what they’ve said.”</p><p>His lawsuit calls for the federal court system to halt the proceedings against him and declare Hegseth’s letter of censure unlawful.</p><p>The court filing makes a twofold argument: that the efforts to discipline Kelly not only violate his free speech rights but also constitute an attack on legislative independence, since they allegedly seek to intimidate a member of Congress.</p><p>“It appears that never in our nation’s history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,” the lawsuit asserts.</p><p>The complaint also accuses the Trump administration of violating Kelly’s right to due process, given the high-profile calls from within the government to punish the senator.</p><p>It pointed to social media posts Trump made, including one that signalled he felt Kelly’s behaviour amounted to “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOUR, punishable by DEATH”.</p><p>The lawsuit also argues that Hegseth’s letter of censure appeared to draw conclusions about Kelly’s alleged wrongdoing, only to then request that the Navy review his military rank and retirement benefits.</p><p>Such a review, the lawsuit contends, can therefore not be considered a fair assessment of the facts.</p><p>“The Constitution does not permit the government to announce the verdict in advance and then subject Senator Kelly or anyone else to a nominal process designed only to fulfill it,” the lawsuit said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, warned residents to take cover. There were no immediate reports on casualties or damage to properties and infrastructure in the attack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian drones struck two foreign-flagged vessels, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said, the second such attack in four days on Black Sea shipping. Kuleba said the vessels were sailing under the flags of Panama and San Marino, and that one person was injured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia attacked energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, causing blackouts that affected at least 33,500 families, Ukraine’s largest private energy firm DTEK said, describing the damage as “significant”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Emergency crews are struggling to restore heat and power to beleaguered Kyiv residents, more than three days after <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/deliberate-torment-ukrainians-left-without-heating-after-russian-strikes\">Russian strikes on energy infrastructure</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kuleba said on Telegram that 90 percent of Kyiv’s apartment buildings have had their heating restored, leaving fewer than 500 dwellings still to be connected. But Mayor Klitschko put the number with no heating at 800, with most living on the west bank of the Dnipro River.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Last year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022, a record driven by intensified hostilities along the front line and the expanded use of long-range weapons, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said. Conflict-related violence in Ukraine killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in 2025, a 31 percent rise in the number of victims from 2024, the monitor said in its monthly update.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s Ministry of Defence said the target it hit last week with a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/russia-hits-ukraine-with-oreshnik-hypersonic-missile-why-it-matters\">hypersonic Oreshnik ballistic missile</a> was a Ukrainian aircraft repair plant in Lviv.

The administration has claimed to have overseen more than 2.5 million voluntary departures and deportations, a “record-breaking achievement”, it said last month.</p><p>Some of those deportations, however, have included immigrants who held valid visas, raising questions about due process and human rights.</p><p>The administration has also adopted a stricter policy for granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.</p><p>“We will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe,” the State Department said in its post on X.</p><p></p><p>The four leading causes for visa revocations were overstays, driving under the influence, assault and theft, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said. The revocations marked a 150 percent increase from 2024, he added.</p><p>The State Department has also launched a Continuous Vetting Center, aimed at ensuring “all foreign nationals on American soil comply with our laws – and that the visas of those who pose a threat to American citizens are swiftly revoked”, Pigott said.</p><p>That centre is part of an overall push to restrict who is allowed into the country. The State Department has ordered US diplomats in general to be vigilant against visa applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the US or who have a history of political activism.</p><p>In November, the State Department said it had revoked about 80,000 non-immigrant visas since Trump’s inauguration, for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.</p><p>Trump had campaigned for re-election in 2024 on a pledge to oversee the “largest deportation programme of criminals in the history of America”. He was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2025.</p><p>But critics have argued that Trump’s wide-sweeping approach has targeted criminals and non-criminals alike. The Trump administration has also faced scrutiny for appearing to target visa-holders who hold views it disagrees with.</p><p>In March, for instance, the Trump administration began a campaign of stripping student protesters involved in pro-Palestinian activism of their visas.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the validity of these claims.</p><p>In 2021, New York state signed into law a requirement that hospitals establish committees at every facility to outline staffing plans by division, including a minimum one-to-two nurse-to-patient ratio in critical care units, as strains on the healthcare system became amplified during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“You can’t divorce this from the experience of COVID in New York. COVID tested our healthcare system and tested nurses in particular. They last went on strike in 2023 and continue to face chronic understaffing, leaving them feeling overextended,” Lindsey Boylan, a community activist at the picket line on Monday morning, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In 2023, after a three-day strike, nurses successfully pushed hospital systems, through arbitration, to enforce those standards across all hospital units.</p><p>The union alleges that hospitals are walking back the standards and that hospital management has failed to agree to requests to strengthen protections for workers amid a rise in workplace violence. Union representatives told Al Jazeera that the requests include installing metal detectors at hospital entrances.</p><p>The strike comes amid heightened concerns about hospital safety following an active shooter incident at a Mount Sinai hospital in November and a fatal shooting at a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Brooklyn last week.</p><p>Mount Sinai has also allegedly disciplined nurses who raised concerns about alleged union-busting, resulting in a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board in October.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to NewYork-Presbyterian, Montefiore and Mount Sinai hospitals for comment.</p><p>“We’re ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognises the challenging realities of today’s healthcare environment. We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city,” a spokesperson for NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>When pressed for specifics, the hospital did not respond. The union told Al Jazeera the hospital offered nurses $4,500 in single lump-sum payments that could be used towards healthcare benefits, staffing, or wages.</p><p>Representatives for Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore did not reply to requests for comment.</p><h2 id=\"unified-nurses\">Unified nurses</h2><p>“The fact that the people who provide healthcare need to be asking for healthcare is ironic and infuriating,” Alex Bores, a state assembly member and congressional candidate in New York’s 12th district, told Al Jazeera. Bores was at the picket line in the early hours of Monday.</p><p>“The energy was incredible. It was 6am and still dark, but people were marching and chanting. Everyone was energised and ready for the fight. There was no hesitation and no fear. It was clear the nurses were unified and prepared to go the distance,” Bores added.</p><p>The strike comes at the height of a severe flu season in New York, with hospitalisations reaching record highs. During the week of December 20, nearly 9 percent of emergency room visits were for the flu. Rates have since begun to decline, according to city health data.</p><p>“This [the severe flu season] leads to an increase in the number of people who need to be seen in emergency rooms and hospitals. As a result, staffing needs are actually higher, making this a particularly difficult time to not have all healthcare professionals available,” said Bruce Y Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health &amp; Health Policy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For the week of January 3, the most recent data available, flu cases fell to 5 percent of emergency department diagnoses.</p><p>Healthcare demands may give nurses added leverage in negotiations.</p><p>“I think there’s a lot of leverage at this time. New Yorkers understand the role nurses played during COVID and beyond, and with a very difficult flu season now under way, we are all aware of how important nurses are, and how overextended they are,” Boylan added.</p><h2 id=\"the-political-test\">The political test</h2><p>The strike poses a major political test at both the city and state levels. Governor Kathy Hochul is up for re-election, and pro-labour Zohran Mamdani’s recent mayoral win in New York City has increased pressure on the governor to side with progressives across the state.</p><p>“My top priority is protecting patients and ensuring they can access the care they need. At the same time, we must reach an agreement that recognises the essential work nurses do every day on the front lines of our healthcare system,” Hochul said in a statement on Sunday night.</p><p>Representatives for the governor did not respond to requests for additional comment after nurses officially began striking.</p><p>The strike comes early in Mamdani’s administration and marks a significant political test for the city’s new mayor, who has historically been pro-labour.</p><p>“There were so many people, it was flooding both sides of the street,” Boylan added.</p><p>In response to a request to the mayor’s office for comment, senior spokesperson Dora Pekec referred Al Jazeera <a href=\"https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/2010532423994364346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to a post</a> that Mamdani published on X on Sunday evening, ahead of the strike.</p><p>“No New Yorker should have to fear losing access to health care — and no nurse should be asked to accept less pay, fewer benefits or less dignity for doing lifesaving work. Our nurses kept this city alive through its hardest moments. Their value is not negotiable,” Mamdani wrote.</p><p>On Monday, the mayor joined picketers outside a hospital in Manhattan.</p><p>“This strike is not just a question of how much nurses earn per hour or what health benefits they receive, although both of those issues matter deeply. It is also a question of who deserves to benefit from this system,” Mamdani said at a news conference.</p><p>The spokesperson did not respond to our request for further comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"
