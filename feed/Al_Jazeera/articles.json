In a televised speech at the time, he denounced the protesters and endorsed his father’s crackdown, threatening “rivers of blood”.</p><p>“That speech during the protests marked the end of Saif the reformer and the birth of Saif the son of [Muammar] Gaddafi,” Anas El Gomati, director of the Sadeq Institute, a Libyan think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>After rebels captured Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in 2011, he spent six years held in Zintan by a local militia. Emadeddin Badi, a senior fellow at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime and Libya expert, said that his captors eventually became more sympathetic to him “and were acting as his bodyguards”.</p><p>“He was not a captive in the traditional sense whatsoever and even had a social life there, married with kids,” Badi said.</p><p>After his release in 2017, Gaddafi kept such a low profile that many speculated he might be dead. He resurfaced publicly with a New York Times interview in 2021, where he hinted at a political comeback, and later moved to pursue presidential ambitions.</p><p>When he registered to run for president in 2021, it became a major controversy that <a href=\"/news/2021/12/23/why-libya-election-got-postponed\">contributed</a> to the collapse of the entire electoral process.</p><p>Saif al-Islam was disqualified because of an earlier war crimes conviction, but the disputes around his candidacy contributed to derailing the vote.</p><p>Still, he retained support among some groups who, amid Libya’s descent into civil war and rival fiefdoms, were nostalgic for the perceived stability of the Gaddafi era.</p><p>His father, Muammar Gaddafi, came to power in 1969, amid a wave of coups in the Arab world along a crescent from South Yemen, through Somalia and Sudan that year.</p><p>Gaddafi presided over a regime, which, although dictatorial, saw a period of economic growth in the country, fuelled by Libya’s oil reserves.</p><p>The regime was also known for mass human-rights abuses, including the execution of political opponents.</p><p>“Saif al-Islam is popular among Gaddafi-era reformists and among those who saw him as that reformist candidate promising change,” Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>His real power wasn’t military but symbolic, El Gomati said. That ideological disposition is referred to locally as the Greens, after the elder Gaddafi’s “Green Book” outlining his political theories.</p><p>“Saif didn’t really control forces, or territory, but controlled an important narrative and represented something for people who were nostalgic for the days of Gaddafi’s rule,” El Gomati said.</p><h2 id=\"what-impact-does-this-have-in-libya\">What impact does this have in Libya?</h2><p>Saif al‑Islam’s death is likely to matter most in eastern Libya, because of the overlap between the supporters of the man who controls that region, military commander Khalifa Haftar, and Gaddafi’s base.</p><p>Despite that overlap, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Khalifa Haftar deeply distrusted each other, mainly because Haftar had defected from the Gaddafi regime decades ago, and attempted a rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi after having initially helped him come to power.</p><p>Tensions between Khalifa Haftar and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi flared in 2021 when Haftar-aligned militias blocked a court hearing on the latter’s election appeal after he was blocked, withdrawing only after demonstrations by his supporters.</p><p>“They [the Gaddafi family] considered him [Khalifa Haftar] a traitor for rebelling against the Gaddafi regime, and it was thought Haftar was trying to replicate the system their father had built,” Gazzini said. “Haftar had always feared the popularity Saif had.”</p><p>But that meant that Khalifa Haftar was attempting to fill a space left by Muammar Gaddafi, but one that Saif al-Islam was still trying to occupy himself. In effect, that made Saif al-Islam a threat to Haftar, as they were competing over the same constituency.</p><p>“The immediate beneficiary [of the killing] is Haftar,” said El Gomati. “Saif represents an alternative to the authoritarian model which Haftar built.”</p><p>Despite his symbolic importance, analysts still expect the immediate fallout from Saif al-Islam’s assassination to be limited.</p><p>The people who once supported the Gaddafi regime have split apart dramatically since 2011, with many former loyalists now working within the competing eastern and western power structures.</p><p>“This stirs waters, but won’t hit Libya with a storm,” Gazzini told Al Jazeera, noting that while Saif al-Islam Gaddafi’s death is significant, Libya’s basic political deadlock isn’t likely to change a great deal after the killing.</p><p>“His death eliminates Libya’s last viable spoiler to the current power duopoly,” El Gomati said. “His assassination closes Libya’s last exit from this divided power system.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They don’t let us bring in anything. They confiscated everything we had, even my children’s belongings. They only left us some clothes.”</p><p>The crossing, Gaza’s only exit point that does not lead to Israel, had remained largely closed since Israeli forces took control of it in May 2024 during Israel’s genocidal war against the Palestinian people in Gaza. Only about two dozen people crossed in both directions on the first day – far fewer than the expected 200, according to sources on both sides.</p><p>“They don’t want a large number of people to return to Gaza,” al-Riqib added. “Rather, they want a large number to leave.”</p><p>Egypt has consistently warned against the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and has reportedly demanded equal numbers entering and exiting the territory each day.</p><p>Ali Shaath, head of a Palestinian committee overseeing Gaza’s governance, called Rafah’s reopening a “window of hope” for the war-devastated territory.</p><p>Although 150 people were scheduled to leave and 50 to enter on Monday, only 12 Palestinians – nine women and three children – were permitted to return from Egypt, according to Gaza’s Interior Ministry and border officials.</p><p>Gaza’s Interior Ministry reported that eight people departed Gaza, while an Egyptian border source counted 12 people – five injured individuals and seven companions – entering Egypt.</p><p>“Things were very difficult, and inspections were taking place everywhere,” said Samira Said after returning through Rafah.</p><p>The reopening, long demanded by the United Nations and humanitarian organisations, forms a crucial element of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza truce proposal, where humanitarian conditions remain critical.</p><p>For Gaza’s sick and injured, the crossing represents potential access to Egyptian medical care. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, reported 20,000 patients urgently requiring treatment, including 4,500 children.</p><p>Gaza City resident Umm Mohammed Abu Shaqfa, 37, whose 11-year-old daughter needs treatment unavailable in the occupied Palestinian territory, said, “We are still waiting to travel through the Rafah crossing for treatment in Egypt. Opening the crossing is a glimmer of hope. Every day, I go to the Ministry of Health office and the World Health Organization to check if my daughter’s name is on the list.”</p><p>While Rafah serves as a crucial entry point for both people and supplies, COGAT, the Israeli Defence Ministry body coordinating Palestinian civilian affairs, has not mentioned allowing a substantial increase in aid into Gaza.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Details of those agreements were not immediately available.</p><p>About 3,000 immigration enforcement agents are currently believed to be in Minnesota as part of Trump’s enforcement operations.</p><p>“Given this increase in unprecedented collaboration, and as a result of the need for less law enforcement officers to do this work in a safer environment, I have announced, effective immediately, we will draw down 700 people effective today – 700 law enforcement personnel,” Homan said.</p><p>The announcement comes after Homan was sent to Minnesota at the end of January in response to widespread protests over immigration enforcement and the killing of Renee Nicole Good on January 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent and Alex Pretti on January 24 by a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer, both in Minneapolis.</p><p>Homan said reforms made since his arrival have included consolidating ICE and CBP under a single chain of command.</p><p>He said Trump “fully intends to achieve mass deportations during this administration, and immigration enforcement actions will continue every day throughout this country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Immigration rights observers have said the administration’s mass deportation approach has seen agents use increasingly “dragnet” tactics to meet large detention quotas, including randomly stopping individuals and asking for their papers. The administration has increasingly detained undocumented individuals with no criminal records, even US citizens and people who have legal status to live in the US.</p><p>Homan said agents would prioritise who they considered to be “public safety threats” but added, “Just because you prioritise public safety threats, don’t mean we forget about everybody else. We will continue to enforce the immigration laws in this country.”</p><p>The “drawdown”, he added, would not apply to what he described as “personnel providing security for our officers”.</p><p>“We will not draw down on personnel providing security and responding to hostile incidents until we see a change,” he said.</p><p>Critics have accused immigration enforcement officers, who do not receive the same level of crowd control training as most local police forces, of using excessive violence in responding to protesters and individuals legally monitoring their actions.</p><p>Trump administration officials have regularly blamed unrest on “agitators”. They accused both Good and Pretti of threatening officers before their killings although video evidence of the exchanges has contradicted that characterisation.</p><p>Last week, the administration announced it was opening a federal civil rights investigation into the killing of Pretti, who was fatally shot while he was pinned to the ground by immigration agents. That came moments after an agent removed a gun from Pretti’s body, which the 37-year-old had not drawn and was legally carrying.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Federal authorities have not opened a civil rights investigation into the killing of Good, who they have maintained sought to run over an ICE agent before she was fatally shot. Video evidence appeared to show Good trying to turn away from the agent.</p><p>On Friday, thousands of people took to the streets of Minneapolis and other US cities amid calls for a federal strike in protest against the Trump administration’s deportation drive.</p><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and other state and local officials have also challenged the immigration enforcement surge in the state, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the CBP, has been violating constitutional protections.</p><p>A federal judge last week said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/us-judge-declines-to-halt-immigration-surge-in-minnesota-amid-protests\">she will not halt</a> the operations as a lawsuit progresses in court. Department of Justice lawyers have dismissed the suit as “legally frivolous”.</p><p>On Wednesday, a poll released by the Marquette Law School found wide-ranging disquiet over ICE’s approach, with 60 percent of US adults nationwide saying they disapproved of how the agency was conducting itself. The poll was conducted from January 21 to January 28, with many of the surveys conducted before Pretti’s killing.</p><p>The poll still found widespread support for ICE among Republicans, with about 80 percent approving of its work. Just 5 percent of Democrats voiced similar approval.</p><p>Perhaps most worryingly for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms in November, just 23 percent of independents – potential swing voters in the upcoming vote – approved of ICE’s actions.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Since then, the US has effectively taken control of Venezuela’s mammoth oil industry.</p><p>In return, Trump dialled down trade tariffs on Indian goods from an overall 50 percent to just 18 percent. Half of that 50 percent tariff was levied last year as punishment for India buying Russian oil, which the White House maintains is financing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>But since Monday, India has not publicly confirmed that it has committed to either ceasing its purchase of Russian oil or embracing Venezuelan crude, analysts note. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, told reporters on Tuesday that Russia had received no indication of this from India, either.</p><p>And switching from Russian to Venezuelan oil will be far from straightforward. A cocktail of other factors – shocks to the energy market, costs, geography, and the characteristics of different kinds of oil – will complicate New Delhi’s decisions about its sourcing of oil, they say.</p><p>So, can India really dump Russian oil?

India, which before the war sourced only 2.5 percent of its oil from Russia, became the second-largest consumer of Russian oil after China. It currently sources around 30 percent of its oil from Russia.</p><p>Last year, Trump doubled trade tariffs on Indian goods from 25 percent to 50 percent as punishment for this. Later in the year, Trump also imposed sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil companies – and threatened secondary sanctions against countries and entities that trade with these firms.</p><p>Since the abduction of Maduro by US forces in early January, Trump has effectively taken over the Venezuelan oil sector, controlling sales cash flows.</p><p>Venezuela also has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/2/3/what-does-303-billion-barrels-of-venezuelan-oil-look-like\">303 billion barrels</a>, more than five times larger than those of the US, the world’s largest oil producer.</p><p>But while getting India to buy Venezuelan oil makes sense from the US’s perspective, analysts say this could be operationally messy.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287833\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250827__72JP6GA__v1__MidRes__IndiaUsTariffTrade-1770202385.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"india\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man sits by railway tracks as a freight train transports petrol wagons in Ajmer, India, on August 27, 2025.

The world can’t afford to keep Russia off the oil market,” Puri said.</span></p><p>Analysts tend to agree. “A complete cessation of Indian purchases of Russian oil would be a major disruption. An immediate halt would spike global prices and threaten India’s economic growth,” said George Voloshin, an independent energy analyst based in Paris.</p><p>Russian oil would likely be diverted more heavily towards China and into “shadow” fleets of tankers that deliver sanctioned oil secretly by flying false flags and switching off location equipment, Voloshin told Al Jazeera. “Mainstream tanker demand would shift toward the Atlantic Basin, most likely increasing global freight rates as a result,” he noted.</p><p>Sumit Pokharna, vice president at Kotak Securities, noted that Indian refineries have reported robust margins in the last two years, majorly benefitting from the discounted Russian crude.</p><p>“If they move to higher-costing, like the US or Venezuela, then raw material cost would increase, and that would squeeze their margins,” he told Al Jazeera. “If it goes beyond control, they may have to pass the excess onto consumers.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287840\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287840\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260201__94PQ7G3__v1__MidRes__VenezuelaUsConflictCrisisOil-1770202601.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"venezuela\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A pumpjack for oil is pictured at the Campo Elias neighbourhood in Cabimas, south of Lake Maracaibo, Zulia state, Venezuela, on January 31, 2026 [File: Maryorin Mendez/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"can-india-stop-buying-russian-oil-altogether\">Can India stop buying Russian oil altogether?</h2><p>It may not be able to. One of India’s two private refiners, Nayara Energy, is majority-Russian-owned and under heavy Western sanctions. The Russian energy firm Rosneft holds a 49.13 percent stake in the company, which operates a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in India’s Gujarat, PM Modi’s home state.</p><p>Nayara is the second-largest importer of Russian crude, buying about 471,000 barrels per day in January this year, accounting for nearly 40 percent of Russian supplies to India.</p><p>Its plant has relied solely on Russian crude since European Union sanctions were imposed on the company last July.</p><p>Nayara is not planning to load Russian oil in April as it shuts its refinery for more than a month for maintenance from April 10, according to Reuters.</p><p>Pokharna said the future of Nayara hangs in the balance, with the US unlikely to grant India an overt exemption for the Russia-backed company to import crude.</p><h2 id=\"can-india-switch-to-venezuelan-oil\">Can India switch to Venezuelan oil?</h2><p>India has been a major consumer of Venezuelan oil in the past. At its peak, in 2019, India imported $7.2bn of oil, accounting for just under 7 percent of total imports. That stopped after the US slapped sanctions on Venezuelan oil, but some officials of the government-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation are still stationed in the Latin American country.</p><p>Now, major Indian refiners have said they are open to receiving Venezuelan oil again, but only if it is a viable option.</p><p>For one thing, Venezuela is roughly twice as far from India as Russia and five times further than the Middle East, meaning much higher freight costs.</p><p>Venezuelan oil is more expensive as well. “Russian Urals [a medium-heavy crude blend] has been trading at a wide-ranging discount of about $10-20 per barrel to Brent, while Venezuelan Merey currently offers a smaller discount of around $5-8 per barrel,” Voloshin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Importing from Venezuela and forgoing the Russian discount would be a costly affair for India,” said Pokharna. “From transportation cost to forgoing discounts, it could cost India $6-8 more per barrel – and that is a huge increase in the importing bill.”</p><p>Overall, a complete pivot away from Russia could raise India’s import bill by $9bn to $11bn – an amount roughly equal to India’s federal health budget – per year, according to Kpler.</p><p>“Venezuelan crude must be discounted by at least $10 to $12 per barrel to be competitive,” argued Voloshin. “This deeper discount is necessary to offset the much higher freight costs, increased insurance premiums for the longer Atlantic voyage, and the somewhat higher operational expenses required to process Venezuela’s extra-heavy high-sulfur crude.”</p><p>Without deeper discounts, the longer journey and complex handling make Venezuelan oil more expensive on a delivered basis, he added.</p><p>Another major issue is that many Indian refiners simply do not have the facilities to process very heavy Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Venezuelan crude is a heavy, sour oil, thick and viscous like molasses, with a high sulphur content requiring complex, specialised refineries to process it into fuel. Only a small number of Indian refineries are equipped to handle it.</p><p>“[Venezuelan oil’s heaviness] makes it an option only for complex refineries, leaving out older and smaller refineries,” Pokharna told Al Jazeera. “The shift is operationally difficult and would require blending with more expensive light crudes.”</p><p>Then there is the question of availability. Today, Venezuela produces barely a million barrels per day when pushed to its limit. Even if all production was sent to India, it would not match the total Russian oil import.</p><h2 id=\"where-else-could-india-buy-oil\">Where else could India buy oil?</h2><p>India’s Minister Puri has said that New Delhi is looking to diversify sourcing options from nearly 40 countries.</p><p>As India has reduced Russian imports, it has increased them from Middle Eastern nations and other countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Now, while Russia accounts for nearly 27 percent share in India’s oil imports, OPEC nations, led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia, contribute 53 percent.</p><p>Reeling from Trump’s trade war, India has also increased purchases of US oil. American crude imports to India rose by 92 percent from April to November in 2025 to nearly 13 million tons, compared to 7.1 million in the same period in 2024.</p><p>However, India would be competing for these supplies with the European Union, which has pledged to spend $750bn by 2028 on US energy and nuclear products.</p><p>Meanwhile, for Venezuela to return to higher production, Caracas needs political stability, changes in foreign investment and oil laws, and to clear debts. That will take time, experts say.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20251212__87WQ9BA__v1__MidRes__IndiaRussiaOil-1770202388.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"nayara\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Customers refuel their vehicles at a Nayara Energy Limited fuel station, the Russian oil major Rosneft’s majority-owned Indian refiner, in Bengaluru, India on December 12, 2025 [File: Idrees Mohammed/AFP]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

And I don’t know if the money that Tony is getting is actually to Tony or to somebody else.”</p><p>He continues: “I hear gigantic numbers given to Tony – $5m here, $10m here, $5m there. Tony’s not making $30m a year.”</p><p>Barak replied: “Yeah, but he’s become quite … I can judge from the style of his watches that he’s …”</p><p>“Yes, but he’s making $10m a year,” says Epstein.</p><p>Barak then responds: “Probably he [gets] the money and he leaves some of it to the others, probably some of the providers.”</p><p>Leaked emails suggest that Epstein served as a trusted financial adviser, fixer, concierge, sounding board and even <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/israels-ex-pm-ehud-barak-and-jeffrey-epstein-had-close-relationship-emails-reveal\">friend to Barak </a>during their long-running relationship, which continued for years after the disgraced financier became a convicted sex offender following a controversial plea deal in 2008.</p><p>The US Justice Department has not confirmed when the recorded conversation took place. Media reports suggest it took place in early 2013.</p><h2 id=\"rubbish-says-blair-spokesperson\">‘Rubbish,’ says Blair spokesperson</h2><p>Asked for comment on the released conversation through his institute, a spokesperson for Blair said: “None of these people have any idea about what he did or didn’t earn, and the figures given are rubbish.”</p><p>The spokesperson said that Blair had met Epstein only once, as had been previously reported, and had never spoken to or seen him since.</p><p>“He has never discussed what he earned with either of the other two people mentioned,” they said.</p><p>The payment for work in Kazakhstan was “not paid to Blair but to his organisation, which hired a team of people for the purpose of that work, which was about reform in Kazakhstan and completely in line with what other international institutions were working on”.</p><p>“It was not related to communications or lobbying, which further demonstrates that none of the people concerned knew what they were talking about,” said the spokesperson.</p><p>A spokesperson for Blair previously said in October that he had met Epstein once “for less than 30 minutes” in Downing Street in 2002, where they discussed US and UK politics, noting the meeting took place long before his crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction.</p><h2 id=\"mandelson-investigation\">Mandelson investigation</h2><p>The acknowledgement came as the UK’s National Archives released details of the meeting under a freedom of information request, after UK political veteran Peter Mandelson, a close associate of Blair’s during his time in power, was <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/uk-fires-ambassador-to-us-peter-mandelson-over-links-to-epstein\">fired as Britain’s ambassador to the US</a> over his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>This week, UK police announced they had <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/uks-mandelson-to-resign-from-house-of-lords-over-epstein-ties\">launched an investigation</a> into allegations that Mandelson committed misconduct in public office in his dealings with Epstein.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The material includes emails from Mandelson to Epstein sharing sensitive government information, as well as bank documents suggesting Epstein transferred tens of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner.</p><p>Blair has recently been back in the spotlight after US President Donald Trump named him one of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">founding executive members</a> on the so-called “<a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/scepticism-hope-gaza-reacts-trump-board-of-peace\">Board of Peace</a>“, tasked with oversight of the administration and reconstruction of Gaza under the US leader’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>More than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed and Gaza turned into rubble during Israel’s two years of nonstop bombardment. Rights groups and scholars have dubbed Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide. Despite a “ceasefire” agreed upon in October, Israel has killed more than 500 Palestinians, including 21 on Wednesday, and has reneged on many of the terms of the deal.</p><p>Blair’s participation in Trump’s project has been a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/28/why-is-the-divisive-tony-blair-now-touted-for-post-gaza-war-interim-role\">major source of contention</a>, given his prominent role in the Iraq war, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.</p><p>To this day, critics in the Middle East and the UK brand Blair a “war criminal”, and he remains a toxic figure in some quarters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

After that, it would agree to limit enrichment of uranium to below 1.5 percent.</p><p>Its current stock of highly enriched uranium – including about 440kg (970lb) that has been enriched to 60 percent – would be transferred to a third country.</p><p>The proposed framework goes beyond Iran’s nuclear programme with mediators proposing that Iran should agree not to transfer weapons and technologies to its regional, nonstate allies.</p><p>Tehran would also pledge to not initiate the use of ballistic missiles under this framework. This falls short of a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\">US demand</a> that Iran curb the number and range of its ballistic missiles.</p><p>A “nonaggression agreement” between Tehran and Washington is also being proposed by the three mediators, one of the sources said.</p><p>It is not yet known how Washington or Tehran have responded to the proposed framework.</p><p>For its part, the US has made it clear that any deal must include regulations on Iran’s nuclear programme, missiles and proxies.</p><p>In the past, Iran has been willing to compromise on nuclear development, including in 2015 when it signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal with  other countries, including the US, to limit nuclear enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. Three years later, however, Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.</p><p>But Tehran has so far refused to talk about limiting its support for nonstate allies in the region and curtailing its ballistic missiles.</p><p>On Wednesday, Iran was still holding firm to the line that it would “exclusively” discuss the nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.</p><h2 id=\"defiant-tone\">Defiant tone</h2><p>The mediators’ framework was presented to the US and Iran just before Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his spy chiefs during a visit to Israel on Tuesday.</p><p>The US is entering negotiations with significant leverage as Iran faces an unprecedented mix of external and internal pressures.</p><p>A US aircraft carrier, fighter jets and navy destroyers are now <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\">positioned</a> in the Arabian Sea, presenting Tehran with a credible military threat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iran has been rocked by nationwide protests in December and January, which culminated in the country’s most brutal episodes of violence in decades.</p><p>Still, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has maintained a defiant tone, and observers remained cautious about whether he would be willing to compromise on key issues, considering the degree of mistrust towards the US in Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"reviving-diplomacy\">Reviving diplomacy</h2><p>This is not the first time Iranian and US officials have met in a bid to revive diplomacy between the two nations, which have not had diplomatic relations since 1980. In June, US and Iranian officials gathered in the Omani capital, Muscat, to discuss a nuclear agreement, but the process stalled as Israel bombed Iran.</p><p>The Israeli strikes kicked off a 12-day war, which ended with the US bombing key Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran making a symbolic strike on Al Udeid military base in Qatar, which hosts US forces.</p><p>Since then, Tehran has claimed it has replenished its stockpile of ballistic missiles and has warned countries it would use them if attacked. Washington is particularly eager to limit Iran’s ballistic missiles because, during the 12-day war, some Iranian missiles succeeded in breaching Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome defence system.</p><p>In the meantime, tensions remained high. On Tuesday, the US shot down an Iranian drone that had come close to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. And on the same day, US officials said Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, a Gulf waterway critical to global trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Omar Shakir, who has worked for the rights group for more than 10 years, told Al Jazeera he has lost faith in the organisation after its new chief, Bolopion, blocked a report accusing Israel of committing “crimes against humanity” in its denial of Palestinian refugees’ right of return.</p><p>Shakir said on Tuesday that the report “sought to connect the erasure of camps in Gaza with the emptying of camps in the West Bank, with the full assault led by the Israeli government against UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees and underscoring how in the midst of this Nakba 2.0 that we’re seeing unfold beyond us, it’s critical that we learn the lessons from Nakba 1.0”.</p><p>The Nakba, which means catastrophe, refers to the forced displacement of 750,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes and land by Zionist militias leading up to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine\">Ukraine</h2><p>In Ukraine, Russia’s “indiscriminate bombing, coercing Ukrainians in occupied areas to serve in the Russian military, systematic torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war, the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, and the use of quadcopter drones to hunt and kill civilians” have not been met with meaningful pressure.</p><h2 id=\"russia\">Russia</h2><p>Russia’s intensifying crackdown on dissent and civil society includes authorities using ill-treatment of those in custody as a “tool of repression” and wielding legislation to target “foreign agents” and “undesirable” organisations.</p><p>The head of the election monitoring group Golos, Grigory Melkonyants, was sentenced to five years in prison. Three lawyers were sentenced to prison terms for providing legal services to the Anti-Corruption Foundation’s founder, Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in 2024.</p><p>“Authorities throughout the country continued to prosecute people for commemorating Navalny’s memory, sharing information about him, using his name, or displaying his portrait,” the report said.</p><p>The foundation was also designated a “terrorist organization” by the country’s Supreme Court. International rights groups, including HRW, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders and the International Federation for Human Rights, have also been banned in Russia.</p><h2 id=\"china\">China</h2><p>In China, authorities “systematically deny the rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and religion, and persecute government critics”, the report says.</p><p>With the state controlling all significant channels of information and some of the world’s “most stringent surveillance and censorship”, critics face imprisonment and forced disappearance. Human rights defenders are frequently harassed and tortured, while those who belong to “illegal” religious groups are harassed and detained by police.</p><p>As Tibetans and Uighurs are forced to assimilate, the government released draft legislation, Promoting Ethnic Unity and Progress, which “seeks to justify existing repression of minorities and facilitate intensifying ideological controls both at home and abroad”.</p><h2 id=\"filling-the-vacuum\">Filling the vacuum</h2><p>The report stresses there is an “urgent need for a new global alliance to support human rights”.</p><p>HRW said it is “critical to look beyond the usual suspects”, pointing to countries such as Costa Rica, Ghana, Malaysia, Mexico, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Vanuatu, which have “played important roles on specific human rights initiatives in key international forums”.</p><p>Chile’s Democracy Forever summit brought together leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Spain and Uruguay, who pledged to engage in “active democratic diplomacy”, while The Hague Group was formed in solidarity with Palestinians and in defence of international law.</p><p>Student protests in support of Palestine, protests against ICE abuses in the US and Gen Z protests in Nepal, Indonesia and Morocco were cited as examples of enduring people power.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the US is reported to be backing away from this suggestion.</p><p>On Monday, US President Donald Trump announced the launch of a strategic minerals stockpile for the US called <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile\">Project Vault.</a> It will be funded by $2bn of private capital along with a $10bn loan from the US Export-Import Bank.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-critical-minerals-ministerial\">What is the Critical Minerals Ministerial?</h2><p>The meeting is the first of the new Critical Minerals Ministerial, a US initiative to build alliances aimed at countering China’s control over critical mineral supply chains around the world.</p><p>The main meeting of representatives takes place on Wednesday.</p><p>Currently, China controls most of the world’s rare earth minerals, including metals that are necessary for the manufacture of many technological items, from smartphones to fighter jets. China has 60 percent of these minerals and processes 90 percent of the world’s supply.</p><p>According to the US Department of State, the ministerial is being hosted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and is taking place at the State Department building close to the White House.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-attending\">Who is attending?</h2><p>The US will host delegations from more than 50 countries, according to the State Department.</p><p>This includes representatives from the Group of Seven countries – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US – as well as from the European Union, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>On Tuesday, Rubio met with Cho Hyun, the foreign minister of South Korea on the sidelines of the ministerial. In an X post, Rubio wrote that he and Cho discussed recent commitments by Seoul to increase “investments to rebuild critical US industries and the importance of diversifying and securing critical mineral supply chains to bolster our economic and national security”.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, Rubio met Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to discuss cooperation over critical minerals.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-critical-minerals-and-why-do-they-matter\">What are critical minerals and why do they matter?</h2><p>They are nonfuel minerals used to manufacture batteries, clocks, wiring, military hardware and semiconductors among other technological products.</p><p>The US describes them as “essential to the economic or national security of the US” and having “a supply chain vulnerable to disruption”.</p><p>Nickel, cobalt, lithium, aluminium and zinc are among the best-known critical minerals. For 12 critical minerals, the US relies entirely on imports. For 29 additional critical minerals, the US imports at least half of what it needs.</p><p>Critical minerals also include 17 rare earth elements – 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, scandium and yttrium. China has deposits of 12 of these.</p><p>Rare earth metals have special magnetic properties and are necessary for the production of permanent magnets, used for industrial automation, electric vehicle motors, renewable energy generators, electronics and many medical devices.</p><p>Because of China’s near-total control of rare earth metals, Western nations have said they worry about their access to these minerals. Currently, Europe’s supply of permanent magnets, for example, comes almost entirely from China.</p><p>The processing costs for rare earths are high, and mining them involves heavy use of chemicals that generate toxic waste harmful to the environment.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2229177\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/INTERACTIVE-What-minerals-are-used-in-electric-vehicles_2-1685964574.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - What minerals are used in electric vehicles_2-1685964574\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"which-country-dominates-critical-minerals-now\">Which country dominates critical minerals now?</h2><p>According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), global rare earth reserves were estimated at about 110 million tonnes as of 2024.</p><p>China has the most rare earth metals and a “near monopoly”, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported in 2024.</p><p>It has also filed thousands of patents for the processing technologies it has developed.</p><p>Last year, China began restricting exports of the 12 rare earth metals it possesses. In April, China <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/12/why-chinas-rare-earth-exports-are-a-key-issue-in-trade-tensions-with-us\">imposed restrictions</a> on exports for seven rare earth minerals. Then in October, it <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters\">added</a> the five remaining metals to the list.</p><p>In late October, Trump reached a trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. China agreed to put the restrictions for the five final metals on hold for one year while the two countries continue trade negotiations. In return, Trump dropped his threat of 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3543003\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/INTERACTIVE-UKRAINE-RARE-MINERALS-GLOBAL-DISTRIBUTION-FEB27-2025-1740694424.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-UKRAINE-RARE MINERALS-GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION-FEB27, 2025-1740694424\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues-on-the-meeting-s-agenda\">What are the key issues on the meeting’s agenda?</h2><p>On Wednesday, US Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley and Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg will deliver opening remarks.</p><p>The countries attending the conference will discuss setting a minerals price floor – a minimum price for a mineral or group of minerals. Those calling for a minimum price to be set said it would reduce risks for investors, keep supplies coming from a larger number of places and prevent large players from leveraging cheap prices to exclude smaller competitors.</p><p>The Trump administration, however, is stepping back from plans to guarantee such a minimum price, according to the Reuters news agency, which quoted unnamed sources for its report. Australian mining stocks dropped as a result.</p><p>Australia, which also has a large supply of rare earth metals, is among those countries pushing hard for a price floor as it positions itself as an alternative to China by investing heavily in developing its own processing capacity.</p><p>The ministerial will also be an opportunity for the US to get other countries to fall into line over its own policies for critical minerals, analysts said.</p><p>“The US is likely to push partner countries to sign minerals deals by which US companies get preferential or at least access to mineral deposits,” Raphael Deberdt, a postdoctoral fellow at the Copenhagen Business School, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Deberdt, who researches critical minerals, explained that while the US has access to these deposits, Washington will also want to invest in those countries to expand production of specific minerals, particularly rare earth elements, cobalt, nickel and graphite.</p><p>“The US is also likely to work on a reshuffling of critical minerals supply chains to orient processing towards its own territory and the territories of allied nations,” Deberdt said.</p><p>“However, this is still prospective as the US has little processing capabilities and remains far from Chinese dominance.”</p><p>He said the Washington conference, therefore, is more likely to be about making US policy on critical minerals visible rather than achieving “real advances in the onshoring, reshoring or friend-shoring of critical minerals”.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-developing-rare-earth-capacity\">Which other countries are developing rare earth capacity?</h2><p>Australia has the world’s fourth largest rare earth reserves, including metals such as neodymium, which is used to make magnets in wind turbines.</p><p>In October, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Trump signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/can-australia-provide-us-with-rare-earth-metals-which-china-has-restricted\">critical minerals agreement</a> that will give the US access to Australian rare earth minerals in return for investment.</p><p>But while Australia’s rare earth reserves are large, they are still only <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/can-australia-provide-us-with-rare-earth-metals-which-china-has-restricted\">one-seventh</a> the size of China’s, according to the USGS. That’s why experts said the US will likely try to <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/we-are-exploited-congolese-fear-losing-out-as-us-makes-minerals-deals\">court other countries</a> for supplies as well.</p><p>Greenland, which Trump has said he wants to take over and make part of the US, is also rich in critical minerals, including rare earth metals. Greenland has limited mining, however, as the practice is largely opposed by Indigenous Inuit residents.</p><h2 id=\"are-countries-stockpiling-their-own-critical-minerals\">Are countries stockpiling their own critical minerals?</h2><p>Yes, as well as the US Project Vault, other countries are stockpiling critical minerals to protect themselves from supply chain disruptions in response to China’s dominance of the market.</p><p>In March 2020, Japan introduced an international resource strategy that reinforced a stockpiling system for its rare earth minerals.</p><p>Similarly, South Korea maintains a longstanding stockpile of critical minerals managed by the state-run Korea Mine Rehabilitation and Mineral Resources Corporation.</p><p>In December, the European Commission adopted the RESourceEU Action Plan to secure the EU’s critical minerals supply. The commission said it will also establish a European Critical Raw Materials Centre early this year to diversify supply chains, including through stockpiling.</p><p>In January, Albanese’s government announced new details of Australia’s $1.2bn Critical Minerals Strategic Reserve to secure the supply of key critical minerals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The market for critical minerals, he believes, is attracting the “covetousness” of major world powers who are lining up for an “increasingly geopolitical” battle.</p><p>But at the end of the day, for the DRC, Koko says the benefits – or lack of them – will depend on the will of the Congolese leadership.</p><p>“If this deal will allow us, the Congolese people, to have roads from point A to point B, to have clean water, to have hospitals, to have water, I think it’s a good deal,” he told Al Jazeera, urging Congolese leaders to make sure the DRC does not come out empty-handed.</p><p>Before Trump came to office, former US President Joe Biden visited the region, in part to discuss the <a href=\"/features/2025/1/2/modern-plunderers-lobito-corridor-plans-bring-fear-hesitation-in-drc\">Lobito Corridor</a> railway infrastructure project, which is currently in disrepair in DRC but will connect the country’s mining provinces to Angola, along the Atlantic Coast – a key port for the export of minerals from Africa to the US.</p><p>According to satellite image analysis carried out by <a href=\"https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/thousands-in-drc-could-face-eviction-from-lobito-corridor-railway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Global Witness</a>, up to 6,500 people could be affected by displacement linked to the development of the Lobito corridor in the DRC.</p><p>The campaign group said it conducted interviews with different social groups last year in DRC’s Kolwezi, and also visited the railway tracks that will be cleared during the rehabilitation.</p><p>It said it had found that the railway line runs through vulnerable communities that have benefitted little from the mining boom in Kolwezi, highlighting a “complex” legal situation where the status of houses and buildings along the railway line was disputed, as was the size of the area to be cleared.</p><p>For Global Witness, the Lobito corridor will be a “litmus test” for Western partners who claim that the project represents a more equitable model for resource exploitation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287052\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287052\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287052\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25136541701680-1770183750.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287052\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Miners work at the D4 Gakombe coltan mining quarry in Rubaya, DRC [File: Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"local-communities-negatively-affected\">Local communities ‘negatively’ affected</h2><p>Gentil Mulume, 35, is an activist in Goma, working on matters of transparency and good governance.

Will the population benefit from this?” he asked.</p><p>For Kuda Manjonjo, a Just Transition adviser with PowerShift Africa, a think tank based in Kenya, Africa holds a disproportionate share of the critical minerals essential to the energy transition, but remains marginalised in global value chains.</p><p>“This disparity reflects an unfair exploitation model that hinders local development,” he said, stressing the importance of rebalancing the situation, calling for fairer governance, local investment in mineral processing and transformation, and better African representation in strategic decisions on these resources.</p><p>Another resident of Goma, Daniel Mukamba, accused many multinationals of seeking to keep countries that are rich in natural resources burdened by the “resource curse” – which he believes becomes a “cancer” that is difficult to cure.</p><p>“If you look at the examples of Walikale and Rubaya, these are cities that produce a lot of minerals, including coltan, gold, cassiterite, and tourmaline, but the population remains poor,” Mukamba told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Both these resource-rich eastern cities are now held by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group, which seized control of much of the east of the country last year.</p><p>A January <a href=\"https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/tracing-opaque-gold-supply-chains-and-deals-central-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> published by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime indicates that in South Kivu province in the east, opaque gold supply chains continue to be linked to conflict, human rights violations, and environmental damage.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287040\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287040\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-12-04T192330Z_268626762_RC2V9IA8X53Y_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RWANDA-CONGO-1770183675.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump shakes hands with President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Felix Tshisekedi during a signing ceremony at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, December 4, 2025 [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"war-means-illegal-exploitation-of-resources\">War means illegal exploitation of resources</h2><p>Despite the US-brokered peace deal between DRC and Rwanda and a separate one brokered by <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">Qatar</a> between DRC and the M23 rebel alliance, fighting continues in eastern DRC and has approached regions rich in critical minerals.</p><p>In December, M23 seized the city of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/we-dont-care-about-politics-violence-hit-uvira-locals-just-want-peace\">Uvira</a>, some 300km (190 miles) from the lithium-rich province of Tanganyika. Although they have since withdrawn, several observers say there are clashes not far from Tanganyika province.</p><p>Many fear that increasing fighting could cause the risk of “uncoordinated” exploitation of mineral resources and are calling for a rapid resolution to the conflict.</p><p>“When there is war, there is illegal exploitation of our minerals,” said Chirac Issa, an environmental activist based in Tanganyika province. “There is no government order to regulate the work of miners. From an environmental standpoint, we fear that uncontrolled mining could contribute to pollution and endanger ecosystems.”</p><p>After the “resources-for-security” US-brokered deal with Rwanda was first reached in June, Congolese President Tshisekedi was optimistic about it, saying it aimed to “promote our strategic minerals, particularly copper, cobalt, and lithium, in a sovereign manner”, while “ensuring a more equitable distribution of economic benefits for the Congolese people”.</p><p>He also said it would “pave the way for local transformation, the creation of thousands of jobs, and a new economic model based on sovereignty and national added value”.</p><p>Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) allied with the M23 – which now administers the capitals of North and South Kivu provinces – however, called the mining partnership between the DRC and the US “deeply flawed and unconstitutional”. He said the plan suffers from a lack of transparency and last week criticised the “opacity surrounding the negotiations”. At a news conference in August, he also denounced the “sell-off” of the DRC’s natural resources.</p><p>Tshisekedi said last year that “the resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo will never be sold off or handed over to obscure interests,” and that the country “will sell neither its future nor its dignity”.</p><p>DRC’s resources, he affirmed, “will benefit the Congolese people above all”.</p><p>But for those same Congolese in Goma – watching this week as foreign officials in suits discuss plans for their resources at a formal event thousands of kilometres away – the future is not as secure as their president might believe.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
