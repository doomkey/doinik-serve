Another third will be covered during a second and third phase in January, while voting has been cancelled altogether in the remainder.</p><p>Fighting, including air raids and arson, has intensified in several areas.</p><p>“The military is deploying troops and burning villages under the guise of ‘territorial dominance’,” said Esther J, a journalist based there. “People here are saying this is being done for the election.”</p><p>In most of the region, “we haven’t seen a single activity related to the election,” she said. “No one is campaigning, organising or telling people to vote.”</p><p>Across Myanmar, voting has been cancelled in 56 of the country’s 330 townships, with more cancellations expected. The conflict, triggered by the 2021 coup, has killed an estimated 90,000 people and displaced more than 3.5 million, according to monitoring groups and the United Nations. It has left nearly half of the country’s population of 55 million in need of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>“People [in Sagaing] say they have no interest in the election,” said Esther J. “They do not want the military. They want the revolutionary forces to win.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"shifting-battlefield\">Shifting battlefield</h2><p>For much of last year, the Myanmar military appeared to be losing ground.</p><p>A coordinated offensive launched in late 2023 by the Three Brotherhood Alliance – a coalition of ethnic armed groups and opposition militias – seized vast areas, nearly pushing the military out of western Rakhine state and capturing a major regional military headquarters in the northeastern city of Lashio, about 120km (75 miles) from the Chinese border. Armed with commercial drones modified to carry bombs, the rebels were soon threatening the country’s second-largest city of Mandalay.</p><p>The operation – dubbed 1027 – marked the most significant threat to the military since the 2021 coup.</p><p>But the momentum has stalled this year, largely because of China’s intervention.</p><p>In April, Beijing brokered a deal in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army agreed to surrender the city of Lashio, without a single shot being fired. The military subsequently reclaimed key towns in north and central Myanmar, including Nawnghkio, Thabeikkyin, Kyaukme and Hsipaw. In late October, China brokered another agreement for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army to withdraw from the gold mining towns of Mogok and Momeik.</p><p>“The Myanmar military is definitely resurgent,” said Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). “If this current trend continues, the Myanmar military could be back in a relatively dominant position in a year or so, maybe two.”</p><p>The military turned the tide by launching a conscription drive, expanding its drone fleet and putting more combat credible soldiers in charge. Since announcing mandatory military service in February 2024, it has recruited between 70,000 to 80,000 people, researchers say.</p><p>“The conscription drive has been unexpectedly effective,” said Min Zaw Oo, executive director at the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security. “Economic hardship and political polarisation pushed many young men into the ranks,” he said, with many of the recruits technically adept and serving as snipers and drone operators. “The military’s drone units now outmatch those of the opposition,” he added.</p><p>According to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED), a monitoring group, air and drone attacks by the military have increased by roughly 30 percent this year. The group recorded 2,602 air attacks that it said killed 1,971 people – the highest toll since the coup. It said Myanmar now ranks third in the world for drone operations, behind only Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>China, meanwhile, has applied pressure beyond brokering ceasefires.</p><p>According to analysts, Beijing pressed one of the strongest armed ethnic groups, the United Wa State Army, to cut off weapons supplies to other rebels, resulting in ammunition shortages across the country. The opposition forces have also suffered from disunity. “They are as fragmented as ever,” said Michaels of the IISS. “Relationships between these groups are deteriorating, and the ethnic armed organisations are abandoning the People’s Defence Forces,” he said, referring to the opposition militias that mobilised after the coup.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-s-calculations\">China’s calculations</h2><p>China, observers say, acted for fear of a state collapse in Myanmar.</p><p>“The situation in Myanmar is a ‘hot mess’, and it’s on China’s border,” said Einar Tangen, a Beijing-based analyst at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. Beijing, he said, wants to see peace in Myanmar to protect key trade routes, including the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that, when completed, will link its landlocked Yunnan province to the Indian Ocean and a deep seaport there.</p><p>Tangen said Beijing harbours no love for the military, but sees few alternatives.</p><p>Indeed, after the coup, Beijing refrained from normalising relations with Myanmar or recognising coup leader Min Aung Hlaing. But in a sign of shifting policy, Chinese President Xi Jinping met Min Aung Hlaing twice this year. During talks in China’s Tianjin in August, Xi told Min Aung Hlaing that Beijing supports Myanmar in safeguarding its sovereignty, as well as “in unifying all domestic political forces” and “restoring stability and development”.</p><p>Tangen said China sees the election as a path to more predictable governance. Russia and India, too, have backed the process, though the UN and several Western nations have called it a “sham”. But Tangen noted that while Western nations denounce the military, they have done little to engage with the rebels. The United States has dealt further blows by cutting off foreign aid and ending visa protections for Myanmar citizens.</p><p>“The West is paying lip service to the humanitarian crisis. China’s trying to do something but doesn’t know how to solve it,” Tangen said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"limited-gains-lasting-war\">Limited gains, lasting war</h2><p>The military’s territorial gains, meanwhile, remain modest.</p><p>In northern Shan state, Myanmar’s largest, the military has recaptured only 11.3 percent of the territory it had lost, according to the Institute for Strategy and Policy – Myanmar, a think tank. But it is western Rakhine State that remains the “larger and more intense theatre of war”, said Khin Zaw Win, a Yangon-based analyst.</p><p>There, the Arakan Army is pushing beyond the borders of the state, overrunning multiple bases, and pushing east in a move that threatens the military’s defence industries. In northern Kachin state, the battle for Bhamo, a gateway to the north, is approaching its first anniversary, while in the southeast, armed groups have taken a “number of important positions along the border with Thailand”, he said.</p><p>So the military’s recent gains in other parts were “not that significant”, he added.</p><p>ACLED, the war monitor, also described the military’s successes as “limited in the context of the overall conflict”. In a briefing this month, Su Mon, a senior analyst at ACLED, wrote that the military remains in a “weakened position compared to before the 2021 coup and Operation 1027 and is unable to assert effective control over the areas it has recently retaken”.</p><p>Still, the gains give the military “more confidence to proceed with the elections”, said Khin Zaw Win.</p><p>The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, which has fielded the most candidates, is expected to form the next government. Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy has been dissolved, and she remains held incommunicado, while other smaller opposition parties have been barred from participating.</p><p>Khin Zaw Win said he does not expect the election to “affect the war to any appreciable extent” and that the military might even be “deluded to go for a complete military victory”.</p><p>But on the other hand, China could help de-escalate, he said.</p><p>“China’s mediation efforts are geared toward a negotiated settlement,” he noted. “It expects a ‘payoff’ and does not want a protracted war that will harm its larger interests.”</p><p><em>Zaheena Rasheed wrote and reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Cape Diamond reported from Yangon, Myanmar.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

For the supporters of the administration of US President Donald Trump, the unprecedented operation signalled his country’s renewed resolve in confronting terrorism. It is also making good on Trump’s pledge to take action on what he claims is a “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/8/ted-cruz-blames-nigeria-for-mass-murder-of-christians-whats-the-truth\">Christian genocide</a>” in Nigeria.</p><p>But beneath the spectacle of military action lies a sobering reality: Bombing campaigns of this nature are unlikely to improve Nigeria’s security or help stabilise the conflict-racked country. On the contrary, the strikes risk misrepresenting the conflict and distracting from the deeper structural crisis that is driving violence.</p><p>The first problem with the strikes is their lack of strategic logic. The initial strikes were launched in Sokoto in northwest Nigeria, a region that has experienced intense turmoil over the past decade. But this violence is not primarily driven by an ideological insurgency linked to ISIL, and no known ISIL-linked groups are operating in the region. Instead, security concerns in this region are rooted in <a href=\"/features/2022/4/19/are-nigerias-bandits-a-new-boko-haram-cell-or-rival\">banditry</a>, the collapse of rural economies, and competition for land. Armed groups here are fragmented and motivated largely by profit.</p><p>The Christmas Day strikes <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/us-bombs-target-isil-in-nigeria-whats-really-going-on\">appear</a> to have focused on a relatively new ideological armed group called Lakurawa, though its profile and any connection to ISIL are yet to be fully established.</p><p>The ideological armed groups with the strongest presence in northern Nigeria are Boko Haram and the ISIL-affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP). The centre of these groups’ activity remains hundreds of kilometres from Sokoto, in the northeast of Nigeria – the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa – where insurgency has a long history. This begs the question: Why strike the northwest first? The logic is unclear.</p><p>Equally concerning is the uncertainty surrounding casualties. So far, we have no authoritative figures. Some social media accounts claim there were no human casualties, suggesting the bombs fell on empty targets. Security analyst Brant Philip posted on his social media platform X: “According to a private source familiar with the US operation against the Islamic State in Nigeria, several strikes were launched, but most of the individuals and groups targeted were missed, and the actual damage inflicted remains mostly unknown.”</p><p>Nigerian news platform Arise TV reported on X that locals confirmed the incident caused widespread panic; according to its correspondent, at least one of the attacks happened in a district that had not suffered from violence before. They also noted that the full impact of the attack, including whether there were civilian casualties, is yet to be determined.</p><p>Other social media accounts have circulated images alleging civilian casualties, though these claims remain unverified. In a context where information warfare operates alongside armed conflict, speculation often travels faster than facts. The lack of transparent data on casualties from the US government risks deepening mistrust among communities already wary of foreign military involvement.</p><p>Symbolism also matters. The attack took place on Christmas Day, a detail that carries emotive and political significance. For many Muslims in northern Nigeria, the timing risks being interpreted as an act of supporting a broader narrative of a Western “crusade” against the Muslim community.</p><p>Even more sensitive is the location of the strikes: Sokoto. Historically, it is the spiritual seat of the 19th-century Sokoto Caliphate, a centre of Islamic authority and expansion revered by Nigerian Muslims. Bombing such a symbolic centre risks inflaming anti-US sentiment, deepening religious suspicion, and giving hardline propagandists fertile ground to exploit. Rather than weakening alleged ISIL influence, the strikes could inadvertently energise recruitment and amplify grievance narratives.</p><p>If air strikes cannot solve Nigeria’s security crisis, what can?</p><p>The answer lies not in foreign military intervention. Nigeria’s conflicts are symptoms of deeper governance failures: Weakened security, corruption, and the absence of the state in rural communities. In the northwest, where banditry thrives, residents often negotiate with armed groups not because they sympathise with them, but because the state is largely absent to provide them with security and basic services. In the northeast, where Boko Haram emerged, years of government neglect, heavy-handed security tactics, and economic exclusion created fertile ground for insurgency.</p><p>The most sustainable security response must therefore be multi-layered.

Investigations are under way, he added, to determine whether he had direct ties to ISIL or adopted violent ideology.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"isil-attacks-down\">ISIL attacks down</h2><p>In May 2015, ISIL took over the city of Palmyra from the former Syrian government.</p><p>Famous for its Greco-Roman ruins, the city bounced back and forth between regime forces and ISIL until the group was expelled in 2017.</p><p>In May 2017, the US-led coalition also forced the group out of Raqqa, which ISIL had declared the capital of its so-called caliphate three years earlier.</p><p>Many surviving ISIL fighters were imprisoned in <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/5/19/a-fathers-fight-to-find-out-what-happened-to-his-son-who-joined-isis\">the al-Hol and Roj camps</a> in northeast Syria, controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Others escaped into the Syrian desert around Palmyra, from where they have occasionally launched attacks.</p><p>When the regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fell on December 8, 2024, analysts said ISIL fighters used the ensuing chaos to go into various cities across the country. In June, the group <a href=\"/features/2025/6/25/deadly-church-attack-raises-security-fears-for-syrians-minorities\">launched an attack</a> on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Samy Akil, a fellow at the Tahrir Institute, said recent estimates put ISIL’s manpower in Iraq and Syria at between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters.</p><p>But experts told Al Jazeera that the coordination between Damascus and Washington has improved over the last year, and pointed to the fact that Syria’s security forces have thwarted several ISIL attacks due to US-provided intelligence.</p><p>“Ahmed al-Sharaa’s new government is committed to fighting the group and, in contrast to the Assad era, al-Sharaa’s government gets regular tip-offs from US intelligence, and probably other forms of US support as well. That’s a pretty powerful combination,” Aron Lund, a research fellow at Century International, focusing on Syria, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This collaboration has seen a decrease in ISIL attacks in Syria, according to a report by consulting firm Karam Shaar Advisory. ISIL launched an average of 63 attacks a month in 2024, while in 2025, that number dropped to 10, according to the report.</p><p>“Since HTS arrived in Damascus, collaboration [with the US] has become much easier,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"structural-flaws\">Structural flaws</h2><p>After the fall of the Assad regime, there were questions over how security would be enforced. The few thousand HTS members who had previously only controlled Idlib in northwest Syria would not be enough to enforce security across the country.</p><p>Syria’s security forces undertook a serious recruitment drive, bringing in tens of thousands of new recruits to add to many of the existing former opposition battalions that were incorporated under the state’s new security apparatus.</p><p>With such a huge recruitment campaign, analysts said, vetting was a difficult task.</p><p>“The Palmyra attack points to structural flaws rather than a mere one-off event. Integration of former faction fighters and rapid new recruitment have produced uneven vetting and oversight, compounded by a permissive environment for radical views, allowing infiltration to persist,” Nanar Hawash, International Crisis Group’s senior Syria analyst, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Together, these factors blur early warning signs and create space for hidden threats, raising the risk of repeat attacks.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Analysts said they expect Syrian security forces to improve the vetting process with time. Meanwhile, another attack like December 13’s was possible and could dent the US’s faith that al-Sharaa’s government can provide security in Syria.</p><p>“It could happen again due to the sheer numbers [of new recruits], but over time, the government will improve its game and be more thorough to prevent that from happening again, because it will have consequences,” Drevon said.</p><p>“We should be careful over generalising based on one attack, which can be a one-off. But if it happens again, it might change the perception of the Syrian government.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-isil-want\">What does ISIL want?</h2><p>As for ISIL, analysts said the group’s priorities have changed since the fall of al-Assad.</p><p>“What we’re seeing now is ISIL is trying to test boundaries and conduct attacks knowing it cannot gain territorial control,” Akil said.</p><p>“It aims at destabilising and staying relevant.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“ISIS cannot hold cities or topple governments. But it doesn’t need to. Its strength lies in destabilisation,” Hawach said. “The Palmyra attack showed that one operative with the right access can kill three US personnel and shake a bilateral relationship.”</p><p>Analysts said ISIL could destabilise Syria by targeting state security forces, religious minorities – like it did in the Damascus church attack in June – or any foreigner on Syrian soil, from US soldiers to humanitarian or United Nations workers. The group could also look to capitalise on tensions between the SDF and Damascus over <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">disagreements on how to integrate</a> the former into the state’s security apparatus.</p><p>The SDF also manages the al-Hol and Roj prison camps in northeast Syria, where many of ISIL’s most battle-hardened fighters and commanders are held. This could prove to be a key target for ISIL in Syria.</p><p>“ISIL thrives in those vacuums,” Hawach said.</p><p>“It’s a guerrilla insurgency, not a caliphate, but in a fragile state, that’s enough to cause serious damage.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The self-declared republic has established its own currency, flag and parliament, though its eastern territories remain disputed.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“This will never be acceptable or tolerable to our government and people who are united in defending our territorial integrity,” Omar said. “Our government strongly advises the State of Israel to rescind its divisive actions and abide by international law.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known locally as Cirro, had been signalling for weeks that recognition by an unnamed state was imminent, though he didn’t clarify which country. Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa had been dotted with billboards in recent weeks, telling residents that recognition was coming.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Omar said the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa was driving foreign interference and interest. “The importance of this region isn’t new. It is still important for international trade today,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"displacement-of-palestinians\">‘Displacement of Palestinians’</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Omar accused Israel of pursuing Somaliland’s recognition in order to further <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/man-says-shadowy-group-sending-palestinians-out-of-gaza-has-israeli-support\">displace Palestinians</a> from Gaza. “One of the motivating factors is the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera. “It has been widely known – Israel’s goal on that issue.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Palestine’s foreign ministry backed Somalia, recalling that Israel had previously identified Somaliland as a potential destination for forcibly displacing Palestinians from Gaza, which it described as a “red line”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On Saturday, Somaliland’s Cirro defended the Israeli move, insisting it was “not directed against any state, nor does it pose a threat to regional peace”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the recognition on Friday, Somalia’s prime minister’s office issued a statement describing Israel’s action as a deliberate attack on Somalia’s sovereignty and an unlawful step, and emphasising that Somaliland remains an integral and “inseparable” part of the Somali territory.</p><p>Netanyahu framed the diplomatic breakthrough with Somaliland as being in the spirit of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/trump-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon-hopes-s-arabia-will-join\">Abraham Accords</a> and said he would champion Somaliland’s cause during his meeting with United States President Donald Trump on Monday. Netanyahu also invited Cirro to Israel, which the latter has accepted.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Trump has distanced himself from close ally Netanyahu on the issue, telling The New York Post newspaper he would not follow Israel’s lead.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Somalia’s Public Works Minister Ayub Ismail Yusuf welcomed Trump’s stance, writing on social media: “Thank you for your support, Mr. President.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Trump’s comments marked a shift from August, when he told a news conference his administration was working on the Somaliland issue. In recent weeks, the US president has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">frequently attacked</a> the Somali community in the US and Somalia.</p><p>The US has also expressed frustration with Somalia, saying at a recent UN Security Council meeting that Somali authorities had failed in improving security in the country despite billions in aid, and signalling it will not continue to fund a costly peacekeeping mission.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Meanwhile, the African Union’s chairperson, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, rejected any initiative aimed at recognising Somaliland as an independent nation, warning it would set a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications. The continental bloc cited a 1964 decision on the intangibility of borders inherited at a country’s independence as a fundamental principle.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also condemned what he described as a provocative Israeli assault on the sovereignty of an Arab and African state. He said the Israeli recognition was a clear violation of international law and a flagrant infringement of the principle of state sovereignty.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Despite the international reactions, thousands poured onto the streets of Hargeisa on Friday to celebrate what many saw as the end of 30 years of diplomatic isolation. The Israeli flag was emblazoned on the national museum as residents welcomed the breakthrough.</p><p>Somalia has historically had contentious relations with Israel, stemming from Israel’s historic ties with Somalia’s regional rival, Ethiopia.</p><p>During the Cold War, Israel provided Ethiopia with military training, intelligence and weapons, while Somalia, aligned with Arab states hostile to Israel, was defeated in the 1977 Ogaden War, a setback that helped fuel decades of civil unrest.</p><p>Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 following persecution under former leader Mohammed Siad Barre, but Somalia has never recognised the breakaway region.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Earlier this month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel revealed there had been communication with Somalia’s government about shared concerns over Houthi influence in the region.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Omar, the Somali state minister for foreign affairs, strongly denied any ties with Israel, stating that the country’s position on Israeli policies remained unchanged.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Average turnout in past years has been about 62 percent, according to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). There are about 6,700 polling units across the country.</p><p>The National Elections Authority initially planned to hold the municipal government elections at the end of August, but moved the polls to December at the last minute, blaming insufficient funds as well as technical and organisational challenges. The decision has added to concerns among election observers and opposition politicians about how prepared the electoral body is.</p><p>Campaigning began on December 13, but opposition groups claim that delays in including Touadera’s biggest challengers in the process have favoured the president’s rallies.</p><p>The presidential candidate with an absolute majority is declared the winner, but if there is no outright winner in the first round, a second run-off vote will determine the victor.</p><p>Although presidents were previously limited to two, five-year terms, a controversial <a href=\"/news/2023/8/8/opposition-cries-foul-as-central-african-republic-okays-tenure-elongation\">2023 referendum</a> introduced a new constitution which removed term limits and increased each term to seven years.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-running-for-president\">Who is running for president?</h2><p>The country’s constitutional court approved Touadera’s candidacy alongside prominent opposition leader Anicet-Georges Dologuele, ex-Prime Minister Henri-Marie Dondra, and five others.</p><p>However, delays in approving the two major opponents and concerns around the readiness of the electoral body have led an opposition coalition, the Republican Bloc for the Defence of the Constitution (BRDC), to boycott the election. The group has, therefore, not presented a candidate.</p><p>Here is what we know about the candidates who are standing:</p><h3 id=\"faustin-archange-touadera\">Faustin-Archange Touadera</h3><p>Touadera, 68, is a mathematician and former vice chancellor of the University of Bangui. He is running under the ruling United Hearts Movement (MCU).</p><p>He served as the country’s prime minister from 2013 to 2015 under President Francois Bozize. He was elected as president in 2016 and again in 2020, although opposition groups contested the vote.</p><p>Touadera, who is the favourite to win in these polls, has campaigned on promises of peace, security and new infrastructural development in the country.</p><p>After 10 years in office, the president’s legacy is mixed. His administration has been dogged by accusations of suppressing the opposition and rigging elections.</p><p>Indeed, Touadera would not be eligible to run had he not forced the 2023 referendum through. He sacked a chief judge of the constitutional court in October 2022, after she ruled that his referendum project was illegal.</p><p>Opposition members boycotted the referendum, but that only gave the Touadera camp more “yes” votes. Although a civil society group launched a legal challenge against his candidacy before the polls, the constitutional court threw out the suit.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194976\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194976\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194976\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-23T070158Z_1780493371_RC20BCA53HL1_RTRMADP_3_CENTRALAFRICA-ELECTION-TOUADERA-1766647361.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Touadera\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194976\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Central African Republic’s President Faustin-Archange Touadera shake hands as they meet in Moscow, Russia, January 16, 2025 [File: Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Touadera is credited with spearheading some economic development, compared with his predecessors. New roads and highways have been built where there were previously none, but the World Bank still ranks CAR’s economy as “stagnant”.</p><p>Touadera has also been praised for achieving relative stability in the conflict-affected country where armed groups hold swaths of territory, especially in the areas bordering Sudan.</p><p>Support from a United Nations peacekeeping force, Rwandan troops and Russian Wagner mercenaries has helped to reduce violence in recent years.</p><p>CAR was the first country to invite the Russian mercenary group to the continent in 2018 in a security-for-minerals deal, before other countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, also secured security contracts.</p><p>CAR was historically closer to former colonial power France, but Paris suspended its military alliances and reduced aid budgets to the country in 2021 following the Russia cooperation.</p><p>At a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023, Touadera praised Russia for saving CAR’s democracy. The two met again in January 2025.</p><p>In advance of the elections, Touadera has also signed a series of peace accords with some armed groups active in the country, although there are fears that the agreements will only hold until after the polls.</p><p>The president launched Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2022, making CAR the second country to do so after El Salvador. The idea drew scepticism, as less than 10 percent of Central Africans can access the internet, and was ultimately abandoned after a year.</p><p>In February 2025, CAR launched the $CAR meme coin, which the government said is an experiment.</p><p>This week, Touadera’s government signed a new contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink to expand internet services to rural and remote regions.</p><h3 id=\"henri-marie-dondra\">Henri-Marie Dondra</h3><p>The 59-year-old is a career banker and former finance minister. He is running under his Republican Unity party (UNIR), which has positioned itself as a reformist party and is not part of the opposition coalition. He <a href=\"/news/2021/6/11/central-african-republic-names-former-finance-minister-as-pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">served as prime minister</a> under Touadera between 2021 and 2022 but was fired, likely because of his strong pro-France tendencies at a time when the administration was turning towards Russia, according to reporting by French radio, RFI.</p><p>Dondra’s candidacy was not approved until November 14, after Touadera accused him of holding Congolese citizenship, which he denied. The accusations raised fears that he would be barred from the vote. Two of his brothers were reportedly arrested and detained without charge before the vote, Dondra told Human Rights Watch in late November.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194980\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194980\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194980\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T070158Z_1199617705_RC29NIAPZ0S2_RTRMADP_3_CENTRALAFRICA-ELECTION-PREVIEW-1766647511.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1159&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dologuele\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A campaign billboard of presidential candidate Anicet-Georges Dologuele, of the Union for Central African Renewal (URCA), stands before the presidential election scheduled for December 28, in Bangui, Central African Republic, December 24, 2025 [Leger Serge Kokpakpa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"anicet-georges-dologuele\">Anicet-Georges Dologuele</h3><p>The main opposition leader of the Union for Central African Renewal (URCA) party broke from the boycotting opposition coalition in order to run in these elections. Dologuele’s candidacy has prompted what some analysts say are xenophobic statements from Touadera’s supporters.</p><p>The 68-year-old dual citizen French-CAR politician first ran for the top job back in 2015 and was the runner-up in the 2020 presidential race. His third bid has faced challenges over his citizenship status. The 2023 referendum limited candidates to CAR citizenship only, and derisive comments from some in the governing camp have suggested some opposition candidates are not “real Central Africans”.</p><p>In September, Dologuele said he had given up his French citizenship; however, in October, a Central African court stripped him of his CAR citizenship, citing a clause in the old constitution disallowing dual citizenship. Dologuele reported the issue as a violation of his human rights to the UN human rights agency. It’s unclear what, if any, action the agency took, but Dologuele’s name on the final candidates list suggests his citizenship was reinstated.</p><p>Dologuele served as prime minister in the 1990s, under President Ange-Felix Patasse, before joining the Bank of Central African States and later heading the Development Bank of Central African States.</p><p>Although he is seen by some as an experienced hand, others associate him with past government failures. Dologuele is promising stronger democratic institutions and better international alliances.</p><h3>Other notable candidates</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Aristide Briand Reboas</strong> – leader of the Christian Democratic Party, the 46-year-old was a former intelligence official and the sports minister until 2024. He is running on promises of better amenities, including electricity and water. He previously ran in 2020.</li>\n<li><strong>Serge Djorie </strong>– a former government spokesperson until 2024, the 49-year-old is running under his Collective for Political Change for the new Central African Republic party. The medical doctor and published researcher has campaigned on public health reforms, poverty reduction and more pan-Africanism. Djorie ran in the 2020 elections.</li>\n<li><strong>Eddy Symphorien Kparekouti</strong> – The civil engineer helped draft the new constitution that was controversially adopted in 2023. In his campaigns, the independent candidate has emphasised poverty reduction in order to solve political insecurity and other developmental challenges.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues-for-this-election\">What are the key issues for this election?</h2><h3 id=\"persistent-insecurity\">Armed groups</h3><p>Protracted political conflict in CAR has continued for more than a decade, with many Central Africans saying they want a leadership that can bring peace.</p><p>Trouble began following a coup in March 2013 by the mainly Muslim Seleka rebel alliance that overthrew President Francois Bozize. In retaliation, Bozize assembled Christian and animist rebel armed groups, known as the Anti-balaka. Both sides attacked civilians and have been accused of war crimes by rights groups. Bozize, who continues to lead a rebel coalition, is now in exile in Guinea-Bissau. His attempted attacks in 2020 were fended off by Touadera’s Russian mercenaries.</p><p>However, killings, kidnappings and displacement continue in many rural communities in the country’s northwest, northeast and southeast regions, despite recent peace deals signed with some groups.
