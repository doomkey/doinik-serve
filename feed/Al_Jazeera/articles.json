            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In her latest book titled <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/girlhood-at-war-9798881800994/\">Girlhood at War</a>, political science scholar Vjosa Musliu tells the story of the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo, through the eyes of her 12-year-old self. Musliu explains how following the end of the war, international organisations were quick to offer workshops on reconciliation and peacebuilding for Serbs and Albanians who lived in Kosovo.</p><p>In the final chapter, “Little Red Riding Hood”, she describes one such session she attended as a teenager in 2002. Led by facilitators from Belgium and the United Kingdom, the workshop began with the story of Little Red Riding Hood, which the participants were asked to reimagine from the perspective of the wolf.</p><p>In the reimagined version, massive deforestation had left the wolf increasingly isolated, so when he met the girl in the red hood, he had not eaten in weeks. Driven by hunger and fear that he might die, the wolf ate the grandmother and the girl.</p><p>The story puzzled Musliu and her peers, who struggled at first to understand how hunger could possibly justify the wolf killing the little girl and her grandmother, and second, to see the purpose of this story in a reconciliation workshop. The facilitators explained that the exercise was meant to show that there are many perspectives to every story, the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and there could always be different truths.</p><p>Absurd as it is, more than 20 years later, I found myself in a very similar situation. In October, I attended a workshop organised by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to bring together young women from Kosovo and Serbia and teach them dialogue and peacemaking.</p><p>Just like Musliu, we too had a foreign facilitator and several international speakers. This time, they had also added two assistant facilitators, one from Kosovo and one from Serbia; it was clear that both had been given a detailed script to follow, which they could not deviate from.</p><p>The first day of the training, we were asked to explain how we understood peace. So we did so by sharing different stories, many of which were traumatic. Some I still cannot stop thinking about. The facilitator seemed less concerned about what we were saying and more preoccupied with us running 15 minutes late. There seemed to be little understanding of the depth of emotions, courage, and vulnerability that those stories carried.</p><p>On the second day, we learned about integrative negotiations. One bullet point in the presentation said that negotiation requires “separating the people from the problem”. I read it, and I felt something in my chest; I couldn’t continue reading further.</p><p>How do I separate the people from the problem, when I know what happened to my family and my community during the war? My parents were forced to flee to Albania before Serb forces entered their neighbourhood; when they came back, their home had been broken into, damaged and some items missing – including my mother’s wedding dress. Neighbours told her that Serb soldiers made it a point to burn women’s wedding dresses they found.</p><p>In other communities, the crimes went well beyond broken homes. More than <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2014/12/10/kosovo-war-victims-list-published/\">8,000 ethnic Albanian civilians</a> were killed or forcibly disappeared; more than 20,000 girls, boys, women and men <a href=\"https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/en/cp_article/war-in-kosovo-and-sexual-violence-a-painful-legacy/\">were raped</a>.</p><p>“During the rape, I was trying to protect myself—I was just a child, only 11 years old. But they marked me. They carved a cross into me and said, ‘This is the memory you’ll keep of us.’ It destroyed me as a child, from the inside. They made those marks on me with a knife,” one survivor recounted.</p><p>Knowing this story and so many others, I found it hard to understand how one can tell a group of young women whose family members were displaced, raped, tortured, or killed during the war that the problem has to be separated from the people.</p><p>I guess it is easy for foreign facilitators to do so because at the end of a peacemaking workshop, they would take a cab to the airport, fly home and leave behind the survivors still struggling with a transition from war to peace and all the pain in between. I recalled Musliu’s words at the end of her story about peacemaking between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood: “We should ask them how they would reconcile their differences if the wolf had eaten their grandmothers?”</p><p>Throughout the workshop, we were assigned seats in the conference room, where we were mixed, the girls from Kosovo and the girls from Serbia sitting next to each other. However, as soon as the lunch break time came, the attempt to make us sit together and befriend failed, as we sat at different tables.</p><p>When asked by the organisers about this division, I responded that the workshop was yet to address the elephant in the room – the war itself. How could we feel there could be resolution and closure without discussing what triggered the war, what happened during it, and how it ended? How could we reconcile if we could not talk about justice?</p><p>Every time I wanted to emphasise the complexity of the post-war situation – for example, by bringing up the topic of survivors of sexual violence – there was an intervention from the facilitators who told me “you are not ready yet” to talk about this.</p><p>I was furious to hear someone else evaluate my ability to handle a conversation. It is a tone the West often uses when speaking to the rest of the world. We are told we are “not ready” for democracy, “not prepared” for self-governance, “not objective enough” to confront our own past.</p><p>Readiness becomes a way to measure civilisation, to decide who can speak and who must listen. In these spaces, “not being ready” is never about emotional strength; it is about power. It is a polite way of saying that our truth is inconvenient, that our pain must wait for translation, moderation, and approval.</p><p>It speaks volumes that the workshop organisers claimed to have a focus on gender, but at the same time avoided the topic of rape as a war crime because it surpassed the level of depth – or rather level of superficiality – they had planned in their agenda.</p><p>On the fifth day of the training, the facilitator announced that we would talk about historical narratives to understand “different perspectives and different truths, even if we don’t agree with all of them”.</p><p>For the organisers, clearly, such an exercise was useful. For me, using perspectives and truths interchangeably was dangerous. It could blur the lines between facts and narratives.</p><p>Yes, wars may hold many perspectives and experiences, but truth is not among the things that can be multiplied. Truth, out of all the things, is not a matter of balance or compromise; it rests on evidence, and it is rooted in facts. When we challenge or debate facts, we risk distorting truth; we risk allowing falsehoods to look like reasonable interpretations of history.</p><p>And so, I sat on that day, 26 years after the end of the war, listening to a painful, outrageous, and dangerous message: There are many truths to a story. I was told that now we have to move on from the past and look towards the future, reconcile and find a way to live with each other.</p><p>I cannot help but think, how in a few years’ time, someone will go and train the Palestinians who experienced genocidal horrors as children on Western-style peacebuilding.</p><p>How would they look a Palestinian in the eye and tell them there are many truths to the Gaza genocide story? How on earth would this be promoting peace?</p><p>If this is what the West today calls building peace, I do not want to be a part of it.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Experts have <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/what-is-cartel-de-los-soles-the-latest-group-designated-terrorist-by-us\">pushed back</a> on the characterisation, saying the “Cartel de los Soles” has traditionally referred to a loose network of corruption within the Venezuelan government.</p><p>In a Saturday post on his Truth Social account, Trump said airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed “in its entirety”, in what some observers saw as the final preparations for military action.</p><p>But on Sunday, Trump told reporters not to “read anything into” the move.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC on Monday, Al Jazeera’s chief US correspondent Alan Fischer said “no one quite knows” why Trump announced the airspace closure. He added that reports in US media indicate the announcement happened without Pentagon notification.</p><p>“When asked about it … on Air Force One, [Trump] said that you shouldn’t read too much into it. But of course, that didn’t stop the speculation, because normally no-fly zones are imposed before there’s some sort of military operation,” Fisher said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He added that many observers in Washington have read the threats and asset build-up as an effort to force Maduro to flee the country before any military action is taken. Others have pointed to Trump’s past statements on Venezuela’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/venezuela-calls-on-opec-to-counter-us-threats\">vast oil reserves</a>, sparking concerns he could pursue a “war for oil”.</p><p>“Of course, in all of this, Donald Trump has to balance his MAGA [Make America Great Again] supporters because he campaigned on the fact that he wouldn’t get involved in what he described as stupid foreign wars,” Fisher said.</p><p>Reporting from the US territory of Puerto Rico, the staging ground of the military’s Caribbean build-up, Al Jazeera’s Phil Lavelle said there has been a flurry of activity, but it remained difficult to discern if any operations were imminent.</p><p>“We’ve got about 15,000 or so military personnel in this part of the world as this readiness is under way,” Lavelle said.</p><p>“We’ve also obviously got the sea systems: We’ve got the USS Gerald F Ford, the largest aircraft carrier strike group in the world, currently off the coast … Also, the USS Winston S Churchill and the USS Bainbridge,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-scrutiny-over-boat-strikes\">Renewed scrutiny over boat strikes</h2><p>The build-up has persisted as the Trump administration has faced renewed pressure over its <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">lethal strikes</a> on alleged Venezuelan drug smugglers in international waters in the Caribbean.</p><p>Over the weekend, Republican and Democratic leaders on the US House and Senate armed services committees announced they were upping oversight of the strikes.</p><p>That came after the Washington Post and CNN reported last week that US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill all people aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs from Venezuela.</p><p>Subsequently, military officials reportedly ordered a so-called “follow-on” strike on the vessel after two individuals appeared to survive the first strike.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While legal scholars have long said US strikes on vessels carrying alleged “narco-terrorists” in international waters <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/in-boat-strike-trump-repurposes-war-on-terror-for-latin-american-crime\">may be illegal</a> under both international and domestic law, the defence secretary explicitly ordering forces to kill all people on board the vessels ventures into even more precarious legal grounds.</p><p>In a letter, a group of former US military lawyers said the orders “if true” would “constitute war crimes, murder, or both”.</p><p>Responding to the report, Hegseth said all military actions in the Caribbean were “in compliance with the law of armed conflict”.</p><p>He has since doubled down in defiance, posting on social media on Sunday a mock image of children’s character Franklin targeting boats with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump said that Hegseth had denied giving the kill order.</p><p>“He did not say that, and I believe him 100 percent,” he said.</p><p>On Monday, the White House confirmed that a second strike did occur, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt saying Admiral Frank Bradley gave the order for the follow-on attack.</p><p>Bradley “worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,” Leavitt told reporters. She characterised the attack as in the “self-defence” of the US.</p><p>Also on Monday, Venezuela’s National Assembly was set to meet for an extraordinary session to debate forming a commission on the strikes.</p><p>However, the meeting was postponed until Tuesday, with no reason given.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are all displaced from their home in Tal al-Hawa in southwest Gaza City, as a result of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/israeli-attack-kills-two-children-in-southern-gaza-despite-ceasefire\">Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza</a>.</p><p>“There are no words to describe how I feel right now,” Samar says, her voice almost breaking. “I feel like my mind is going to freeze. How am I supposed to welcome my baby girl like this?”</p><p>While Samar tries to salvage clothes and blankets, her husband and brothers shovel sand into the pools of water that have swallowed their living space. Mattresses, clothing, and basic belongings lie scattered around them, soaked and unusable.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143567\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143567\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143567\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9270-1764603663.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Close up of a woman holding nappies damaged by water\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143567\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samar al-Salmi had prepared nappies and other items for her new baby, but they were ruined by the floodwater [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“I put the baby’s hospital bag in my mother’s tent, thinking it would be safe,” she says. “But the rain rushed in there first and flooded everything, including the bag.”</p><p>“I don’t know where to start,” she adds. “Should I care for my children, whose clothes are full of mud and sand so I need to heat water and bathe them?</p><p>“Or do I try to dry the mattresses that will be so difficult in this cold? Or should I prepare myself so I’m ready to give birth at any moment?” she asks.</p><p>Since the war began two years ago, aid organisations have warned that Gaza’s displaced families would face catastrophe each time winter arrived, as they live in thin, tattered tents as a result of a strict Israeli ban on construction materials and caravans entering the Gaza Strip.</p><p>“A tent is not a solution,” Samar says. “In the summer, it’s unbearably hot, and in the winter, we flood. This is not a life. And winter hasn’t even started yet. What will we do when the real cold arrives?”</p><p>“At the very least, why weren’t caravans allowed in? Any roof to shelter us until this ends.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143572\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143572\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143572\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9224-1764603779.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman cleaning in a tent, reflected through a mirror\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samar is now trying to dry out all her family’s belongings, to make the Gaza tent they live in partially habitable [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-father-overwhelmed\">A father overwhelmed</h2><p>Samar’s husband, Abdulrahman al-Salmi, sits quietly, busy repairing the tents with her brothers. At first, he is so discouraged that he says he doesn’t even feel like talking to Al Jazeera. But gradually, he begins to open up.</p><p>“As a father, I’m helpless,” the 39-year-old says. “I try to hold our life together from one side, and it collapses on the other. That’s our life during and after the war. We’ve been unable to find any solution.”</p><p>He recounts the moment Samar called him earlier that morning while he was on his way to his first day of work at a small barbershop.</p><p>“She was crying and screaming, and everyone around her was screaming,” he recalls. “She told me, ‘Come quickly, the rain has invaded our tent from every direction.’”</p><p>He dropped everything and ran back under the rain.</p><p>“The place was completely flooded, like a swimming pool,” he says, tears filling his eyes. “My wife and mother-in-law were screaming, my children were outside shivering from the cold, the tents were flooded, the street was flooded… people were scooping water out of their tents with buckets. Everything was extremely difficult.”</p><p>For Abdulrahman, the rain feels like the final blow.</p><p>“We’ve been struggling in everything since the war began, and now the rain has come to finish us off completely.”</p><p>The father spoke of his immense difficulty in providing essentials for the newborn amid severe shortages and skyrocketing prices.</p><p>“I bought the diapers for 85 shekels ($26), the same type we used to get for 13 ($4),” he says. “The milk formula is 70 ($21). Even the pacifier is expensive. And now everything we prepared for tomorrow’s delivery is ruined. I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>The couple cannot help but remember the life they once had; their warm, clean second-floor apartment in Tal al-Hawa, where they once lived a dignified and peaceful life, as they put it.</p><p>“Now the apartment, the building, and the entire neighbourhood are destroyed,” Samar says. “All our family homes are gone. We have no option but to live in tents.”</p><p>What terrifies the couple most is welcoming their baby girl into these conditions. Samar is scheduled for a C-section and will return afterwards to the tent.</p><p>“I never imagined this,” she says softly. “I never imagined I would welcome the daughter we dreamed of under these conditions.”</p><p>She admits, through guilt, that she sometimes regrets getting pregnant during the war.</p><p>“In my previous deliveries, I returned from the hospital to my apartment, to my comfortable bed, and I took care of myself and my baby peacefully,” she adds with grief.</p><p>“Any mother in the world would understand my feelings now, the sensitivity of the last days of pregnancy, the delivery itself, and the early days afterward.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143577\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9405-1764604018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man holds an empty bucket\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abdulrahman al-Salmi says he feels frustrated and helpless as life ‘collapses’ [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"endless-displacement\">Endless displacement</h2><p>Like most families in Gaza, Samar’s has been displaced repeatedly, moving between Khan Younis, Rafah, Nuseirat, and Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“I fled to my family’s home, then my uncle’s home, then my husband’s family. Every house we fled to is now destroyed, and everyone is homeless,” Samar says.</p><p>Their children, Mohammad, seven, Kinan, five, and Yaman, three, have suffered the most.</p><p>“Look at them,” she says. “They’re shivering from the cold. They don’t have enough clothes. And the laundry I just washed is covered in mud again.”</p><p>A few days ago, the children needed to be taken to the hospital after being bitten by insects inside the camp. Cold and illness stalk them every night.</p><p>“The older boy couldn’t sleep from stomach pain,” Abdulrahman says. “I covered him and covered him, but it didn’t help. There are no blankets … nothing.”</p><p>For Samar, even the ceasefire has brought no comfort. She rejects the narrative that the <a href=\"/features/2025/11/26/stuck-in-gazas-limbo-palestinians-struggle-to-live-amid-israels-attacks\">war has calmed down</a>. To her, the war never stopped.</p><p>“They say the war is over. Where is it over?” Samar asks. “Every day there is bombing, every day there are martyrs, and every day we drown and suffer. This is the beginning of a new war, not the end.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143593\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143593\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9256-1764604216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman holds her belongings\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salma al-Salmi cleans up her family’s rain-soaked tent [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-plea-for-shelter\">A plea for shelter</h2><p>Above all, the couple wants only one thing: dignity.</p><p>“Even caravans are not a real solution; they’re temporary,” Samar says. “We are human beings. We had homes. Our demand is to rebuild our homes.”</p><p>Her final plea is directed at humanitarian organisations.</p><p>“We need clothes, mattresses, blankets. Everything is ruined. We need someone to stand with us. We need a place to shelter us. It’s impossible to keep living on a sheet of plastic.”</p><p>As for Abdulrahman, he sums up their reality with a single sentence as he spreads another layer of sand:</p><p>“Honestly… we’ve become bodies without souls.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4143600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4143600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4143600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A9146-1764604413.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A waterlogged area between tents\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4143600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winter rains have flooded tents in Gaza, with more rain expected over the next few months [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Two days earlier, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff and Ukraine’s top negotiator, resigned amid a corruption scandal in the energy sector.</p><h2 id=\"more-work-needed\">More work needed</h2><p>Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, hailed the Florida talks as a success, but added that “there’s more work to be done”.</p><p>“There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr Witkoff travels to Moscow,” he said.</p><p>Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said the Ukrainians would be happy that Rubio, whom they see as the Trump administration’s most Ukraine-friendly senior official, was currently leading the negotiations.</p><p>“Because Rubio seems to be driving the car at the moment, things seem to be going OK for the Ukrainians,” Challands said.</p><p>However, he stressed that caution was needed because of Trump’s unpredictability and because Russia had yet to react to the latest peace plan draft.</p><p>Sticking to his maximalist demands, Putin has said he will end the war only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from four of its regions Russia illegally annexed in 2022 but does not fully control.</p><p>“If they don’t withdraw, we’ll achieve this by force.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United Kingdom’s new left-wing political party, Your Party, cofounded by former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, has become mired in a bitter divide between its leaders.</p><p>On Saturday, Your Party cofounder Zarah Sultana said she would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/corbyns-new-party-faces-crisis-as-cofounder-skips-first-day-of-conference\">skip the first day</a> of the newly formed group’s inaugural two-day conference following a serious disagreement over who could attend.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-your-party\">What is Your Party?</h2><p>After the UK’s last general election in 2024, which the Labour Party won in a landslide following 14 years of Conservative Party rule, Corbyn and four other left-leaning independents – Shockat Adam, Adnan Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Iqbal Mohamed – formed the Independent Alliance, which focused heavily on taking a pro-Palestine position over Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Corbyn, 76, stepped down as leader of the Labour Party following yet another election defeat to the Conservatives in 2019.</p><p>Among other issues, Corbyn had long weathered <a href=\"/news/2022/9/25/what-really-happened-during-labours-anti-semitism-crisis\">accusations of anti-Semitism</a> during his leadership of Labour, something many described as a “witch-hunt” against him and his supporters.</p><p>In 2020, the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its findings that Labour had broken the law on anti-Jewish racism. It partially blamed “serious failings” under Corbyn’s leadership of the party.</p><p>In response, Corbyn stated that anti-Semitism was “absolutely abhorrent”, but added: “The scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.”</p><p>As a result, he was immediately suspended from the party. He was readmitted in 2020, but ultimately left the Labour Party altogether in 2024 – after nearly 60 years of membership – to become an independent MP.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In late July this year, he announced that he would cofound a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/corbyn-sultana-to-form-uk-party-flash-in-the-pan-or-real-alternative\">new socialist party</a> with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, 32, who also became an independent after leaving Labour on July 3. Other members of the Independent Alliance also joined. The aim was to present the new party as a credible left‑wing alternative to the governing Labour Party.</p><p>In a statement at the time, Corbyn and Sultana said: “The system is rigged when the government says there is no money for the poor, but billions for war.”</p><p>The statement added that they envisioned a party “rooted in our communities, trade unions and social movements”.</p><p>“As a party, we’ve got to come together and be united because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent,” Corbyn said during the inaugural conference, which took place in the northwestern English city of Liverpool and finished with a rousing rendition of Bella Ciao – an Italian antifascist folk song – by attendees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-did-sultana-refuse-to-attend-the-first-day\">Why did Sultana refuse to attend the first day?</h2><p>Sultana announced on Saturday that she would not attend in protest against one of her supporters being denied entry to the event and several others being expelled from the party for also allegedly being members of the far-left Socialist Workers Party.</p><p>Sultana told the Press Association news agency: “I’m disappointed to see on the morning of our founding conference, people who have travelled from all over the country, spent a lot of money on their train fare, on hotels, on being able to participate in this conference, being told that they have been expelled.”</p><p>She added: “That is a culture that is reminiscent of the Labour Party, how there were witch-hunts on the eve of conference, how members were treated with contempt.”</p><p>However, an unnamed spokesperson for Your Party defended the decision to bar members of the Socialist Workers Party. The spokesperson told UK media: “Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules – and these rules were enforced.”</p><p>Sultana attended the second day of the conference on Sunday, when she apologised for what she described as “hiccups” during the launch of the party.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">However, she added, “The expulsions, bans and censorship on conference floor are unacceptable. It’s undemocratic. It’s an attack on members and on this movement.”</p><h2 id=\"what-else-have-the-leaders-disagreed-about\">What else have the leaders disagreed about?</h2><p>The fledgling party has been beset by disagreements over several issues.</p><h3 id=\"funding-issues\">Funding</h3><p>In November, senior figures including Corbyn, Iqbal Mohamed, and Adnan Hussain accused Sultana of withholding more than 800,000 pounds ($1.06m) in donations made to the party when it was first announced in July.</p><p>Since the party was still in the process of being formally registered as a legal entity, the funds were temporarily collected by a private company called MoU Operations Ltd, which is controlled by Sultana.</p><p>The BBC reported on November 8 that an unnamed spokesperson for Sultana said she “is in the process of transferring all funds and data” but was conducting “essential due diligence as part of this process”.</p><p>As of mid-November, the party had received a “small portion” of the funds, according to a statement by Your Party leaders. There has not been a more recent update on the status of the remaining funds.</p><h3>Leadership model</h3><p>There was a disagreement over how the newly formed party should be led.</p><p>While Sultana was pushing for a collective of leaders to reflect grassroots representation – what she terms “maximum member democracy” – Corbyn said a single, traditional leader would be more effective.</p><p>In the end, the party voted for a collective of leaders by a narrow margin of 51.6 percent to 48.4 percent.</p><p>This means that the party will now be headed by a collective of leaders, which will be overseen by a party member who is not a member of parliament.</p><p>Ultimately, many see the problems which have beset the party as being down to a fight for control between Corbyn and Sultana.</p><p>The UK media have reported that Corbyn supporters were irritated by Sultana’s decision to hold a pre-conference rally on the night before the conference began. While she called it a Your Party event, they claimed it was organised solely by her.</p><h3 id=\"desertions-several-members-including-mps-have-quit-the-party\">Party desertions</h3><p>Several members of the new party, including some working MPs, have already quit as supporters of Corbyn accuse Sultana of trying to undermine him and vice versa. On November 14, Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain announced in an X post that he had decided to leave.</p><p>“The culture surrounding the party has become dominated by persistent infighting, factional competition and a struggle for power, position and influence rather than a shared commitment to the common good,” Hussain wrote in a statement.</p><p>“Instead of openness, cooperation and outward focus, the environment has too often felt toxic, exclusionary and deeply disheartening,” he added.</p><p></p><p>A week later, Dewsbury and Batley MP Iqbal Mohamed also announced his departure.</p><p>In a statement posted on X on November 21, Mohamed said: “The many false allegations and smears made against me and others, and reported as fact without evidence, have been surprising and disappointing. However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

Cheung was arrested on suspicion of “attempting to incite discord”, The Standard newspaper reported.</p><p>On Saturday, authorities arrested Miles Kwan, a 24-year-old student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, after he created an online petition calling for greater transparency and accountability from the government, multiple reports said.</p><p>The petition included four demands, including the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to probe the circumstances of the fire, including whether potential conflicts of interest may have contributed to the disaster.</p><p>Before it was removed from the internet on Saturday, the petition had garnered more than 10,000 supporters.</p><p>China’s national security office in Hong Kong appeared to condemn the petition before its removal, accusing activists of using “the banner of ‘petitioning the people’ to incite confrontation and tear society apart.”</p><p>Hong Kong’s Office for Safeguarding National Security also accused figures with “sinister intentions” of exploiting the fire to return the city to the “black-clad violence” that erupted during mass antigovernment protests in 2019.</p><p>On Monday, a commentary in the Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper called on the public to be vigilant against “anti-government elements” with “malicious intentions”.</p><p>“They have even gone so far as to ‘act as representatives’ to establish a so-called ‘concern group,’ put forward so-called ‘four demands,’ distribute leaflets, and launch a petition, all in an attempt to incite public unrest,” the commentary said.</p><p>“Their actions are utterly devoid of conscience and humanity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"outrageous\">‘Outrageous’</h2><p>The crackdown is the latest sign of the narrowing space for dissent in Hong Kong following Beijing’s sweeping overhaul of the semi-autonomous territory’s political and legal landscape in response to the 2019 demonstrations.</p><p>China has repeatedly denied that Hong Kong’s civil liberties have deteriorated, insisting that the passage of two far-reaching national security laws have ensured that residents’ rights and freedoms are “even better protected” than before.</p><p>Beijing has also argued that the legislation ensures the continuation of Hong Kong’s partial autonomy under “One Country, Two Systems,” the arrangement under which UK returned the territory to China in 1997.</p><p>Nathan Law, an activist and critic of Beijing who served in Hong Kong’s legislature, called the authorities’ actions “outrageous” and the latest example of a “highly authoritarian trend” in the former British colony.</p><p>“The goal of the government is to create a chilling effect by arresting these individuals. Any civil actions without the government’s permission are now illegal,” Law, who lives in self-exile in the UK and is wanted by Hong Kong authorities on national security charges, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The government worries about people congregating and initiating collective action, whether it is political or not.”</p><p>The Hong Kong Police Force did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ronny Tong, a non-official member of Hong Kong’s de facto cabinet, disputed the suggestion that authorities were stifling criticism of the government’s handling of the disaster.</p><p>“If you look at the major newspapers in Hong Kong, there are very many various suggestions and… criticisms of the handling of the incident in Hong Kong, so by no means is there a general suppression of different views or criticisms of the government,” Tong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Tong said that that while it would be inappropriate to comment on the cases of people who had yet to face the judicial process, the law allowed for “constructive” criticism of the authorities.</p><p>“One must not simply make the case of a few arrests – the circumstances of which are still unclear – to come to the conclusion that the Hong Kong government are trying to stifle views which they don’t like,” he said.</p><p>At least 151 people were killed in Wednesday’s blaze at a high-rise apartment complex in Hong Kong’s northern district of Tai Po, the worst fire in the city since at least 1948.</p><p>The scale of the disaster has prompted scrutiny of safety standards in Hong Kong’s construction industry, with authorities honing in on how the use of substandard materials in renovation works on the block may have aided the fire’s rapid spread.</p><p>Hong Kong authorities have arrested 13 people as part of their investigations into the fire, including the directors of an engineering consultant company involved in the renovations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"commission-of-inquiry\">Commission of Inquiry</h2><p>While the Hong Kong police and the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption have launched separate investigations, the government has so far not indicated that it will establish an independent commission of inquiry.</p><p>Hong Kong authorities launched commissions of inquiry, a legacy of British rule in the territory, in response to many past disasters.</p><p>Past inquiries, which have been typically led by a judge, looked into tragedies including a 2012 ferry accident that left 39 people dead and a 1996 fire that cost 41 lives.</p><p>Kevin Yam, a former lawyer in Hong Kong, said that Beijing could not tolerate public criticism of the official response to the fire as it was concerned that “the smallest spark of dissent can snowball into something bigger”.</p><p>“Those who read George Orwell will know that phrase, ‘They who control the past control the present future, and they who control the present control the future.’ And the Communist Party of China has always been very good at that,” Yam, who is wanted by the Hong Kong authorities for alleged national security offences, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They see that once they silence the dissent and the criticism, and then they flood the zone with favourable stories about how they handled things, then that becomes the official record of history.”</p><p>Once known for its raucous media, vibrant civil society and political diversity, Hong Kong has dramatically curtailed the space for dissent since the 2019 protests.</p><p>Under the laws, which have been widely condemned by foreign governments and rights groups, authorities have forced the closure of critical media outlets, effectively eliminated opposition parties from the city’s legislature, and banned politically sensitive protests.</p><p>The mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments have defended the laws as a proportionate response to the antigovernment protests, which began peacefully before descending into street battles between demonstrators and police, and other national security threats facing the territory.</p><p>In a speech marking the fifth anniversary of the 2020 law in June, Xia Baolong, Beijing’s top official for Hong Kong affairs, called the legislation a “guardian” of the city’s semi-autonomous status and stability.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Legally, there are no conditions for a pardon.</p><p>The pardon request will first be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice’s pardons department, which will send its opinion to Herzog’s office.</p><p>While the president usually follows the ministry’s recommendation, he is not required to do so.</p><p>Herzog has previously said he sees a negotiated settlement between prosecutors and Netanyahu’s legal team as the most effective way to conclude this legal matter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3360783\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3360783\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-israeli-leaders-and-people-reacted\">How have Israeli leaders and people reacted?</h2><p>Israelis <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/israelis-protest-in-tel-aviv-after-netanyahu-seeks-pardon-on-fraud-cases\">protested</a> outside Herzog’s home in Tel Aviv on Sunday night against Netanyahu’s pardon petition, joined by opposition politicians, including Naama Lazimi.</p><p>Herzog and Netanyahu are former political rivals, but they have a good working relationship.</p><p>“After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the president will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,” a statement from Herzog’s office said in response to the pardon request.</p><p>“He basically says, ‘I’m completely innocent,’” Yohanan Plesner, president of The Israel Democracy Institute, told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>“So there is no assumption of responsibility … this might project a problematic message to all public figures and to what our public norms might look like.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-netanyahu-accused-of\">What is Netanyahu accused of?</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown:</p><h3>Case 1000, the ‘Gifts Affair’</h3><p>Netanyahu was charged in 2019, while he was prime minister, with fraud and breach of trust during his tenure as minister of communications from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>The charges say Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, received lavish gifts worth nearly $200,000, including champagne and cigars, from two wealthy businessmen in exchange for political favours.</p><p>The businessmen are Israeli Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.</p><p>Milchan testified that he provided gifts to Netanyahu in June 2020. Packer was also implicated as having shared the costs of these expensive gifts with Milchan.</p><p>Netanyahu is accused of advancing Milchan’s interests by helping him secure a US visa renewal by lobbying US officials on his behalf. He is also accused of advancing a tax exemption law that could have benefitted Israelis abroad, like Milchan.</p><p>As for Packer, media reports claimed that he was making big investments in Israel, and his lawyers had inquired about Israeli citizenship or residency for the billionaire, which would have benefitted him tax-wise.</p><p>Fraud and breach of trust can carry prison sentences of up to three years, while bribery can carry up to 10 years and/or a fine.</p><p>The goods were valued at approximately 700,000 shekels ($186,000), according to a statement made by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit following the indictment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Case 2000, the ‘Netanyahu-Mozes affair’</h3><p>This case also charges him with fraud and breach of trust, saying Netanyahu made a deal with businessman Aron Mozes, a controlling shareholder of the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, which was critical of Netanyahu.</p><p>The alleged deal was for favourable coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for legislation to slow the growth of the rival Israel Hayom newspaper, which had overtaken Yedioth Ahronoth. A legislative bill was being considered that would have limited Israel Hayom’s circulation.</p><p>The indictment summary said, despite “a profound rivalry” between the two men, they conducted three series of meetings between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>During these meetings, Netanyahu and Mozes “engaged in discussions regarding the promotion of their common interests: improving the coverage that Mr. Netanyahu received in the ‘Yedioth Ahronoth’ media group; and the imposition of restrictions on the ‘Israel Hayom’ newspaper”, the indictment said.</p><h3>Case 4000, the ‘Bezeq affair’</h3><p>This case indicts Netanyahu for granting regulatory favours to Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq in return for positive coverage on Walla, a news website controlled by its former chairman.</p><p>Netanyahu, communications minister at the time, allegedly provided regulatory benefits to Shaul Elovitch, the owner of Bezeq, who also controlled the news website Walla.</p><p>The benefits reportedly included mergers and financial gains. In exchange, Elovitch provided favourable coverage of Netanyahu and his wife.</p><p>Netanyahu “dealt on several occasions with regulatory matters pertaining to Mr Elovitch, and took specific actions that promoted significant business interests of Mr Elovitch of substantial financial value”, the indictment summary said.</p><p>Besides fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery in this case.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-israeli-politicians-were-charged-with-corruption\">What other Israeli politicians were charged with corruption?</h2><p>Since 1996, <a href=\"/news/2018/2/14/israels-leaders-and-corruption-allegations\">every Israeli prime minister</a> has been the subject of a corruption investigation.</p><h3>1996-99</h3><p>Netanyahu, in his first term as prime minister, was investigated for reasons including a kickback scheme and influence peddling.</p><h3>1999-2001</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak was investigated on allegations of illegal campaign financing, bribery and money laundering.</p><h3>2001-06</h3><p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the late 1990s in what came to be known as the Greek Island affair.</p><h3>2006-09</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was convicted of taking $430,000 in bribes while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He was imprisoned in February 2016 for fraud, breach of trust, falsifying corporate records, and tax evasion.</p><h3>2009-21</h3><p>Netanyahu returned to the premiership. During this period, he was charged with the cases above, while two other cases against him were dropped.</p></div></div></body></html>"
