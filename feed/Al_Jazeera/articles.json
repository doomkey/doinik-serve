That figure has since been revised, but the park service budget could face potential budget cuts in 2026.</p><p>One budget proposal earlier this year from the House Appropriations Committee recommended cutting $176m from the park service operations budget, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a non-partisan US advocacy group.</p><p>The US government and park system is funded through January 30, 2026, but Congress has yet to fully approve a 2026 fiscal bill.</p><p>The park service has lost 4,000 staff members since January due to budget constraints and related issues, the association said this week.

It claimed that these boats were involved in drug trafficking, but authorities have released no evidence showing narcotics were present, and legal scholars argue that even if drugs were found, the attacks would likely still violate international law.</p><p data-start=\"1019\" data-end=\"1321\">The US military footprint in the region is now the largest it has been in decades, with roughly 15,000 US personnel stationed across the Caribbean.</p><p data-start=\"1643\" data-end=\"1729\">Trump has repeatedly insisted he is not seeking to topple the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"1731\" data-end=\"2062\">Still, recent developments have heightened concerns about potential US intervention. On Saturday, the Reuters news agency reported – citing four US officials – that Washington was preparing to enter a new phase of operations related to Venezuela, and two of those officials said the options included attempting to overthrow Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"2064\" data-end=\"2310\">Last month, Trump authorised the CIA to conduct <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">covert operations</a> in Venezuela.

Cartel de los Soles is a term that Venezuelans use to describe high-level corruption by the country’s senior officials and leaders, but it isn’t an organised cartel, per se.</p><p data-start=\"2654\" data-end=\"2760\">Trump told advisers on Monday that he intends to speak directly with Maduro at a date yet to be announced.</p><h2 id=\"a-caribbean-tour\">A Caribbean tour</h2><p data-start=\"2792\" data-end=\"2903\">Amid the soaring tensions, top US military officials began a tour of the Caribbean this week, meeting with leaders in the region.</p><p data-start=\"2905\" data-end=\"3303\">Dan Caine, the top US military officer, travelled to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. According to a summary released by Caine’s office, the two reaffirmed bilateral ties and “exchanged views on challenges affecting the Caribbean region, including the destabilizing effects of illicit narcotics … and transnational criminal organization activities”.</p><p data-start=\"3305\" data-end=\"3503\">Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also assured Persad-Bissessar of Washington’s commitment to “address shared threats and deepen collaboration across the Caribbean”, the Pentagon said.</p><p data-start=\"3505\" data-end=\"3587\">He began his tour of the Caribbean on Monday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/top-us-military-adviser-tours-caribbean-as-pressure-on-venezuela-deepens\">a stop in Puerto Rico</a>, where he met US troops.</p><p data-start=\"3589\" data-end=\"3940\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to continue the diplomatic push on Wednesday in Santo Domingo, where he will meet Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader and Defence Minister Carlos Antonio Fernandez Onofre.

Persad-Bissessar, however, has openly supported the attacks.</p><p data-start=\"4142\" data-end=\"4377\">In early September, she said she had no sympathy for drug traffickers, declaring that “the US military should kill them all violently”. Her comments prompted criticism from regional figures and some domestic opposition politicians.</p><p data-start=\"4379\" data-end=\"4598\">Amery Browne, Trinidad’s former foreign minister, told the local newspaper Newsday that the prime minister’s position is “reckless” and has distanced Trinidad and Tobago from CARICOM, the regional trade bloc.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”</p><p>In the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws … our Constitution”. Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders”.</p><p>The lawmakers did not mention specific circumstances in the video.</p><p>At an event in Michigan on Tuesday, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, which officials accuse of ferrying drugs, and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into US cities despite some legal setbacks.</p><p>“It wasn’t that there was any one incident; it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I’m worried. I am being sent to Washington’ or ‘I’m being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I’m concerned I’m going to be asked to do something that I don’t know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that’s where it came from.”</p><p>Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.</p><p>Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defence”, as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, does not absolve troops of responsibility.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Building on that sense of momentum, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, who led negotiations in Geneva, told US news website Axios that the security guarantees Ukraine was seeking looked “very solid”.</p><p>Speaking at the White House, Trump conceded that resolving the Ukraine war was “not easy”, but added, “We’re getting close to a deal.”</p><p>“I thought that would be an easier [deal], but I think we’re making progress,” he said.</p><p>Taking to his Truth Social platform later on, he said that he would send envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to iron out “a few” remaining differences over the deal.</p><p>He said he hoped to meet “soon” with Putin and Zelenskyy, “but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages”.</p><p>Russia, which had hammered Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with a deadly barrage of missiles the previous night, seemed unconvinced of progress.</p><p>Russia has not yet seen the modified plan, which remains unpublished, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underlined that it should reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at their Alaska summit earlier this year.</p><p>“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established, then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation [for Russia],” Lavrov warned.</p><p>Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said there was a lot of “uncertainty” at the Kremlin, though there had allegedly been “behind-the-scenes interactions” between Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US counterpart Steve Witkoff, “who reportedly worked on the initial stage” of Trump’s plan.</p><p>The Russian side, she said, was not happy about revisions to the peace plan.</p><p>“Unlike the initial American plan presented by Donald Trump, which consisted of 28 points, the so-called European version doesn’t include withdrawing the Ukrainian armed forces from Donbas, it allows Kyiv to join NATO, and it doesn’t limit the size of its armed forces,” Shapovalova said.</p><p>Still, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had earlier emerged upbeat from meeting with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, with his spokesman saying: “The talks are going well and we remain optimistic.”</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X that there were “a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States”.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said it was “unclear when those talks will happen, who will be involved, and what they will look like”. But, she added, it was clear they would not be imminent, given the upcoming American Thanksgiving holiday on November 27.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"macron-urges-pressure-on-putin\">Macron urges ‘pressure’ on Putin</h2><p>As the US strained to bridge the gap between Ukraine and Russia, leaders in the coalition of the willing, who have pledged to underwrite and guarantee any ceasefire, moved fast on security guarantees and a reconstruction plan for Ukraine.</p><p>In the video meeting, co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in attendance, the leaders decided to set up a task force between the US and coalition countries to “solidify” security guarantees.</p><p>Trump has not committed to providing back-up for a post-ceasefire “reassurance force” for Ukraine. The plan for the force involves European allies training Ukrainian troops and providing sea and air support, but would be reliant on US military muscle to work.</p><p>Speaking after the video call, Macron said discussions in Geneva had shown that there should be no limitations to the Ukrainian army, contrary to what had been outlined in the initial draft of the US plan.</p><p>He also said a decision on using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction, at the heart of a political and legal impasse in a Europe seeking funding for Ukraine, would be “finalised in the coming days” with the European Commission.</p><p>Western countries froze approximately $300bn in Russian assets in 2022, mostly in Belgium, but there has been no consensus on how to proceed. Some support seizing the assets, while others, like Belgium, remain cautious owing to legal concerns.</p><p>According to reports, Trump’s plan would split the assets between reconstruction and US-Russia investments.</p><p>Macron hit out at Russia, saying “continued pressure” should be put on Moscow to negotiate. “On the ground, the reality is quite the opposite of a willingness for peace,” he said, alluding to Russia’s overnight attacks on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, which left seven dead and disrupted power and heating systems.</p><p>In his daily evening address, Zelenskyy said: “What is especially cynical is that Russia carried out such strikes while talks are under way on how to end the war”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel has already shown it is capable of far greater violence, as we are seeing in the Gaza Strip,” Israeli human rights group B’Tselem’s executive director Yuli Novak said on Friday. “The situation in the West Bank is deteriorating by the day and will only worsen, because there is no internal or external mechanism to restrain Israel or stop its ongoing policy of ethnic cleansing.

But experts say the story is more complicated than what packages of stuffing and tinned pumpkin can tell.</p><p>The retailer is advertising a lower price this year at $4 per person for 10 people compared with $7 per person for 8 people in 2024, a talking point the White House has embraced.</p><p>On Friday, Trump once again pointed that out: “We’ve got [prices] way down from last year,” Trump said while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. “Walmart said that Thanksgiving this year is exactly 25 percent less than last year.”</p><p>But the Bentonville, Arkansas–based retailer’s offer comes with caveats. The kit contains fewer items – 20 compared with 29 last year – and uses more generic products rather than name brands, a switch that typically lowers costs.</p><p>Companies like Walmart, Amazon and Kroger that offer Thanksgiving meal kits can shape what goes into their bundles and choose to absorb costs.</p><p>But official data actually suggests that prices are going up. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts suggest turkey prices will be about 40 percent higher than this time last year, largely because of supply shortages tied to avian flu.</p><p>Data, however, on the price of turkey has varied depending on where you look. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the cost of turkey will be 16 percent less than this time last year. But, researchers at Purdue University found that the price will be up 25 percent compared with this time last year.</p><p>Prices for other staples have also risen – potatoes by 3.7 percent, rolls by 3.9 percent and apples by 5.3 percent – all outpacing the 3 percent annual inflation rate, government data show.</p><p> </p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117939\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACIVE-THANKSGIVING-DINNER-COST-1763571536.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACIVE-THANKSGIVING-DINNER-COST-1763571536\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>New analysis from Groundwork Collaborative, The Century Foundation, and AFT found that another Thanksgiving staple, cranberry sauce, is up by 22 percent from this time last year.</p><p>CPI data shows wine prices declining due to domestic production, but imported European bottles face 15 percent increase.</p><p>Amid tariff-related uncertainty, rising wholesale costs, limited economic data and concerns over future social safety net programmes, Americans have grown more cautious in their spending. Consumer confidence continues to fall hitting its lowest level since April in its most recent reading published on Tuesday.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-prices-up\">Why are prices up?</h2><p>For poultry, the surge has little to do with economic policy. An ongoing strain of avian flu is limiting the supply of turkeys, with more than 2.2 million birds affected so far in 2025 and more than 600,000 confirmed infections in September. Even when only a single bird tests positive, farmers must slaughter the entire flock to contain the spread, further reducing supply.</p><p>“The current global H5N1 panzootic is the largest, most geographically widespread outbreak of avian flu ever recorded. The virus has affected more countries, more wild species, and more continents simultaneously than any previous avian influenza event,” Crystal Heath, the executive director of Our Honor, a veterinary advocacy organisation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The virus started spreading through commercial poultry operations in the United States in February 2022,” Heath said.</p><p>For other staples, however, economic policy is a driving factor for the rise in prices.</p><p>Agricultural products, including tomatoes and potatoes, are up in price, driven by both import costs and the rising price of farm inputs – many of which are imported themselves, like the fertiliser needed to grow food and farm equipment like tractors.</p><p>“Tariffs on imported materials, including parts, fertiliser and other chemicals, are raising input costs for farmers. Those higher costs then get passed along, driving up the price of each unit and contributing to inflation,” Babak Hafezi, chief executive officer at Hafezi Capital, an international consulting firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Labour shortage drives up costs of agricultural products like apples, potatoes and tomatoes, which have seen a surge in prices, Hafezi said.</p><p>“The thing is, when fruit hangs on the trees with no one to pick it, it never makes it into the market. But the demand is still there, so it gets filled by imports. I visited a lemon farm in California and saw fruit everywhere, lemons just dropping to the ground and rotting because there weren’t enough workers to harvest them.”</p><p>Tariffs have pushed up the cost of canned goods as well.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/9/3/campbells-sees-tariff-hit-in-year-ahead-as-economic-uncertainty-looms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campbell’s</a>, one of the nation’s largest producers of prepared foods, said earlier this year it would need to raise prices because tariffs increased the cost of steel used in its cans.</p><p>“The impact of tariffs, and to whatever extent immigration issues are affecting agricultural workers or people in meat-processing plants, is still being felt. There are a lot of exogenous shocks continuing to hit the system. So this isn’t just, ‘Hey, we had this huge run-up in inflation during COVID and prices just haven’t come down’,” Matthew Higgins, professor of management at Tulane University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Last week, Trump rolled back tariffs on some foods and other consumer goods. While the change immediately affects imports and wholesale goods, experts say that does not mean that consumers may see lower prices this Thanksgiving or even at all.</p><p>“The probability of the prices massively decreasing is very low unless there is some major disruption like a recession, and people can no longer consume at the level they were,” Hafezi said.</p><p>There is a historical precedent for this. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, producers raised prices because of supply-chain strains, and retailers followed suit. But even after those strains eased, consumers had already shown they would tolerate higher prices, leaving grocery stores with little incentive to reduce them.</p><p>That came to light in a 2024 report by the Federal Trade Commission, which outlined elevated prices at grocery stores.</p><p>“Some firms seem to have used rising costs as an opportunity to further hike prices to increase their profits, and profits remain elevated even as supply chain pressures have eased,” the report said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"spending-pressures\">Spending pressures</h2><p>Regardless of the cause, the strain on consumers preparing for the holidays is intensifying, including on the back of the US government shutdown that ended recently.</p><p>City Harvest, a New York City–based organisation that partners with soup kitchens and food distribution centres, told Al Jazeera it has seen an increase in demand in the weeks following the shutdown.</p><p>“A lot of federal workers that were visiting the pop-up distributions were people seeking food assistance for the first time, so that was definitely a new population of people that were looking for support,” Jenna Harris, associate director of donor relations at City Harvest, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>City Harvest also noted that the city’s soup kitchens and food pantries are experiencing their highest number of visitors on record.</p><p>“We do see that about 67 percent of New Yorkers that visit food pantries have a job, sometimes multiple jobs, so it’s really just showing that the rising cost of food is an issue,” Harris added.</p><p>This trend is not new – visits have risen 85 percent since 2019, according to FeedNYC, but new challenges are compounding the pressure. Families are navigating looming changes to the <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/25/will-millions-of-low-income-americans-lose-food-stamps-during-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SNAP</a> programme and uncertainty about healthcare costs in 2026. Across the country, states have begun notifying recipients of new requirements and giving them three months to comply, or they could lose benefits altogether.</p><p>Similarly, with<a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/us-shutdown-ends-what-happens-now-when-will-services-resume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies still up for debate</a>, approximately 2.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance premiums if they are not extended, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving low- and middle-income families struggling to maintain coverage.</p><p>“There’s tremendous uncertainty, and as you move down the socioeconomic ladder, that uncertainty only increases. To some extent, you’d expect people to be more cautious with holiday spending,” Higgins added.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is a massive bifurcation of the American economy. The ultra-wealthy, with access to inflation-adjusted and future-oriented assets, are doing extremely well, while the middle and lower classes are struggling. Companies serving the upper and upper-middle classes are likely to thrive, whereas those catering to the rest of the market will have to focus on value-oriented products,” Hafezi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They rode up to the second storey in a bucket, smashed a window and cracked open display cases with angle grinders. They fled on the back of scooters driven by two accomplices.</p><p>All in all, the operation took less than seven minutes. Thieves dropped a jewel-encrusted crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, as they escaped. The rest of the loot has not been found.</p><p>The four already charged over the theft are three men and a woman. This month, it emerged that one of the men, a 37-year-old, was in a couple with the woman and they have children. The couple was arrested after their DNA was found in the basket lift used during the robbery.</p><p>Beccuau said at the time that the man’s criminal record contained 11 previous convictions, most of them for theft. The first two men arrested earlier lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers and were also known to the police for having committed thefts.</p><p>The heist made headlines worldwide and spotlighted museum security in France, which has seen a series of break-ins at cultural institutions.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/louvre-director-recognises-jewel-theft-failures-says-she-offered-to-resign\">Louvre’s director</a> has pledged more police and security cameras, acknowledging in an appearance before lawmakers that failings had led to the theft.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
