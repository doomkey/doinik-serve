It is rumoured that he was a police officer before he became a drug lord.</p><p>He rose in the ranks of Mexico’s drug-trafficking underworld in the 1990s. In 1994, he was convicted in the US of heroin trafficking and served nearly three years in prison before returning to Mexico.</p><p>There are plenty of stories about El Mencho’s outrageous methods of making threats and dealing with adversaries.</p><p>He once reportedly sent a severed pig’s head in an ice chest to a Mexican attorney as a threat, Rolling Stone magazine reported in 2015, citing an unnamed former DEA field agent.</p><p>A call recording captured him threatening a local police commander with the call sign “Delta One”, promising to kill him “and even your dogs” if his officers didn’t back off, then ending with a nonchalant “Sorry for the bad language”.</p><p>As El Mencho rose to become s powerful drug dealer, he began to heavily invest in submarines, which he used to transport drugs from South America to the US, Rolling Stone reported. It added, citing the former DEA agent, that El Mencho hired Russian naval engineers to help design the submarines.</p><p>He became one of Washington’s most wanted fugitives, and it had offered a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-known-about-the-jalisco-new-generation-cartel\">What is known about the Jalisco New Generation Cartel?</h2><p>El Mencho founded the cartel in about 2009 and rapidly expanded it, using online recruitment and diversifying its income streams through fuel theft, extortion, timeshare scams and other rackets.</p><p>The US has identified the Jalisco cartel along with the Sinaloa Cartel as the organisations primarily responsible for trafficking <a href=\"/news/2023/10/5/whats-fentanyl-and-why-have-deaths-due-to-drug-overdose-spiked-in-the-us\">fentanyl</a> into the US in recent years. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers the Jalisco cartel to be as powerful as Sinaloa with a presence in all 50 US states. The DEA said it is active in 21 of Mexico’s 32 states.</p><p>The Jalisco cartel has become notorious for its assaults on Mexican security forces. In 2015, it shot down a military helicopter in Jalisco.</p><p>In 2020, it tried to assassinate then-Mexico City Police Chief Omar Garcia Harfuch, who now serves as the federal security secretary.</p><p>In February last year, Mexico <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/why-has-mexico-handed-over-drug-cartel-leaders-to-us-who-are-they\">handed over</a> senior Jalisco cartel leader Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, El Mencho’s brother, to the US. This came days after <a href=\"/news/2025/2/19/us-declares-drug-cartels-criminal-gangs-global-terrorist-organisations\">the US designated</a> eight Latin American criminal and drug-trafficking groups as “global terrorist organisations”, including the Jalisco cartel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-el-mencho-die\">How did El Mencho die?</h2><p>El Mencho was killed by Mexican special forces during a military operation to capture him in Talpalpa in the southern part of Jalisco on Sunday.</p><p>Troops were sent in to arrest El Mencho, and his followers tried to fight them off. Authorities said he was killed during the operation.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-operation\">What do we know about the operation?</h2><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X on Sunday that the Secretariat of National Defence reported the operation had been carried out by federal forces.</p><p>“My recognition to the Mexican Army, National Guard, Armed Forces, and Security Cabinet,” Sheinbaum wrote.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X that the US had provided intelligence to the Mexican government to assist with the operation.</p><p>“In this operation, three additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two were arrested,” Leavitt posted. Authorities have not confirmed their identities.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-the-us-involvement\">How significant is the US involvement?</h2><p>Benjamin Smith, a professor of Latin American history at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera that the most recent captures of Mexican drug bosses have been backed by the US. “This is not new,” he said.</p><p>Vanessa Rubio-Marquez, associate dean for extended education for the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics, said the US involvement in the operation “speaks about the need to have permanent and effective dialogue and cooperation between both countries”.</p><p>“As a transnational activity that includes import of precursors, production, trafficking, consumption, money laundering, flow of arms, extortion and corruption from both sides of the border, both countries need to work together to combat these organisations and their unlawful activities and being able to protect citizens,” said Rubio-Marquez, who has represented Mexico in various international fora, including the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-happened-since-el-mencho-s-killing\">What has happened since El Mencho’s killing?</h2><p>Violence erupted on Sunday in at least 20 Mexican states, including Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Nayarit, Guanajuato and Tamaulipas.</p><p>Officials in Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato reported that at least 14 people were killed in Sunday’s violence, including seven members of the national guard.</p><p>Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, which is to host several matches in this year’s FIFA World Cup, was largely shut down on Sunday night as residents sheltered indoors. Four high-level football matches planned for Sunday were <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/23/football-matches-postponed-in-mexico-after-drug-cartel-leader-killed\">postponed</a>.</p><p>Videos on social media showed passengers running in panic through Guadalajara’s airport and smoke rising over the resort city of Puerto Vallarta. Governor Pablo Lemus urged people to stay home and suspended public transport while schools were closed on Monday in several states.</p><p>The US embassy in Mexico issued a security alert for US citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, advising them to stay indoors.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-mexicans-reacted\">How have Mexicans reacted?</h2><p>Analysts said the Mexican public is mostly supportive of the government’s actions to rein in the cartels.</p><p>The government reported in December that the average number of killings per day in Mexico had dropped by 37 percent since <a href=\"/news/2024/10/1/claudia-sheinbaum-sworn-in-as-mexicos-first-female-president\">Sheinbaum took office</a> in October 2024.</p><p>“She’s extremely popular,” Smith said. “And Mencho was broadly loathed.”</p><p>Sheinbaum had an approval rating of about 70 percent as of late January, according to the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, New York-based organisations focused on promoting cultural and political understanding and business ties in the Americas. The rating has been consistent since Sheinbaum was elected.</p><p>“It was widely known – and criticised – that President Claudia Sheinbaum’s predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador followed a policy of ‘hugs not bullets’,” Rubio-Marquez said.</p><p>“This is a clear U-turn to this former policy by a Morena [Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum’s party] government and an implicit recognition that crime has to be confronted with decision and a sophisticated strategy that includes information, intelligence and cooperation with the US and coordination and training with actors at the different levels of government.”</p><h2 id=\"what-might-happen-next\">What might happen next?</h2><p>The operation that killed El Mencho could benefit Mexico in its negotiations with US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs or even resort to military action if Mexico does not clamp down on drug cartels.</p><p>However, experts said the operation could spark a new wave of violence in Mexico because cartels may retaliate against security forces. Smith said the operation could result in “more public murders”.</p><p>“For the last year, the Mexican state has managed to bring down homicides. I suspect this killing will reverse that trend,” he said.</p><p>It is unclear what the future holds for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel because El Mencho’s death has left a power vacuum and it is unknown who will succeed him.</p><p>“The fight against criminal actors is not only about getting rid of leaders and bringing them to justice,” Rubio-Marquez said. “It implies a complex strategy that includes prevention, the combat of powerful arms used by cartels, the disarticulation of their multi-layered networks, security and protection for citizens, and effective policies towards social inclusion and social cohesion, economic development.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were surprised but told me that they were specifically there to ‘fight and kill the Ukrainians’,” Chege recounted.</p><p>“When I asked some Ugandans and Kenyans that I met later, and seeing what training we were being given, we realised that we had been fooled and we were going to the war front.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331720\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chege-shows-army-boots-that-he-was-given-as-part-of-military-uniform-in-Russia-1771838128.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chege shows army boots that he was given as part of a military uniform in Russia [Dominic Kirui/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-saw-thousands-of-dead-bodies\">‘I saw thousands of dead bodies’</h2><p>In recent months, reports have surfaced from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/did-ex-south-african-president-zumas-daughter-recruit-for-russias-war\">South Africa</a>, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa about young men fraudulently recruited for work abroad, only to end up on the front lines in the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>All in all, nationals from <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/ukraines-fm-says-over-1400-africans-recruited-to-fight-for-russia-in-war\">36 African countries</a> are known to be fighting for Russia in the four-year war, Ukraine’s foreign minister said in November.</p><p>At the base he was sent to in Ukraine, Chege went through a one-month training and was sent to what he called the “yellow zone” before eventually going to the “red zone”.</p><p>“Our trainer there told us that it was going to get tough. He prepared us for the worst and told us that we should be courageous enough to see dead bodies.”</p><p>Soon after, Chege witnessed this firsthand. “I saw thousands of dead bodies that were piled into something like a wall.” That’s when he knew he had to find a way out.</p><p>“I tried to call my agent and went to the commander, asking to leave,” he said, but was told he was in it until the end.</p><p>A week into fighting, Chege thought he would not survive.

Chris Dalby, senior analyst at Dyami Security Intelligence, outlined two possible scenarios.</p><p>“One is that [El Mencho] did appoint a successor,” he told Al Jazeera. “A lot of analysts are pointing to his stepson, Juan Carlos Gonzalez Valencia, his wife’s son from a previous marriage whom he adopted as his own.”</p><p>Dalby said the heir apparent, who is in charge of the cartel’s paramilitary wing, is seen as having the best shot at keeping the Jalisco New Generation Cartel united. But he would have to assume “a huge role” to replace the cult of personality around El Mencho.</p><p>“If his stepson cannot do it, you’ve got four, five, six commanders all with the money, the power and the men to create their own criminal thiefdoms,” the analyst continued.</p><p>“If that happens, and that’s the worst-case scenario, you could see record levels of homicide in Mexico in the months to come.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">Al Jazeera’s John Holman, reporting from Mexico City, said “different bosses within the cartel, perhaps regional ones, could start disputing for power.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“We’ve seen this happen time and time again, from Guerrero to Sinaloa,” he added, referring to other big cartels. “Eventually, that leads to a civil war between different factions.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">The timing is particularly sensitive in the wake of the upcoming FIFA World Cup.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“That spells additional problems for Mexico,” Holman said. “So this, at the moment, is a triumph for the Mexican government, but it could turn into an even bigger problem in the weeks and months ahead,” he added.</p><p id=\"p-rc_302f029891128928-51\" data-path-to-node=\"12\">For common Mexicans, the fall of a kingpin could also signal the rise of extortions and forced recruitment as fractured cells within El Mencho’s cartel scramble for resources.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">“A lot of people at the moment in Jalisco … are sheltering in place. There is no school tomorrow,” Holman said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"14\">Meanwhile, some residents have turned to the streets to gauge the immediate danger, closely monitoring bus stops and taxi stands for signs of movement.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“If the city wakes up without public transport, it means something is going to happen,” a resident, who requested anonymity, warned.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“Difficult days are ahead of us. Even if things had somehow felt relatively calm on one side, you don’t know what’s going to happen now.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

An analysis by Al Jazeera, based on official data, reveals that skyrocketing prices for basic commodities have made a complete iftar meal to break the daily fast a distant dream for the vast majority of the population.</p><h2 id=\"skyrocketing-costs\">Skyrocketing costs</h2><p>During periods when Israel tightened its siege or completely closed the crossings into Gaza, food prices spiked by more than 700 percent. While prices have retreated slightly since the “ceasefire” began in October, they remain significantly higher than pre-war levels.</p><p>According to Mohammed Barbakh, director general of policy and planning at the Ministry of Economy in Gaza, official data tracking prices from before the war began on October 7, 2023, to the first days of this Ramadan show staggering increases.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s analysis of the ministry’s price data reveals the following hikes:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Prices rose from 14 shekels ($4.49) to 25 shekels ($8.01) per kilogramme (2.2lb), an 80 percent increase.</li>\n<li><strong>Frozen fish:</strong> Prices jumped from 8 shekels ($2.56) to 23 shekels ($7.37) per kilo, a 190 percent increase.</li>\n<li><strong>Frozen red meat:</strong> Prices rose from 23 shekels ($7.37) to 40 shekels ($12.82) per kilo, a 75 percent difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> A tray of 30 eggs now costs 35 shekels ($11.22) compared with 13 shekels ($4.17), a 170 percent increase.</li>\n</ul><p>Vegetables, a staple of the Palestinian diet, have also seen dramatic surges. Tomatoes have doubled in price while cucumbers have jumped by 300 percent, rising from 3 shekels ($0.96) per kilo to 12 shekels ($3.85). Cheese prices have increased by up to 110 percent, directly impacting the cost of suhoor, the predawn meal before the daily fasting during Ramadan begins.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331383\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331383\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-How-much-does-food-cost-in-Gaza-2026-Ramadan-Israel-war-1771823932.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - How much does food cost in Gaza 2026 Ramadan Israel war-1771823932\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-cost-of-a-meal\">The cost of a meal</h2><p>Based on data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Al Jazeera estimated the cost of a basic iftar for a family of six. The meal includes two chickens, rice, salad, appetisers, a soft drink, cooking gas and oil.</p><p>The price of the meal has risen to about 150 shekels ($48), up from 79 shekels ($25.32) before the war, an increase of 90 percent.</p><p>For suhoor, a simple meal of cheese, hummus, falafel and bread now costs 31.5 shekels ($10.10), compared with 18.6 shekels ($5.96) previously.</p><p>The combined daily cost to feed a medium-sized family now stands at 181.5 shekels ($58.17), an 88 percent jump from pre-war figures.</p><h2 id=\"economic-obliteration\">Economic obliteration</h2><p>These price hikes coincide with a collapse in purchasing power. A United Nations report <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166444\">released</a> in late 2025 indicated that the annual per capita income in Gaza plummeted to $161 (503 shekels) in 2024, down from $1,250 (3,900 shekels) in 2022.</p><p>The labour market has essentially vanished. In a statement issued in October, Sami al-Amsi, head of the General Federation of Palestinian Trade Unions, said unemployment stood then at more than 95 percent as workshops, farmland and fishing fleets were destroyed.</p><p>“The worker is no longer looking for a job because there is no work at all,” al-Amsi said. “Today, the Palestinian worker is looking for a food parcel to survive.”</p><h2 id=\"blockade-and-monopoly\">Blockade and monopoly</h2><p>Economic researcher Ahmed Abu Qamar attributed the inflation to Israel’s restrictive entry policies and “coordination fees” imposed on trucks.</p><p>“The humanitarian protocol stipulates the entry of 600 trucks daily, yet the Israeli occupation effectively allows only between 200 and 250 trucks,” Abu Qamar told Al Jazeera, noting that the Strip actually requires 1,000 trucks daily to meet minimum demand.</p><p>He also highlighted a monopoly system under which only about 10 merchants are authorised to import goods through four Israeli companies, restricting competition and keeping prices artificially high. He called for a return to a free market system and the full opening of crossings to alleviate the burden on a population already crushed by conflict.</p></div></div></body></html>"

While she has remained popular in Mexico, security is a persistent concern, and, since US President Donald Trump took office a year ago, she has been under intense pressure to show results against drug trafficking.</p><p>The Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive in its attacks on the military, including on helicopters, and specialises in launching explosives from drones and planting mines.</p><p>In 2020, it carried out a dramatic assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then head of the capital’s police force, now the federal security secretary.</p></div></div></body></html>"
