            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Prominent American conservative journalist Tucker Carlson’s interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has caused quite a stir. Since it was released on Friday, observers from across the political spectrum in the United States have taken to social media to comment.</p><p>Indeed, the interview highlighted — perhaps more than any other political or media spectacle — the growing suspicion that American officials may be more loyal to a foreign country than they are to the US. This may well turn out to be a defining moment for how Americans view their government’s relationship with Israel.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-true-friend\">Israel’s ‘true friend’</h2><p>Huckabee, who is also a Baptist minister and former governor of Arkansas, was confirmed as US ambassador to Israel in April 2025. The news of his appointment was welcomed by the Israeli government and various pro-Israel groups, and he was hailed as a “true friend of Israel”.</p><p>That Israel is quite close to Huckabee’s heart was made clear throughout his interview with Carlson, as he repeatedly parroted Israeli talking points.</p><p>He spoke of Israel’s “biblical right” to the land; referred to the occupied West Bank as “Judea and Samaria”; and even <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/absurd-and-provocative-huckabee-faces-firestorm-for-israel-border-stance\">appeared to approve</a> of Israel expanding its territory to other parts of the Middle East.</p><p>He repeatedly spoke of Israeli interests as US interests, often used “we” seemingly including Israel, and even insisted that the “problem on the border with Lebanon” was an issue Americans should care about. He defended his meeting with Jonathan Pollard, the former American intelligence analyst convicted of spying on the US for Israel, and for advocating for his early release from prison.</p><p>Huckabee went as far as taking a jab at the US Army in his effort to defend the violations of the Israeli military in Gaza.</p><p>When Carlson pressed him about Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he appeared to suggest that the Israeli military is more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US military.</p><p>After Huckabee argued that Israel’s war on Gaza produced a “lower number of civilians killed” than any modern urban war, Carlson pressed him for a reference point.</p><p>The ambassador offered two US wars — in Iraq and Afghanistan — as comparisons, suggesting that Israeli military commanders have been more concerned about protecting civilian life than their American counterparts.</p><p>A US ambassador publicly arguing that a foreign military is more humane than his own country’s armed forces inevitably raises questions about where his primary loyalty lies.</p><p>But Huckabee is, of course, not the only “true friend of Israel” within the US political elite.</p><p>The US Congress, on both sides of the aisle, has been known to give boisterous standing applause to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu every time he visits.</p><p>Huckabee’s boss, US President Donald Trump, has repeatedly claimed he is “the best friend to Israel… they’ve ever had”.</p><p>Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, has proudly declared he is a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/\">Zionist</a> and ensured full support and impunity for Israel as it carried out genocide in Gaza.</p><p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has boasted that he goes to Israel every two weeks “whether I need to or not”.</p><p>Eric Adams, former New York City mayor, chose to visit Israel at the end of his tenure and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/us-news/eric-adams-meets-with-netanyahu-on-taxpayer-funded-israel-trip-as-he-rips-mayor-elect-zohran-mamdani/\">said</a> that as mayor of America’s largest city, he had been serving Israel.</p><p>And the list goes on.</p><p>For the longest time, declarations of loyalty to Israel were seen as a political advantage in US politics. But this may well be changing.</p><h2 id=\"a-wake-up-call\">A wake-up call</h2><p>American academics have long been interested in Israel’s oversized influence on US politics. Scholars like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have written extensively about the issue.</p><p>But for many years, this scrutiny was largely confined to academia or left-wing activist circles. Conservatives and liberals labelled such critics as conspiracy theorists or anti-Semites.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview has perhaps let the cat out of the bag on the American right.</p><p>What makes the interview important is not simply the substance of Huckabee’s remarks, but the interviewer, venue, audience, and underlying message of the line of questioning.</p><p>A hugely popular conservative media figure travelled to Israel and publicly pressed a sitting US ambassador on whether American interests are being subordinated to Israeli interests. He questioned the theological and historical underpinnings of Zionism, criticised Israel’s treatment of Palestinian Christians, and asked why US tax dollars are sent to Israel.</p><p>In his responses, the ambassador appeared to speak more as a representative of the Israeli government than the United States government.</p><p>Judging by Huckabee’s <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/article-887416\">defensive</a> reaction after the interview and its social media fallout, he is learning an important lesson: appearing to put Israel first and America second is no longer an asset, but a liability, for American politicians.</p><p>Elected American officials will be watching the public reaction carefully — especially in light of polling data showing that American public opinion towards Israel has <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/22/us-public-opinion-on-israel-is-changing-us-policy-will-have-to-as-well\">shifted</a> dramatically in recent years.</p><p>The political incentive that has driven decades of unconditional support for Israel has now been weakened. The political calculus, too, is changing — it may be politically advantageous for American officials to adopt more evenhanded, even openly critical, approaches to Israel.</p><p>This alone marks a significant shift.</p><p>Carlson’s interview with Huckabee did not create that shift, but it brought it into the heart of the American right. If the question “America first or Israel first” can now be asked openly in conservative circles, then important political boundaries have already been broken.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview could be the wake-up call that American politics needed to break free from the outsized influence of a Middle Eastern country that has long undermined US interests.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Spurs are suffering even more now – his only goals since the start of November have come against them.</p><p class=\"p1\">Arsenal rebounded after two straight draws that have let second-place Manchester City back in the title race.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Gunners regained their five-point lead, but City has a game in hand and still has to host Mikel Arteta’s team in the league in mid-April. They also meet in the English League Cup final on March 22.</p><p class=\"p1\">It proved to be a tough start to life as Tottenham manager for Igor Tudor, who has made a habit of picking up good results early in his tenures at previous clubs.</p><p class=\"p1\">Not this time, though. Tottenham did equalise two minutes after conceding the opener to Eze when Randal Kolo Muani dispossessed Declan Rice and drilled home a finish for 1-1 in the 34th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">Gyokeres made it 2-1 with a shot from the edge of the area in the 47th, and Eze stretched the lead in the 61st with a rebound after Bukayo Saka’s shot was saved. Gyokeres scored again in stoppage time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Arsenal have 10 league games remaining in their bid for a first top-flight title since 2004.</p><p>Eze has scored six league goals this season, of which five have been against Spurs. Asked why he holds that record against their rivals, he told Sky Sports: “I don’t know. I try to score every single game. It seems to work quite a lot against Tottenham. It’s a feeling you get.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Premier League on Sunday, ‌Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister struck a winner deep into ⁠stoppage time as ⁠his side snatched a scarcely-deserved 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest in their Premier League clash.</p><p class=\"p1\">After a pedestrian ⁠90 minutes in which they barely managed a shot on target, Mac Allister lit the fuse with a stoppage-time effort that was ⁠ruled out for handball before rifling home a rebound in the 97th minute to snatch the win.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, with doubts swirling around the future of Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, his team dug out a 1-0 win over last-place Wolverhampton thanks to a last-minute goal.</p><p class=\"p1\">Evann Guessand prodded home a far-post finish after coming on as a substitute.</p><p class=\"p2\">Fulham climbed above Sunderland into the top half of the table after becoming just the second visiting side to win at the Stadium of Light this season.</p><p class=\"p2\">Raul Jimenez’s double secured a 3-1 victory for Marco Silva’s men.</p></div></div></body></html>"

South Africa in their first cricket match of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup and now must win their next two games to have a chance of reaching the semifinals.</p><p>The defending champions were bowled out for 111 in 18.5 overs while chasing a target of 188 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Sunday.</p><p>It was the cohosts’ first loss of the tournament and also ended their 12-match winning streak in the T20 World Cup that they had carried on from their title-winning run in 2024.</p><p>South Africa’s bowlers put on a near-perfect display against a strong Indian batting lineup, and were backed by their fielders to leave the pre-tournament favourites reeling.</p><p>India lost their in-form opener Ishan Kishan on the fourth ball of the innings to the offspin bowling of South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram while trying to hit against the spin.</p><p>One-down batter Tilak Varma was the next to fall as he was caught behind off the first ball of Marco Jansen’s over.</p><p>India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav and out-of-form star batter Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild their innings until Sharma fell in the fifth over after scoring 15 runs off 12 deliveries.</p><p>Incoming batter Washington Sundar and Yadav were the next two wickets to fall as India failed to build a big partnership in front of a large home crowd.</p><p>A 35-run partnership between all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube lifted the Indian run chase briefly, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and near-faultless fielding resulted in regular dismissals for the home side.</p><p>When Dube fell for 42 off 37, India’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Jansen’s superb bowling earned him four wickets for 22 runs off 3.5 overs , while left-arm spin bowler Keshav Maharaj took three for 24 in his four overs.</p><p>All of South Africa’s bowlers were economical, with Lungi Ngidi leading the way by conceding only 15 runs in his four wicketless overs.</p><p>Earlier, player of the match David Miller’s crucial innings of 63 runs off 35 balls stabilised South Africa’s innings after they were reduced to 20-3 in four overs.</p><p>He shared a 97-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who scored 45 off 29 balls, as the pair resurrected the Proteas after Markram decided to bat first after winning the toss in the first Super Eight match in Group 1.</p><p>Despite Miller’s dismissal in the 16th over, South Africa were able to post a formidable total of 187-7, thanks to a 24-ball 44 not out by Tristan Stubbs at the end of the innings.</p><p>Jasprit Bumrah picked up 3-15 off his four overs.</p><p>The loss propels South Africa to the top of Group 1 in the Super Eight stage, with India at the bottom with a net run rate of -3.80.</p><p>The defending champions must win their remaining two games to have a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.</p><p>West Indies and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in their group and will face each other on Monday.</p><p>South Africa face the West Indies on Thursday, while India play Zimbabwe on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have somberly clapped, played music in front of mosques, and held up “victory” signs to break state-imposed norms during such events.</p><p class=\"s5\">Iranians from diverse ethnic backgrounds across the country say they have undertaken the unprecedented practice not out of joy, but to express pride for family members and compatriots killed while peacefully protesting.</p><p class=\"s5\">The Iranian government claims 3,117 people were killed during the protests, all by “terrorists” and “rioters” who were armed, trained, and funded by the US and Israel. It has rejected accusations by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that blame state security forces for being behind the protest killings.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4330121\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4330121\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4330121\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_699b1a47e7-1771772487.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TEHRAN, IRAN - FEBRUARY 21: People are shop at Tajrish bazar in Tehran on February 21, 2026 in Tehran, Iran.

It is roughly 50km (31 miles) wide at its entrance and exit and narrows to about 33km (20 miles) at its tightest point. It forms the only maritime link between the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.</p><p data-start=\"1757\" data-end=\"2003\">Despite its narrow width, the channel accommodates the world’s largest crude carriers. Major Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters rely on it to move supplies to international markets while importing nations depend on its uninterrupted operation.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3794723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-Strait-of-Hormuz-Map-Iran-Israel-1750677677.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Strait of Hormuz Map Iran Israel-1750677677\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-and-gas-pass-through-the-strait\">How much oil and gas pass through the strait?</h2><p data-start=\"2056\" data-end=\"2326\">According to the US <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65504\">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), about 20 million barrels of oil transited through the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024. That equates to nearly $500bn in annual energy trade, underlining the waterway’s central role in the global economy.</p><p data-start=\"2328\" data-end=\"2564\">The crude passing through the strait originates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2508\">Any prolonged disruption would rattle producers and the economies that depend on their exports.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2803\">The strait also plays a critical role in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. In 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes, according to EIA <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65584\">data</a>.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-it-all-go\">Where does it all go?</h2><p data-start=\"2832\" data-end=\"3009\">The strait handles LNG flows in both directions. Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the US and West Africa.</p><p data-start=\"3011\" data-end=\"3257\">The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asia.</p><p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3516\">China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year.

At its narrowest stretch, the Strait of Hormuz and its designated shipping lanes fall entirely within the territorial waters of Iran and Oman.</p><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"518\">That legal reality gives Tehran geographic leverage. About 3,000 vessels transit the strait each month.

He cautioned: “Oil prices have been highly reactive to geopolitical tensions in recent weeks, and as a result, prices could spike to well over $100 per barrel if there were to be a major disruption.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325065\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325065\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325065\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-15T190353Z_1949412274_RC27GJAEQ307_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-USA-CARRIER-1-1771517393.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Frank E.

Several major Asian economies depend heavily on shipments transiting through the strait.</p><p data-start=\"5872\" data-end=\"6128\">Almost half of India’s crude oil imports and about 60 percent of its natural gas supplies move through the Strait of Hormuz.

The court said tariffs are a form of taxation, and under Article I of the Constitution, the power to tax belongs exclusively to Congress.</p><p>The court’s ruling, however, does not apply to Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium, lumber and automotives since these were imposed under a different law – Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.</p><p>Following the verdict, a furious Trump called the Supreme Court judges “fools and lapdogs” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution”. He immediately signed an executive order under Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to impose a blanket 10 percent tariff on all countries the US trades with, starting on February 24. On Saturday, he raised the tariff to 15 percent, the highest rate allowed under this trade law.</p><p>So, what is this new trade law that Trump has used to impose tariffs? What does this mean for trade deals the US has already signed with countries around the world?</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-new-trade-law-trump-is-using\">What is the new trade law Trump is using?</h2><p>Under US law, Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 empowers the president to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/20/tariff-refunds-could-take-years-amid-us-supreme-court-ruling-experts-warn\">impose tariffs</a> of up to 15 percent to address “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits”.</p><p>Tariffs can be imposed under this law only for 150 days unless the US Congress agrees to extend it. Trump is the first president to use this law to impose tariffs.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-a-temporary-import-duty-to-address-fundamental-international-payment-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Friday, the White House said some goods, such as certain agricultural products like beef, tomatoes, natural resources and fertilisers that cannot be grown or produced in the US, aerospace products, among others, will not be subject to the temporary levy.</p><p>Shantanu Singh, an international trade lawyer, noted that since this is the first time this legal authority has been used by any US president, it could likely be litigated.</p><p>“But the government has considerable leeway to determine this as trade deficits can form part of balance-of-payments deficits,” he told Al Jazeera. Trump has justified the tariffs as a way to balance the US’s trade deficits of more than $900bn.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-to-the-trade-deals\">What happens to the trade deals?</h2><p>Several countries had signed trade deals to cushion themselves from Trump’s punishing tariffs last year. The United Kingdom, India and the European Union, among others, had entered into deals to lower tariffs on their exports to the US.</p><p>But the ongoing tariff spectacle has thrown the future of those trade deals into doubt. Will they be charged the new 15 percent tariff or the agreed rate signed in the trade deals? Will India be tariffed at 18 percent, as per the trade deal, or 15 percent as announced by Trump on Saturday?</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said some of these trade agreements will stand.</p><p>“The trade deals, because they are international, will likely remain in place,” Singh, the international trade lawyer, said.</p><p>However, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, he said, the big incentive for doing trade deals with the Trump administration, which was to get a lower reciprocal tariff rate before competitors, has vanished.</p><p>“That reduces the incentive for trade partners to comply with their part of the deal for the time being,” he said.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the trade agreements and what their future looks like.</p><h3 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h3><p>The UK was one of the first to sign a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/8/us-uk-trade-deal-how-are-trumps-global-tariff-talks-shaping-up\">trade deal</a> with the US last May after being hit by 5 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts.</p><p>Under their <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/1/us-uk-agree-to-zero-tariffs-on-medicines-uk-commits-to-higher-spending\">agreement</a>, the US agreed that there would be zero tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the UK, and for other goods, it was set at 10 percent. Last December, the two nations also agreed to zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals and medical products.</p><p>After Friday’s Supreme Court ruling, William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said in a <a href=\"https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/news/2026/02/new-tariff-rate-a-further-blow-to-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> that the ruling does “little to clear the murky waters for business”.</p><p>On Friday, a spokesperson told the media that the British government was “working with the US” to understand more about how the court’s ruling will affect the UK.</p><p>The court ruling will not impact the UK’s deal on steel, aluminium and pharmaceutical exports.</p><p>But Bain said the new 15 percent global tariff rate, which has been imposed under Section 122 of the Trade Act 1974, “will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses and weaken global economic growth”.</p><h3 id=\"china\">China</h3><p>Trump had imposed one of the highest tariffs on China, and the world’s two largest economies were engaged in a trade war. At one point, they had slapped reciprocal tariffs exceeding 100 percent on some goods.</p><p>The two countries have yet to sign a trade deal, but they agreed to lower the tariffs as part of a trade truce.</p><p>After several rounds of trade talks and a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the two countries agreed to a one-year truce with a 10 percent baseline tariff. Trump also slashed the so-called fentanyl tariff to 10 percent.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will lift tariffs imposed on chemicals used in fentanyl. However, tariffs on other Chinese exports, such as electric vehicles, aluminium and steel, will remain.</p><p>Following the court’s ruling, Chinese Embassy spokesperson in the US, Liu Pengyu, told journalists that tariffs and trade wars serve neither the US nor China’s interests. He called on Beijing and Washington to work together to “provide greater certainty and stability for China-US economic and trade cooperation and the global economy”.</p><p>Trump is scheduled to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/trump-to-make-three-day-visit-to-china-next-month-white-house-says\">travel</a> to China from March 31 to April 2 to meet Xi and discuss trade.</p><p>But Singh, the trade lawyer, said countries like China that did not negotiate deals with the US are quite well placed because, as a result of the court’s ruling and repeal of the reciprocal tariffs, they have achieved a lower rate of tariff without having to make concessions.</p><p>“China will definitely feel it has the upper hand going into negotiations with the US,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"south-east-asia\">South East Asia</h3><p>Last year, South East Asian countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia entered into trade agreements with the Trump administration to lower tariffs.</p><p>Malaysia reduced its tariff from 25 percent to 19 percent, while Cambodia’s tariff dropped from 49 percent to 19 percent after their respective trade agreements with the US last year. Vietnam and Indonesia also signed deals, reducing their tariffs to 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively.</p><p>After ⁠the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News that US imports from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate was fixed at 15 percent on Saturday.</p><p>Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, also said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent remains in force despite the court decision.</p><h3 id=\"india\">India</h3><p>At 50 percent, India faced among the highest US tariffs. The US first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent citing the country’s purchases of Russian oil as the reason.</p><p>Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\">trade deal</a>. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.</p><p>An Indian trade delegation, which was scheduled to travel to the US to finalise details of the trade agreement, has been postponed.</p><h3 id=\"european-union\">European Union</h3><p>Last July, the EU and the US struck a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">deal</a> to avert a transatlantic trade war after Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imports from the 27-member bloc. Under the agreement, EU exports to the US would face a 15 percent tariff.</p><p>The deal, however, had not yet come into effect since EU lawmakers paused its ratification after Trump threatened to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, last month.</p><p>The European Parliament’s trade committee is set to vote on the EU’s trade deal with the US on February 24, but the Supreme Court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs have made the future of the deal uncertain.</p><p>An EU commission spokesperson told journalists after the court’s ruling that the bloc is in “close contact” with the US administration to seek more clarity.</p><h3 id=\"mexico\">Mexico</h3><p><a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/mexicos-tariffs-on-india-are-a-double-whammy-after-us-tariffs\">Mexico</a> was one of the first countries to be targeted by Trump’s tariffs last year. It was hit by a 25 percent tariff on some pharmaceuticals, and an additional 25 percent “fentanyl tariff” over what Trump said is the flow of drugs across the Mexican border into the US.</p><p>Approximately 85 percent of Mexican exports to the US were exempt from tariffs because of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into force in July 2020.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will reduce the tariffs on Mexico’s exports.</p><p>However, the USMCA is set to be reviewed again later this year, and it is uncertain whether products exempt from US tariffs under it will face levies if the agreement lapses.</p><p>Mexico’s Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said he will travel to the US in the near future to discuss the issue.</p><h3 id=\"canada\">Canada</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/canadas-carney-hails-new-trade-deals-expects-us-to-respect-sovereignty\">Canada</a> faces 35 percent tariffs on goods from certain sectors, like steel and aluminium, and most of its goods have also been impacted by a 50 percent levy on imported metals and a 25 percent duty on non-US cars.</p><p>Most of its goods are exempt under the existing USMCA.</p><p>Following the court verdict, Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told journalists that significant work remains as Washington-imposed tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber and automobiles remain in place.</p><p>Moreover, with the USMCA review coming up later this year, some Canadian leaders are also worried about what Trump could do next.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Countries are waiting to hear how exactly the top court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs will play out.</p><p>Singh, the trade lawyer, said the US administration will likely use the 150-day period during which the 15 percent Section 122 global tariffs will be effective.</p><p>“During this period, the United States trade representative will swiftly conduct investigations under another legal authority – Section 301 – to make findings on unfair trade practices of its trade partners and try to reinstate the reciprocal tariff rates which were invalidated,” he said.</p><p>“The trade deals could then be adjusted to reflect this new reality.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some of Colombia’s Muslims reflect a rich history of migration to the region. Others are converts.</p><p>“The Colombian Islamic community is a small one but enjoys more on account of its diversity,” Zia said, as he took a break from serving tea in his uncle Zaheer’s restaurant in the upscale Poblado neighbourhood of Medellin.</p><p>On the eve of Ramadan, Muslim communities in cities like Bogota and Medellin prepared for the coming festivities with decorations and prayer.</p><p>Golden, glittering letters spelled out wishes for “Ramadan Karim” — or a “generous Ramadan” — above a modest mosque in Belen, on the outskirts of Medellin.</p><p>Inside, shoes were lined neatly along the wall. In a small, square prayer room, about eight men of different ages and nationalities stood shoulder to shoulder, bowing in unison.</p><p>“The majority of those who come to the mosque are Colombians, but we see people from Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Pakistan and other Arab countries,” said Mu’tasem Abdo, the mosque’s imam who came to Medellin from Egypt four years ago.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4327432\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4327432\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4327432\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC_1162-1771634202.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Imam Mu’tasem Abdo speaks in his office\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4327432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imam Mu’tasem Abdo speaks about celebrating Ramadan in Colombia from his office [Arjun Harindranath/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>He explained how, because Colombia’s Muslim community is relatively small, newcomers sometimes find themselves aching for the festive experience they remember from home.</p><p>“A native from a Muslim country can miss the grandeur of Ramadan as experienced back home,” Abdo explained.</p><p>Pakistani immigrant Rana Arif Mohammad remembers arriving in Colombia 23 years ago with dreams of adventuring through Latin America.

There have been several waves of migration in the century since.</p><p>In Colombia, one of the most significant came during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The conflict triggered an exodus of nearly one million Lebanese people that included many Muslims and Christians.</p><p>Some settled in cities like Maicao, where one of the largest mosques in Latin America was built and completed in 1997.</p><p>The continued migration into Colombia has contributed to the diversity of its Muslim community.</p><p>In Bogota, Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi speaks proudly of the range of nationalities in his jamaat, or congregation, at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in the west of the city.</p><p>“There are people of different nationalities, approximately 10 or 15 different countries, and we find great diversity in this centre,” Qurtubi explained after delivering the Taraweeh prayer marking the first night of Ramadan.</p><p>Though there are no official statistics on the origins of Colombia’s Muslim population, Qurtubi has noticed an increase in Muslim converts.</p><p>He estimates that roughly 100 to 200 worshippers in his jamaat are new to the religion. It can be a struggle, though, to build a sense of cohesion, given the different backgrounds of the worshippers.</p><p>“The biggest challenge in Colombia is maintaining a stable community that has an impact on society and a common identity,” he said.</p><p>“In a community where most people have converted due to different circumstances that led them to Islam, it can be a little more complicated to achieve.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4327434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4327434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4327434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01333-1771634209.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi leads prayers at the Al-Qurtubi Islamic Centre in Bogotá on the first night of Ramadan.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4327434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi leads prayers at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in Bogota on the first night of Ramadan [Alfie Pannell/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>But Qurtubi said the diversity of his congregation has led to celebrations that embrace the spectrum of Colombia’s Muslim identity.</p><p>He described how, on each night of Ramadan, a different family volunteers to cook food for the Iftar, the breaking of the fast.</p><p>“The food options can be very varied. Why? Because it depends on each person’s culture and background,” he explained. “For example, I can offer Moroccan food, one person can offer Pakistani food, others Colombian food.”</p><p>He believes community events like Ramadan create an opportunity for Colombia’s Muslims to embrace their differences and build communal understanding.</p><p>“Knowledge is what allows a community to grow, to flourish … and to have the opportunity to prosper and put down roots here in Colombia,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
