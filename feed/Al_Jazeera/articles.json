These are, after all, countries whose own stability is directly affected by the crisis between the US and Iran.</p><p>This marks a clear break from the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was built around a transactional arms control logic. In 2026, the tensions are fully of a military nature. Regional actors are no longer peripheral observers. They have a direct strategic interest in containment, de-escalation, and preventing a spillover.</p><p>The timing reflects that shift. Over the past few days, Iran and regional nations have intensified their diplomacy. Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, travelled to Moscow on June 30 for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held consultations in Istanbul last Friday.</p><p>Building on those meetings, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani visited Tehran over the weekend. Shortly afterwards, Larijani publicly stated that a structured negotiating framework was beginning to take shape.</p><p>According to multiple sources, what is now being prepared is not a partial or interim arrangement, but a roadmap towardsa comprehensive agreement.</p><p>Washington, however, is keeping ambiguity in play. US President Donald Trump told Fox News this week: “Iran is talking to us, and we’ll see whether we can do something, otherwise we’ll see what happens.” The message combined diplomatic engagement with pressure, preserving uncertainty as leverage.</p><p>Does this mean the risk of war has disappeared? No. But it has receded – if only for the moment.</p><p>Even confidence-building measures, such as transferring or downblending Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, do not resolve the core disputes. Major issues remain unresolved, most notably Iran’s ballistic missile programme and the broader question of its regional deterrence.</p><p>This is where the real negotiation lies. The US no longer appears interested in a deal that merely manages risk. Iran, for its part, does not want an agreement tied to a single presidency or vulnerable to reversal. What both sides are now probing is whether structural concessions can be exchanged for structural guarantees. Everything else – formats, venues, participation – is secondary.</p><p>For now, diplomacy is moving, war is deferred, and the window remains open. Whether it stays that way will depend on whether substance follows structure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

All those tens of thousands of people with injuries still have injuries.”</p><h2 id=\"lack-of-medicine\">Lack of medicine</h2><p>The devastation and lack of access to medical care have killed thousands of Palestinians, experts say.</p><p>For example, there were 1,244 kidney patients in Gaza before the start of the war in October 2023. Now that number stands at 622, al-Wahidi said.</p><p>While 30 were documented to have been killed in direct Israeli attacks, al-Wahidi estimated that hundreds of others died from lack of access to <a href=\"/features/2023/10/25/terrifying-hope-shrinks-for-gazas-dialysis-patients-at-packed-hospitals\">dialysis services</a>.</p><p>And the crisis is ongoing.</p><p>Despite the “ceasefire”, al-Wahidi said, thousands of people in Gaza are also at risk of dying due to shortages in medication.</p><p>“With medicine, the deficit has grown after the ‘ceasefire’. Although the number of injuries has gone down relatively, the lack of medicine has gotten worse, reaching 52 percent. This is a rate that we did not reach throughout the war,” al-Wahidi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The medicine deficit for chronic illnesses is at 62 percent, he added.</p><p>“That means 62 percent of people with chronic conditions are not able to take their medication regularly, which leads to deterioration in health, which leads to death,” al-Wahidi said.</p><p>There are 350,000 patients with chronic illnesses in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry.</p><p>Al-Wahidi said people with long-term illnesses need regular medical attention, tests and visits with physicians – services that were inaccessible throughout the war due to repeated displacement and Israeli attacks on medical centres.</p><p>“I don’t think any hypertension patient has been able to see a doctor regularly since the war started. And if they managed to get medical attention, we don’t have enough medication for everyone,” he said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285584\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-GAZA-HEALTHCARE-SYSTEM-FEB-3-2026-1770124823.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - GAZA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM - FEB 3 2026-1770124823\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>According to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israeli attacks have put 22 <a href=\"/news/2025/4/13/timeline-israels-attacks-on-hospitals-throughout-its-war-on-gaza\">hospitals in Gaza</a> out of service and damaged 211 ambulances.</p><p>So, beyond equipment and doctors, the physical medical buildings in Gaza have also been severely damaged.</p><p>Al-Wahidi said there are no functioning hospitals left in northern Gaza. “People have to come to Gaza City, often on foot, walking several kilometres to reach <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/1/al-shifa-was-a-dream-and-a-nightmare\">al-Shifa Hospital</a> or al-Ahli Hospital,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"medical-evacuations-crucial\">Medical evacuations crucial</h2><p>Amid this widespread destruction, health advocates say restoring Gaza’s health system should go hand-in-hand with evacuating patients who need urgent care.</p><p>Mohammed Tahir, a trauma surgeon who <a href=\"/amp/video/quotable/2026/2/1/as-rafah-reopens-palestinians-are-given-an-impossible\">volunteered in Gaza during the war</a>, described the situation of the health sector in the territory as “dire”.</p><p>“The hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed. Its doctors, its nurses have been killed, imprisoned, forced to flee,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The facilities are in squalor, really. There is a huge gap in terms of the surgical equipment required – the ICU facilities, the dialysis machines, the diagnostic devices there, the provision of medicines from antibiotics to painkillers to those required for managing chronic conditions.”</p><p>Israeli officials and US President Donald Trump have repeatedly expressed plans for <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/trump-says-us-will-take-over-and-own-gaza-in-redevelopment-plan\">removing all Palestinians</a> from Gaza.</p><p>Tahir said while concerns about ethnic cleansing in Gaza are valid, medical evacuations are necessary to treat people who need specialised care and lessen the burden on the medical system.</p><p>“What we want to do is to take these patients that need evacuation out of Gaza into other healthcare systems and create a method to repatriate them to Gaza,” he said.</p><p>Tahir stressed that transferring people with complex injuries and conditions would free up medical resources for routine healthcare services in the territory.</p><p>“That allows the people of Gaza to treat the normal, regular conditions,” he said. “People still walk in the streets. They fall over; they break their hip; they break their ankle; that needs treatment, and we need to empower them to manage these day-to-day conditions as well.”</p><p>Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/us-officially-withdraws-from-the-world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), said beyond Rafah, referral pathways must open from Gaza to Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and across the world.</p><p>“What the focus should be now is to rebuild the health system inside Gaza, so we don’t rely so much on evacuations,” Jasarevic told Al Jazeera in a TV interview.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"de-healthification-of-gaza\">‘De-healthification’ of Gaza</h2><p>In addition to attacking hospitals across Gaza, Israeli forces regularly ordered the evacuation <a href=\"/news/2023/11/15/israeli-forces-raid-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-in-targeted-operation\">of medical centres</a> and raided them under the unfounded claim that they were used as command centres by the Palestinian group Hamas.</p><p>Public health experts say a functioning <a href=\"/news/2024/12/27/israeli-soldiers-burn-gazas-kamal-adwan-hospital-force-hundreds-to-leave\">medical system</a> is more than a place where people can get treatment; it is a tenet of a viable society – and that is exactly what Israel tried to dismantle.</p><p>One of the acts that constitute a genocide, according to the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, is deliberately inflicting on the targeted group “conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.</p><p>Asi, the public health expert, pointed to footage of Israeli soldiers filming themselves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-jXeVUjoyog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smashing</a> hospital equipment as further evidence that the systemic targeting of the health sector in Gaza was deliberate.</p><p>She said the Israeli campaign against the health system “should be, in and of itself, seen as part of the perpetuation of creating” conditions to destroy the Palestinian people.</p><p>Asi added that researchers know from past conflicts that many people are pushed to leave their homes and neighbourhoods when the last clinic or hospital is closed.</p><p>“People know that they cannot live without healthcare. So it’s a tool of displacement. It’s a tool of ensuring that reconstruction, rebuilding people going back to certain areas is, if not impossible, much more difficult,” Asi said.</p><p>The Health Ministry’s al-Wahidi said the medical system in the territory served as a “safety valve” for the people throughout the war.</p><p>“In any area, people were finding safety in the functioning hospitals. The medical workers would remain until the last minute in the hospitals until they are forcibly removed or detained by Israeli forces,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So, attacking the hospitals and raiding them was a recipe for displacing people. The resilience of the hospitals became the resilience of the people. As long as the hospitals remained standing, the people remained in their land.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Layth Malhis, a Georgetown University graduate student, recently wrote a report for <a href=\"https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/de-healthification-israels-engineered-collapse-of-palestinian-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Shabaka</a> think tank on what he termed the “de-healthification” of Palestine – a longstanding Israeli policy intended to “render Palestinian life unhealable and perishable”.</p><p>Malhis told Al Jazeera the Israeli assault on healthcare workers – as symbols of knowledge and social mobility – aimed to psychologically and physically harm Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“What we saw in the genocide is that the Israelis have treated doctors and nurses and their institutions as combatants – because they understand that if you really want to eviscerate the Palestinians and remove them from their land, you have to get rid of the people that are keeping them alive and resistant and resilient,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"rebuilding\">Rebuilding</h2><p>Despite the enormous challenges, al-Wahidi said, the health sector in Gaza is trying to recover.</p><p>“Under the current standards and data and circumstances, it all seems unmanageable, but we are still providing services to the best of our ability,” he said.</p><p>Al-Wahidi said the Health Ministry is starting to restore medical buildings with local efforts and materials available on the market.</p><p>He added that officials are launching vaccination campaigns and opening new clinics while expanding services at the still-functioning hospitals daily.</p><p>“For the first time since the start of the war, we resumed open-heart surgeries at al-Quds Hospital. This is an achievement under these difficult conditions,” al-Wahidi said.</p><p>“We also activated <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/israels-attacks-on-gaza-fertility-clinics-shatter-dreams-of-parenthood\">childbirth services</a> at 19 medical centres throughout the Gaza Strip. Humble efforts, but we are trying to rebuild the healthcare system with the resources available.”</p><p>Asi said Palestinian health workers embody the best of the profession, voicing disappointment that people in the global medical community have largely overlooked the plight of their peers in Gaza.</p><p>“The health sector is such a microcosm of Palestinian resilience,” she said.</p><p>“It is beyond comprehension for most of us that we could ever go through those conditions and have the motivation to rebuild as they have when so many of their comrades have been killed, and the threat to them is still existent. I think it’s astounding. I think it’s incredible.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hasan is still in his teens, but he is their teacher. They greeted him in Rakhine language: “Sayar, Nay Kaung Lar? [Sir, how are you?]” The children are among 80 who study at Hasan’s community-run private school, where he teaches them Burmese, English and maths.</p><p>But nearby, a Bangladeshi government official on a motorcycle was trying to educate all those who would listen about something else: He was making announcements about the country’s upcoming February 12 elections.</p><p>Between February 9 and February 13, the official yelled out on a microphone, people in the refugee camp should keep their shops shut and not venture outside the camp. And he warned them: Anyone found participating in any political campaign would receive “serious punishment” – they could lose their registration card and a separate document that allows refugees access to subsidised rations.</p><p>The camps in Cox’s Bazar are home to more than 1 million Rohingya refugees, who were forced to flee Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military crackdown. At a time when most countries shunned them, Bangladesh – under then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina – gave them shelter. But the election season warnings to them were a reminder of how, at the same time, life in Bangladesh is life in limbo: Limited education, health, rations, livelihood options, and freedom of movement.</p><p>As Bangladesh’s 127 million voters prepare to elect their next government, Rohingya refugees like Hasan know that they aren’t real stakeholders.</p><p>“I don’t have any new expectations,” Hasan told Al Jazeera. “I deserve to live with dignity and human rights. This life [in Bangladesh] is not my choice.”</p><p>Still, he conceded, candidates from the two main political fronts in the election – the alliances led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami – in the Ukhia and Teknaf regions where the Rohingya camps are based, have spoken of the community’s concerns, as have national leaders from these parties.</p><p>That gives him some hope to cling to.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287278\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287278\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287278\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC3080-1770189355.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Rohingya family outside their temporary home in a camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Rohingya family outside their temporary home in a camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"it-s-not-sufficient\">‘It’s not sufficient’</h2><p>Hasan arrived in Bangladesh with his family when he was 10 years old in 2017, with other Rohingya refugees.</p><p>The massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar – where the community’s members are not even considered citizens – is currently being investigated by the International Court of Justice as a possible genocide. Meanwhile, in November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Myanmar’s military chief, Min Aung Hlaing, accusing him of committing crimes against the Rohingya in 2017.</p><p>Since then, Bangladesh has been home to the biggest chunk of Rohingya refugees globally.</p><p>But Nay San Lwin, a diaspora leader of the Rohingya and a co-chair of the Arakan Rohingya National Council (ARNC), said that while the community was grateful to Bangladesh’s government and people, the country’s policy of “non-integration” of the Rohingya meant that they remained on the peripheries of society. The camps are fenced with barbed wire, and Rohingya children can’t access the formal education system of Bangladesh, for instance.</p><p>“The elected government in February should focus on improving living conditions, access to education, healthcare, livelihoods, and fostering greater engagement between refugees and host communities,” he said.</p><p>That’s easier said than done, though. The Rohingya camps have run with financial support from the United Nations and global aid agencies – and funding cuts in recent years have hobbled the already limited services available to residents.</p><p>“The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate due to insecurity, funding cuts, lack of education, and uncertainty about the future,” said Sayed Ullah, president of the United Council of the Rohingya, a community organisation.</p><p>Hafez Ahmed, a 64-year-old shopkeeper in the camp, said medical facilities there were getting worse. “We only got the basic medicines they provide in the hospital. If any critical illness is detected, hospitals advise us to seek treatment at private hospitals, but we don’t have the money,” he told Al Jazeera. “Rations are getting less; it’s not sufficient.”</p><p>And for young Rohingya like the teenage teacher Hasan, life in the camp is one of dashed dreams.</p><p>“Living camp life is a trauma; camp life is like prison life,” he said.  “I wanted to be a world-class teacher who contributes to world education, but what can I say to myself, a fateless one?”</p><p>Growing frustrations with life in Bangladesh have led more and more Rohingya refugees to try to repeat the perilous journeys they once took to get to the country – to go elsewhere this time.</p><p>In a joint statement issued in November, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that in 2025, more than 5,300 Rohingya refugees embarked on dangerous maritime journeys. Many left Myanmar, but others were also trying to flee Bangladesh. In all, more than 600 are missing or have been killed.</p><p>Bibi Khadija, 23, is among those who tried to leave the refugee camps in Bangladesh. In November, she said, she tried “to go to Malaysia in search of a better life”. But after a human trafficker detained her and her three-year-old son, she escaped with the child. As she tried to make her way back to the camp, she asked locals in a market for help. Instead, she said, they “beat” her. “You are the Rohingya; you always create problems for us,” she recalled the mob telling her. Eventually, another local – a stranger – gave her some money to help her get back home.</p><p>Khadija’s story isn’t unique: The Rohingya in Bangladesh today sit at the intersection of a complex narrative, say experts – both treated as victims of a possible genocide, and held responsible for crime and strained social services.</p><p>As the country looks for a new start with the upcoming election, many – among both the Rohingya and Bangladeshis concerned about their presence in the nation – are hoping for a new deal for the community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4287284\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4287284\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4287284\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC6062-1770189395.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, are home to more than one million Rohingya refugees [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4287284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, are home to more than one million Rohingya refugees [Sahat Zia/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"matter-of-utmost-priority\">‘Matter of utmost priority’</h2><p>In August 2024, then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India, seeking exile after a major student-led uprising. She has now been sentenced, in absentia, to death for a brutal crackdown by her security forces against protesters, in which more than 1,400 people were killed.</p><p>Since her ouster, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has led an interim administration. Before the February 12 elections that will determine Bangladesh’s next government, the BNP and the Jamaat – the two main forces, with Hasina’s Awami League banned – have both spoken of the Rohingya crisis.</p><p>“Rohingya repatriation is a matter of utmost priority for the BNP,” party leader Israfil Khosru told Al Jazeera. Khosru is a special assistant to BNP chairperson Tarique Rahman’s Foreign Advisory Committee. In 1992, during the first term of Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, as the country’s prime minister, Bangladesh successfully repatriated Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. “We believe in safe and dignified repatriation of the Rohingyas. Their right to citizenship [in Myanmar] must be ensured.”</p><p>The Jamaat, meanwhile, has launched a platform to seek feedback on potential solutions to the Rohingya crisis from Bangladeshis and the diaspora. “We received a significant number of policy proposals from the people to solve the Rohingya crisis. We will examine those,” Jamaat’s assistant secretary, Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, said.</p><p>“Solving the Rohingya issue is one of our party’s top priorities, to return them to their homeland, Myanmar, with security and dignity,” he added. He said that while previous Bangladeshi governments have focused on seeking a resolution through the UN, “China, India, and other essential stakeholders should play an effective role,” too.</p><p>But Tanvir Habib, assistant professor in international relations at Dhaka University, said the Rohingya issue was not a major factor in the election campaign.</p><p>“The next government would need to engage global and regional stakeholders to ensure that support continues to reach this vulnerable community,” he said.</p><p>Thomas Kean, senior consultant on Bangladesh and Myanmar for the International Crisis Group, said Rohingya refugees would “welcome improvements to their living conditions in the camps” under whichever party wins the election.</p><p>But the refugees see “their stay in Bangladesh as temporary, so the focus remains repatriation”.</p><p>John Quinley, director at the human rights nonprofit Fortify Rights, cautioned that Bangladeshi parties need to go beyond using “the Rohingya as a political tool during election campaigns”.</p><p>“Whoever comes to power in Bangladesh must outline a comprehensive Rohingya strategy that goes beyond repatriation. Repatriation cannot be the sole political agenda for Bangladeshi leaders, as it is not possible at this time,” he argued. “The Myanmar junta continues to commit genocide against the Rohingya.”</p><p>Not everyone is as sympathetic to the Rohingya refugees.</p><p>Outside the camp in Cox’s Bazar, Mahabub Alam, a 29-year-old student and a resident of Ukhia, described the Rohingya as a “burden”.</p><p>“Rohingya are occupying our local labour market at a lower day wage rate, and the job market is decreasing. So the Rohingya issue is a big problem for us,” Alam said.</p><p>Alam also blamed the Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar for local crime, including human trafficking.</p><p>While Rohingya leaders push back against the community being characterised as responsible for crime and violence in parts of Bangladesh, those concerns extend beyond locals in Cox’s Bazar.</p><p>“People are getting impatient with the lingering Rohingya issue in Bangladesh,” Major-General Shahidul Haque, a former diplomat and Bangladeshi defence attache to Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. “It is impacting our law and order situation and our national security. I have attended seminars this week where everybody is worried and wants this solved. They are expecting the  next government to solve the issue.”</p><p>What that solution will look like is unclear.</p><p>But back in the camp in Cox’s Bazar, Ahmed, the Rohingya shopkeeper, knows what he wants from the next government in Bangladesh: Repatriation with rights, to Myanmar.</p><p>“I want to die in my homeland,” the sexagenarian said. “I want to return to my home.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) said that Panama’s ruling against CK Hutchison subsidiary – the Panama Ports Company – was “absurd”, “shameful and pathetic”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Panamanian court had “ignored the facts, breached trust, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises in Hong Kong, China”, the HKMAO said on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“China has sufficient means and tools, and sufficient strength and ability to defend a fair and just international economic and trade order,” the office said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“Heavy prices both politically and economically will surely be paid” by Panama if it insists on going ahead with the ruling, the office

after US <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/2/donald-trump-and-the-great-panama-canal-tantrum\">President Donald Trump</a> threatened to seize control of the crucial passageway that connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, claiming the waterway was effectively under Chinese control and therefore a security threat to Washington.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Without naming the US, the Chinese statement further said that “some country has … used bullying tactics to force other countries to obey their will,” and that Panama had “willingly succumbed” to hegemonic power.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">John Moolenaar, chairman of the US House Select Committee on China, called the Panama court’s decision a “win for America”.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Panamanian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding China’s warning.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">CK Hutchison said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday that its board of directors “strongly

Neither did I. But how do you do an agreement, a pact? It’s not as between twin brothers. It’s between opponents,” Petro said.</p><p>Separately, Trump told reporters from the Oval Office that he felt good about the meeting. “I thought it was terrific,” he said.</p><p>On the agenda for the two leaders were issues including the fight against transnational drug trafficking and security in Latin America.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from Tuesday’s meeting.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-white-house-charm-offensive\">A White House charm offensive</h2><p>Over the past year, Trump has invited the media to participate in his meetings with foreign leaders, often holding news conferences with the visiting dignitaries in the Oval Office.</p><p>Not this time, however. The meeting between Trump and Petro lasted nearly two hours, all of it behind closed doors.</p><p>But the two leaders emerged with largely positive things to say about one another.</p><p>In a post on social media, Petro revealed that Trump had gifted him several items, including a <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018764117893406985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commemorative photograph</a> of their meeting accompanied by a signed note.</p><p>“Gustavo – a great honor. I love Colombia,” it read, followed by Trump’s signature.</p><p>In another <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018772658737869234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, Petro showed off a signed copy of Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal. On its title page, Trump had scrawled another note to Petro: “You are great.”</p><p>“Can someone tell me what Trump said in this dedication?” Petro wrote jokingly in Spanish on social media. “I don’t understand much English.”</p><h2 id=\"a-turning-point-in-a-tense-relationship\">A turning point in a tense relationship?</h2><p>Petro’s joke appeared to be a cheeky nod to his notoriously rocky relationship with Trump.</p><p>It was only six days into Trump’s second term, on January 26, 2025, that he and Petro <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">began their feud</a>, trading threats on social media over the fate of two US deportation flights.</p><p>Petro objected to the reported human rights violations facing the deportees. Trump, meanwhile, took Petro’s initial refusal to accept the flights as a threat to US “national security”. Petro ultimately backed down after Trump threatened steep sanctions on imported Colombian goods.</p><p>They continued to trade barbs in the months since. Petro, for instance, has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/family-of-man-slain-in-a-us-boat-strike-in-the-caribbean-lodges-complaint\">condemned the deadly US attacks</a> on boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, comparing the strikes with murder.</p><p>He has also criticised Trump for carrying out a US military offensive in Venezuela to abduct then-President Nicolas Maduro. That attack, Petro said, was tantamount to “kidnapping”.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, stripped Petro of his US visa following the Colombian leader’s appearance at the United Nations General Assembly, where he criticised the US and briefly joined a pro-Palestinian protest.</p><p>The Trump administration also sanctioned Petro in October, blaming the left-wing leader for allowing “drug cartels to flourish”.</p><p>After removing Maduro from power on January 3, Trump offered a warning to Petro: he had better “watch his a**”. The statement was widely interpreted to be a threat of military action against Colombia.</p><p>But Trump and Petro appeared to have reached a turning point last month. On January 7, the two leaders held their first call together. Tuesday’s in-person meeting marked another first in their relationship.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"agreeing-to-disagree\">Agreeing to disagree</h2><p>Despite the easing tensions, the two leaders used their public statements after the meeting to reaffirm their differences.</p><p>Trump was the first to speak, holding a news conference in the Oval Office as he signed legislation to end a government shutdown.</p><p>The US president, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, used the appearance to reflect on the political tensions the two leaders had in the lead-up to the meeting.</p><p>“He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted, because I’d never met him,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>He added that Tuesday’s meeting was nevertheless pleasant. “I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well.”</p><p>Petro, meanwhile, held a longer news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, where he raised some points of divergence he had with Trump.</p><p>Among the topics he mentioned was Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which the US has supported, and sustainable energy initiatives designed to be carbon neutral. Trump, in the past, has called the so-called green energy programmes a “scam”.</p><p>Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing leader, also reflected on his region’s history with colonialism and foreign intervention. He told reporters it was important that Latin America make decisions for itself, free from any outside “coercion”.</p><p>“ We don’t operate under blackmail,” he said at one point, in an apparent reference to Trump’s pressure campaigns.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"differing-approach-to-combating-drug-trafficking\">Differing approach to combating drug trafficking</h2><p>One of the primary points of contention, however, was Petro’s approach to combating drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, responsible for 68 percent of the global supply.</p><p>The Trump administration has used the fight against global drug trafficking as a justification for carrying out lethal military strikes in international waters and in Venezuela, despite experts condemning the attacks as illegal under international law.</p><p>It has also stripped Colombia of its certification as an ally in its global counter-narcotics operations.</p><p>Trump’s White House has <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> it will consider reversing that decision if Petro takes “more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking”.</p><p>But Petro has rejected any attempt to label him as soft on drug trafficking, instead touting the historic drug busts his government has overseen.</p><p>He made this argument yet again after Tuesday’s meeting, claiming that no other Colombian administration had done as much as his to fight cocaine trafficking.</p><p>Rather than take a militarised approach to destroying crops of coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine, Petro argued that he has had more success with voluntary eradication programmes.</p><p>This push, he said, succeeded in “getting thousands of peasant farmers to uproot the plant themselves”.</p><p>“These are two different methods, two different ways of understanding how to fight drug trafficking,” Petro said. “One that is brutal and self-interested, and what it ends up doing is promoting mafia powers and drug traffickers, and another approach, which is intelligent, which is effective.”</p><p>Petro maintained it was more strategic to go after top drug-ring leaders than to punish impoverished rural farmers by forcibly ripping up their crops.</p><p>“I told President Trump, if you want an ally in fighting drug trafficking, it’s going after the top kingpins,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4286941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4286941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26034840917917-1770173498.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks at a podium\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during a news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, on February 3 [Jose Luis Magana/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-trumpian-note\">A Trumpian note</h2><p>Tuesday’s meeting ultimately marked yet another high-profile reversal for Trump, who has a history of shifting his relationships with world leaders.</p><p>Last year, for instance, he lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a public Oval Office clash, only to warm to the wartime leader several months later.</p><p>But Colombia is quickly approaching a pivotal presidential election in May, which will see Petro’s left-wing coalition, the Historic Pact, seek to defend the presidency against an ascendant far right.</p><p>Petro himself cannot run for consecutive terms under Colombian law. But there is speculation that Tuesday’s detente with Trump may help Petro’s coalition avoid US condemnation ahead of the vote.</p><p>Colombia, after all, was until recently the largest recipient of US aid in South America, and it has long harboured close ties with the North American superpower. Straining those ties could therefore be seen as an election liability.</p><p>While Petro acknowledged his differences with Trump during his remarks, at times he expressed certain views that overlapped with the US president’s.</p><p>Like Trump has in the past, Petro used part of his speech on Tuesday to question the role of the UN in maintaining global security.</p><p>“ Did it not show incapacity? Isn’t a reform needed?” Petro asked, wondering aloud if there was “something superior to the United Nations that would bring humanity together better in a better way”.</p><p>But when it came to donning Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Petro drew a line – or rather, a squiggle.</p><p>On social media, he shared an adjustment he made to the cap’s slogan. A jagged, Sharpie-inked “S” amended the phrase to include the entire Western Hemisphere: “Make Americas Great Again.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
