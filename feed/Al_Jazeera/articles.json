            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Israeli occupation authorities have intensified their campaign of forced displacement across the occupied West Bank, issuing expulsion orders to an entire Bedouin community east of Ramallah and escalating demolition policies in occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>The measures come amid a surge in settler violence targeting educational institutions in the Jordan Valley and residential homes in Qalqilya, further shrinking the living space for Palestinians under military occupation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"zone-of-expulsion\">‘Zone of expulsion’</h2><p>On Sunday morning, Israeli forces raided the Abu Najeh al-Kaabneh Bedouin community in al-Mughayyir village, east of Ramallah.</p><p>Local sources confirmed to the Wafa news agency that soldiers delivered a military order requiring the community’s 40 residents to dismantle their homes and leave the area within 48 hours. The army declared the site a “closed military zone”, a tactic frequently used to clear Palestinian land for settlement expansion.</p><p>During the raid, Israeli troops arrested three foreign solidarity activists attempting to document the eviction order.</p><p>The expulsion order is part of a widening campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region. It follows the complete displacement of the Shallal al-Auja community north of Jericho, which concluded on Saturday. After years of systematic harassment, the last three families of the community were forced to leave, marking the erasure of a presence that once included 120 families.</p><h2 id=\"al-aqsa-provocations\">Al-Aqsa provocations</h2><p>In occupied East Jerusalem, Israel’s municipal policies of urban restriction continued to displace Palestinians.</p><p>On Sunday, Yasser Maher Dana, a Palestinian resident of the Jabal Mukaber neighbourhood, was coerced into demolishing his 100-square-metre (1,076-square-foot) home. The structure, located in the al-Salaa district, housed four family members.</p><p>Israeli authorities routinely force Palestinians in East Jerusalem to execute their own demolition orders to avoid paying exorbitant fees charged by municipal crews and forces if they carry out the destruction themselves. These demolitions are justified by a lack of building permits, which rights groups say are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain in the city.</p><p>Simultaneously, in Silwan, south of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the municipality issued a demolition order for a residential room belonging to the al-Taweel family, granting them a 10-day deadline. This follows notices issued three days before demolishing two homes belonging to brothers in the Wadi Qaddum neighbourhood.</p><p>Tensions also rose at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, stormed by dozens of Israeli settlers under heavy police protection. According to the Jerusalem governorate, the incursion included a provocative “wedding blessing” ritual performed by settlers for a bride in the courtyards, a violation of the site’s status quo.</p><h2 id=\"settlers-attack-schools-and-homes\">Settlers attack schools and homes</h2><p>In the northern Jordan Valley, Israeli settlers, backed by the military, disrupted the school day at the al-Maleh School.</p><p>Azmi Balawneh, the director of education in Tubas, reported that settlers blocked teachers from reaching the school, which serves children from the vulnerable Bedouin communities of al-Hadidiya, Makhoul, and Samra.</p><p>This harassment coincides with the establishment of a new illegal settlement outpost in the al-Maleh area just a week ago. In the nearby Khirbet Samra, settlers erected a new tent on Sunday morning to seize more pastoral land.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the village of Faraata, east of Qalqilya, settlers from the illegal “Havat Gilad” outpost attacked the home of Hijazi Yamin.</p><p>Yamin told Wafa that settlers pelted his house and unleashed an attack dog on his family, trapping his wife and seven children inside.</p><p>“We live in a constant state of insecurity,” Yamin said, noting this was the second attack in a week. “I am afraid to leave my wife and children alone or let them go to school.”</p><h2 id=\"military-raids-and-closures\">Military raids and closures</h2><p>Israeli forces conducted multiple raids across the West Bank on Sunday, arresting at least four Palestinians. In Hebron, two brothers were arrested following a raid on their family home. More arrests were reported in the village of Duma, south of Nablus, and in the town of al-Ubeidiya, east of Bethlehem.</p><p>In the northern city of Jenin, military vehicles stormed the city centre and the Jabel Abu Dhuhair neighbourhood. During the incursion, troops deliberately destroyed street vendors’ carts at the Cinema Roundabout, targeting the local economy.</p><p>Movement restrictions also tightened significantly. For the second consecutive day, the Israeli army closed the main entrance to Turmus Aya, north of Ramallah, and blocked the Atara military checkpoint since the early morning hours, severing connections between northern and central West Bank cities. According to the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, Israel now operates 916 military checkpoints and gates throughout the West Bank.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

And in the case of China, that can be particularly true.</p><p>In this sense, what was important about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to China at the end of January was that it happened at all. In recent years, there have been plenty of tensions between the two countries: the accusations against two British citizens of spying for China, the delay in the approval for the new Chinese embassy in London, the trial against democracy activist Jimmy Lai, etc.</p><p>The fact that Starmer made the trip to Beijing – the first one for a British prime minister in eight years – indicated that the arguments in favour of doing it outweighed the negatives of it. What certainly tipped the balance was the increased intensity with which the US administration is now turning on its traditional allies.</p><p>The visit did not reset relations, but it revealed that the world has entered a new era of global power dynamics, which is already reflected in diplomacy.</p><p>On January 23, just a week before his trip to China, Starmer summoned up a rare display of public anger, condemning US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/frankly-appalling-uks-starmer-slams-trump-over-afghanistan-comments\">remarks</a> about British troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>This made the visit to Beijing very different from those of previous British prime ministers. In the past, there had never been a question about the alignment between the United Kingdom and the United States.</p><p>The US and the UK were close allies for decades. They acted in close coordination on the wars in the Middle East since 2001, and on combatting global terrorism and other threats. They shared intelligence through the Five Eyes arrangement and worked together as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>On China, moments of disagreement were brief. In 2004, the UK and its European partners <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004-09/eu-eyes-lifting-china-arms-embargo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attempted</a> to lift the arms embargo imposed by them and the US on China after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, on the grounds that all the equipment they forbade was restricted perfectly well by other legislation. The then Bush administration strongly opposed this, and the idea was dropped.</p><p>More than a decade later, during the first Trump administration, it looked like Europe might seek to forge its own trade deal with China to compensate for steel and other tariffs placed on it by the US. But in 2018, that receded too as the European Union ironed out a deal with Washington. Part of that was not to grow closer to the Chinese in terms of trade.</p><p>The pandemic pushed the US and Europe further towards aligning with each other against China, which they regarded as partially creating the problem by not announcing the appearance of the virus soon enough. By 2023, therefore, the UK and the US were almost vying with each other to be more hawkish, with then-Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66156847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declaring</a> that the People’s Republic was Britain’s greatest “state-based threat”.</p><p>We are no longer in that world. Washington’s actions are raising fundamental questions about the alliance system around NATO and other security arrangements that it has sat at the heart of since the end of World War II.</p><p>We do not yet know the shape of the world we are heading into. It might take years for it to fully emerge. But for Starmer on his visit to Beijing, this shift meant he was talking to an interlocutor who is also trying to work out what the new situation means.</p><p>President Xi Jinping is not a security ally of the UK, but in the strange, topsy-turvy world we now inhabit, his administration is probably closer to the UK in terms of working out what to do about global warming or how to manage the risks of artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Both countries do not like the unpredictability of the current situation. They are all linked by having a problem with the US now, even if it is a different kind of problem.</p><p>This, of course, does not mean that a new kind of strategic alliance is in the making; there were no signs of that in the meeting. After all, culturally, politically and in terms of values, the UK and China disagree with each other too much for that to happen. This is regardless of Britain’s links with the US.</p><p>But that Starmer was able to announce restrictions on small engines that end up used in the boats bringing immigrants illegally across the seas around the UK was a telling sign of how, even in a deglobalising world, everything still connects, and that in a modest and indirect way, Britain needs to talk to China to address some aspects of what it sees as its own security priorities.</p><p>There were other announcements as well: the $15bn investment by British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the 30-day visa-free access to China for British citizens and the lifting of sanctions against some UK Parliament members.</p><p>The groundwork was also laid for deeper economic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/29/what-agreements-starmer-trip-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engagement</a>, with some steps being taken to improve trade and facilitate UK business access to the Chinese market.</p><p>Longer term, this visit could also pave the way for engagement that recognises the rise of China as a technology power. In environmental science, AI, quantum computing – indeed, in almost every area – China is outpacing not just the UK, but almost everyone else. It is producing ideas and innovations in medicine, renewable energy, etc which matter to the UK for its own good.</p><p>A single four-day visit did not reset the relationship. There are still many issues between the two countries. But at least it has allowed the possibility – now that the political blockages have been cleared – to work out strategically how the UK and others in Europe navigate the new geopolitics where there are no eternal friends or enemies, and how they react to a world where, for the first time in recent history, China has innovations, technologies and ideas that they might need and want.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Of course, the coup was suppressed,” Khamenei said. “Their goal was to destroy sensitive and effective centres involved in running the country, and for this reason, they attacked the police, government centres, [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC] facilities, banks and mosques and burned copies of the Quran.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iranians-are-in-mourning\">‘Iranians are in mourning’</h2><p>The protests started on December 28 after shopkeepers in Tehran’s business district protested Iran’s rapid economic decline linked to local mismanagement and corruption, as well as the collapse of Iran’s currency, the rial, amid sanctions imposed by the US and its allies.</p><p>But the protests soon morphed into nationwide expressions of anger over curtailed personal and social freedoms, an acute energy and water crisis, and severe air pollution, among other things.</p><p>The United Nations, international rights groups, and foreign-based opponents of the Iranian establishment say thousands were shot dead or stabbed by security forces during the protests.</p><p>A UN special rapporteur said the number of fatalities may surpass 20,000 as more information – stifled by a weeks-old internet blackout – comes out. US-based activists allege there were 6,713 deaths, and claim they are investigating 17,000 others. Other sources cite even higher figures.</p><p>Iranian authorities maintain that “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel were responsible for the mass killings. The country’s state media said the protests <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">killed 3,117 people</a>, with 2,427 being civilians and the remainder being members of the security forces.</p><p>President Masoud Pezeshkian this week promised to release the names and information of every person killed during the unrest soon, but has provided no timeline for this. His government also sent a text message to Iranians, saying the move will counter the “fake claims and figures”.</p><p>“One-way text messages cannot wash away the blood. Many Iranians are in mourning,” an Iranian woman told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"death-to-america\">‘Death to America’</h2><p>In an apparent move to help calm the inflamed tensions within Iranian society, the government on Sunday sent another text message to citizens, telling them that women will soon be allowed to ride motorcycles in the country.</p><p>Iran’s laws have so far blocked women from riding motorcycles, while the state continues to impose a mandatory dress code and punish violators.</p><p>Inside the Iranian parliament, meanwhile, familiar images were witnessed on Sunday as hardline lawmakers once again donned IRGC uniforms and chanted “Death to America” with clenched fists.</p><p></p><p>The move was in reaction to the European Union earlier this week designating the IRGC as a “terrorist” organisation. Tehran responded by proscribing the bloc’s armed forces.</p><p>The IRGC, originally created shortly after the Iranian revolution to protect the fledgling theocratic establishment, has since transformed into a military powerhouse that also controls large parts of the Iranian economy.</p><p>“Such moves [by the EU] will not only fail to help with regional peace and security, but will also make the path of constructive engagement and coordination harder,” the IRGC said in a statement on Sunday in response to its blacklisting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iranian officials are also holding “celebrations” across the country to mark the revolution’s anniversary and bolster its defiant messaging.</p><p>Troops from the IRGC and the army, joined by the police and other security personnel, marched on the streets of Tehran on Sunday in an apparent show of strength. Soldiers on motorcycles led a parade from Mehrabad Airport to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, where Khomeini delivered his first speech in 1979. Soldiers were also photographed at Khomeini’s mausoleum in Tehran as they “renewed their covenant with the goals and ideals of the revolution”.</p><p>Hamidreza Hajibabaei, who heads the committee organising the 10-day event marking the revolution’s anniversary, said on Sunday that large demonstrations will be held on February 11 across the country to “spell the end of the presence of global arrogance”.</p><p>In his speech, Khamenei also stressed the importance of state-run events, claiming that millions of people participated in a pro-government rally on January 12 while “mere thousands” rose up against the Islamic Republic during the nationwide protests.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iranian state television and other affiliated networks continue to broadcast programmes condemning the “riots” last month. A similar show on Ofogh, an IRGC-affiliated television channel, <span>allegedly mocked the protesters, triggering angry online reactions and forcing the authorities to sack the channel’s director.</span></p><p>“They are only throwing more salt on our wounds,” a young student told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns. “They say all our youth were killed by terrorists, then go ahead and mock the people who laid down their lives on state television.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Today, we enjoy approximately 20 hours of continuous, uninterrupted service per day. This was a distant dream just two months ago.”</p><p>Sultan said the ongoing progress in Aden cannot be attributed solely to the United Nations-recognised government. He highlighted the role of Falah al-Shahrani, who arrived in Aden early this year as part of a high-level delegation from the Joint Forces Command of the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen to follow up on security and military arrangements in the wake of the STC’s military collapse.</p><p>An adviser to the commander of the forces, al-Shahrani has worked with local and military leaders to reposition military camps outside Aden and has played a critical role in managing what Sultan described as a sensitive phase in the city.</p><p>“Al-Shahrani is effectively the de facto ruler of Aden now,” Sultan added.</p><h2 id=\"saudi-uae-tensions\">Saudi-UAE tensions</h2><p>In late December, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen surfaced publicly, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/saudi-says-it-will-militarily-back-yemens-government-against-separatists\">prompting</a> Riyadh to adopt a sharper narrative and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/uae-welcomes-saudi-efforts-to-support-security-in-yemen-amid-stc-advance\">launch</a> military operations aimed at pushing back the UAE-backed STC, which had crossed a Saudi red line by trying to take control of eastern Yemeni regions that bordered Saudi Arabia.</p><p>On December 30, the UAE <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/30/live-yemens-presidential-council-cancels-uae-defence-deal\">announced</a> its withdrawal from Yemen “of its own volition” after the Yemeni government demanded it do so. The UAE has been arming and funding the STC since its <a href=\"/news/2020/4/26/yemen-what-is-the-southern-transitional-council\">establishment</a> in 2017.</p><p>At a news conference in Warsaw on Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said, “The UAE has now decided to leave Yemen, and I think if that indeed is the case and the UAE has completely left the issue of Yemen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take responsibility.”</p><p>Some STC leaders travelled to Riyadh after the Saudi attacks on the STC and announced the dissolution of the group. But other STC leaders have rejected that statement and continue to try to rally support on the ground in southern Yemen.</p><h2 id=\"mass-demoralisation\">Mass demoralisation</h2><p>Saleh Qasim, a 45-year-old resident of Aden’s Sheikh Othman district, told Al Jazeera that “the Saudi era” has begun in Aden.</p><p>“Aden is recovering today, and that could be the path to Yemen’s recovery,” he said.</p><p>But he added that while the early signs are promising, it is still a bleak time for pro-independence southerners like himself.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The STC and its supporters want the restoration of the former South Yemen, an independent state that existed from 1967 to 1990 before uniting with North Yemen to form the united Republic of Yemen.</p><p>Supporters of secession feel that the south was disenfranchised in the united Yemen. They took their opportunity after the Houthi takeover of Sanaa and northwestern Yemen in 2014 and 2015, taking de facto control over Aden and other parts of southern Yemen.</p><p>It had finally seemed like the dream of an independent state was on the horizon, particularly with the backing of the UAE. But then came the Saudi-backed counterattack by the Yemeni government, and now, in the space of weeks, the dream of secession has been shattered, in the short term at least.</p><p>“This is the most frustrating moment for the secessionists,” Qasim said. “They have lost land, weapons and fighters. I can see the mass demoralisation among the independence seekers in Aden.”</p><p>He added: “I also aspire to see the south independent but through dialogue, not force.”</p><p>The STC has been trying to showcase its support in Aden with rallies every Friday that are attended by thousands of people in al-Aroudh Square.</p><p>There, the protesters raise the southern flag and the image of the STC’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/saudi-led-coalition-says-stcs-al-zubaidi-fled-to-uae-via-somaliland\">on-the-run leader</a>, Aidarous al-Zubaidi. They also chant for independence, pledge to continue their struggle and voice their anger at the Saudi role. However, Sultan, the journalist, views these mass rallies as an emotional outlet for STC supporters that ultimately will not be able to restore the group’s lost leverage.</p><p>Sultan believes that local authorities are turning a blind eye to the demonstrations as a way of allowing STC supporters to blow off some steam.</p><p>“In my opinion, there is a deliberate effort to allow separatist demonstrators to vent their frustrations regarding recent developments, which have been quite shocking to them,” Sultan said.</p><h2 id=\"three-challenges\">Three challenges</h2><p>On January 15, President Rashad al-Alimi, the head of the Presidential Leadership Council, Yemen’s UN-recognised authority, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/yemens-saudi-backed-government-appoints-new-prime-minister-2\">appointed</a> Foreign Minister Shaya Mohsin al-Zindani as the ⁠country’s prime minister.</p><p>Consultations on the selection of cabinet members have been under way in Riyadh. Once finalised, the cabinet is expected to return to Aden to govern – a major move that would signal that the government is truly in control of the city for the first time in years.</p><p>However, challenges lie ahead as “the internal and external architects of chaos” have not abandoned their agenda in the south, Yemeni political analyst Sadam al-Huraibi told Al Jazeera, referring to the UAE and armed separatists.</p><p>Al-Huraibi identified three challenges that the new cabinet will potentially face in Aden. “One major threat is the terrorist or politically motivated bombings in Aden, which could quickly turn the city into a place of mourning.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On January 21, an explosives-laden car <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/five-killed-in-treacherous-attack-on-military-convoy-in-yemen\">detonated</a> as a pro-government military commander’s convoy was moving in Aden. Five soldiers were killed, and three were wounded. No party has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p><p>“The other challenge is the risk of planned riots. Protesters may exploit the right to assembly and turn to violence in Aden. Such incidents can erupt sporadically and rob the city’s calm, affecting the government’s ability to function,” al-Huraibi said.</p><p>Al-Huraibi added that the third challenge is the UAE’s alleged covert coordination with separatists in southern cities to undermine Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government. “The UAE said it withdrew from Yemen, but there is no guarantee it will be completely disengaged,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-the-focus-to-the-north\">Shifting the focus to the north</h2><p>Yemeni officials today believe that a stable Aden and Saudi support are decisive success factors for shifting the focus to the north, where the Houthis have dominated for a decade.</p><p>Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman said in a recent interview that Saudi Arabia “has committed to pay the salaries of all the national army and the brigades, … the salaries of the government staff, including the diplomats”.</p><p>“And this is the first step,” he said. “First, we have to secure the capital in Aden, and then when the capital is stable and the services are functioning to a certain extent, the government starts operating from Aden.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>With the unified political and military bloc in the south, he said, the focus must shift to the peace process and confronting the Iran-backed Houthis.</p><p>Noman believes the Houthis are not ready for a peace process but they will change their minds when they see the new government operating in Aden and playing a governing role in the south.</p><p>For their part, the Houthis have downplayed the importance of the recent Saudi moves in the south, arguing that Saudi Arabia puts its interests first, not Yemen’s.</p><p>In a speech broadcast on January 23, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi movement, said: “The Saudi – even at this stage – is not concerned with either unity or separation [in Yemen]. What concerns him is complete control, occupation and domination over the Yemeni people.”</p><p>The Houthis took control of Sanaa in 2014 and then <a href=\"/news/2015/1/21/houthis-take-over-yemen-presidential-palace\">toppled</a> the Yemeni government in Sanaa in 2015, sparking a conflict that remains unresolved to date. They have been able to continue in power despite years of Saudi-led coalition air strikes, followed by air attacks since 2023 by the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.</p><p>Mohammed, a Houthi field commander, told Al Jazeera that he does not see a difference between the UAE and Saudi Arabia in Aden.</p><p>“Both are occupiers,” he said. “The good services that they offer to the people are not sustainable, so it is naive to celebrate gifts given by your occupier.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was one of the biggest and most brazen attacks carried out by Baloch separatists, whose claim, however, of killing 84 Pakistani security personnel was dismissed by the authorities.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the provincial capital, Quetta, where the scars of the decades-old conflict could be seen over the city’s police academy, the courts and the bazaars, the official message is once again of unwavering control.</p><p>“Our security forces, personnel and officers have fought bravely,” said Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, framing the BLA attacks as the “last gasp of a cornered enemy”.</p><p>Yet, this narrative of dominance is punctuated by the sobering death toll: more than a dozen security personnel killed and civilian families caught in the crossfire. The power move – of trying to project more power than actually wielding it – feels true for both sides.</p><h2 id=\"terrorism-a-foreign-plot\">‘Terrorism’ a foreign plot</h2><p>Islamabad’s response to separatist attacks, once meticulously framed, is now a routine occurrence. The fighters are cadres of “Fitna-al-Hindustan”, which in Urdu translates to “India’s incitement”, it alleged. New Delhi has not yet responded to the charge.</p><p>The nomenclature of a “foreign hand” is now the cornerstone of Pakistan’s national security narrative, linking every attack to the hand of Islamabad’s historical rival. The complex, locally-rooted Baloch grievances are subsumed into a simpler, catchier, blame-shifting story of foreign subterfuge. It echoes past government statements, which blamed “neighbouring countries” for trying to derail its key economic projects.</p><p>The narrative of blaming the neighbours also positions the Pakistani military not as a party to an internal dispute, but as a defender of Pakistan’s territorial sanctity. But it is more than a narrative.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2020/8/21/jadhav-case-new-delhi-wants-indian-lawyer-to-help-convicted-spy\">Kulbhushan Jadhav</a>, an Indian national arrested and sentenced to death for espionage by a Pakistani court in 2016, is a living exhibit of Pakistan’s case against external interference.</p><p>Pakistan had released a video that appeared to show Jadhav confessing to facilitating attacks in Balochistan. While India denied involvement, Jadhav’s testimony fits the strategic nationalisation of a provincial conflict.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4279274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4279274\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4279274\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260131__94N73G4__v1__HighRes__PakistanUnrestSouthwest-1769936460.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan Balochistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4279274\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Security personnel shift an injured man at a hospital in Quetta [Adnan Ahmed/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"grievances-fuelling-rebellion\">Grievances fuelling rebellion</h2><p>On the ground, the official Pakistani script reads differently.</p><p>In the hushed conversations at Quetta’s tea shops, a different, more intimate story of political marginalisation and economic injustice unfolds, as residents wonder how poverty remains entrenched despite the province’s immense mineral wealth.</p><p>The promise of the $46bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), centred on the port of Gwadar in Balochistan, is viewed by locals not as a boon, but as one that might benefit Beijing and Islamabad, not the Baloch fishermen or shepherds.</p><p>“Sir, are you crazy!” exclaimed a security official at a coal mine in Spin Karez, where Al Jazeera had reached to document the plight of miners dying due to a lack of proper equipment.</p><p>“The insurgents [rebels] come in their hundreds and pick up everything, including [paramilitary] checkpoints. Who said it’s safe for you to be in this area?” he went on.</p><p>Baloch separatists have often raided mines and killed workers from other provinces who came looking for a livelihood. The encounter is one of many incidents in Balochistan as the province feels like the “Wild West” – no rules, no one really in charge.</p><p>This discontent is the oxygen that keeps the separatist movement alive.</p><p>As a security source told Al Jazeera: “A military can neutralise a militant, but it cannot neutralise a grievance. The state sees them as a terrorist network; many here see their sons and brothers who took up arms.”</p><p>The death of 18 civilians in the latest conflict is a tragic footnote that underscores this divide as the rebellion consumes the very people it claims to fight for.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"human-cost-of-conflict\">Human cost of conflict</h2><p>Balochistan is a land of haunting dualities. It is home to Gwadar, the gleaming linchpin of CPEC on the Arabian Sea, and to remote valleys where communication lines are the first casualty during any flare-up. Its porous borders with Iran and Afghanistan provide fighters with strategic depth. For Pakistan, the province is a source of strategic anxiety.</p><p>The human cost of the conflict is reflected in the region’s landscape and memory. As one recalls the raw testimony from a resident after a 2013 attack in Hazara town: “The wounded were lying here and there … we didn’t know who was who.”</p><p>Or the haunting question of a cadet after the 2016 Quetta <a href=\"/news/2016/10/26/pakistan-lej-behind-police-academy-attack-in-quetta\">police academy massacre</a>: “Why were we called back in and told to stay here with no weapons?”</p><p>These statements are indictments of a persistent security failure and eroding social contract. They explain why the official claims of “unity behind security forces” sometimes feel less like a lived reality and more like an aspirational slogan.</p><p>“Everyone here is corrupt” was a startling statement from a former chief minister of Balochistan who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.</p><p>People in Balochistan speak of widespread corruption plaguing the impoverished province, endemic and consuming every sphere of public services. Very little money, in that case, is actually left to provide basic services such as healthcare and education. Security is a luxury many do not even believe in any more.</p><p>The recent military operations in Balochistan demonstrate Pakistan’s formidable capacity for kinetic response. Drones monitor from above, forces patrol in strength, and rebels are cleared from strongholds.</p><p>Yet, like clockwork, the “national action plan” is dusted off and reviewed after every crisis. Vows are made, and the violence eventually returns. Despite multiple “surrender of weapons” ceremonies seen in recent years, the rate of nationalistic propaganda producing more recruits is probably much higher.</p><p>True stability in Balochistan requires a calculus that transcends body counts. It requires recognising that separatism draws from a well of genuine discontent, that development must be seen as inclusion rather than just extraction, and that political dialogue is not appeasement, but necessity.</p><h2 id=\"regional-implications\">Regional implications</h2><p>Balochistan – bigger than Germany in area – is critical in the power play of regional influence, which involves China’s economic ambitions, Iran’s sectarian politics, the United States’ “containment” strategies, India’s enemy-of-my-enemy strategy, and Afghanistan’s alleged role in the province.</p><p>Pakistan’s challenge is to navigate these external currents while finally addressing the internal fissures that make its largest province so perilously vulnerable. The last 48 hours have again challenged the country’s domestic security architecture.</p><p>As it always does, the dust will settle again. Most of the Pakistani establishment and its media will forget Balochistan, again. And armchair analysts will continue with their punditry.</p><p>But whether the dust settles over a landscape moving towards durable peace or if it is just a quiet interlude before the next storm depends on who gets to write the next chapter.</p><p>Balochistan needs political accommodation, economic inclusion, and effective regional diplomacy if, at all, there is a genuine push to change its status from a perpetual flashpoint.</p></div></div></body></html>"
