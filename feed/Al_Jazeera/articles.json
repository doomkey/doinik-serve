In 2022, it received approximately $44bn.</p><p>At the same time, countries on the continent spent almost $90bn servicing external debt in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-progress\">No progress</h2><p>Shortly before the release of the G20’s final communique, 165 charities condemned the group’s slow progress on debt sustainability and urged President Ramaphosa to implement reforms before transferring the G20 presidency over to the US in December.</p><p>“While this year’s G20 has been put forward as an ‘African G20’, there is no evidence that any progress has been made on the debt crisis facing Africa and many other countries worldwide during the South African presidency,” the group said in a letter.</p><p>The missive called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to sell its gold reserves and set up a debt relief fund for distressed governments. It also backed the creation of a ‘<a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/8/why-the-global-south-needs-a-borrowers-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">borrowers club</a>’ to facilitate cooperation among low-income countries.</p><p>The call for a unified debtor body reflects growing frustration with existing frameworks, notably the Paris Club, in which mostly Western governments, but not China, have exerted undue influence over the repayment policies of debtor nations.</p><p>In May 2020, the G20 launched a multibillion-dollar repayment pause to help poor countries cope with the COVID‑19 crisis. Known as the <a href=\"/news/2020/10/12/world-bank-g20-may-agree-to-only-6-month-debt-relief-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debt Service Suspension Initiative</a>, the programme is continuing to provide relief to some participating countries.</p><p>The launch of the Common Framework, soon afterwards, was designed to coordinate debt relief among all creditors. At the time, the initiative was hailed as a breakthrough, bringing together the Paris Club, China and private creditors to help prevent a full-blown debt crisis in developing countries.</p><p>But coordinating equal treatment, including government lenders, commercial banks, and bondholders, has made the process slow and prone to setbacks.</p><p>To date, none of the countries that joined the Common Framework – Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, and Chad – have completed their debt restructuring deals.</p><p>And even then, the programme has relieved just 7 percent of the debt costs for the four participating nations, according to ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.</p><h2 id=\"outmanoeuvred\">‘Outmanoeuvred’</h2><p>In March, South Africa convened an expert panel – headed by a former finance minister and a former Kenyan central banker – to explore how to assist heavily indebted low-income countries, particularly in Africa.</p><p>In a report released earlier this month, the panel echoed many of the ideas put forward by the 165 charities that wrote to Ramaphosa in October, calling for measures like an IMF-backed special debt fund and the formation of a debtors’ club.</p><p>But the experts’ proposals “weren’t even acknowledged at the leaders’ summit”, Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, told Al Jazeera. He said that the G20 presidency “failed to address the scale of the global debt problem”.</p><p>“Ultimately,” Gallagher added, “South Africa was outmanoeuvred by larger, more economically important members of the G20 who saw little benefit to themselves in reforming the international financial architecture on debt.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"double-whammy-of-debt\">‘Double whammy’ of debt</h2><p>In the early 2000s, the IMF, World Bank and some Paris Club creditors cancelled more than $75bn of debt – roughly 40 percent of external obligations – under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.</p><p>Since then, however, many developing countries have slipped back into the red. After the 2008 financial crisis, private creditors poured money into low-income economies, steadily replacing the cheaper loans once offered by institutions like the World Bank.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, almost 40 percent of external public debt repayments from lower-income countries went to commercial lenders. Just one-third went to multilateral institutions, according to <a href=\"https://debtjustice.org.uk/press-release/debt-payments-to-private-lenders-three-times-higher-than-to-china?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Debt Justice</a>, a United Kingdom-based charity.</p><p>China has also emerged as the world’s largest single creditor, especially in the Global South, committing more than $472bn through its policy banks – such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank – between 2008 and 2024.</p><p>“On top of debt becoming more expensive over the past 10 or 15 years, there is now a wider universe of lenders that developing countries have turned to,” says Iolanda Fresnillo, a policy and advocacy manager at Eurodad, a civil society organisation.</p><p>“It’s been a double whammy. Debt is now costlier and harder to resolve,” she said, noting the difficulty of coordinating creditors in a restructuring. Protracted debt crises slow growth by squeezing public investment.</p><p>Overcoming these hurdles is made harder when creditors pursue competing commercial interests. Fresnillo says an independent debt-restructuring body, designed to shorten negotiation times and limit economic costs, could help.</p><p>In September, the head of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan, said, “There is no permanent institution or system that is there all the time dealing with debt restructuring … maybe we can create new momentum.”</p><p>However, talk of an international sovereign debt restructuring mechanism isn’t new. The IMF spearheaded a push for a neutral body – which would be akin to a US bankruptcy court – in the late 1990s.</p><p>The Fund’s proposed restructuring mechanism faced swift pushback. Major creditor countries, particularly the US, opposed ceding power to an international body that could override its legal system and weaken protections for US investors.</p><p>Still, “the need for this type of international solution is obvious”, says Fresnillo. “Having a basic set of rules, as opposed to an ad hoc negotiation for every new debt crisis, should be a bare minimum.”</p><p>She added that “adopting a global standard on <a href=\"/news/2021/10/31/g20-leaders-endorse-global-corporate-minimum-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taxing transnational corporations</a> could also guarantee a baseline of revenues for low-income countries. But with multilateral cooperation so weak right now, I wouldn’t hold my breath.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Monday’s <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/1992999267967905905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a> came after President Donald Trump repeatedly called for criminal charges against Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers involved in the video.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Pentagon chief <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america\">Pete Hegseth</a> said later on Monday that Kelly is facing a probe because he is the only lawmaker in the video who falls under the jurisdiction of military law as a retired Navy captain.</p><p>“As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation – lending the appearance of authority to his words,” Hegseth wrote on X.</p><p>“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”</p><p>The senator was quick to respond with defiance to the Pentagon’s move.</p><p>“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly said in a statement. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”</p><p>The Pentagon had suggested that Kelly is accused of “actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.</p><p></p><p>Last week, Trump described the legislators as traitors and went as far as arguing that they should face <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/punishable-by-death-trump-threatens-democrats-with-sedition-charges\">the death penalty</a> for sedition: in other words, speech that is designed to incite a rebellion.</p><p>Kelly, a former US Navy captain who now represents Arizona in the Senate, was one of six former military and intelligence officers featured in the video, released on November 18.</p><p>“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” they said in the video.</p><p>The Pentagon stressed that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) — which spells out military laws and guidelines — service members have a legal obligation to “obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful”.</p><p>“A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it wrote in Monday’s statement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/us-sells-700m-nasams-missile-system-to-taiwan\">The Pentagon</a> added that Kelly could face recall “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures”.</p><p>Retired military personnel who continue to receive benefits after their service remain subject to military law, according to the UCMJ.</p><p>But it is rare for military courts to prosecute former service members, especially for alleged offences committed after their tenure.</p><p>In recent days, Democrats have expressed outrage over Trump’s response to the lawmakers’ videos, which they say amounts to a death threat.</p><p>Democrats have also argued that the video simply reaffirms a fact of military law: Service members are required to refuse orders they know to be in violation of the US law, as part of their oath to the Constitution.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Charlie Kirk</a> in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.</p><p>Trump first invoked the death penalty on Thursday, sparking a firestorm of criticism. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on social media.</p><p>Despite the outrage, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/trump-again-slams-democrats-who-urged-us-troops-to-refuse-illegal-orders\">Trump doubled down</a> on his stance late on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the legislators who released the video “SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW”.</p><p>The Pentagon’s move on Monday signals that federal agencies, led by Trump appointees, are willing to respond to the president’s political grievances.</p><p>The Department of Justice pursued criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey in now-dismissed cases that critics say were political.</p><p>Comey was charged with lying to Congress, while James was facing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/james-comey-letitia-james-argue-us-attorney-in-their-cases-hired-illegally\">mortgage fraud accusations</a>.</p><p>Later on Monday, the White House expressed support for the Pentagon’s investigation of Kelly. “You can’t have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks. And that’s what these Democrat members were encouraging,” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And it is our position that Lindsey Halligan is extremely qualified for this position — but more importantly was legally appointed to it.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-names-halligan-as-prosecutor\">Trump names Halligan as prosecutor</h2><p>Halligan had been appointed in September to serve as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>Trump had a public falling-out with Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to file charges against James due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>That sparked outrage in the White House. Siebert announced his resignation on September 19, and the following day, Trump took to social media to declare that he had fired the prosecutor himself.</p><p>“He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”</p><p>The president also addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi in the message, saying that the Department of Justice needed to move forward with charges against James, Comey and a US senator, Adam Schiff of California.</p><p>“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote.</p><p>He urged Bondi to act immediately to secure indictments, signalling that Halligan would help.</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”</p><p>Before her appointment, Halligan had no prosecutorial experience, and her background was largely in insurance law. Previously, she served as a personal lawyer to Trump.</p><p>Within days of taking up her role as US attorney, Halligan had secured <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/ex-fbi-director-comey-says-he-is-innocent-after-us-court-indictment\">an indictment against Comey</a> for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a Senate proceeding.</p><p>Then, on October 6, Halligan unveiled a second indictment against James, accusing her of mortgage fraud.</p><p>A third indictment arrived on October 16, this time against Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.</p><p>All three have denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges were acts of political retribution. Comey, James and Bolton have all criticised Trump publicly, and James even successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump in New York state.</p><h2 id=\"comey-james-seek-dismissal\">Comey, James seek dismissal</h2><p>Lawyers for the defendants have explored multiple channels to have the cases dismissed before trial.</p><p>On November 13, Judge Currie heard opening arguments in one petition brought by James and Comey.</p><p>They asserted that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid, since she did not have judicial approval.</p><p>Normally, interim US attorneys may only stay in the position for a span of 120 days. After that period, federal judges in the district may decide who fills the role.</p><p>Siebert had served for a 120-day period and had gotten judicial permission to continue as acting US attorney, until the Senate could confirm a permanent occupant for the role.</p><p>But Halligan did not have the judges’ approval. That made her appointment as US attorney illegal, according to lawyers for Comey and James.</p><p>Lawyers for the Justice Department, however, argued that the issue amounted to a mere “paperwork error” — and that Attorney General Bondi had likewise signed off on the indictments.</p><p>Still, the hearings in Currie’s courtroom raised serious questions about the validity of the indictments.</p><p>Currie raised concerns that the grand jury transcript in Comey’s case was incomplete, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/disturbing-pattern-us-judge-rebukes-missteps-in-james-comey-indictment\">an issue later echoed</a> by Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in a separate ruling on November 17.</p><p>He said the records indicate “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”, including misleading statements from the prosecutor and the use of an unrelated search warrant. He also pointed out that it seemed the final indictment against Comey had never been fully presented to the grand jury, as required.</p><p>In another courtroom last week, overseen by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/justice-department-admits-grand-jury-did-not-review-final-comey-indictment\">Justice Department acknowledged</a> that it had indeed failed to give the grand jury a chance to review the final Comey indictment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Another 236 applications from Myanmar were pending as of November 10.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce immigration into the US.</p><p>It has therefore attempted to rescind Temporary Protected Status for several groups, including citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela and other countries facing instability.</p><p>Just last Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115590786862216464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on his platform Truth Social that he was “hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota”, accusing gangs of Somali nationals of “terrorizing” the state.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Legal experts, however, question whether a president can revoke Temporary Protected Status from a specific group in a specific state. Some have accused Trump of attempting to intimidate immigrants, in order to force them to leave the country.</p><p>Under Trump, the federal government has also restricted <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">its cap on refugee admissions to 7,500</a>, a historic low.</p><p>In addition, the Trump administration has sought to strip hundreds of thousands of immigrants of another temporary protection called “humanitarian parole”. That programme allows immigrants to come into the country on a short-term basis due to emergency situations or humanitarian concerns.</p><p>Several of those efforts face ongoing legal challenges. So far, however, the Supreme Court has largely sided with the Trump administration.</p><p>In an unsigned May 30 <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1079_p86b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a>, for instance, a majority on the high court lifted a lower court’s ruling that had barred the Department of Homeland Security from ending humanitarian parole for nearly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.</p><p>Two left-leaning justices — Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor — issued a dissent, warning that removing the pause would cause great harm to US immigrants while the legal challenge proceeds.</p><p>The decision, Brown Jackson wrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unrest-in-myanmar\">Unrest in Myanmar</h2><p>In the case of Myanmar, the Department of State has issued a level-four travel advisory — the highest tier — warning against transit through the country.</p><p>It cited the risk of “armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions”.</p><p>In February 2021, the military toppled the government of President Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country has grappled with civil war ever since, marking the latest chapter in a nearly eight decades of internal unrest.</p><p>The military leadership is locked in a fight with members of the exiled government as well as armed ethnic groups and civilian opposition groups.</p><p>It has led a campaign of heavy air strikes, some of which reportedly targeted schools and hospitals. Both rebels and soldiers have been accused of human rights abuses, including torture.</p><p>The United Nations estimates the long-running conflict has created nearly 1,585,298 asylum seekers and refugees as of October, with many seeking protection in nearby countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.</p><p>Members of the persecuted Rohingya ethnic group have been rendered stateless amid the fighting.</p><p>Citizens from Myanmar were initially given Temporary Protected Status in the US under former President Joe Biden in May 2021.</p><p>The administration then extended the protection designation twice: once in September 2022 and again in May 2024. The latest 18-month extension was slated to expire on Tuesday, November 25.</p><p>The termination of the Temporary Protected Status will take effect 60 days after the Federal Register notice is officially published.</p><p>In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Noem had deemed conditions in the country sufficiently safe for its citizens to return.</p><p>“Burma [Myanmar] continues to face humanitarian challenges due in part to continued military operations against armed resistance and the need for humanitarian assistance,” the notice said.</p><p>“There have, however, been improvements in Burma’s governance and stability at the national and local levels.”</p><p>The notice added that allowing Myanmar citizens to stay ran “contrary to the U.S. national interest”.</p><p>In March, the Department of Homeland Security told Congress that 9,590 Myanmar citizens were eligible for the protection, but had yet to apply.</p><p>Just this month, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/21-dead-search-continues-after-refugee-boat-sinks-near-malaysia-thailand\">another boat sank off</a> the Myanmar shore, as Rohingya refugees attempted to flee to safety.

And he can reward or punish reporters with access in these cases in the same way he does in granting interviews, Trump’s team argued.</p><p>The AP says that if journalists are invited to cover an event on a pool basis – such as last week when the president had meetings in the Oval Office with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani – the Trump administration cannot discriminate on the basis of a news organisation’s freedom of speech.</p><p>“The First Amendment does not stop at the Oval Office door,” said Charles Tobin, the lawyer representing the AP.</p><p>Since the dispute began, the White House has given Associated Press writers sporadic access to limited-space events at the White House. AP photographers have received much more frequent access. Tobin argued the White House has hurt the AP’s business with its new policy; for years, AP journalists had been virtually always included in these pool events.</p><p>But in its brief supporting its own position, the administration said that “to the extent that the AP built a business model that depended on the assumption that it would maintain this favored-nation status in perpetuity, that is hardly the government’s fault.”</p><p>The AP reports and produces for thousands of news outlets and other organisations around the world.</p><p>Tobin made his argument before three judges who illustrated that the AP faces an uphill battle in this fight, despite the lower court ruling. Two of them, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, are Trump appointees who voted against the AP as part of a separate appellate panel this past spring. And they expressed scepticism Monday about how a rule could be put in place that satisfies the outlet’s concerns.</p><p>“You would eventually need an injunction against the president for this to work, don’t you?” Rao asked him. It’s extremely rare for a judge to issue an injunction against a president; they generally act against people who work for the chief executive.</p><p>“How would we decide what’s a ‘pool’ event and an individual journalist’s event?” Rao asked.</p><p>Yaakov Roth, the principal deputy assistant attorney general arguing for the Trump administration, also wondered about rules put in place limiting a president’s ability to invite people to see him at the White House. “Nobody is going to come up here and say that the president has to invite equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats to the White House Christmas party,” he said.</p><p>Roth was questioned by the third judge on the panel, Robert Wilkins, who asked if the administration could bar a group of citizens from Kansas who had bought tickets to tour the White House if a Trump appointee discovered one of them had posted something on social media critical of the president.</p><p>“Woe to the public,” said Wilkins, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.</p><p>Julie Pace, AP’s executive editor, wrote in an op-ed piece published Monday morning that the question of access is not just about AP; it’s about people’s access to the government that works for them.</p><p>“When we talk about press freedom, we are really talking about your freedom. Reporters ask questions, photographers take pictures, and video journalists record history on your behalf to ensure that you are informed about the things you don’t have the time to unearth, watch or learn about for yourself,” Pace wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Letting the government control which journalists can cover the highest office in the land and setting rules about what those journalists can say or write is a direct attempt to undercut the First Amendment,” Pace wrote. “It should worry all of us.”</p><p>The Trump administration says it is up to the White House, not the press, to make decisions about access to areas where space is limited. The White House Correspondents’ Association had been deciding who is in the press pools since the 1953-61 administration of President Dwight Eisenhower. The White House reset that tradition in February, saying it wanted to broaden access to include other news outlets.</p><p>“If the AP means to suggest that the White House lacks authority to limit who may engage in news gathering activities from sensitive areas of the White House, it is legally mistaken,” the administration said in its supporting brief.</p><p>A lower court ruled this spring that the government couldn’t retaliate against a news organisation for its speech, but the appeals court halted any response to the ruling until an appeal takes place.</p><p>AP style also recommends acknowledging Trump’s renaming of the Gulf. The president said that AP’s access would remain restricted until it changed its style.</p><p>Nearly four dozen press organisations, and news outlets from ProPublica to Fox News Channel, along with The New York Times and The Washington Post, filed a brief in support of the AP.</p><p>“When any news outlet is chilled … the press and the public as a whole lose out, no matter how many reporters or cameras remain in the room,” the outlets said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Voting remains open until 8pm local time (23:00 GMT). A fifth member, Luiz Fux, has moved to a different panel, so his seat remains vacant.</p><p>In explaining Monday’s decision, de Moraes accused Bolsonaro of making “repeated” attempts to violate court orders and explained that the former president is a flight risk.</p><p>Bolsonaro has shown “patent disrespect for the justice system”, de Moraes said.</p><p>“There is no doubt, therefore, about the need to convert house arrest into pre-trial detention, due to the need to guarantee public order, ensure the application of criminal law and prevent disrespect for the precautionary measures already applied.”</p><p>Justice Dino also cited the possibility that Bolsonaro might flee the country to evade justice.</p><p>“The admitted breach of electronic monitoring not only increases the risk of escape but also indicates a blatant violation of the precautionary measures imposed by the Judiciary,” Dino wrote.</p><p>In September, the far-right Bolsonaro had been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison for attempting to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, which he lost.</p><p>He was found guilty on five counts. They included attempting a coup, participating in an armed criminal organisation, seeking the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, participating in damage qualified by violence, and the deterioration of listed heritage.</p><p>The same panel that voted for Bolsonaro’s conviction reconvened on Monday to determine whether he should stay in custody.</p><p>Only one of the panel’s five original justices, Fux, had voted against Bolsonaro’s conviction in September. Fux no longer remains on the panel, however.</p><p>Bolsonaro has denied seeking to foment a coup and has maintained his innocence. His defence team has framed the proceedings as an attempt to dampen his political popularity.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro, has called the case a “witch hunt” and has sought to intervene on the former president’s behalf, imposing steep tariffs on Brazil and sanctioning Justice de Moraes.</p><p>Previously, Bolsonaro had been held under house arrest at his residence in Brasilia, while his defence team sought to appeal.</p><p>In early November, the Supreme Court panel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/brazil-supreme-court-panel-rejects-bolsonaros-prison-sentence\">rejected</a> Bolsonaro’s attempt to throw out his sentence.

The ex-president told the assistant judge he believed a change in medication might have brought on the symptoms.</p><p><span>Federal police have indicated that Bolsonaro may have considered fleeing the country in the past, given his mounting legal troubles.</span></p><p>In August, the police issued a report that documented some of Bolsonaro’s attempts. Officials, for instance, said they seized a 33-page letter addressed to the government of Argentinian President Javier Milei, a fellow right-wing leader, petitioning for asylum.</p><p>In the letter, dated February 2024, Bolsonaro explains that he has been “persecuted for reasons and crimes that are essentially political”.</p><p>Around the same time as the letter, Bolsonaro <span>spent a couple of nights in the Hungarian embassy in Brasilia, raising further questions about whether he might be seeking diplomatic sanctuary.</span></p><p>One of Bolsonaro’s sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, currently <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/eduardo-bolsonaro-son-of-brazils-ex-president-to-face-obstruction-charge\">faces trial for obstruction</a>, based on the allegation that he petitioned the Trump administration to illegally interfere in his father’s case.</p><p>Bolsonaro is currently being held in a federal police facility in Brasilia.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>When on November 19 Texas Governor Greg Abbott called for an official investigation into so-called “Sharia courts”, it was not based on evidence, complaints, or any legal irregularity. It was a political performance. There are no Sharia courts in Texas — only voluntary Muslim mediation panels operating under the same framework used by Jewish beth din courts and Christian arbitration services.</p><p>Yet in a letter sent to district attorneys and sheriffs demanding an investigation, Abbott wrote that “The Constitution’s religious protections provide no authority for religious courts to skirt state and federal laws simply by donning robes and pronouncing positions inconsistent with western civilization,” implying that Muslims were secretly building an alternative legal system.</p><p>This is not law enforcement. It is political theatre designed to stoke fear.</p><p>A day earlier, on November 18, Abbott issued an executive order designating the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) — the largest Muslim civil rights organisation in the country — as a “foreign terrorist organisation” (FTO).</p><p>The order cited no crimes, no violence, no plot, no prosecutorial record. It was simply a sweeping claim that an American civil rights group constituted a national security threat.</p><p>Lawyers immediately noted that Abbott does not have the authority to designate FTOs; only the US federal government does. But again, the point was not legal accuracy.</p><p>This ineffectual order was more about political messaging than anything else. It was aimed to portray Muslim Americans and their institutions as suspect and their civic engagement as a security risk.</p><p>Abbott’s actions are the latest product of a long-running American panic machine that transforms ordinary Muslim life into a threat narrative. This panic machine has been in operation for decades and has repeatedly weaponised Sharia for political gain.</p><p>For example, in the late 2000s, a coordinated national campaign—spearheaded by activists like David Yerushalmi and organisations such as ACT for America—pushed legislators across the country to introduce “anti-Sharia” bills. In the early 2010s, more than 40 states considered laws barring courts from applying “foreign law”, a euphemism universally understood to mean Islamic law.</p><p>The most extreme example occurred in the US state of Oklahoma, where voters approved a constitutional amendment explicitly banning Sharia and the application of international law. When the law was challenged in court, a federal judge blocked it.</p><p>This and other legal challenges exposed these measures for what they were: political stunts, not responses to real legal problems. Yet the broader campaign succeeded in normalising the idea that Muslim religious practice itself is a national security threat, paving the way for later escalations, including Abbott’s actions in Texas today.</p><p>Months before the call to investigate “Sharia courts”, again in Texas, a Muslim-led real estate project was targeted with a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and branded online as a “Sharia colony”. Local residents were told that Islamic law would govern the neighbourhood, that non-Muslims would be excluded, and that the development was part of a creeping Islamic takeover. None of the rumours were true: the project was open to everyone and sought only to address the region’s housing crisis.</p><p>The DOJ ended its investigation after finding no illegality in June, but in September, Governor Abbott signed a law  banning “Sharia compounds” in Texas.</p><p>This dynamic has played out far beyond Texas. In the state of Tennessee, opponents of a mosque in Murfreesboro argued that Islam was not a religion and that Muslims were therefore undeserving of First Amendment protection. The argument defied centuries of constitutional doctrine, but that didn’t matter; the point was to make Muslim religious life appear legally illegitimate.</p><p>In Dearborn, Michigan, a city with one of the country’s oldest Arab and Muslim communities, viral hoaxes have repeatedly claimed the city has been “taken over by Sharia law”. Fabricated videos, manipulated headlines, and images from other countries have been circulated to create the illusion of Islamic governance on American soil. Fact-checks have debunked these narratives, yet the rumours have persisted.</p><p>Muslim public figures have also been targeted. During his campaign, New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced racist memes and conspiracy theories claiming he was plotting to usher in “Sharia rule” if elected. None of Mamdani’s policy proposals have any religious content whatsoever. His agenda focuses on mass transit, housing, and police accountability. But to those invested in Sharia panic, a Muslim in public office is always presumed to be a Trojan horse.</p><p>And it is not just Republicans who have fanned these flames. Major newspapers, liberal politicians, and even civil liberties institutions have repeatedly adopted the underlying framing that Islamic law is inherently foreign, inherently political, or inherently at odds with American values. By accepting the premise that Sharia is a threat, they effectively validate the narrative architecture of Islamophobia even when they claim to oppose it.</p><p>These incidents reveal a consistent pattern: the panic surrounding Sharia is not about law, safety, or constitutional principle. It is about boundary maintenance in a country struggling with demographic change. It is about who gets to be seen as American and who remains permanently suspect. The panic keeps reemerging not because it reflects valid concerns, but because it is useful — an instrument for mobilising voters, policing civic belonging, and justifying state surveillance.</p><p>What makes this all the more ironic is that Sharia, as understood by Islamic scholars across centuries, bears little resemblance to the caricatures that animate US politics. In Arabic, Sharia means “a path to the water”, a metaphor for moral and spiritual nourishment.</p><p>It is a broad ethical framework concerned with justice, welfare, and accountability. Its foundational aims — the maqāṣid al-sharīʿa — revolve around protecting life, intellect, faith, property, and human dignity. The tradition contains sophisticated doctrines of equity (istiḥsān), public interest (maṣlaḥa), and custom (ʿurf), which operate much like the equitable and contextual tools of modern common law systems.</p><p>Far from being an alien code, Sharia shares deep structural resonances with Western legal traditions. As Professor John Makdisi demonstrated in a landmark <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/nclr/vol77/iss5/2/\">North Carolina Law Review</a> article, several foundational features of English common law bear striking parallels to Islamic legal institutions, likely transmitted through Norman Sicily. This history matters not because it collapses distinctions between legal systems, but because it exposes the absurdity of the idea that Islamic law is inherently incompatible with Western governance.</p><p>The United States once understood that legacy. When the Supreme Court chamber was unveiled in 1935, it featured a marble frieze depicting humanity’s greatest lawgivers, including Prophet Muhammad, shown holding a Quran as a symbol of justice and moral authority. Today, acknowledging that simple historical fact would itself trigger outrage.</p><p>The renewed Sharia panic is not about Islam entering American courts; it is about Islam entering American civic life. It is about Muslim political participation, Muslim community development, Muslim institutions, and Muslim representation — all recast as existential threats. As the country enters another election cycle animated by anti-diversity rhetoric, anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, and attacks on Middle East studies programmes, Sharia becomes a flexible container for a much older anxiety: the fear of a pluralistic America.</p><p>The danger is not Sharia. The danger is the political machinery that turns ordinary Muslim Americans into objects of suspicion, targets of state power, and props in a culture war they did not choose. If there is anything Americans should fear, it is not Islamic law, but the weaponisation of fear.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
