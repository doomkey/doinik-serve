His condition was already critical.”</p><p>Medical staff at the Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis were shocked by the infant’s deteriorated state.

His tests showed no illness. His tiny body simply couldn’t withstand the extreme cold inside the tents,” Eman says, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>On Tuesday, Gaza’s Ministry of Health announced the death of an infant due to a severe drop in body temperature caused by extreme cold amid harsh living conditions brought on by the recent weather.</p><p>In a press statement, the ministry said that infant Mohammed Khalil Abu al-Khair, two weeks old, had died from acute hypothermia.</p><p>“The child, Abu al-Khair, arrived at the hospital two days ago and was admitted to the intensive care unit, but he passed away yesterday,” the statement said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181466\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181466\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181466\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A3755-1766042121.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Baby Mohammed freezes to death as Gaza battles winter and displacement\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Medical report of baby Mohammed, describing his deteriorating condition upon hospital admission two days before his death [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>With Mohammed’s death, the number of children who have died from the cold weather in Gaza has risen to four this month, after the ministry announced three similar deaths during the previous week.</p><h2 id=\"celebration-turned-to-devastation\">Celebration turned to devastation</h2><p>The Abu al-Khair family had welcomed the birth of Mohammed on December 1 in an atmosphere of joy and celebration after a gruelling pregnancy that, as ِِEman describes, was filled with hardship, with the war still ongoing.</p><p>“My pregnancy was extremely difficult. We went through very hard conditions and famine, and I was exhausted,” she says.</p><p>“But all my suffering faded when Mohammed was born healthy and well. I never imagined we would lose him after just two weeks.”</p><p>Eman recounts her desperate attempts to keep her newborn warm using every piece of clothing and the blankets she had, while the baby’s father, Khalil, tried to secure the tent and seal every opening to protect the baby from the cold.</p><p>But all their efforts were in vain.</p><p>“We’re living in tents on the street, as you can see. What can a piece of cloth or nylon really do?” she says, pointing around the tent.</p><p>“The cold is indescribable. Every morning, we wake up to find water flooding our bedding from underneath.”</p><p>Baby Mohammed was Eman and Khalil’s second child, after their two-year-old daughter, Mona, who had grown up during the war, which began in October 2023.</p><p>“When we returned from the burial, little Mona came to me asking, ‘Where is the baby?’ Every moment she asks where her little brother went, and her question kills me,” Eman says as she holds her daughter and cries.</p><p>Eman wonders what crime her baby, and other children his age, have committed to deserve what she describes as the “cruel” fate of a life of misery inside tents.</p><p>“Our children have died in every possible way: bombing, snipers, hunger, cold, one after another. My child is not the first, and he will not be the last.”</p><h2 id=\"not-a-life\">‘Not a life’</h2><p>Munir al-Bursh, the director general of Gaza’s Ministry of Health, has warned of further deaths among children, the elderly and the sick due to plummeting temperatures inside rain-soaked displacement tents.</p><p>Al-Bursh said that moisture and standing water inside tents create an environment ripe for the spread of respiratory diseases among displaced people, while patients are unable to access any form of healthcare.</p><p>Despite the start of a ceasefire in October, little reconstruction has taken place in Gaza, where the majority of residential buildings have been destroyed by Israeli bombing and systematic demolition.</p><p>Israel has also continued to attack Gaza on a regular basis and shows little sign that it is willing to allow real reconstruction to begin, at least in the near term.</p><p>That means that the conditions that led to Mohammed’s death are likely to continue.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A3950-1766042152.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Baby Mohammed freezes to death as Gaza battles winter and displacement\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The family lives in a tent made of fabric and nylon in Khan Younis’ camps after their displacement a year ago and the destruction of their home [Abdelhakim Abu Riash, Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>And the tragic loss of her baby has left Eman obsessed with fear for the life of her two-year-old daughter.</p><p>“I over-warm her, cover her with everything I have, and I never sleep.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In a 19-minute <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/17/live-trump-to-highlight-achievements-amid-venezuela-economic-tensions\">address to the nation</a> on Wednesday night, United States President Donald Trump made no major announcements, as presidents are usually wont to do. Instead, he took the opportunity to further denigrate immigrants, highlight his perceived personal achievements and make grandiose promises of prosperity to come.</p><p>“Our nation is strong. America is respected, and our country is back stronger than ever before. We’re poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen,” he said.</p><p>Members of the Democratic Party were quick to capitalise on Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/trumps-approval-rating-drops-to-39-amid-economic-concerns-us-poll\">flagging approval ratings</a> and popular concerns about <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">affordability</a>.</p><p>“Quickly lost track of how many lies Trump shouted out tonight, but the main takeaway is that he has clearly lost touch with reality. Delusional,” Senator Chris Van Hollen said. “The most honest thing he said was, ‘No one can believe what’s going on.’”</p><p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential future presidential contender who frequently needles Trump in his social media posts, mocked him for giving a speech focused on “Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me”.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from his address:</p><h2 id=\"he-blamed-immigrants-for-the-us-s-problems\">He blamed immigrants for the US’s problems</h2><p>The US president took aim at immigrants, blaming them for the housing crisis and economic problems.</p><p>“Illegal aliens stole American jobs and flooded emergency rooms getting free healthcare and education paid for by you – the American taxpayer,” Trump said.</p><p>“They also increased the cost of law enforcement by numbers so high that they are not even to be mentioned.”</p><p>The US president, who recently called the Somali community “garbage” in a racist tirade, falsely claimed that Somalis “took over the economics” of the state of Minnesota and stole “billions and billions of dollars”.</p><p>Repeated studies have shown that immigrants contribute more to the economy than they take from it, and provide labour in vital sectors, including agriculture and construction. In the US as well, immigrant labour, including by undocumented workers, has long propped up the <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/18/ripple-effect-in-us-anti-immigrant-policy-strains-child-and-eldercare\">childcare, home care and elder care industries</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-promised-an-economic-boom-in-2026\">He promised an ‘economic boom’ in 2026</h2><p>Recent polling has shown that Americans are increasingly concerned about the cost of living and Trump’s handling of the economy.</p><p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released on Wednesday found that just 36 percent approve of Trump’s economic record, and 45 percent say that prices are their primary issue when it comes to economic concerns. More than half said they believed the country was already in a recession.</p><p>The president tackled this head-on with assurances that his policies are working and the economy is on track to experience a boom.</p><p>He added that the next chief of the Federal Reserve will agree to bring down interest rates “by a lot”. Current chair Jerome Powell’s term comes to an end in May 2026 and Trump is expected to announce a successor soon. This year, he has pressured the US central bank to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/trump-threatens-major-lawsuit-against-federal-reserve-chief-jerome-powell\">reduce interest rates</a>, and even suggested he could fire Powell over the issue.</p><p>He did address the issue of rising medical costs, which Democrats say will soar when key healthcare subsidies for people on low incomes expire at the end of this year. To counter this, Trump pointed to his efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs through a series of agreements he has made with pharmaceutical companies to sell drugs direct to consumers on his new website, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/3/what-is-trumps-new-trumprx-website-and-will-it-bring-medicine-prices-down\">TrumpRx</a>.</p><p>“There has never been anything like this in the history of our country,” he said. “Drugs have only gone up, but now they’ll be going down by numbers never conceived possible,” Trump said, stating that new price reductions would become available in January and “greatly reduce the costs of healthcare”.</p><p>But he stayed away from some other key concerns among voters – namely, energy and grocery prices, something he pledged to get under control, having slammed the Joe Biden administration for soaring inflation. He has yet to do so.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said: “He was arguing that since he’s taken office, many things, including the main concern for most Americans, which is the affordability of energy as well as food prices, have turned around.</p><p>“But if you’ll notice, as the US president was talking, he didn’t mention anything about energy prices, which are still relatively high for most consumers.</p><p>“And when it comes to the affordability of groceries and food items, going out to restaurants, these are still very high for most Americans, and that has a lot to do with the president’s tariffs, which he says are bringing an enormous amount of revenue into the country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-claims-he-brought-peace-to-the-middle-east\">He claims he brought peace to the Middle East</h2><p>The US president claimed: “I’ve restored American strength, settled eight wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing peace for the first time in 3,000 years, and secured the release of the hostages, both living and dead here at home,” Trump said.</p><p>Observers <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/nobel-peace-prize-2025-what-are-trumps-credentials-and-can-he-win\">dispute</a> that Trump has ended eight wars or brought peace to the Middle East. In particular, the US actively took part in the military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during hostilities between Iran and Israel in June, which ended with a ceasefire mediated by both the US and Qatar.</p><p>He also announced the end of hostilities between Pakistan and India in May after four days of fighting. But while Pakistan credits the US president for helping to halt the fighting, <a href=\"/video/the-bottom-line/2025/9/7/how-did-india-us-relations-decline-so-suddenly\">India insists he had no role</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel was founded in 1948 – rather than 3,000 years ago – and has continued to carry out daily strikes on the Gaza Strip – and to prevent aid from entering – <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/24/no-there-is-no-ceasefire-in-gaza\">despite the ceasefire in place</a>.</p><p>Palestinians, rights groups and some analysts have said a ceasefire exists in name only as Israel violates it almost daily.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-announced-a-warrior-dividend-for-us-troops\">He announced a ‘warrior dividend’ for US troops</h2><p>Trump said 1.45 million United States military service members will soon receive bonus cheques for $1,776 each, paid from revenues raised from trade tariffs imposed on other countries by Trump this year.</p><p>“Think of this: 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call ‘Warrior Dividend’ before Christmas,” Trump said in his televised address, adding that the specific amount was in honour of the year the US was founded.</p><h2 id=\"he-did-not-mention-venezuela-tensions\">He did not mention Venezuela tensions</h2><p>Some observers had speculated that Trump might take the opportunity to make a dramatic announcement about military action against Venezuela during his address – or make a case for military action in the future.</p><p>But despite the fact that he has imposed an oil blockade on Venezuela and amassed the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast\">largest military force</a> in the region in decades, close to the coast of the country, he did not mention the rising tensions between the US and Venezuela.</p><p>Instead, he made just a passing mention of the military strikes carried out on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which the Trump administration claims are trafficking drugs, despite providing no evidence of this, and which have killed about 90 people.</p><p>Legal experts say the targeting of vessels in international waters in the Caribbean and Pacific <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">likely violates</a> US and international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.</p><p>Trump said the US has “decimated the bloodthirsty foreign drug cartels”. He has previously claimed that each strike on a boat “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/does-each-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-save-25000-us-lives\">saves 25,000 American lives</a>” by preventing drugs from reaching the US. However, experts say this is doubtful as there is <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">little evidence</a> that Venezuela is a major source of drugs trafficked to the US.</p><p>This week, he signed <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-signs-executive-order-labeling-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction\">an executive order</a> declaring the potent opiate drug, fentanyl, which he says is one of those being trafficked, a “weapon of mass destruction”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But officials say that scheme has been shelved as it requires unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 leaders, and Russia-friendly Hungary has ruled it out.</p><p>Meanwhile, US efforts to forge a deal to end the war are set to continue, with officials set to meet Russian negotiators in Miami this weekend to discuss Trump’s peace plan, according to a White House official quoted by the AFP news agency.</p><p>Large differences remain all around.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"235\" data-end=\"673\">For more than a decade, the Arab Spring has been widely dismissed as a failure, often portrayed as a brief eruption of idealism that collapsed into repression, war and authoritarian restoration. Tunisia’s uprising, which started on December 17, 2010, with the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in Sidi Bouzid, is often remembered in this register: as a tragic prelude to dashed hopes rather than a transformative political moment.</p><p data-start=\"675\" data-end=\"736\">This reading is incomplete and, in important ways, misleading.</p><p data-start=\"738\" data-end=\"1189\">Bouazizi’s act was not merely a reaction to police brutality, corruption or economic exclusion, although all three were real. It was a moral rupture that shattered the quiet normalisation of humiliation and laid bare the ethical foundations of authoritarian rule. What followed in Tunisia, and soon across much of the Arab world, was not simply protest, but an awakening: a collective realisation about dignity, belonging and the limits of obedience.</p><p data-start=\"1191\" data-end=\"1630\">The Arab Spring should therefore be understood less as a failed transition than as a lasting transformation of political consciousness. Its most consequential effects were not institutional but experiential, reshaping how people understood citizenship, legitimacy and their own capacity to act. Even where regimes survived or reasserted control, that shift did not disappear. It altered the terrain on which power is contested to this day.</p><p data-start=\"1632\" data-end=\"2086\">For this reason, the uprisings cannot be understood as isolated national revolts. From Tunis to Cairo, Sanaa to Benghazi, different societies moved in parallel, shaped by distinct histories but animated by a shared emotional and political grammar. Protesters were not only demanding material change; they were asserting themselves as political subjects, rejecting the idea that power could indefinitely deny them visibility, voice and equal citizenship.</p><p data-start=\"2088\" data-end=\"2455\">The uprisings were enactments of this shift. They redefined what legitimacy meant and who could claim it. In occupying public space, people were not merely opposing regimes but rehearsing alternative ways of living together. The Arab Spring was less a programme than a practice, shaped through action rather than design: a lived reimagining of political possibility.</p><p data-start=\"2457\" data-end=\"2930\">One of its most consequential dimensions was the transformation of streets and squares into sites of collective learning. Places long monopolised by the state’s coercive and symbolic power were reclaimed as arenas of participation and mutual recognition. In Cairo’s Tahrir Square, Tunis’s Bourguiba Avenue and Sanaa’s Change Square, common citizens organised security, cleaned streets, debated demands and negotiated differences. Public space became a school of politics.</p><p data-start=\"2932\" data-end=\"3366\">These moments mattered for a simple reason: they showed that democracy is not only a constitutional arrangement but a social practice learned through action. Protesters did not simply demand rights; they enacted responsibility. Even when these spaces were later cleared or violently reclaimed, the experience of inhabiting them left a lasting imprint. Once people have lived democracy, however briefly, they carry its memory forward.</p><p data-start=\"3368\" data-end=\"3884\">The Arab uprisings also revealed why cities matter. Revolts are often ignited in peripheral and marginal spaces, with Sidi Bouzid being the most powerful example, but they are sustained or defeated in urban centres. This is not a claim about virtue but about structure. Cities concentrate institutions, social networks and historical memory. They bring people into direct confrontation with the machinery of power, including ministries, courts and security services, and make authority tangible rather than abstract.</p><p data-start=\"3886\" data-end=\"4238\">Urban life fosters dense repertoires of sociability: trust, cooperation, debate and solidarity forged in markets, neighbourhoods, mosques and universities. These networks enable collective action to persist beyond the initial moment of rupture. Without them, uprisings risk remaining episodic. With them, they acquire durability, even under repression.</p><p data-start=\"4240\" data-end=\"4534\">Repression, of course, came swiftly and brutally. The exhilaration of those early months was followed by counter-revolution, militarisation and war. In many Arab cities, regimes responded by reasserting control over bodies, spaces and memory. It would be dishonest to romanticise what followed.</p><p data-start=\"4536\" data-end=\"4935\">Yet repression did not erase the symbolic struggle unleashed in 2011. Across the region, protesters targeted not only rulers but the imagery and rituals that sustained authoritarian power. Portraits were torn down, slogans scrawled over symbols of dominance, and statues defaced. These acts were not theatrical excesses. They were attempts to dismantle the emotional architecture of fear and submission.</p><p data-start=\"4937\" data-end=\"5260\">Such moments leave traces even when they are followed by defeat. The experience of collective transgression, of crossing lines once deemed inviolable, alters how authority is seen and felt. People learn that power can be confronted, mocked and undone, even if temporarily. That knowledge does not disappear with repression.</p><p data-start=\"5262\" data-end=\"5596\">This is why the Arab Spring is not dead, despite sustained efforts to portray it as a historical error or a cautionary tale. What survived was not a set of institutions but a pedagogy of liberty. Learned through action and reflection in public space, this pedagogy reshaped how people understood agency, responsibility and resistance.</p><p data-start=\"5598\" data-end=\"6035\">Its effects are visible today in quieter, more fragmented struggles. Across the region, younger generations mobilise around social justice, environmental degradation and public accountability. They may not invoke 2011, but they operate with an inherited refusal of fatalism. A graffiti in Hay Ettadhamen, a marginalised suburb of Tunis, captures this enduring scepticism: “Is Tunisia a republic, a monarchy, an animal farm, or a prison?”</p><p data-start=\"6037\" data-end=\"6393\">The Arab Spring’s most enduring contribution lies here. It demonstrated that even acts originating in marginal spaces can reshape collective imagination and expand the horizon of the possible. Bouazizi’s defiance did not produce instant democracy. But it ignited a critical consciousness that continues to animate struggles against injustice and exclusion.</p><p data-start=\"6395\" data-end=\"6458\">The uprisings did not fail. They changed form, but not meaning.</p><p data-start=\"6395\" data-end=\"6458\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

What followed was not simply a regional revolt, but a historic demand for dignity, accountability, and democratic rule.</p><p>Predictably, regimes responded with <a href=\"/features/2011/2/21/gaddafi-hits-with-deadly-force\">heavy-handed</a> tactics – numerous demonstrators were killed, beaten, or arrested.</p><p>But the pro-democracy movement achieved significant early successes.</p><p>Within months, four longstanding dictators – Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, and Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh – were all toppled.</p><p>In a handful of countries – Bahrain, Algeria, and Iraq among them – regimes successfully quelled protests, ending them before they could gain serious momentum.</p><p>Protest movements in other countries resulted in limited reforms or, in the case of Syria, prolonged civil war without immediate regime change.</p><p>Like Syria, Libya and Yemen ultimately descended into violent conflict.</p><p>Egypt and Tunisia were the only Arab Spring countries that could point to significant longer-term successes – both countries quickly toppled their dictators and almost immediately began democratic transitions.</p><p>Despite mixed results, observers generally praised the Arab Spring as a revolutionary democratic moment for a region long mired in tyranny. Yet, 15 years on, it is clear that while popular demands for democracy endured, authoritarian regimes have learned how to ensure such uprisings would never succeed again.</p><h2 id=\"the-cases-of-egypt-and-tunisia\">The cases of Egypt and Tunisia</h2><p>In both Egypt and Tunisia, democratic transitions appeared initially to take hold: Constituent assemblies were formed, new constitutions were drafted, new political parties and media outlets were established, and new political leaders were elected.</p><p>Importantly, in both countries, parties formed by the Muslim Brotherhood – which has long been well-organised in much of the region – quickly gained influence.</p><p>Some observers viewed the political rise and influence of centrist Islamists as something benign, even positive, while others argued it posed a problem.</p><p>Arguments about the potential merits or shortcomings of political Islam aside, both Egypt and Tunisia were initially seen as hopeful models of Arab democratic transformation, precisely because they suggested that authoritarianism was not an Arab inevitability.</p><p>Although their transitions were fraught with serious challenges and sometimes full-on crises, both countries showed that modern Arab societies were capable of building democratic systems, even if imperfect and fragile.</p><p>More importantly, perhaps, the examples of Egypt and Tunisia showed that Arab citizenries were democratically eager – election turnout figures in both countries were comparable to those of some established Western democracies.</p><p>But appearances and voter turnout numbers were at least partly deceiving, particularly in the case of Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party and its representatives came out victorious in referendums and elections, including the presidency, but never truly held power.</p><p>Egypt’s “<a href=\"/opinions/2012/1/25/egypt-the-revolution-that-shame-built\">deep state</a>” – the military, police, intelligence agencies, judiciary and media apparatus – never fully exited the political scene.</p><p>The old regime successfully sabotaged a pair of elected parliaments and then, in the summer of 2013, collaborated with anti-Islamist Egyptian liberals to overthrow Egypt’s first-ever democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi.</p><p>The 2013 Egyptian <a href=\"/features/2018/7/2/egyptian-society-being-crushed-five-years-after-military-coup\">coup</a> represented a complete democratic reversal, a return to the pre-2011 status quo, and arguably something even more tyrannical.</p><p>Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who had served as Morsi’s defence minister, quickly consolidated power. He <a href=\"/opinions/2016/1/24/another-arab-spring-is-coming-to-egypt\">oversaw</a> mass killings, mass arrests, political party bans, media closures, sham elections, and the eventual overhaul of Egypt’s legal and political frameworks.</p><p>Experts have argued cogently that the authoritarian system el-Sisi has created is even more despotic than Mubarak’s.</p><p>Tunisia’s flirtation with democracy lasted longer than Egypt’s but ultimately experienced a similar backslide.</p><p>In 2014, Tunisia prepared a new constitution and elected its first democratic president, Beji Caid Essebsi.</p><p>But the 2019 election of a new president, Kais Saied, marked the beginning of the end of Tunisia’s democratic experiment.</p><p>In July 2021, about two years after taking office, Saied overthrew Tunisia’s nascent democracy, claiming emergency powers, dismissing the prime minister, and suspending parliament.</p><p>Since that time, Saied has further consolidated power.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons learned</h2><p>It is clear that the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes learned at least one thing from the 2010-2011 pro-democracy protest movements: Their dictatorships had not been sufficiently authoritarian.</p><p>In both nations, the political and legal frameworks have been carefully reengineered to prevent exactly the kind of civil disobedience witnessed 15 years ago.</p><p>Not even the slightest protest or opposition is to be tolerated.</p><p>In Egypt, for example, a 2013 protest law prohibits public demonstrations; and a 2015 terrorism law considers any act of “intimidation” which “harms national unity”, “disturbs the public order”, or “impedes public authorities … from carrying out their work” to be an act of “terrorism”.</p><p>The post-2013 Egyptian military regime has also demonstrated that it will not leave any elections to chance.</p><p>The government has orchestrated <a href=\"/opinions/2018/3/24/is-egypts-sham-election-made-in-the-usa\">sham</a> elections, passed an electoral <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/27/egypts-all-important-parliamentary-elections-arent-elections-at-all\">law</a> that guarantees the parliament’s fealty to the president, and revised the constitution to extend el-Sisi’s rule to 2030.</p><p>Where cracks have allowed opposition figures to run for president, el-Sisi has used his grip on power to have them arrested or forced into permanent exile.</p><p>Experts have noted how closely Tunisia’s Saied has followed in el-Sisi’s footsteps.</p><p>Although he hasn’t established el-Sisi-level repression in Tunisia, Saied has, like his Egyptian counterpart, rewritten the constitution, expanded presidential powers and eliminated checks and balances.</p><p>Data gathered by the Bertelsmann Transformation Index show that, on numerous political and economic indicators, Tunisia has regressed to pre-Arab Spring levels.</p><h2 id=\"cracks-in-the-system\">Cracks in the system</h2><p>Fifteen years after the Arab Spring, the root problems that led to demonstrations – corruption, injustice, and economic hardship – still exist and are perhaps more pressing now than they were back then.</p><p>Arab countries overwhelmingly score poorly on the annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), with many placed near the bottom of the world rankings, and states also remain mired in injustice.</p><p>For example, out of 21 Arab countries recently evaluated by Freedom House, none were rated “free”; and of the nine Arab nations assessed in 2025 as part of the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, most placed near the bottom of global rankings.</p><p>Importantly, as a whole – Gulf countries notwithstanding – the Arab region continues to be mired in economic hardship.</p><p>According to the World Bank, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) remains exceedingly low in most non-Gulf states, and the United Nations says food shortages and hunger remain significant problems across much of the region.</p><p>Economic problems in Egypt and Tunisia are indicative of conditions in much of the rest of the region.</p><p>In Egypt, since the 2011 uprising, both the military’s economic empire and the inequality gap have grown, while inflation and poverty have increased.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tunisian economy is also backsliding.</p><p>According to a recent report published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Saied’s economic approach has led to a huge increase in internal debt and a “collapse of [economic] growth”, in addition to “reduced real wages and increased unemployment”.</p><h2 id=\"democracy-the-elephant-in-the-room\">Democracy: The elephant in the room</h2><p>What is perhaps most alarming for Arab regimes is that their citizenries continue to overwhelmingly desire democratic government.</p><p>According to the Arab Opinion Index, more than 70 percent of Arab respondents support democracy, compared with only 19 percent who do not.</p><p>Survey results also suggest that Arab citizens provide negative assessments of democracy levels in their countries;

This is reflected in vocabulary, science, technology and civilisation,” he tells Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"an-alphabet-with-many-forms\">An alphabet with many forms</h2><p>Arabic uses an alphabet of 28 letters and is written from right to left. The script is cursive, and its letters change shape depending on their position in a word. Short vowels are typically omitted in everyday writing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179362\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179362\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-The-Arabic-alphabet-Arabic-Language-day-1765976624.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - The Arabic alphabet - Arabic Language day-1765976624\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>These features, together with Arabic’s extensive vocabulary, have contributed to the perception that the language is difficult for non-native speakers to learn.</p><p>However, Al Hamad says this perception is far from accurate for many people.</p><p>“One of the biggest misconceptions about Arabic is that it is among the most difficult languages in the world,” he said. “In reality, it is simply a language with systems that differ from English or from many European languages.”</p><p>He added that while the Arabic script may appear unfamiliar to some learners, it is “quite familiar” to speakers of other languages, such as Urdu and Farsi. Speakers of those languages, Al Hamad says, often find Arabic easier to read while Turkish speakers may find its vocabulary easier to memorise due to the thousands of Arabic words Turkish has absorbed.</p><h2 id=\"from-a-for-algebra-to-t-for-tariffs\">From A for algebra to T for tariffs</h2><p>One of the biggest contributions the Arabic language has made to the world is in the fields of mathematics and science.</p><p>Over time, some of these words entered other languages in shortened or adapted forms, becoming so familiar that their origins are often forgotten.</p><p>One example is algebra, a cornerstone of mathematics. The term comes from the Arabic word al-jabr, meaning “restoration” or “reunion”. It originally appeared in the title of a ninth-century work on solving equations by the Baghdad-based Persian scholar Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, after whom the word “algorithm” is derived.</p><p>Other Arabic words underwent more dramatic transformations. Carat, the unit used to measure the weight of gemstones, traces its roots to the Arabic word qirat.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4179838\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4179838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Common-English-words-with-Arabic-roots-1765989016.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Common English words with Arabic roots-1765989016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4179838\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>According to Al Hamad, these changes reveal how English and other languages adapt unfamiliar sounds. “Because English has relatively few words beginning with Q,” he explains, “Arabic words such as qirat were reshaped using more familiar sounds like C, G or K, producing forms such as carat.”</p><p>The same process can be seen in everyday vocabulary beyond science and mathematics. The word giraffe, for instance, comes from the Arabic zarafa, and went through a similar transformation as English and other European languages reshaped the original sounds to fit their own phonetic patterns, much as they did with words beginning with the Arabic letter Q.</p><p>On the other hand, words such as tariff, which is derived from the Arabic word ta’rif, meaning “to notify” or “to announce”, entered English through contact with other languages involved in trade.</p><p>Al Hamad says these words “most likely entered the English language via Romance languages” although not necessarily in the forms we recognise today. He adds that they also passed through Turkish, which “borrowed heavily from Arabic” and influenced the medieval world through trade and warfare. Later, during the British colonial era, English both borrowed from and contributed words directly to Arabic.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We had a lot of oil there. As you know, they threw our companies out, and we want it back,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>In 2007, then-Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2013/3/6/venezuela-president-hugo-chavez-dies\">Hugo Chavez</a> – Nicolas Maduro’s late predecessor – forced out some US oil companies as he nationalised the country’s petrol sector.</p><p>He also only vaguely alluded to his campaign of military strikes against alleged boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, saying that the US “decimated the bloodthirsty foreign drug cartels”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The $11bn project is supported by technology transfer from a Taiwanese chipmaker and has onboarded the United States chip giant Intel as a potential customer.</p><p>With companies the world over hungering for chips, India’s entry into that business could boost its role in global supply chains. But experts caution that India still has a long way to go in attracting more foreign investment and catching up in cutting-edge technology.</p><h2 id=\"unprecedented-momentum\">Unprecedented momentum</h2><p>Semiconductor chips are designed, fabricated in foundries, and then assembled and packaged for commercial use. The US leads in chip design, Taiwan in fabrication, and China, increasingly, in packaging.</p><p>The upcoming foundry in Gujarat is a collaboration between India’s Tata Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the country, and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC), which is assisting with the plant’s construction and technology transfer.</p><p>On December 8, Tata Electronics also signed an agreement with Intel to explore the manufacturing and packaging of its products in Tata’s upcoming facilities, including the foundry. The partnership will address the growing domestic demand.</p><p>Last year, Tata was approved for a 50 percent subsidy from the Modi government for the foundry, along with additional state-level incentives, and could come online as early as December 2026.</p><p>Even if delayed, the project marks a pivotal moment for India, which has seen multiple attempts to build a commercial fab stall in the past.</p><p>The foundry will focus on fabricating chips ranging from 28 nanometres (nm) to 110nm, typically referred to as mature chips because they are comparatively easier to produce than smaller 7nm or 3nm chips.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mature chips are used in most consumer and power electronics, while the smaller chips are in high demand for AI data centres and high-performance computing. Globally, the technology for mature chips is more widely available and distributed. Taiwan leads production of these chips, with China fast catching up, though Taiwan’s TSMC dominates production for cutting-edge nodes below 7nm.</p><p>“India has long been strong in chip design, but the challenge has been converting that strength into semiconductor manufacturing,” said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Washington, DC-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF).</p><p>“In the past two to three years, there’s been more progress on that front than in the previous decade – driven by stronger political will at both the central and state levels, and a more coordinated push from the private sector to commit to these investments,” Ezell told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"easy-entry-point\">Easy entry point</h2><p>More than half of the Modi government’s $10bn in semiconductor incentives is earmarked for the Tata-PSMC venture, with the remainder supporting nine other projects focused mainly on the assembly, testing and packaging (ATP) stage of the supply chain.</p><p>These are India’s first such projects – one by Idaho-based Micron Technology, also in Gujarat, and another by the Tata Group in the northeastern Assam state. Both will use in-house technologies and have drawn investments of $2.7bn and $3.3bn, respectively.</p><p>The remaining projects are smaller, with cumulative investments of about $2bn, and are backed by technology partners such as Taiwan’s Foxconn, Japan’s Renesas Electronics, and Thailand’s Stars Microelectronics.</p><p>“ATP units offer a lower path of resistance compared to a large foundry, requiring smaller investments – typically between $50m and $1bn. They also carry less risk, and the necessary technology know-how is widely available globally,” Ashok Chandak, president of the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Still, most of the projects are behind schedule.</p><p>Micron’s facility, approved for incentives in June 2023, was initially expected to begin production by late 2024. However, the company noted in its fiscal 2025 report that the Gujarat facility will “address demand in the latter half of this decade”.</p><p>Approved in February 2024, the Tata facility was initially slated to be operational by mid-2025, but the timeline has now been pushed to April 2026.</p><p>When asked for reasons behind the delays, both Micron and Tata declined to comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>One exception is a smaller ATP unit by Kaynes Semicon, which in October exported a consignment of sample chip modules to an anchor client in California – a first for India.</p><p>Another project by CG Semi, part of India’s Murugappa Group, is in trial runs, with commercial production expected in the coming months.</p><p>The semiconductor projects under the Tata Group and the Murugappa Group have drawn public scrutiny after Indian online news outlet Scroll.in reported that both companies made massive political donations after they were picked for the projects.</p><p>As per Scroll.in, the Tata Group donated 7.5 billion rupees ($91m) and 1.25 billion rupees ($15m), respectively, to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just weeks after securing government subsidies in February 2024 and ahead of national elections. Neither group had made such large donations to the party before. Such donations are not prohibited by law. Both the Tata Group and the Murugappa Group declined to comment to Al Jazeera regarding the reports.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-domestic-demand-a-key-priority\">Meeting domestic demand a key priority</h2><p>The upcoming projects in India – both the foundry and the ATP units – will primarily focus on legacy, or mature, chips sized between 28nm and 110nm. While these chips are not at the cutting-edge of semiconductor technology, they account for the bulk of global demand, with applications across cars, industrial equipment and consumer electronics.</p><p>China dominates the ATP segment globally with a 30 percent share and accounted for 42 percent of semiconductor equipment spending in 2024, according to DBS Group Research.</p><p>India has long positioned itself as a “China Plus One” destination amid global supply chain diversification, with some progress evident in Apple’s expansion of its manufacturing base in the country. The company assembles all its latest iPhone models in India, in partnership with Foxconn and Tata Electronics, and has emerged as a key supplier to the US market this year following tariff-related uncertainties over Chinese shipments.</p><p>Its push in the ATP segment, however, is driven largely by the need to meet the growing domestic demand for chips, anticipated to surge from $50bn today to $100bn by 2030.</p><p>“Globally, too, the market will expand from around $650bn to $1 trillion. So, we’re not looking at shifting manufacturing from China to elsewhere. We’re looking at capturing the incremental demand emerging both in India and abroad,” Chandak said.</p><p>India’s import of chips – both integrated circuits and microassemblies – has jumped in recent years, rising 36 percent in 2024 to nearly $24bn from the previous year. An integrated circuit (IC) is a chip serving logic, memory or processing functions, whereas a microassembly is a broader package of multiple chips performing combined functions.</p><p>The momentum has continued this year, with imports up 20 percent year-on-year, accounting for about 3 percent of India’s total import bill, according to official trade data. China remains the leading supplier with a 30 percent share, followed by Hong Kong (19 percent), South Korea (11 percent), Taiwan (10 percent), and Singapore (10 percent).</p><p>“Even if it’s a 28 nm chip, from a trade balance perspective, India would rather produce and package it domestically than import it,” Ezell of ITIF said, adding that domestic capability would enhance the competitiveness of chip-dependent industries.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"better-incentives-needed\">Better incentives needed</h2><p>The Modi government’s support for the chip sector, while unprecedented for India, is still dwarfed by the $48bn committed by China and the $53bn provisioned under the <a href=\"/economy/2022/8/9/biden-signs-chips-act-to-boost-us-chipmakers-compete-with-china#:~:text=The%20law%2C%20providing%20$52bn,South%20Korea%20for%20critical%20technologies.&amp;text=US%20President%20Joe%20Biden%20on,generation%20investment%20in%20America%20itself%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US’s CHIPS Act</a>.</p><p>To achieve scale in the ATP segment for meaningful import substitution – and to advance towards producing chips smaller than 28nm – India will need continued government support, and there is a second round of incentives already in the works.</p><p>“The reality is, if India wants to compete at the leading edge of semiconductors, it will need to attract a foreign partner – American or Asian – since only a handful of companies globally operate at that level. It’s highly unlikely that a domestic firm will be competitive at 7nm or 3nm anytime soon,” Ezell said.</p><p>According to him, India needs to continue focusing on improving its overall business environment – from ensuring reliable power and infrastructure to streamlining regulations, customs and tariff policies.</p><p>India’s engineers make up about a fifth of the global chip design workforce, but rising competition from China and Malaysia to attract multinational design firms could erode that edge.</p><p>In its latest incentive round, the Indian government limited benefits to domestic firms to promote local intellectual property – a move that, according to Alpa Sood, legal director at the India operations of California-based Marvell Technology, risks driving multinational design work elsewhere.</p><p>“India already has a thriving chip design ecosystem strengthened by early-stage incentives from the government. What we need, to further accelerate and build stronger R&amp;D muscle – is incentives that mirror competing countries like China [220 percent tax incentives] and Malaysia [200 percent tax incentives]. This will ensure we don’t lose the advantage we’ve built over the years,” Sood told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Marvell’s India operations are its largest outside the US.</p><h2 id=\"the-trump-effect\">The Trump effect</h2><p>India’s upcoming chip facilities, while aimed at meeting domestic demand, will also export to clients in the US, Japan, and Taiwan. Though US President Donald Trump has threatened 100 percent tariffs on semiconductors made outside the US, none have yet been imposed.</p><p>A bigger concern for India-US engagement – so far limited to education and training – is Washington’s 50 percent tariff on India over its Russian crude imports. Semiconductors remain exempt, but the broader trade climate has turned uncertain.</p><p>“Over half the global semiconductor market is controlled by US-headquartered firms, making engagement with them crucial,” Chandak said. “Any alignment with these firms, either through joint ventures or technology partnerships – is a preferred option.”</p><p>The global chip race is accelerating, and India’s policies will need to keep pace to become a serious player amid growing geo-economic fragmentation.</p><p>“These new 1.7nm fabs are so advanced they even factor in the moon’s gravitational pull – it’s literally a moonshot,” Ezell said. “Semiconductor manufacturing is the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes – and the policymaking behind it must be just as precise.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Maxwell, 63, argues that “newly discovered evidence” proves that she “did not receive a fair trial by independent jurors coming to Court with an open mind”.</p><p>“If the jury had heard of the new evidence of the collusion between the plaintiff’s lawyers and the Government to conceal evidence and the prosecutorial misconduct they would not have convicted,” Maxwell wrote.</p><p>She said the

Donald Trump’s signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><p>The law, which Trump signed after months of public and political pressure on his administration, requires the Department of Justice to provide the public with Epstein-related records by December 19.</p><p>The circumstances of Epstein’s death and his influential social circle, which spanned the highest reaches of business and

Justice Department has said it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices.</p><p>Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges but was found dead a month later in his cell at a New York federal jail, and his death was ruled a suicide.</p><p>Maxwell, once a well-known British socialite, was arrested a year later and convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021.</p><p>In July, she was interviewed
