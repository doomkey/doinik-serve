But the Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings\">rejected all their allegations</a>, claiming “terrorists” and “rioters” armed and funded by the US and Israel were behind the killings across Iran.</p><h2 id=\"families-united-in-grief-strength\">Families united in grief, strength</h2><p class=\"s5\">From Kuhchenar county in southern Iran’s Fars province to central Arak and Mashhad in the northeast, families continue to release footage online to commemorate their loved ones killed during the demonstrations.</p><p class=\"s5\">Behesht-e Zahra, a cemetery in Tehran, was crowded on Friday as people gathered in solidarity with multiple families holding mourning ceremonies to mark <a href=\"/news/2022/10/26/clashes-thousands-attend-mahsa-amini-memorial-iran-saqqez\">“chehelom”</a>, or 40 days since the killing of their loved ones.</p><p class=\"s5\">Bereaved relatives somberly clapped, played music and showed the “victory” sign in an attempt to express pride, strength and defiance despite their losses.</p><p class=\"s5\">Among those remembered were Ayda Heydari, 21, a medical student, and Zahra “Raha” Behloulipour, who attended Tehran University. Both were shot and killed with multiple live rounds in separate incidents.</p><p class=\"s5\">The state-run Mehr news agency reported Heydari was “a victim of Mossad agents in recent riots” and released a short clip of an interview with her family.

So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-geopolitical-win\">A geopolitical win</h2><p>The lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.</p><p>So while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.</p><p>Pakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.</p><p>The reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.</p><p>Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.</p><p>Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.</p><p>Sri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.</p><p>When Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.</p><p>“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.</p><p>“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.</p><p>“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”</p><p>A little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.</p><p>As of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.</p><p>Come Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288497\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-STADIUMS-T20-MENS-CRICKET-WORLD-CUP-2026-FEB3-2026-1770220847.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -STADIUMS- T20 MEN'S CRICKET WORLD CUP - 2026 - FEB3, 2026-1770220847\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

This is the type of drone used by groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Yemeni Houthis. Suddenly, a blinding whiteness overtakes the image. Seconds later, the wing of the drone snaps off, sending it tumbling down, exploding when it hits the ground.</p><p>This is a video shared by the Israeli Ministry of Defence and arms producer Rafael, a hint towards the future of anti-drone warfare. In it, they are demonstrating one of their new weapons: a high-energy laser designed to take down aerial threats such as drones, but also rockets and even artillery shells. It’s called Iron Beam. Israel claims they have shot down several enemy drones with it already.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Laser weapons have been a dream for arms manufacturers and militaries since the invention of the laser in 1960. So far, they have remained a dream. But now they seem to be on the brink of a breakthrough. Technological advances have made lasers more robust. At the same time, the rise of drones increases the need for weapons that can shoot them down cheaply and efficiently.</p><p>“Lasers are the next step in air defence systems,” says Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he works on high-energy lasers in defence projects.</p><p>“When you are attacked by thousands of inexpensive drones, you cannot afford to defend yourself with expensive anti-air weapons, such as missiles. Lasers might be a solution.”</p><p>This promise is causing a gold rush among defence companies. Independent analyses on the market’s size are lacking, but a flurry of contracts and announcements have recently been made.</p><p>The Israeli Iron Beam contract is worth $500m for Rafael and Elbit Systems, another Israeli defence company. The US Navy has contracted Lockheed Martin to supply its ships with defensive high-energy lasers. UK defence firm MBDA was awarded a 316-million-pound ($430m) defence contract at the end of 2025 to deliver their DragonFire laser weapon system by 2027. MBDA is also cooperating with German defence giant Rheinmetall to develop a German system by 2029. France, in turn, took a similar approach, teaming up again with MBDA and a flurry of its own defence players to develop a laser system.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"star-wars\">Star Wars</h2><p>One of the companies benefitting from this gold rush is the Australian Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), led by the German CEO Andreas Schwer. In 2025, they secured a 71-million-euro ($84m) contract with the Netherlands for the development of a laser weapon. In December, another contract, worth $80m, was announced with South Korea.</p><p>Their laser technology is a descendant of the United States’s Strategic Defense Initiative programme, colloquially known as Star Wars. In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan created the programme to use lasers, fired from space, to shoot down Soviet ballistic missiles.</p><p>That grand vision failed. Billions were invested, but in the 1990s, most of the programmes ended. EOS was one of the participants. They used Star Wars’ insights to build lasers that track satellites. But now they are using them for a different goal: shooting down drones.</p><p>“Our high-energy laser is a derivative of our Star Wars technology,” says Schwer. “Initially, we developed lasers to track satellites. But when the Houthi rebels used drones to attack Saudi Arabia in 2018, we realised this technology was needed elsewhere.”</p><p>Today, they employ 500 people; by the end of next year, that should be 700. If EOS does any large acquisitions, that number might even be even higher, claims Schwer.</p><p>For their laser weapons, EOS is aiming to cooperate with local defence companies as a growth strategy. In Europe, for example, they are working together with players such as Helsing, OHB, MSI and KNDS. That way, they can grow without having to invest large amounts of capital. “We team up with local champions,” says Schwer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dependency-and-sovereignty\">Dependency and sovereignty</h2><p>Particularly in Europe, the market for high-energy lasers is growing. The importance of drone warfare in Ukraine, but also recent cases of drone flights over critical infrastructure in Europe, and Russian drone incursions on the Eastern border of the EU, have caused a surge in demand for anything that can repel mass drone attacks.</p><p>“High-energy laser weapons have, supposedly, been just around the corner for a long time now. However, in the last few years we have seen the technology mature and systems actually being deployed,” says James Black, deputy director of the defence and security research group at RAND Europe.</p><p>The market is still fragmented, however, with many countries launching their own research projects. “You have different countries investing in sovereign R&amp;D projects, testing and low-scale field tests,” says Black. “We don’t yet have a mass market rollout. We haven’t seen industrial consolidation yet.”</p><p>One of the reasons why lasers are so attractive is that they are not dependent on existing supply chains for air-defence weapons. “Countries want sovereign air defence solutions,” says Black. “They want to reduce their dependency on foreign suppliers. For different weapons, such as Patriot missiles, you’re, for example, dependent on the US.”</p><p>For many advanced anti-air weapons, the US is currently the dominant player. The companies that will dominate the market for laser weapons might come from a different part of the world, though. “For the US military, the main priority is deterring and defeating China,” says Black. “That affects which weapons US companies develop. China is more advanced than Russia or Iran. Also, the Indo-Pacific is a very large area, with mostly sea. Massed attacks by small drones are much less of a threat there than in Europe.”</p><h2 id=\"drone-swarms\">Drone swarms</h2><p>Lasers are becoming viable now, on the one hand, because the technology has simply matured. “Twenty years ago, we were using chemical lasers for these projects,” says Boyd. “They were the only ones that had enough power.”</p><p>A laser always has a medium through which the light passes and which amplifies it. Up until recently, for military lasers, the medium of choice was a cocktail of chemicals. These lasers generate a very powerful beam, but they also have downsides, including the volatile chemicals themselves.</p><p>In the past few years, however, solid-state lasers have become more powerful. In such lasers, the medium is a solid material, such as optical fibre. These lasers are more robust and easier to handle. “Solid-state lasers are used for all kinds of industrial processes,” says Boyd. “Civilian industries advanced them significantly. That accelerated their use in military applications.”</p><p>Technical issues still need to be resolved, however. One of those is collateral damage. A laser beam that misses its target just keeps going straight and could, for example, miss a drone and hit an airliner or satellite.</p><p>“Laser beams can also scatter off surfaces and blind people,” says Boyd. “That’s why good targeting systems are so important.”</p><p>This became clear this week when the airspace around El Paso, in the US, was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/why-was-el-paso-airspace-shut-down-drones-security-fears-and-confusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">closed down</a> unexpectedly by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), leading to chaos at the local airport. The shutdown seems to have been related to a non-scheduled test of an anti-drone laser weapon by the US Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>“The El Paso incident strongly illustrates the need for careful use of laser weapons,” says Boyd. “In cluttered civil environments, it is particularly important to have an effective process in place for de-confliction of the region into which a laser is being fired.”</p><p>Lasers are also sensitive to the weather; rain or fog reduces their effectiveness significantly. They also generate a lot of heat, which makes them prone to overheating and could make them an easy target on a battlefield. That is why initially, lasers might be used to defend critical infrastructure away from front lines, or be installed on ships.</p><p>“We’re not going to be shooting handheld lasers at each other anytime soon,” says Black. “Lasers aren’t a silver bullet. They don’t solve all problems. But they are making concrete advances, and countries are actually putting them in the field. They will, however, need to be integrated in wider anti-air systems, where they will serve beside other weapons.”</p><p>In Australia, EOS is working on that. One of their priorities is making their lasers more powerful, and able to handle large swarms of drones. “We want to have more kills per minute,” says Schwer. “That’s why you need more power. Our next step is to have 50 kills per minute. Even with large swarms of drones, nothing will be able to get through.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in ⁠textiles and agro-products.</p><p>After his return, Rahman tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties ⁠under Hasina, and get rid of the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister.</p><p>Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.</p><p>“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he recently said. “What we need ⁠at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”</p><p>Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on ⁠a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many. He has always denied the allegations, calling ⁠them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappeared, and offices shuttered.</p><p>Since his return, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions – a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a ‌fresh start.</p><p>Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders said he directly oversaw candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed ‌remotely.</p><p>He ‌may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.</p><p>“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”</p><p>Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said since his return, Rahman has become “a pretty ubiquitous figure”, who made “lots of big promises about restoring law and order, rebuilding infrastructure and healthcare”.</p><p>“He has made big promises, notably on corruption, especially for a party tainted with corruption itself in the past. Rahman is promising a top-down, no-tolerance approach to corruption, and a new era of clean politics in Bangladesh.”</p><p>As he prepared on Saturday to take the reigns of power in the country, Rahman said the new government he will lead faces daunting challenges.</p><p>“We have paved the way for the establishment of democracy in the country,” he added.</p><p>“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions and destroying law and order.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We believe that Europe must survive.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The US under President Donald Trump wants to lead global “renewal and restoration … and that while we are prepared if necessary to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”, he said.</p><p>Rubio’s speech on Saturday was seen as more conciliatory than remarks made by US Vice President JD Vance last year, who used his appearance at the event to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.</p><p>Despite the softer tone, Rubio still criticised Europe on migration. He warned of “civilisational erasure” caused by mass migration and said it’s “destabilising” the West – a line that has been frequently repeated by US officials, including the president.</p><p>Other divisions remain between the once-ironclad allies. European leaders remain bruised by Trump’s desire to take control of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/greenlands-strategic-position-in-seven-maps-why-trump-wants-the-island\">Greenland</a>, an autonomous territory of NATO-member Denmark.</p><p>European leaders have used the conference as an opportunity to pledge to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences. Leaders said this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying “a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever”.</p><p>“This is the right time for a strong Europe,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, who stressed on Friday the continent is “clear in the support of Ukraine” and “building its own architecture of security”.</p><p>“This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America,” the French leader said.</p><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the conference that Europe “must be ready to fight to do whatever it takes to protect our people, our values and our way of life”, and added the continent should focus on decreasing “some dependencies” and focus on creating a “more European NATO”.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/us-and-europe-must-repair-and-revive-transatlantic-ties-germanys-merz\">acknowledged a “rift”</a> opened up between Europe and the US, prompted by culture wars, but issued an appeal to Washington: “Let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together.</p><p>“In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” said the conservative leader, who has ramped up defence spending in the top European Union economy.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she’s “very much reassured” by Rubio’s speech, reiterating a “strong Europe” is the goal.</p><p>However, some were more cautious about Rubio’s stance on European immigration.</p><p>“I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.</p><p>“This was not a departure from the general position of the [Trump] administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,” he said on X.</p><p></p><p>Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, addressed the meeting on Saturday.</p><p>No Russian officials have been invited, but Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China delivered a key speech.</p><p>A US official said Rubio will meet with Zelenskyy at the conference. US officials have worked for months to try to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, with little success.</p><p>At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Zelenskyy to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal… He has to move,” the US leader said.</p><p>At the conference, the US secretary of state also touched on issues outside Europe.</p><p>On China, he said the US owes it to the world to manage its relations with China, even when the national interests of the two superpowers do not align.</p><p>Speaking about Iran, he said Trump’s preference is to reach a deal with Tehran, but said that’s “very hard to do”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
