However, when the November 1 deadline arrived, IndiGo airline was not prepared. As a result, it was first forced to delay and later cancel flights, as there were not enough pilots available.</p><p>FDTL was finally implemented in two phases this year, with the second phase coming into effect on November 1. The rules include:</p><ul>\n<li>Increasing pilots’ mandatory weekly rest period from 36 to 48 hours. A pilot’s personal leave request, however, cannot be included under the mandatory rest period.</li>\n<li>Capping pilots’ flying hours that continue into the night to 10 hours.</li>\n<li>Capping the weekly number of landings a pilot can make between midnight and early morning to two.</li>\n<li>Submitting quarterly pilots’ fatigue reports to India’s aviation regulator – the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).</li>\n</ul><p>Aviation experts and pilot unions have said IndiGo has been the hardest hit due to negligence and a lack of planning for the new rules.</p><p>“Despite the two-year preparatory window before full FDTL implementation, the airline inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze, entered non-poaching arrangements, maintained a pilot pay freeze through cartel-like behaviour, and demonstrated other short-sighted planning practices,” the Federation of Indian Pilots told the Press Trust of India news agency on December 4.</p><p>Former AirAsia CFO Vijay Gopalan <a href=\"https://x.com/mrajshekhar/status/1997350252353901015?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blamed</a> IndiGo’s “very very lackadaisical, nonchalant attitude” in adapting to the new rules as a reason for the crisis.</p><h2 id=\"what-steps-has-the-government-taken-to-address-the-crisis\">What steps has the government taken to address the crisis?</h2><p>The government has ordered a high-level inquiry to determine the reasons and accountability for flight disruptions.</p><p>Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu blamed IndiGo for “mismanagement regarding their crew”, adding that other airlines were prepared for the changes.</p><p>The government on Friday announced exemptions from the new rules for the carrier and provided stranded passengers with train tickets to continue their journey.</p><p>IndiGo has been exempted until February 10 from the requirement to cap the weekly number of landings for a pilot between midnight and early morning. It <span>has also been exempted from the pilots’ flight duty time.</span></p><p>The Airline Pilots Association of India has, however, protested against the exemptions, saying the rules “exist solely to safeguard human life”.</p><p>On Saturday, India’s aviation watchdog, the DGCA, sent a letter to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers, warning him of regulatory action amid flight cancellations.</p><p>“You have failed in your duty to ensure timely arrangements for conduct of reliable operations,” Reuters reported, quoting DGCA official Ravinder Singh Jamwal.</p><p>The Ministry of Civil Aviation on Saturday also announced capping of airfares to control the surge in ticket prices due to a breakdown in IndiGo’s flight services.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4063662\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4063662\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4063662\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25276132673269-1761563338.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An aircraft of India's budget airline IndiGo is serviced.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4063662\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IndiGo is the largest private airline controlling nearly 60 percent of the domestic market [File: AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"when-will-the-indigo-operations-return-to-normal\">When will the IndiGo operations return to normal?</h2><p>Acknowledging its failure to adapt to the new rules, IndiGo has apologised for the serious “operational crisis”. It attributed the mass cancellations to “misjudgement and planning gaps”.</p><p>IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said in a video statement on Friday that it would “take some time” for the flight operations to get back to normal.</p><p>“Given the size, scale, and complexity of our operations, it will take some time to return to a full normal situation, which we anticipate between 10 and 15 December,” he said in the video.</p><p>In his message, Elbers announced that the airline has three lines of action to address the crisis, which include customer support measures to effectively communicate cancellations and refunds, aligning with the DGCA’s regulations.</p><p>The airline on Sunday afternoon said it is on track to operate more than 1,650 flights, up from 1,500 on Saturday. It added that 137 out of 138 destinations are in operation. Full waiver on cancellations and reschedule requests for bookings until December 15 will be given, it said.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-are-other-leading-indian-airlines-managing\">How are other leading Indian airlines managing?</h2><p>Other Indian carriers, including Air India and Akasa Air, continue with their operations amid the chaos.</p><p>According to Indian media reports, Mumbai-based low-cost carrier Akasa Air, focused on recruiting new pilots, which helped it adapt to the new FDTL norms.</p><p>A report by Indian business portal Money Control noted that Tata-owned Air India also boosted flight crew for domestic flights, helping it better handle the new rules.</p><p>However, international flights by Air India and its sister company, budget carrier Air India Express, have reduced international flight operations to undertake more safety checks after a <a href=\"/features/2025/6/13/how-deadly-air-india-crash-shattered-dreams-wiped-out-entire-families\">deadly June plane crash</a> that killed 241 people in Gujarat state.</p><h2><span>Has the crisis impacted airfare?</span></h2><p>Yes. With IndiGo dominating the Indian aviation market, other airlines have hiked prices on many routes, especially return flights from metro cities New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.</p><p>“That wasn’t pricing. It was profiteering. When systems collapse, the market becomes a vulture,” posted an X user after ticket prices soared.</p><p>According to Indian media reports, the Civil Aviation Ministry has warned airlines that it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and has in turn “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes.”</p><p>As per a Reuters report, the government has said flight journeys between 1,000km and 1,500km (620-930 miles) should be capped at 15,000 rupees ($167).</p><p>Airfares were previously capped in India in May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the subcontinent ordered lockdowns and reduced flight operations. <a href=\"/features/2025/12/2/indias-sky-high-fares-crash-dreams-to-make-flying-accessible-to-all\">According to</a> a study published last November by global trade association Airports Council International (ACI), India, however, saw a 43 percent rise in domestic fares in the first half of 2024 compared with 2019.</p><p>So far, Air India and Air India Express, which hold 26 percent of the market share, have addressed the situation and <a href=\"https://x.com/airindia/status/1997238043275923551?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clarified</a> that “economy class airfares on non-stop domestic flights have been proactively capped to prevent the usual demand-and-supply mechanism being applied by revenue management systems”.</p><p>The two airlines added that they are seeking to add capacity to help travellers and their baggage reach their final destinations efficiently.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>There’s an old saying in Urdu: Zaroorat ijaad ki maa hai (necessity is the mother of all inventions). I would often hear it as a child growing up in Pakistan.</p><p>I’ve always been fascinated by how some phrases leap across languages without losing their truth.</p><p>You see, survival has a universal dialect, and here, behind the castle walls of New Jersey State Prison (NJSP), necessity isn’t just a mother, it’s a warden, a foreman, and a constant whisper in your ear.</p><h2 id=\"pennies-on-the-dollar\">Pennies on the dollar</h2><p>Like the chains and hooks once used for corporal punishment in the basement of the “Warden’s House” at NJSP, prison labour is a relic of another time. It is a system that still smells faintly of chain gangs and sweat-soaked fields.</p><p>Here at NJSP, we work because we’re told to, for pennies on the dollar.</p><p>According to the Prison Policy Initiative (PPI), a non-profit that researches mass criminalisation in the US, prisoners can earn as little as $0.86 per day, with those in skilled work – like plumbers, electricians and clerks – making barely a few dollars per day.</p><p>Meanwhile, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) research shows that many states pay between $0.15 and $0.52 per hour for cleaning and maintenance jobs, such as sanitation work, with some states paying prisoners <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/publications/captive-labor-exploitation-incarcerated-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nothing at all</a>.</p><p>The Department of Corrections budget runs in the billions, but prisoners can work every day of the year and still only make enough to choose between soap or soup when ordering from the commissary.</p><p>According to the PPI, prisons collect approximately $2.9bn annually from sales at the commissary and prisoners’ phone calls. Meanwhile, an investigation in The Appeal, a publication focusing on the US legal system, found that commissary prices are often five times higher than prices outside prison, with markups soaring as high as <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/locked-in-priced-out-how-much-prison-commissary-prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">600 percent</a> for something like a denture container.</p><p>With costs like these, prisoners have had to create a second economy just to survive inside. We call it the “hustle” – not in the Wall Street sense, but in the purest form of making something out of nothing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117202\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117202\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117202\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scanned_20251106_162246-3-1-1763547994.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C609&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prison series [Illustration by Martin Robles]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117202\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Illustration by Martin Robles]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-tailor\">The tailor</h2><p>I met “Jack”, who works in a pantry, a man who prefers to keep his real name to himself for fear of reprisals. His job at the prison involves preparing meals for fellow prisoners. He works 365 days a year with no holidays, no sick time, and each month is paid a little over $100 into his prison account.</p><p>Jack doesn’t get money from his family on the outside. Most prisoners don’t. In fact, many actually support their loved ones outside through their prison hustles.</p><p>Jack stitches survival together with a needle and thread. He hems khakis, tapers shirts, and mends shoes for stamps. This prison currency is bought through the commissary or traded among prisoners as hard currency for buying and selling. One book has 10 stamps and costs about $8 in the commissary, but can cost more when traded between prisoners.</p><p>Two books of stamps get you a tailored “set” (pants and a shirt or two shirts), and it’s four stamps (about $3) to raise your pant cuffs above the ankles, a popular request among Muslim brothers here. Jack won’t say how much he earns a month, but it’s more than what he makes prepping meals.</p><p>Water is his biggest expense. “The tap water here burns my stomach,” he told me. “Tastes like metal.”</p><p>He buys a case of 24, 16oz (470ml) bottles of water for $6 (about eight stamps). Only three cases are allowed per inmate at a time, and we can only order from the commissary twice a month. He tries to ration, but when he runs out – or water isn’t available at the commissary – he needs to fork out more money to buy bottles from other prisoners who sell at higher prices.</p><p>“The funny thing,” he said, not smiling, “is that they [the prison] give the officers water filters.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117204\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117204\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117204\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scanned_20251106_162354-1-1-1763548000.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C593&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prison series\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Illustration by Martin Robles]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-corner-store\">The corner store</h2><p>On another tier, Josh runs what you might call a corner store without a corner. He sells and trades food for a profit – chili pouches or blocks of cheese from the commissary, peppers smuggled out of the kitchen. The commissary may run out of items or place limits on how many prisoners can buy, so the prisoners go to Josh. But they also go to him for other things – staplers for legal work, shoes, or cash. They trade prison stamps for their purchase. The exchange rate and prices fluctuate depending on supply and demand, but there’s always a profit. A pack of 24 cookies bought at the commissary for $4 may sell for anywhere between $5 and $12. It’s often more profitable to sell loose cookies.</p><p>Josh’s system is pure street business. He buys in bulk from the kitchen workers who steal small quantities from the pantries, and when a prisoner makes an order, he smuggles the item to them immediately – usually via a “unit runner”. He sells with a markup, and offers credit at higher rates.</p><p>“It’s a cat-and-mouse game,” Josh explained. “The trick is to never keep anything in your cell. Too many haters.”</p><p>The “haters” might snitch, and get Josh in trouble. Sometimes, snitching itself is a hustle where police recruit a prisoner to spy and provide them with food, which they, in turn, sell.</p><p>Josh’s hustle lets him buy gifts for his children and cancer awareness T-shirts for his recovering mother, and keeps his phone account alive so he can speak to them.</p><p>And then there’s 52-year-old Martin Robles, who can fix anything. I call him “Mr Fix It”. He can do it all: fans, electronics, clothing. In the summer, when fans burn out, he bypasses the fuse (which often breaks due to power fluctuations) for the price of two books of stamps. “You have to spend money to make money,” he said, explaining the cost of oil, glue, and sandpaper – the tools of his trade. He didn’t want to reveal how much he makes, but he is sought after in prison. He says his hustle isn’t about survival so much as keeping his hands busy and his dignity intact.</p><h2 id=\"the-hustles-keep-turning\">The hustles keep turning</h2><p>Each of these men works in the official prison economy, and then works again in the shadow one. In both, they are underpaid, undersupplied, and overwatched. The hustle isn’t about greed. It’s about staying alive, staying connected, and, sometimes, sending a birthday gift to a goddaughter to remind her, and more importantly, yourself, that you still exist beyond these walls.</p><p>In here, we don’t have much. What we do have is time, pressure and the kind of hunger that sharpens the mind. So we make do. We turn scraps into tools, boredom into ritual. Behind these walls, necessity will keep birthing inventions. And the hustles will keep turning, one quiet transaction at a time.</p><p><em><strong>This is the second story in a three-part series on how prisoners are taking on the US justice system through law, prison hustles and hard-won education.</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Read the first story here: <a href=\"/features/2025/12/1/how-im-fighting-the-us-prison-system-from-the-inside\">How I’m fighting the US prison system from the inside</a></em></strong></p><p><strong>Tariq MaQbool</strong> is a prisoner at New Jersey State Prison (NJSP), where he has been held since 2005.

But, he added, “The suffering and destruction in Gaza remain in our hearts. People remember the glimmer of light even amid devastation.”</p><p>The mayor also shared a message sent to Bethlehem by <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/pope-leo-insists-on-2-state-solution-to-resolve-israel-palestine-conflict\">Pope Leo XIV</a>, saying the pontiff assured residents he “carries Bethlehem in his heart and prayers and is working for an end to Palestinian suffering”, urging people in Gaza “not to give in to despair”.</p><p>Canawati called on pilgrims worldwide to visit Bethlehem, saying tourism is an act of solidarity with Palestinians “who are weary of war but have not grown weary of hope”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4156434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4156434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4156434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8451-1765086374.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mayor Canawati speaks to visitors\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4156434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bethlehem’s Mayor Maher N Canawati greets visitors [Monjed Jadou/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Economic hardship under siege</strong></h2><p>Bethlehem’s Christmas spirit comes despite <a href=\"/news/2025/9/15/israels-financial-stranglehold-on-palestinian-land-must-end-un-experts\">severe economic decline</a> linked to Israeli closures and the collapse of tourism, the primary driver of the local economy.</p><p>Shopkeepers and artisans told Al Jazeera that hope, rather than income, has kept the city standing.

The UAE has long rejected accusations it is arming the RSF.</p><p>Rosemary DiCarlo, UN undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, told the Doha Forum that the international organisation’s “whole focus” in the war in Sudan had been on the protection of civilians.</p><p>But while some efforts had been successful, most were not.</p><p>“It has been extremely difficult to instil in the parties the need to leave civilians alone,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"massacre-in-south-kordofan\">‘Massacre’ in South Kordofan</h2><p>On Saturday, an official in South Kordofan’s Kalogi locality told Al Jazeera that <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/rsf-kills-dozens-mostly-children-in-war-torn-sudans-kalogi-saf-sources\">at least 116 people</a> had been killed in an RSF attack on a preschool and other sites on Thursday, including 46 children who attended the preschool.</p><p>The Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the attack in a statement as a “full-fledged massacre”, saying the RSF had targeted the preschool directly with missiles from a drone, before bombing it again while the locals were trying to rescue the wounded, then pursuing the wounded and the paramedics inside a hospital.</p><p>The executive director of the Kalogi locality said the high death toll in the attack was due to the severity of the injuries sustained, while some families avoided taking injured loved ones to the hospital for treatment because of attacks on the facility.</p><h2 id=\"displaced-women-raped\">Displaced women raped</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Sudan Doctors Network said it had documented 19 cases of rape committed by RSF personnel against women in the al-Afad camp in al-Dabbah who had fled the fighting in el-Fasher.</p><p>The group said two of the survivors, situated in Sudan’s Northern State, were pregnant and were receiving ”special healthcare under the supervision of local medical teams”.</p><p>It said it “strongly condemns the gang rape” by the RSF men, which was a violation of international law, and warned that “the silence of the international community regarding these heinous practices encourages their repetition”.</p><p>Elsewhere, a SAF source told Al Jazeera that air defences had intercepted RSF drones in al-Damazin in Sudan’s southern Blue Nile state, while a government source said electricity had been cut off in the city due to shelling of a power station.</p><p>The UN says violence in Sudan has displaced nine million people and left more than 30 million in need of aid.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
