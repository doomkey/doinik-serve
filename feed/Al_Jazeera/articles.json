They’ll fight at 145lb (66kg) for five five-minute rounds.</p><p>Despite their lengthy absences, Rousey and Carano remain two of the most iconic fighters in MMA history for their trailblazing careers. Carano led their once-outlawed sport into the mainstream of broadcast television, while Rousey secured the enthusiastic acceptance of women’s MMA by Dana White and the UFC.</p><p>Rousey (12-2) rose to become arguably the biggest athlete in all of MMA after winning an Olympic medal in judo in 2008. Her armbar finishes and cage charisma single-handedly prompted White to begin the promotion of women’s MMA, with Rousey at the centre of his plans.</p><p>Rousey won the UFC’s first-ever women’s bout in 2013 to claim the bantamweight title belt, and she still holds the promotion’s record with six title defences.</p><p>After ending 11 of her first 12 fights in the first round, her career abruptly stalled when she lost back-to-back bouts to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes, prompting her to move on to acting, professional wrestling and motherhood.</p><p>“Been waiting so long to announce this: Me and Gina Carano are gonna throw down in the biggest super fight in women’s combat sport history!” Rousey said. “This is for all MMA fans past, present and future.”</p><p></p><p>Carano (7-1) fought in the first Nevada-sanctioned MMA bout between women in 2006, and she won a series of fights that made her a network television draw in the sport’s early days. She was stopped by Cris “Cyborg” Justino in her most recent fight in August 2009, and she moved on to an acting career despite repeated rumours of a return to the cage.</p><p>“Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for, and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,” Carano said.</p><p>“She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen. This is an honour. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win, and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome. This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community.”</p><p>Carano, who turns 44 in April, landed several prominent film roles and became a cast member of Disney’s “The Mandalorian” before her contract failed to be renewed in 2021, after she expressed controversial right-wing views in a series of social media posts.</p><p>Carano settled a lawsuit last year against Lucasfilm and The Walt Disney Company over her claim that she was fired for the posts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321643\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321643\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321643\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26048615229932-1771397945.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE - Gina Carano attends the Disney Plus launch event promoting, \"The Mandalorian,\" on Oct. 19, 2019, at the London West Hollywood hotel in West Hollywood, Calif.

Over the two years of its genocide in Gaza, Israel has set itself on course to become, in the words of some of its own lawmakers, a “pariah state”. Its prime minister and former defence minister are wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court, while global revulsion over its actions in Gaza has pushed the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/campaign-to-boycott-israel-looks-to-future-after-gaza-ceasefire\">boycott</a> of Israeli goods to the forefront of consumers’ minds.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Four countries – Spain, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Ireland – are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/spain-ireland-boycott-eurovision-song-contest-over-israels-inclusion\">refusing</a> to take part in the popular song competition Eurovision in protest at Israel’s presence. A global campaign is also under way to suspend Israel from both European UEFA and international FIFA football competitions, while South Africa’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/14/south-africa-says-icj-genocide-case-will-continue-despite-gaza-ceasefire\">case</a> accusing Israel of genocide in the International Court of Justice is ongoing.</p><p>But in Israel, this international isolation – and the killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians – is not significantly changing opinions on how the country should behave. In fact, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still has a strong chance of winning elections set to be held this year, and much of the opposition towards him comes from his domestic policies, rather than disagreement over how he has treated Palestinians, which many remain indifferent to.</p><p>“Most people don’t even know we’ve largely annexed the West Bank,” said Orly Noy, the editor of the Hebrew-language news site Local Call. “It just isn’t reported that way.”</p><p>“They may be aware that some of the rules of governance have changed, but they probably won’t know that it’s been de facto annexed until there’s an international response that affects them, such as Eurovision,” she said, noting that the withdrawal of the four nations in objection to Israel’s genocide has been framed in Israel as being motivated primarily by anti-Semitism.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"disinterest\">Disinterest</h2><p>For many Israelis, Palestinians barely exist, observers <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/dehumanisation-how-israel-is-able-to-commit-its-genocide-in-gaza\">have said</a>, with the extreme settler violence perpetrated upon them going largely <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/mapping-forced-displacements-and-settler-attacks-by-israel-in-the-west-bank\">unreported</a> or cast as somehow deserved.</p><p>“The media never really reports opposition to anything Israel does,” Noy continued. “It simply dismisses it as anti-Semitic, and presents the world as being made up of those that are either for us, or against us.”</p><p>“Why would they [Israelis] ever reflect on any of their government’s actions?” she asked rhetorically. “They have the answers already: anti-Semitism, victimhood and defiance.”</p><p>Little of the carnage that Israel has inflicted on Gaza has made its way to Israeli television – overwhelmingly the most popular way of receiving news – over the course of the war. On the contrary, Israeli news channels covering the conflict have focused on the number of “terrorists” killed, or framed concern over the nature of the war entirely through the prism of the 250 or so captives taken by Hamas and other groups in 2023.</p><p>In print, criticism of the government or its war has largely been left to smaller outlets on the left.</p><p>In such a landscape, where Israel’s actions go largely unreported, criticism of its government’s conduct is easily cast by lawmakers as anti-Semitic in origin, with just the accusation serving as a second “Iron Dome” – a reference to Israel’s anti-missile defence system – in deflecting criticism of the state, said Neve Gordon, an Israeli professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London.</p><p>“Israel always has to be the victim, and that victimhood justifies any level of violence in its defence,” Gordon said.</p><p>“I visited Israel around 10 times during the first year and a half of the war,”  he said, describing the period of war when Israel had killed tens of thousands of men, women and children in Gaza and starved thousands more.</p><p>“All you heard about was the hostages. You never heard about what was happening in Gaza,” he said, “It’s a repetition of trauma that erases everything else, including compassion.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"siege-mentality\">Siege mentality</h2><p>According to Netanyahu – speaking at a conference in January – the anti-Semitism that Israel faces runs deeper than mere racism.</p><p>Rather, the battle against anti-Semitism is the battle over the future of civilization, Netanyahu said.</p><p>“Racism has existed throughout history. That’s not what anti-Semitism is,” he told attendees. “Anti-Semitism began as a creed 2,500 years ago, 500 years before the birth of Christianity, with an ideological attack against the Jews that kept on metamorphosing over centuries.”</p><p>Decades of similar statements from a variety of politicians have left their mark, said Daniel Bar-Tal, professor of social-political psychology at Tel Aviv University, noting that an entire nation is now “indoctrinated” into a world view that positions its own history as the overwhelming counterweight to whatever actions it chooses to undertake or criticism of it.</p><p>“Many Israeli Jews have a kind of siege mentality,” Bar-Tal said, describing how criticism of Israel was met by a form of “moral silencing” weaponised and propagated by the government. “They imagine that the rest of the world just wants Israel to disappear.”</p><p>“They think, you Europeans didn’t say anything about us during World War II,” he added. “You did nothing to stop the Holocaust, and now you want to attack the one place where Jews feel safe?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are the most precious things I have.”</p><p>“Every day they are safe is a day worth gratitude and joy,” she says with pride mixed with fear, referring to the terror that has accompanied her throughout the war at the thought of losing them.</p><p>Like other Palestinians in Gaza, what distinguishes this Ramadan is the relative calm that has come with the current ceasefire, compared with the previous two years, when Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, was at its peak.</p><p>“The situation is not completely calm,” Maisoon explains. Everyone knows the war hasn’t truly stopped; shelling still happens from time to time. But compared to the height of the war, things are less intense.”</p><p>Maisoon participates in camp administration activities, helping prepare bread and arrange dates and water for distribution, minutes before the call to prayer on the first day of Ramadan.</p><p>“This is the third Ramadan we’ve spent in displacement. We lost our homes, our families, and many loved ones.”</p><p>“But here in the camp, we have neighbours and friends who share the same pain and suffering, and we all want to support one another socially.”</p><p>Maisoon lost her home in southeastern Gaza at the beginning of the war and was forced to flee with her husband, Hassouna, and their children, moving between camps before eventually settling in Bureij under what she describes as “very bad conditions”.</p><p>“We are trying to create life and joy out of nothing. Ramadan and Eid come and go, but our situation remains the same,” she says after a brief pause.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321297\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321297\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A3278-copy-1771385940.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A husband and wife with their son in a decorated tent\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maisoon al-Barbarawi, her husband Hassouna, and their son, Hasan, as they prepare for Ramadan in Gaza [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"wounded-from-within\">‘Wounded from within’</h2><p>Maisoon’s words fluctuate between optimism and fear, but she insists that Ramadan is “a blessing”, despite everything around her.</p><p>On the first day of Ramadan, she had not yet decided what she would cook for her family, as her limited means would only allow for a modest meal.</p><p>But she had already prepared her prayers and wishes before breaking her fast.</p><p>“I will pray that the war never returns. That is my daily prayer: that things calm down completely and that the army withdraw from our land,” she says, pointing to bullet holes in her tent caused by gunfire from an Israeli quadcopter drone days earlier.</p><p>Fear of the war’s return during Ramadan is not unique to Maisoon, but is shared by many across the Gaza Strip, who worry about a renewed escalation, similar to last year when fighting resumed on March 19, 2025, coinciding with the second week of Ramadan.</p><p>That renewed war was accompanied by the closure of crossings and a ban on food aid entering the enclave, triggering a severe food crisis and humanitarian famine that lasted until last September.</p><p>“People these days keep talking about stocking up. They tell us: store flour, store food… the war is coming back,” Maisoun says anxiously.</p><p>“Last Ramadan was famine and war at the same time. I spent all my money during the previous famine.”</p><p>“My little son used to pray for death because he craved food.

She received a food parcel from a relief organisation on the first day of Ramadan.</p><p>Opening the package with a broad smile, she celebrates its contents while her grandchildren gather around her.</p><p>“This is fava beans, halva, dates, tahini, oil, lentils, beans, spreadable cheese, mortadella, mashallah, an excellent parcel,” Hanan tells her daughter standing nearby.</p><p>“This will be perfect for tomorrow’s suhoor,” she says, referring to the predawn meal before Muslims begin fasting for the day.</p><p>Hanan, 55, is a mother of eight who fled to Deir el-Balah a year ago from Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, one of the hardest-hit places by Israel during the war.</p><p>She tells Al Jazeera that she will have to depend on whatever aid arrives to sustain her during Ramadan, due to her difficult economic situation.</p><p>“Today, thank God, we received assistance. This will ease my worry about what we will break our fast with,” says Hanan, who shares a tent with 15 family members, including children and grandchildren.</p><p>Smiling, she admits she secretly set aside a small amount of money to prepare a tray of potatoes with minced meat and rice for the first iftar.</p><p>“I saved a small amount to buy a kilo of meat tomorrow. Fasting requires protein,” she says in a low voice, noting that preparing a meal now depends entirely on what is available that same day, as storage conditions are nearly nonexistent.</p><p>“As you can see, there is no electricity, no infrastructure, no refrigerators to store vegetables or meat if we buy them.”</p><p>“We purchase what we need day by day so the food does not spoil.”</p><p>Yet the other side of Ramadan for Hanan is measured not by preparation but by those absent from the table.</p><p>Tears fill her eyes as she mentions her two sons in their late twenties who were killed in a strike last year, one leaving behind a daughter not yet two years old.</p><p>“This is the first Ramadan after the martyrdom of my sons Abdullah and Mohammed,” she says through tears.</p><p>“You feel the emptiness.

We’ve been cooking over open fire for two years. The wind blows out the flame, and my son tries to shield it with plastic.”</p><p>She relies on firewood due to prolonged shortages of cooking gas.</p><p>“I managed to fill an eight-kilo gas cylinder two months ago and refused to use it until Ramadan,” she says, pulling out the hidden cylinder.</p><p>“Gas is like treasure for us. I planned to save it for suhoor or something quick. It would be difficult to light a fire at dawn.”</p><p>“In the end, everything passes. What matters is that we remain together in health and safety, and that we do not live through famine or war again,” she adds, her voice shifting to prayers for peace.</p><p>The memory of famine further deepens her anxiety.</p><p>She repeats the word “difficult” as she recalls the months when prices soared and food disappeared after last Ramadan.</p><p>She describes grinding lentils to replace flour and mixing them with pasta or rice to feed as many family members as possible.</p><p>To make the bread stretch, she cut it into smaller portions.</p><p>“I make it smaller, so it’s enough for everyone.”</p><p>And yet, her final wish, repeated like a prayer, echoes what many in Gaza seek this Ramadan: nothing more than “goodness and peace”, and a return home from displacement.</p><p>“May this Ramadan be one of goodness and peace for everyone… and may we return to our homes and our land.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But of course, the president reserves the ability to say when he thinks that diplomacy has reached its natural end,” Vance said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"stumbling-blocks\">Stumbling blocks</h2><p>Iran has for years sought relief from sweeping sanctions imposed by the US, including a Washington-imposed ban on other countries buying its oil.</p><p>Tehran has said it wants the ongoing talks to focus on its uranium enrichment programme, insisting that any deal must deliver tangible economic benefit to Iran while maintaining its sovereignty and national security.</p><p>Washington has demanded that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, and has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues, such as Tehran’s missile stockpile.</p><p>Iran has said it will not accept zero uranium ‌enrichment and that its missile capabilities are off the table.</p><p>The talks come amid high tensions in the Gulf, with the US deploying two aircraft carriers to the region. The first – the USS Abraham Lincoln, with nearly 80 aircraft – was positioned about 700km (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.</p><p>Its location puts at least a dozen US F‑35s and F‑18 fighter jets within striking distance.

The move would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.</p><p>Tehran has also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">threatened to strike</a> US military bases in the region in the event of an attack.</p><p>A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed last year when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb three nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"degraded\">‘Degraded’</h2><p>Ali Vaez, the Crisis Group’s Iran project director, told Al Jazeera he believed there is a lot of space for agreement on the nuclear front, “simply because Iran’s nuclear programme has been degraded on the ground, and so, some of the cost of the compromise has already sunk in”.</p><p>“It should be easier for the Iranians to accept zero enrichment for a period of time, because they have not spun a single centrifuge since the 12-day war back in June,” he said.</p><p>“But when it gets to non-nuclear questions, like regional activities or their missile programme, I think, at best, the Iranians will be willing to do superficial concessions, not the kind of grand bargain capitulation that the US expect,” he said.</p><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, meanwhile, reiterated in an interview published on Tuesday that Tehran was “absolutely not seeking nuclear weapons”.</p><p>“If anyone wants to verify this, we are open to such verification to take place,” he said.</p><p>“However, we do not accept that we should be prevented from using nuclear science and knowledge to address our illnesses and to advance our industry and agriculture,” he added.</p><p>Iran has joined the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which guarantees countries the right to pursue civilian nuclear power in return for requiring them to forgo atomic ‌weapons ‌and cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p>Israel, which has not signed the treaty, neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons, under a decades-old ambiguity policy designed to deter surrounding enemies. Scholars believe it does.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has to be there year after year, until this project is done.”</p><p>At stake is the fate of the Northeast Corridor project, a central part of the Gateway Program, an interstate initiative to expand and renovate the aging tunnels that the link metropolitan hubs between New York and New Jersey.</p><p>The federal government had pledged billions in support for the project, considered to be vital for transportation and safety reasons.</p><p>But on October 1, one day into a historically long government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would suspend $18bn in funding for the project that had already been granted.</p><p>The move was designed to pressure Democrats — and Democrat-aligned jurisdictions — to comply with Republican demands to end the shutdown.</p><p>But Trump hinted at the time that some of the programming cuts could be permanent. The shutdown ended after 43 days in November, and still, the funding for the New York City tunnel project remained frozen.</p><p>Democrats decried the freeze an act of political revenge. “It should concern every American that the Trump Administration is willing to harm working families and our nation’s economy to punish Democrats,” Representative Jerry Nadler of New York <a href=\"https://nadler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397413\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in response to the funding suspension.</p><p>But Trump has continued to withhold the funds. On February 3, the states of New York and New Jersey announced they were suing the Trump administration to release the funds.</p><p>“After four months of covering costs with limited operating funds, the states warn that construction will be forced to completely shut down as soon as February 6 unless federal funding resumes,” attorneys general Letitia James of New York and Jennifer Davenport of New Jersey said in a <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-trump-administration-freezing-gateway-programs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> at the time.</p><p>Three days later, as the states hit that February 6 deadline, a US district judge ordered the funds to be released, citing the potential for irreparable harm to the project.</p><p>The ruling required more than $200m in reimbursement funds to be paid out to the states.</p><p>Over the last week, the federal government responded by releasing $30m, in addition to the $77m announced on Tuesday. But officials said it was still not enough.</p><p>At Tuesday’s news conference, union leader Gary LaBarbera emphasised that new construction was a necessity.</p><p>“Let me tell you: The existing tunnels, the trans-Hudson tunnels, are over a hundred years old. Their structural integrity has failed,” he said.</p><p>He added that the issue of maintaining safe transportation should be nonpartisan</p><p>“This isn’t a Republican tunnel or a Democratic tunnel, right? This should not be a political tug of war,” he said.</p><p>Governor Hochul, meanwhile, used part of her speech to address the president. “ Let’s stop the chaos. Let’s stop the insanity. Let them work, Mr President,” she said, in a gesture to the workers around her.</p><p>But this week, on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump doubled down on his opposition to the project.</p><p>“I am opposed to the future boondoggle known as ‘Gateway,’ in New York/New Jersey, because it will cost many BILLIONS OF DOLLARS more than projected or anticipated,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086782319939311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“It is a disaster! Gateway will likewise be financially catastrophic for the region, unless hard work and proper planning is done, NOW, to avoid insurmountable future cost overruns.”</p><p>He also denounced reports that he would un-freeze the funding in exchange for renaming New York’s Penn Station after him, as well as Washington’s Dulles airport.</p><p>“IT IS JUST MORE FAKE NEWS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116081535267965046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, adding that such a proposal was “brought up by certain politicians and construction union heads”, not him.</p><p>Still, his White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to confirm the reports last week during a news briefing.</p><p>“Why not?” she told a reporter. “It was something the president floated in his conversation with [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer.”</p><p>On Tuesday, reports emerged that the Trump Organization had filed trademark claims for any airports bearing the president’s name.</p><p>Republicans in Florida’s legislature have already sought to rename the international airport in Palm Beach for Trump, citing his nearby golf courses and residence at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Even the January 30 publication has been criticised as incomplete, with reports indicating that there could be more than 6 million files in the government’s possession.</p><p>The newly released documents have revealed new details about Epstein’s relationships with influential figures, but few have faced accountability.</p><p>Critics have argued that Epstein himself faced scant legal consequences for the sex crimes he perpetuated. He reached a plea deal in Florida in 2008, wherein he pleaded guilty to soliciting a child for prostitution and sex trafficking, but he only served 13 months in custody.</p><p>He was in jail in 2019, facing federal charges, when he died by suicide in his cell.</p><p>Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been sentenced to more than 20 years for her role in the sex trafficking scheme.</p><p>In Tuesday’s statement, the experts on the UN panel slammed the heavy redactions in the Epstein files that appear to shield the identities of powerful figures.</p><p>“The reluctance to fully disclose information or broaden investigations, has left many survivors feeling retraumatized and subjected to what they describe as ‘institutional gaslighting’,” the UN experts said.</p><p>Their criticism echoes similar accusations in the US. Lawmakers there have argued that the administration of President Donald Trump, a former friend of Epstein, has defied the November law by redacting documents beyond the guidelines set out by Congress.</p><p>The experts also noted that there appeared to be “botched redactions that exposed sensitive victim information”.

It added that the show “decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options”.</p><p>Talarico posted a nearly minute-long clip of his interview with Colbert on X, calling it “the interview Donald Trump didn’t want you to see”.</p><p>“I think Donald Trump is worried we’re about to flip Texas,” Talarico told Colbert during their interview. “This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”</p><p>Crockett, meanwhile, suggested that Colbert could have avoided an issue with the FCC by having her on the show, as he has in the past.

Zogby would later found the AAI.</p><p>Jackson’s campaign also actively courted Arab Americans and amplified calls for Palestinian self-determination in an era when unquestioning support for Israel was the default position in US politics.</p><p>Berry said Jackson always rejected pressure to disassociate from Arab Americans who view Palestine as a focal issue.</p><p>“He understood that the fight for justice was one that had to be done when it was both hard and easy. Our country has lost a giant,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-party-platform\">The party platform</h2><p>Jackson launched a second campaign for president in 1988, winning 13 states, including Michigan and much of the South, in the Democratic primary.</p><p>He ultimately lost the nomination to then-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Still, Jackson’s campaign catapulted Palestinian rights into the national discourse.</p><p>Zogby and other Jackson delegates at the Democratic National Convention rallied to include support for Palestinian statehood in the party’s platform that year.</p><p>While the push eventually fell short at the national level, 11 state parties adopted platforms expressing support for “the rights of the Palestinian people to safety, self-determination and an independent state”.</p><p>Jackson’s relative success in the primary also led to the appointment of an Arab-American activist, Texan Ruth Ann Skaff, to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the party’s executive board.</p><p>At the time, Skaff faced unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism for her pro-Palestinian stance, not to mention calls to be removed from the committee.</p><p>But in an interview with Al Jazeera, she said she was just a local organiser from Houston, Texas, not a high-level political operative.</p><p>She explained that Jackson’s embrace of the Arab-American community rang <span>“true to his message of wanting to empower those who do not have power or who are excluded”.</span></p><p>She also recalled him being humorous and approachable.</p><p>“We were learning how to organise, how to spread the message and then take it to the next step of being active politically at the very local level. And he guided us and inspired us the entire way,” Skaff said.</p><p>Born in South Carolina in 1941, under the racial segregation of the <a href=\"/features/2015/8/15/know-your-history-understanding-racism-in-the-us\">Jim Crow laws</a>, Jackson was dedicated to civil rights from a young age.</p><p>He was considered a talented public speaker, and as a pre-teen, he became a protege of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>A central part of his national platform was to stress the need for a broad coalition of communities to come together and demand equal rights.</p><p>Jackson moved to Chicago in 1965, where he founded the civil rights and community empowerment movement that became known as the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</p><p>Even after his presidential run, Jackson remained close with the Arab community.</p><p>Hatem Abudayyeh, the executive director of the Arab American Action Network (AAAN) in Illinois, praised Jackson as “a tried-and-true Chicagoan, one of us, who opened the doors to Rainbow/PUSH for Palestinians and Arabs in Chicagoland”.</p><p>“Under his leadership, Black, Latino, Asian, Arab and so many other communities worked together for racial, economic, and social justice,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“He never shied away from solid and principled solidarity with our Palestinian and Arab communities,” he added. “We mourn today with our friends in the Black community, and with all those who will carry on his fight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"support-for-gaza-protesters\">Support for Gaza protesters</h2><p>Nabih Ayad, the founder of the Arab American Civil Rights League (ACRL), said Jackson was one of the first leaders to shine light on the plight of Palestinians at the national stage.</p><p>He also worked on other issues related to the Arab community. In 2015, for instance, Jackson lobbied for the admission and resettlement of Syrian refugees, despite opposition from Republican governors.</p><p>The ACRL, based in the Michigan suburb of Dearborn, hosted Jackson on a panel to highlight the refugees’ plight. Ayad said Jackson’s message was that “justice is universal”.</p><p>“It was an honour to cross his path and be able to see a giant like Jesse Jackson really caring about the little people, the small guys, about injustice wherever it happens, no matter where it is around the world,” Ayad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This drive to address injustice drove Jackson to speak up for Palestinians even when it may have cost him politically, according to Ayad.</p><p>Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition organised an emergency summit in 2024 to call for a ceasefire during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Later that year, he voiced support for pro-Palestine protests on college campuses, writing in the University of Chicago’s newspaper, The Chicago Maroon, that the student leaders “represent the best of our nation”.</p><p>Matthew Jaber Stiffler, the director of the Center for Arab Narratives, a research institution, said Jackson helped the Arab community feel “seen”. He, too, highlighted the political costs of championing Palestinian rights.</p><p>“Even just saying, ‘I support the rights for Palestinians to exist in the national political sphere,’ could get you branded as a radical, could get you pushed to the margins,” Stiffler told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Mainstream candidates didn’t – and still don’t – really want that plank in their platform. And I think that’s why there was such love for Jesse Jackson and what he stood for, because he was not afraid.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"work-that-has-to-be-done\">‘Work that has to be done’</h2><p>In the decades since Jackson’s presidential campaigns, Palestine has become less of a taboo subject in US politics. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/rashida-tlaib-introduces-us-congress-resolution-to-recognise-gaza-genocide\">Congress members</a>, mayors and celebrities have become vocal in criticising Israeli abuses.</p><p>Still, the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties have avoided publicly supporting Palestinian rights. During the 2024 presidential race, for instance, both major parties adopted staunchly pro-Israel platforms.</p><p>The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris even refused to allow a Palestinian speaker at the party’s <a href=\"/news/2024/8/22/they-want-to-erase-us-how-dnc-rejected-demand-for-palestinian-speaker\">convention that year</a>.</p><p>The flow of US money and weapons to Israel has also continued uninterrupted, despite the <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/4/30/we-didnt-expect-to-find-bones-inside-one-gaza-familys-nightmare\">horrific atrocities</a> in Gaza.</p><p>Furthermore, since taking office in January 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump has led a <span>crackdown on Palestinian rights advocates, threatening foreign-born activists with deportation and other penalties.</span></p><p>Berry said that while the current conditions are challenging, Jackson taught the community to overcome barriers and build its power.</p><p>“I think that the lessons and the legacy of someone like Reverend Jackson teaches us that this is work that has to be done,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For her part, Skaff said Jackson wanted Arab Americans to stand up and let their message be known.</p><p>“We’re stronger when we’re united and when we exercise our rights and responsibilities as American citizens: to stand up, to speak out, to run for office, to vote, vote, vote, vote,” she told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he was also a visible member of the campus’s activist community, founding a Palestinian student society alongside fellow student Mahmoud Khalil.</p><p>Columbia became a hub for pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, and Trump campaigned for re-election, in part, on cracking down on the demonstrations.</p><p>Khalil became the first student protester to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March of last year, less than three months into Trump’s second term.</p><p>Then, on April 14, Mahdawi was arrested at a meeting set up by the government, allegedly to process his citizenship application.</p><p>ICE detained him in “direct retaliation for his advocacy of Palestinian rights”, the ACLU said in a statement at the time.</p><p>The Trump administration attempted to transfer Mahdawi out of state to Louisiana, but a court order ultimately blocked it from doing so.</p><p>Mahdawi was ultimately released on April 30, after US Judge Geoffrey Crawford accused the Trump administration of doing “great harm” to someone who had committed no crime.</p><p>Human rights advocates have described the Trump administration’s attempts to deport foreign-born student activists as a campaign to chill free speech.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>After his release last year, <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/columbia-protest-leader-mohsen-mahdawi-released-from-us-custody\">Mahdawi walked out of the court</a> with both hands in the air, flashing peace signs as supporters greeted him with cheers.</p><p>As he spoke, he shared a message for Trump. “I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said to Trump.</p><p>He also addressed the people of Palestine and sought to dispel perceptions that the student protest movement was anything but peaceful.</p><p>“We are pro-peace and antiwar,” Mahdawi explained. “To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering, and I see freedom, and it is very soon.”</p><p>Mahdawi’s arrest comes as part of a wider push by the Trump administration to target visa holders and permanent residents for their pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>Trump has also pressured top universities to crack down on pro-Palestine protests in the name of combating anti-Semitism. In some cases, the Trump administration has opened investigations into campuses where pro-Palestinian protests were prominent, accusing them of civil rights violations.</p><p>Last July, Columbia University entered into a $200m settlement with the Trump administration, with a further $21m given to end a probe into allegations of religious-based harassment.</p><p>The university, however, did not admit to wrongdoing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many people have been fighting against racism in football; Vinicius is one of them. I’m proud of him and his great game.”</p><p>The Associated Press news agency reported that television cameras picked up Vinicius Junior telling the referee that Prestianni had called him a “monkey”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Benfica began the game on the front foot, but the visitors gradually assumed control while the hosts appeared content to counterattack, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois producing a stunning one-handed save to keep out a 25th-minute strike from Fredrik Aursnes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Real finished the first half strongly, and only goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin’s brilliance kept ⁠the score goalless at the break as he produced stunning saves to deny Kylian ⁠Mbappe and Arda Guler.</p><p class=\"p1\">The breakthrough came five minutes after the restart. Mbappe burst forward and fed Vinicius on the left. The Brazilian cut diagonally towards the box, shifted inside and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot into the far top corner.</p><p class=\"p1\">Vinicius celebrated by dancing with the corner flag and ⁠was booked by Letexier for excessive celebration.</p><p class=\"p1\">As the forward argued with the referee, he became involved in a heated exchange with Prestianni, with Vinicius and several teammates suddenly running towards ⁠the referee.</p><p class=\"p1\">Letexier crossed his arms in front of his face to activate ⁠FIFA’s protocol and stopped the match. Real’s players threatened to leave the pitch as tensions flared, before play eventually resumed 11 minutes later.</p><p class=\"p1\">The atmosphere turned hostile, with Vinicius loudly booed whenever he touched the ball, and the broadcast camera appeared to show an outraged Mbappe calling Prestianni “a bloody racist” to ‌his face several times after the game resumed.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tempers flared again in the 85th minute, when Vinicius fouled Richard Rios. Benfica manager Jose Mourinho stormed towards the fourth official, demanding a second booking for the Brazilian, but was himself cautioned ‌for ‌his protests.</p><p class=\"p1\">An incensed Mourinho continued remonstrating, and was promptly shown a second yellow card.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320967\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320967\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320967\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_6994e1b47f-1771364788.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"LISBON, PORTUGAL - FEBRUARY 17: Jose Mourinho, Head Coach of Benfica, is shown a red card by referee Francois Letexier during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Knockout Play-off First Leg match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid C.F. at Estadio do SL Benfica on February 17, 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal.

There is no place for it in football or society. It is disgusting.”</p><p>Mourinho criticised Vinicius Junior’s celebration and defended the club – if not Prestianni – against allegations of racism.</p><p>“Words were exchanged. I want to be independent. I don’t want to say I believe in Prestianni or believe in Vinicius,” he said.</p><p>“I told [Vinicius], ‘When you score a goal like that, you just celebrate in a respectful way’. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was Black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"galatasaray-thrash-juve-5-2\">Galatasaray thrash Juve 5-2</h2><p>Elsewhere on Tuesday, Dutch midfielder Noa Lang scored a brace as Galatasaray thumped Juventus 5-2 in a pulsating contest in Istanbul in the first leg of a Champions League playoff.</p><p class=\"p1\">In a nerve-shredding atmosphere, Luciano Spalletti’s Juventus actually led 2-1 at half-time after Teun Koopmeiners replied to Brazilian midfielder Gabriel Sara’s opener with a brace of his own.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Colombian full-back Juan Cabal was dismissed for two bookings in a calamitous second half for the Italian side, as Lang’s brace and goals from Davinson Sanchez and Sacha Boey sunk Juventus.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, Champions League holders Paris Saint Germain overcame a horror start and a two-goal deficit to beat 10-man Monaco 3-2 away in the first leg of their knockout round ⁠playoff tie.</p><p class=\"p1\">Desire Doue came off the bench to engineer an impressive turnaround for PSG, who conceded a goal in the opening minute and were 2-0 down after 18 minutes as Folarin Balogun grabbed a double for ⁠the hosts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 20-year-old Doue replaced Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele, who went off injured after 27 minutes, and proved decisive for the visitors as he struck two superb goals, as well as setting one up for Achraf Hakimi.</p><p>In Germany, striker Serhou Guirassy ⁠scored one ⁠goal and created another as hosts Borussia Dortmund claimed a ⁠2-0 victory over Italian visitors Atalanta in the first leg ⁠of their Champions League playoff tie on Tuesday.</p></div></div></body></html>"
