Columbia is very sick too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,” Trump said, in seeming reference to Colombian President Gustavo Petro. “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.”</p><p>When one reporter asked, “So there would be an operation by the US?”, Trump replied, “Sounds good to me.”</p><p>Petro’s administration has long touted its efforts to crack down on cocaine trafficking, by destroying laboratories where the drug is produced and intercepting shipments.</p><p>Last November, Petro celebrated what his government called <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/colombia-hails-historic-blow-after-largest-cocaine-bust-in-a-decade\">the largest cocaine seizure</a> in a decade, with 14 tonnes, <a href=\"https://x.com/mindefensa/status/1991946915492053101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">worth nearly $388.9m</a>, confiscated as it reached Buenaventura’s port on the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>There is no evidence that Petro himself is involved in any narcotics trafficking, despite Trump’s claims to the contrary.</p><p>He and Trump, however, have long exchanged barbs, with Petro criticising the Republican leader for his hardline immigration policies, his support for Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, and his deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Trump has responded by taking action against Petro, stripping the Colombian president of his US visa in September and sanctioning him in October.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"escalating-rhetoric\">Escalating rhetoric</h2><p>Petro is the first left-wing president to lead Colombia’s government, and his term ends in 2026.</p><p>He has denounced the US attack on Venezuela and warned that Latin America must unite to avoid being treated as “a servant and a slave” to foreign interests.</p><p>“The US is the first country in the world to bomb a South American capital in all of human history,” Petro <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2008001606780887517\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on Sunday.</p><p>“What a terrible distinction that is, because South Americans will not forget it for generations. The wound remains open for a long time.”</p><p>He later made reference to his time as a rebel fighter during his teens and 20s, when he participated in Colombia’s six-decade-long internal armed conflict. He suggested he would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/colombias-petro-promises-to-defend-homeland-amid-trump-threats\">take up arms again</a> if Colombia faced foreign attack.</p><p>“I swore not to touch another weapon since the 1989 peace agreement, but for the sake of the homeland, I will take up arms again, even though I don’t want to,” Petro <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2008063024343515623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media.</p><p>For her part, Villavicencio has emphasised in a statement that Colombia is addressing drug trafficking with “rigour, sacrifice, and a comprehensive approach”.</p><p>On Tuesday, she added that her ministry rejects any threats against Latin American sovereignty, as well as towards Colombia’s democratically elected president.</p><p>“An offence against the president is an offence against our country and a disregard for all the democratic processes that we have carried out,” she said.</p><p>She is slated to meet members of the US Department of State later in the day.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.</p><p>On Saturday, in the hours after the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/what-is-the-war-powers-act-and-can-it-stop-trump-from-attacking-iran\">resolution</a> to rein in US President Donald Trump’s military actions.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.</p><p>Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.</p><p>But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.</p><p>Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.</p><p>“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.</p><p>“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"an-uphill-battle\">An uphill battle</h2><p>Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.</p><p>That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.</p><p>That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.</p><p>Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.</p><p>The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.</p><p>Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.</p><p>But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/how-the-us-attack-on-venezuela-abduction-of-maduro-unfolded\">US operation</a> on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.</p><p>“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.</p><p>In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.</p><p>“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.</p><h2 id=\"republicans-ho-hum-about-resolutions\">Republicans ho-hum about resolutions</h2><p>Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.</p><p>Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p>No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.</p><p>When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">war powers resolution</a> requiring Congressional approval for further actions.</p><p>Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.</p><p>However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.</p><p>Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.</p><p>In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.</p><p>December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/us-republicans-back-trump-on-venezuela-amid-faint-maga-dissent\">tiny fragment</a> of his party.</p><p>Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.</p><p>“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.</p><p>Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.</p><p>That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/DWStweets/status/2007515364553568526?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.</p><p>“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.</p><p>In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/fact-checking-trump-following-us-capture-of-venezuelas-maduro\">sought to send</a> the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.</p><p>Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.</p><p>“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”</p><p>Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.</p><p>That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">formally sworn in</a> as the country’s interim president on Monday.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.</p><p>The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.</p><p>Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/2025-trumps-year-of-emergency-invasion-and-narcoterrorism\">growing power</a> over the military.</p><p>“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.</p><p>“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.</p><p>“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His contract with the club expires at the end of the current season, and the Austrian has indicated that talks on a new contract are currently on hold.</p><p>The 51-year-old has an 11-year managerial experience, having coached two teams in the Austrian top tier, as well as Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt in the German league.</p><h3 id=\"darren-fletcher\">Darren Fletcher</h3><p>The former United midfielder, who graduated from the Manchester United Academy to first time in 2003 and spent 12 years playing under Ferguson, is among the favourites after landing the interim manager’s role.</p><p>Fletcher has been the head coach of United’s academy since July and was the first choice to steer the ship after Amorim’s exit.</p><p>A firm fan favourite during his playing days, the 41-year-old could take the route of his former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who earned the full-time manager’s role after coming on as interim manager.</p><h3>Enzo Maresca</h3><p>While Maresca’s departure from Chelsea was similar to Amorim’s at United, the Italian had a successful first season in London, winning the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup.</p><p>The former Manchester City U-23 and Parma manager led Leicester City back to the Premier League in 2024 before being snapped up by Chelsea.</p><p>Maresca has been favoured to swiftly find a role in the top tier of European football, and Old Trafford could be his next stop.</p><h2 id=\"ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2><p>Solskjaer’s playing and managerial spells at United have endeared him to the club’s faithful, who insist that his knowledge of the “Fergie Way” could bring back the glory days.</p><p>In terms of results, the Norwegian did not land any major trophies during his reign at United but managed to lead the team to a Europa League final and a second-place finish in 2021.</p><p>Solskjaer is currently out of work, having been sacked by Turkish side Besiktas after eight months in charge, and any long-term appointment would most likely require another successful interim period first.</p><h2 id=\"thomas-tuchel\">Thomas Tuchel</h2><p>The current England manager is focused on leading the Three Lions at the upcoming World Cup, but his name is being thrown around for the job at United before the new season’s beginning in August 2026.</p><p>The German is no stranger to winning trophies at major European clubs, having done it at Chelsea, PSG and Bayern Munich.</p><h2 id=\"gareth-southgate\">Gareth Southgate</h2><p>Often regarded as a serious candidate for the role of manager of Manchester United during his England tenure, Southgate’s stock appears to have fallen of late.</p><p>The former Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and England defender’s only management experience at club level came with Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2009. He then took charge of the England under-21 side in 2013 before being appointed manager of the full national team in 2016, a role he held until he stood down in 2024.</p><p>United fans, however, appeared consistent in their concerns about Southgate throughout all his previous links to the job over his pragmatic approach to the game. The 54-year-old was perceived by vocal United fans as stifling the attacking talents of the English team, something not in keeping with the United philosophy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,” he said through an interpreter, before he was cut off by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court.</p><p>Maduro called himself a POW, a person captured and held by an enemy during an armed conflict.</p><p>Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who appeared in court on Monday as a codefendant, also pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Other Venezuelan leaders have echoed Maduro’s position. On Saturday, his then-deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on state television alongside her brother, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.</p><p>However, on Monday, the day when Rodriguez took over as Venezuela’s interim president, she posted a statement on social media offering to cooperate with Trump. In the statement, she invited Trump to “collaborate” and sought “respectful relations”.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,” she wrote.</p><p>The Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations, Samuel Moncada, said, “We cannot ignore a central element of this US aggression.”</p><p>“Venezuela is the victim of these attacks because of its natural resources,” Moncada said, according to the UN website.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-us-position\">What is the US position?</h2><p>The US has described the January 3 special operation in Caracas during which Maduro was abducted as a law enforcement operation.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Kristen Welker of NBC’s Meet the Press on Monday that the US and Venezuela were not at war.</p><p>“We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela,” he said.</p><p>The US ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, said the operation was necessary to combat narcotics trafficking and transnational organised crime threatening US and regional security.</p><p>“There is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,” Waltz said, according to the UN website. “This was a law-enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades.”</p><p>However, Rubio’s words contradicted Trump’s statements.</p><p>During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump told reporters that the US is ready to carry out a second military strike on Venezuela if its government refuses to cooperate with his plan to “resolve” the situation there.</p><p>“Marco Rubio is not the President. Trump has declared unequivocally that the United States is engaged armed conflict with Venezuela to justify more than 100 murders of alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific,” constitutional law expert Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Starting in September, the US military launched a series of strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific on boats that it claimed were carrying narcotics. More than 100 people have been killed in at least 30 such boat bombings, but the Trump administration has yet to present any public evidence that there were drugs on board, that the vessels were travelling to the US or that the people on the boats belonged to banned organisations as the US has claimed.</p><p>“If the United States were not a war, Trump would confess he is engaged in mass murder of civilians.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-significance-of-maduro-s-pow-claim\">What is the significance of Maduro’s POW claim?</h2><p>If Maduro is indeed a POW, then protections under international law apply to him.</p><p>The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 mandates humane treatment, respect and protection for POWs.</p><p>According to the convention, a POW can be tried and sentenced in another country, particularly the detaining power, but only for certain crimes such as war crimes.</p><p>Maduro, however, has been charged with narcotics-related offences, not with war crimes.</p><p>And in general, the Third Geneva Convention requires that POWs must be returned “without delay” to their nation as soon as the conflict ends.</p><p>“According to President Trump, Maduro is a prisoner of war because Trump declared Maduro had initiated war against the United States via drug trafficking leading to overdose deaths. That would mean the Geneva Conventions would apply but which Trump will certainly disregard,” Fein said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-other-experts-say\">What do other experts say?</h2><p>Susanne Gratius, a professor of political science and international relations at the Autonomous University of Madrid, told Al Jazeera that the US attempts to portray Maduro’s abduction as a law-and-order exercise did not hold up in the face of facts.</p><p>“They sell the operation as a domestically motivated drugs issue, but it is clearly not. They violated national sovereignty. Even though Maduro is a dictator, there is no legal argument to hijack him and his wife through a US military operation,” Gratius said, referring to Maduro’s refusal to quit office despite widespread accusations that he lost controversial elections in 2024.</p><p>The US attack, she said, was a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter, which decrees that all members are sovereign equals. “Regime change or access to oil do not justify unilateral military interventions.”</p><p>Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that the US involvement in Venezuela was “less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits”.</p><p>Venezuela is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels as of 2023 – it earns <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">only a fraction</a> of the revenue it once did from exporting crude.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below the leading exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn). This is largely because of US sanctions on Venezuelan oil.</p><p>“This [oil] is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources,” Bantekas said.</p><p>Experts also point to the months-long military campaign that the Trump administration waged against Venezuela before Maduro’s abduction — including the bombing of boats — to underscore why it is hard to justify the US attack as a law-and-order operation.</p><p>“Trump’s seizure of Venezuelan oil and displacement of Venezuelan sovereignty are acts of war,” Fein said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Last year, the US designated it as a “terrorist” group. The Trump administration built its case against Maduro, asserting that he was its leader.</p><p>In December, the US had accused Venezuela of trafficking fentanyl, dubbing it a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-signs-executive-order-labeling-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction\">“weapon of mass destruction”</a>. However, when the charges were announced against Maduro on Monday, fentanyl was not mentioned.</p><p>US Vice President JD Vance had on Sunday still insisted that some fentanyl did originate from Venezuela.</p><p>Analysts have pointed out confusing messaging coming from the Trump administration regarding the aim behind the brazen operation and how to move forward. Experts have also questioned the legality of the operation that saw the reported killing of at least 40 people.</p><p>The Trump administration insists Maduro’s abduction was legal and that the Maduro government is not legitimate.</p><p>In the meantime, Maduro’s deputy, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, who was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Monday, has expressed eagerness to collaborate with the US.</p><p>At the moment, the question of who will govern Venezuela is hanging in the balance. There are some key differences in what Trump and Rubio have said.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-rubio-said\">What has Rubio said?</h2><p>Rubio spoke to multiple news outlets on Sunday and Monday, as he defended the US actions and spelled out the reasoning behind the operation that has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/us-critics-and-allies-condemn-maduros-abduction-at-un-security-council\">condemned</a> by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC’s Meet the Press, Rubio said: “We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela.”</p><p>The seizure of “drug boats” will continue, he said, referring to the dozens of strikes on vessels near the Venezuelan coast since September that have killed more than 100 people.</p><p>“No more drug trafficking … and no more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world and not benefitting the people of Venezuela or, frankly, benefitting the United States and the region,” Rubio told NBC on Sunday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Additionally, Rubio told NBC that the US does not need Venezuelan oil and has plenty of its own oil. “What we’re not going to allow is for the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by adversaries of the United States,” he said, naming Russia, Iran and China.</p><p>“This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States, simple as that.”</p><p>Rubio told NBC’s Welker that since 2014, about eight million Venezuelans have fled the country, driven by the systematic theft and mismanagement of the country’s oil wealth by Maduro and his inner circle, instead of it being used to benefit the Venezuelan people. He said the migration was “destabilising” the region.</p><p>According to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees updated in May 2025, nearly 7.9 million people have left Venezuela. Analysts point out that the punitive US sanctions played a significant role in the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, which worsened the migrant crisis.</p><p>Rubio on Sunday reiterated that the US will continue to enforce an existing “oil quarantine”.</p><p>“We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking,” Rubio told a local news outlet.</p><p>Accusations that Venezuela is the main source of drugs entering the US are false, experts say.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>Rubio’s recent statements differ from what Trump has said about Venezuela.</p><p>While Rubio said the US does not want to govern Venezuela and is not interested in its oil, Trump suggested different ideas a day earlier.</p><p>During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>Trump added that US oil companies would fix Venezuela’s “broken infrastructure” and “start making money for the country”.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-s-the-plan\">So what’s the plan?</h2><p>Elvira Dominguez-Redondo, a professor of international law at Kingston University in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera that there is no basis to comment on whether Washington has a coherent plan.</p><p>“From the outside, it is impossible to know what the next steps of the US will be, particularly given the contradictory public statements coming from senior figures.”</p><p>She added: “What I can say, based on observable facts, is that there is no full-scale military invasion or formal assumption of governmental authority by the US. What appears to have occurred instead is the removal of Maduro while allowing the rest of the governing apparatus to remain in place, under conditions that are not publicly known. Whether and how this was negotiated is unclear.”</p><p>Dominguez-Redondo said the US cannot legally invade and govern Venezuela, since this would amount to occupation under international law.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-latest-political-situation-in-venezuela\">What’s the latest political situation in Venezuela?</h2><p>Sworn in as the interim leader on Monday, Rodriguez, 56, told the National Assembly, “I come with pain over the kidnapping of two heroes who are being held hostage: President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores.”</p><p>“I swear to work tirelessly to guarantee the peace, spiritual, economic and social tranquillity of our people.”</p><p id=\"interim-venezuelan-leader-invites-trump-to-collaborate-and-seeks-respectful-relations-in-newly-conciliatory-message\">A day earlier, she had offered to work with Trump and sought “respectful relations” in a conciliatory message.</p><p>“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” Rodriguez wrote on social media.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war.”</p><p>On Saturday, Rodriguez had appeared on state television alongside her brother, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219110\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-venezuela_leaders-1767699346.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - venezuela_leaders-1767699346\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-key-leaders-in-venezuela-s-chavista-government\">Who are the key leaders in Venezuela’s Chavista government?</h2><p id=\"it-will-also-include-key-personalities-currently-present-in-caracas\">The key leaders shaping Venezuela’s next political chapter include acting President Rodriguez, who was part of Maduro’s inner circle. Her brother Jorge is also an important leader.</p><p>The other key leaders include Interior Minister Cabello – considered powerful in the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela – and Defence Minister Lopez.</p><p>When asked what action the Venezuelan government and the military could take against any US intervention, Kingston University’s Dominguez-Redondo said, “In practical terms, very little.”</p><p>“If the Venezuelan military were capable of mounting a meaningful response, it would likely have done so already.”</p><p>She pointed out how the US involvement in Venezuela did not begin with the abduction of Maduro, but with attacks on boats in Venezuelan waters that the US alleged were carrying drugs.</p><p>“These were Venezuelan boats, and even if they were engaged in trafficking, the killings were extrajudicial executions. From a legal perspective, those incidents could have been characterised as an armed attack, potentially triggering a right of self-defence by Venezuela.</p><p>“Yet Venezuela did not respond militarily and limited itself to condemnation. The escalation then continued through the seizure of Venezuelan oil, and finally, the capture of Maduro. The sequence strongly suggests that the Venezuelan military lacks the capacity to respond effectively.”</p><p>Dominguez-Redondo added that it is also unlikely that other countries will take action against the US involvement in Venezuela.</p><p>“The only body capable of imposing sanctions that are legally binding on all states is the UNSC. However, this body cannot act against the US as a permanent member with veto power. As a result, there is no credible mechanism capable of constraining the US in the short term.”</p><p>Venezuela also has Colectivos, which are decentralised, pro-government armed civilian groups with multiple individual leaders.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-main-opposition-leaders\">Who are the main opposition leaders?</h2><p>On Saturday, Trump ruled out the possibility of working with opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/venezuelas-machado-says-she-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-since-october\">Maria Corina Machado</a>, saying Machado does not have enough support in Venezuela.</p><p>Machado, seen as the most credible adversary of Maduro’s left-wing government, is a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly and a free-market advocate. She fled the country last month.</p><p>Another prominent opposition leader is <a href=\"/news/2024/10/24/venezuelan-opposition-leaders-machado-gonzalez-win-eus-top-rights-prize\">Edmundo Gonzalez</a>, who ran against Maduro in the 2024 election after Machado was barred from running. He is currently based in Spain after fleeing Venezuela in September 2024 following an arrest warrant.</p><h2 id=\"after-maduro-who-might-be-next\">After Maduro, who might be next?</h2><p>After Maduro’s abduction, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trump-threatens-colombias-petro-says-cuba-looks-like-its-ready-to-fall\">threatened military action</a> against his <a href=\"/features/2026/1/6/colombia-prepares-for-refugee-influx-after-us-strikes-on-venezuela\">Colombian</a> counterpart, Gustavo Petro, adding he believed the government in Cuba, too, was likely to fall soon.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that Venezuela and Colombia were “very sick” and called Petro “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.</p><p>“And he’s not going to be doing it very long. Let me tell you.”</p><p>When asked if he meant a US operation against Colombia, Trump said, “Sounds good to me.”</p><p>Petro retorted in a series of posts on X on Sunday, saying he would “take up arms” for his country if necessary.</p><p>“I have enormous trust in my people,” he said. “And that is why I have asked the people to defend the president from any illegitimate violent act against him.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
