But within hours, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt hit back, accusing Ramaphosa of “running his mouth,” insisting that the US position had not changed, and that the South African leader’s comments were “not appreciated by the president [Trump] or his team.”</p><p>She did, however, indicate that the US would send an official for the handover ceremony, as it takes over the G20’s presidency from South Africa. Acting US ambassador to South Africa Marc D Dillard might be the official tasked with this responsibility, though this has not yet been confirmed.</p><p>Despite the drama over the US attendance, Johannesburg has been buzzing with activity all week in preparation for the summit, as workers clean up and decorate the bustling city. Ramaphosa himself drew surprise when he donned dungarees and picked up cleaning tools.</p><p>Bright flowers and colourful G20 billboards adorn the streets through which dignitaries will pass on their way from the OR Tambo International Airport into the city.</p><p>At least 3,500 extra police officials have been deployed to bolster security for the high-level guests, while the army has been placed on standby.</p><p>Some South Africans, though, have voiced criticism of the expensive event, pointing to the economic challenges the country faces. Several protests by organisations from climate action groups to women’s rights defenders are also planned around the airport and the venue of the summit.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the summit:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121308\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121308\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-21T080320Z_228901625_RC2V0IA59VR3_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1-1763716414.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"g20 MEETING\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banners featuring European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Angola’s President Joao Lourenco are displayed inside the secured area of the G20 summit venue ahead of the meeting scheduled for November 22–23, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 21, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-the-g20-and-when-is-the-summit\">What is the G20, and when is the summit?</h2><p>The G20 was founded in 1999 as an informal economic grouping of the world’s biggest economic powers.</p><p>But it was the 2008 economic crisis that propelled the G20 into prominence: In a world where major Global South economies like China and India were playing increasingly vital roles, the G7 grouping of seven wealthy nations was no longer equipped to stop the financial bloodbath that spanned continents.</p><p>Since then, G20 leaders have met at least once every year for summits.</p><p>The grouping originally comprised 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States), plus the European Union as the 20th entity. Since 2023, the African Union has been a member, too. Combined, they represent 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the world’s population, according to the G20.</p><p>G20 country representatives meet throughout the year to discuss pressing issues. But in November, the leaders meet for the annual summit.</p><p>The leaders’ summit marks the culmination of the host country’s yearlong stewardship and usually ends with a non-binding leaders’ declaration. In Brazil last November, leaders issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by a 2030 deadline.</p><p>South Africa has held the presidency since November 2024 and will hand over to the US on November 30, 2025. This weekend’s meeting will take place over two days from Saturday, November 22 at Johannesburg’s 150,000 square-metre Nasrec Expo Centre, the country’s largest convention centre.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-attending\">Who is attending?</h2><p>Forty-two countries and organisations have confirmed their attendance, according to South African officials speaking to reporters on Monday.</p><p>At least six heads of state are not attending the summit, though apart from the US, the others are sending high-level representatives, Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said, describing this attendance rate is a “success” for South Africa.</p><p>Some of the most notable names expected at the summit include: China’s Premier Li Qiang, French President Emmanuel Macron, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><p></p><p>African Union Commission chairperson Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, President of European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will also be present.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-boycotting-the-summit-this-year\">Why is the US boycotting the summit this year?</h2><p>Trump’s absence from the meeting will be the most notable and has threatened to overshadow the summit’s agenda and undermine South Africa’s position.</p><p>Last week, the US president denounced South Africa’s leadership of the G20 and said he would not attend, citing alleged discrimination against South Africa’s minority white population and inaccurately alleging a “genocide” of white farmers.</p><p>Trump has made several unsubstantiated claims of “genocide” since he returned to the White House in January, following South Africa’s passing of a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new law</a> seeking to address disparities in land ownership, three-quarters of which is owned by the country’s white minority.</p><p>In February, the Trump administration cut foreign aid to South Africa, a move which could be a major threat to the nation’s HIV response, according to experts.</p><p>During a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">heated exchange</a> with Trump at the White House in May, President Ramaphosa denied claims of a “white genocide” and said South Africa generally experiences high crime rates, which affect all ethnicities.</p><p>In July, Trump said that while he might not attend the G20 summit, he would send Vice President JD Vance instead. However, on November 8, Trump doubled down on claims of “human rights abuses” by South Africa in a post on his social platform Truth Social, and said <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/trump-says-us-to-boycott-south-africa-g20-summit-over-white-genocide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no US official </a>would be attending the forum.</p><p>“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote, while recounting his claims again. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue. I look forward to hosting the 2026 G20 in Miami, Florida!” he added.</p><p>South African officials have attempted to downplay the US’s absence. Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists in Cape Town after Trump’s announcement, said the action would likely not have an impact.</p><p>“It is unfortunate that the United States has decided not to attend the G20,” he said. “All I can say in my experience in politics is that boycotts never really work. They have a very contradictory effect.”</p><p>In another comment to the media, Ramaphosa told reporters the US boycott was “their loss”. The South African leader, this week, however, said he would hand over the presidency to an empty seat meant for the US representative in a symbolic gesture, and stressed the need to repair ties with Washington.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3725273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3725273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3725273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-21T175538Z_211099346_RC2GMEAOPQ99_RTRMADP_3_USA-SAFRICA-1747856541.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa looks towards a monitor (not pictured) that shows videos allegedly pertaining to the genocide of white people in South Africa, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 21, 2025.

Milei did not state why he withdrew.</li>\n<li>China’s Foreign Ministry on November 14 also announced that President Xi Jinping had cancelled his attendance at the meeting, and would instead be represented by Prime Minister Li Qiang. The ministry did not state why, but South Africa and China have a thriving trade relationship. President Xi was in the country for the 2023 BRICS summit, another informal grouping of developing powers.</li>\n<li>The Kremlin announced in October that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin would not attend the meeting, and would instead send his deputy head of the presidential administration, Maxim Oreshkin. Putin is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Ukraine and, as a signatory, South Africa is legally obliged to arrest him if he sets foot in the country.</li>\n<li>Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu cancelled his trip after 25 girls were kidnapped this week from their school amid a security crisis in the country.</li>\n<li>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum will not attend due to scheduled appointments in the country, the government announced this week. Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente usually represents her abroad.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-agenda\">What’s on the agenda?</h2><p>South Africa, as host, will emphasise issues which affect Global South countries and is hoping to persuade leaders to collectively pledge their commitment to addressing topics from economic inequalities to improving development financing for vulnerable countries.</p><p>South Africa will also lobby countries to commit to scaling up their spending on climate-disaster resilience and disaster responses globally; increase the amount of climate finance flowing from richer to poorer nations; provide better debt restructuring and relief for poorer nations via international financial institutions and bilateral lending; and prioritise local communities and source countries amid a race among global powers for access to critical minerals, some of which are concentrated in African countries.</p><p>South Africa has not hosted an international event on this scale since the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Despite the snub from the US, this is an important moment for the country, and for Africa, Gilad Isaacs, executive director of South African think tank, the Institute for Economic Justice, told Al Jazeera, saying Pretoria has put “real issues” affecting African countries on the agenda this time.</p><p>“The US boycott will not derail the work,” Isaacs said. “The credibility of the presidency will be measured not by the presence of any one country, but by whether the agenda set in the interests of the Global South is carried through and used in other forums.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-21T074732Z_1002669083_RC2U0IAB4B0J_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1763716594.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"g20\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banners featuring world leaders are displayed inside the secured area of the G20 summit venue ahead of the meeting scheduled for November 22–23, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 21, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-protests-are-planned\">What protests are planned?</h2><p>Several protests are being planned around the event, starting on Friday. Deputy national commissioner for policing Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili told reporters on Tuesday that authorities are expecting protests in Johannesburg and other major South African cities.</p><p>“We will allow that right (to protest) to be exercised,” she said. “But within the proper directives and proper confines of the law.”</p><h3 id=\"femicide-protests\">Femicide protests</h3><p>One of the largest demonstrations is planned by the Women for Change advocacy group, which is calling for a national shutdown on Friday, the eve of the summit, to protest against South Africa’s soaring rates of violence against women and femicide. Three women are killed by intimate partners every day, according to government figures.</p><p>The organisation has led a significant social media campaign in the days leading up to the event to create awareness. On Friday, it is asking South African women to boycott work and school and to wear all black to signify mourning. Women are also being urged to lie down for 15 minutes at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the women murdered.</p><p>“Because, until South Africa stops burying a woman every 2.5 hours, the G20 cannot speak of growth and progress,” Women for Change said in a campaign statement.</p><p>In an impassioned statement during a sideline G20 event on Thursday evening, President Ramaphosa attempted to show solidarity with women, declaring gender-based violence and femicide both a national and global crisis. Women’s rights groups, however, say they are pushing for femicide to be declared a national disaster.</p><h3>Climate change protests</h3><p>On Thursday, a coalition of climate change and wealth inequality activists called The Citizen began an alternative summit in Johannesburg, decrying the G20 gathering as “for the rich”.</p><h3>White minority protests</h3><p>Separately, Solidarity, a trade union representing members of South Africa’s Afrikaner white minority, is also set to protest against the alleged marginalisation of white South Africans. The organisation has put up controversial billboards around Johannesburg that say: “Welcome to the most RACE-REGULATED country in the world.”</p><h3>Unemployment protests</h3><p>Meanwhile, Operation Dudula, a South African anti-immigration group, says it will protest against joblessness and poverty in the country. South Africa’s 31 percent unemployment rate is one of the highest in the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

“always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I’ve been despised in Washington, DC, and never fit in”.</p><p>“I will be resigning from office with my last day being January 5, 2026,” she said.</p><p>Greene said she did not want her supporters and family to endure “a <a

responded to the news, saying: “I think it’s great news for the country”.</p><p>“It’s great,” ABC News quoted Trump as saying in an interview.</p><p></p><p>Previously an icon of Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Greene had a very public falling out with Trump, with the president announcing earlier this month that he was withdrawing all support for the congresswoman he described as “‘Wacky’ Marjorie”.</p><p>Greene has cited as a cause for her rift with Trump her outspoken advocacy for releasing the government’s files on <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/11/21/aje-onl-usa_epstein_av_v3-201125\">convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p><p>Trump had dismissed the Epstein issue as a “Democrat hoax” and has struggled with uproar in his MAGA base over his <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">U-turn on a pre-election promise</a> to release government files on the case.</p><p>But under mounting pressure from within his own party and Democrats, Trump signed a bill this week to release the Epstein files after a motion to release them passed in the House and Senate with overwhelming support.</p><p>In her resignation statement, Greene referenced the Epstein controversy.</p><p>“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Greene also this year became the first Republican lawmaker to call US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide.</p><p>Trump followed up his withdrawal of support for Greene earlier this month with multiple posts on his Truth Social platform attacking the lawmaker as a “lightweight” and even a “traitor” to the Republican Party.</p><p>Greene subsequently said she was being targeted by a wave of threats.</p><p>The move by Greene to resign from Congress before the 2026 midterms is the clearest sign yet of a growing split in the MAGA world amid strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, and Trump’s warm White House meeting earlier on Friday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trump-and-mamdani-hope-for-positive-relationship-after-productive-meeting\">New York’s

We never thought about it.”</p><p>But Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.</p><p>Zohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">Israel’s abuses against Palestinians</a>, long considered a taboo subject in US politics.</p><p>He is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.</p><p>“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”</p><p>“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-mamdani-family\">Inside the Mamdani family</h2><p>The son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.</p><p>He earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>When Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.</p><p>Mahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”</p><p>He traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.</p><p>Living with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.</p><p>“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122211\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122211\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-05T050247Z_1026356933_RC24QHAXIBXO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR-1-1763758816.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani and his family\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani stands with his wife Rama Duwaji, mother Mira Nair and father Mahmood Mamdani after winning the 2025 New York City mayoral race [Jeenah Moon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-mood-of-change\">A ‘mood of change’</h2><p>Mahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.</p><p>“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”</p><p>Local media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.</p><p>Mahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.</p><p>“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”</p><p>Mahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor.

Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.</p><p>The two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.</p><p>Only on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge.

armed groups operating in the volatile east.</p><p>M23 seized Goma, eastern DRC’s largest city, in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Qatar has hosted multiple rounds of direct talks between the DRC government and M23 going back to April, but they have dealt largely with preconditions and confidence-building measures.</p><p>The two sides <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\">agreed</a> in July to a declaration of principles that left many key issues at the root of the conflict unresolved, and in October they reached a deal on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire.</p><p>The July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier,

Sometimes, many of them wear [army] uniforms. Sometimes these are soldiers on reserve duty that are on a break,” she said.</p><p>Some Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, have condemned settler violence, but Novak dismissed the move as a ploy to blame Israel’s policies on a “small group of crazy settlers”.</p><p>Novak also highlighted that most of the killing and destruction in the West Bank is carried out by official Israeli forces, not settlers. “So this is another arm of the violence that Israel inflicts on Palestinians,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-us-lawmakers\">Meeting US lawmakers</h2><p>Novak and her B’Tselem colleague Kareem Jubran have been in Washington, DC, this week, where they met with US lawmakers, including Democratic Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley and <a href=\"/video/the-bottom-line/2025/6/19/senator-van-hollen-netanyahu-outsmarted-trump-on-iran\">Chris Van Hollen,</a> as well as Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.</p><p>Novak said the group wants to stress the need for accountability for the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>“We are talking about a governing system, the Israeli system, that conducted genocide for two years — war crimes on a daily basis — and got away with it with no accountability,” she said.</p><p>“The current situation is probably the most dangerous that we’ve ever been in because not only this violence and this criminality took place, it was also normalised, and in any moment, it can start again, go back to the same scale.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that there is peace in the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years because of the truce he helped broker in Gaza.</p><p>And earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution backing the US president’s 20-point <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza\">plan for Gaza</a>, which calls for an end to the fighting, gradual Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of an international force to the territory.</p><p>The plan would also see Hamas disarm and Gaza’s governance handed over to an international commission, dubbed “the Board of Peace”.</p><p>It has no accountability or compensation mechanism for the horrors that Israel unleashed on Gaza for two years.</p><p>Novak said Trump’s plan is disconnected from the reality on the ground.</p><p>“It just allows everybody to move on, instead of dealing with the situation and demanding Israel not only to be held accountable but also stop this kind of systematic oppression over the Palestinians,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-plan\">Trump’s plan</h2><p>Since the Security Council embraced the ceasefire deal, Israel has faced less international pressure. Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">Eurovision </a><a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">singing contest</a> and European football have lost momentum.</p><p>On Monday, Germany announced it was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/germany-lifts-curbs-on-arms-exports-to-israel-citing-gaza-ceasefire\">lifting restrictions</a> on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.</p><p>“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.</p><p>Jubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza <a href=\"/news/2019/3/30/gazas-great-march-of-return-protests-explained\">from 2006 onwards</a> enabled the genocide.</p><p>“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Despite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.</p><p>“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.</p><p>“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
