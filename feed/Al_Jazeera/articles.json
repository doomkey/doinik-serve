Among the key priorities for the new government is rebuilding its national army and security forces.</p><p>For decades, Syria’s security apparatus and the military were considered by many as a brutal force to protect the regime and crack down on dissent.</p><p>The new interim government has begun the restructuring and recruiting process, focused on rebuilding the armed forces and adopting a new doctrine where loyalty is to the country.</p><p>“We started the process of restructuring our military and army … and we are meeting the need of the moment by having an army that Syria deserves as a nation to building an army that represents Syria and is able to face the challenges,’’ Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra said during a ceremony for soldiers graduating from a military academy in the city of Aleppo.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203857\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203857\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203857\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25342425007138-1767097957.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Syria Assad Fall Anniversary\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Syrian army soldiers stand on their armoured personnel carriers during a parade [Hussein Malla/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>“We will develop all branches of the armed forces and increase our military preparedness and efficiency to protect our nation. And we already issued rules of conduct and discipline,” Abu Qasra said after attending a military march by newly graduating candidates showing off their camouflage uniform and military vehicles and rifles.</p><p>But analysts warn that the process of rebuilding could be long and difficult, given the challenges that lie ahead – not least among them changing the mentality of armed groups and transforming them into part of an organised, professional army.</p><p>And among the main issues is vetting the large number of recruits to the country’s newly formed security forces, deciding whether to continue with Russian equipment, integrating forces from southern Syria and the <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces</a> (SDF) in the northeast, and building the trust of the country’s many minority groups.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The success of the Syrian armed forces would go a long way to providing political stability in the country, and, with it, possible foreign investment and support for the government in Damascus.</p><p>“If Syria fails to integrate all armed forces and former opposition groups into its army, it faces an existential challenge of fragmentation and disintegration,” Caroline Rose, director of military and national security priorities at the New Lines Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Without unification within its army and ongoing sectarian division, the country risks frequent security flashpoints – infighting between different armed groups and its armed forces – that could put Syria back on the path to civil war,” Rose explained.</p><h2 id=\"vetting\">Vetting</h2><p>When the al-Assad regime collapsed on December 8, 2024, so did its security apparatus and armed forces. Many abdicated and fled to neighbouring countries, some hid in their homes, and others turned in their weapons and military IDs to the new authority.</p><p>In the first hours after al-Assad fled, Israel also began <a href=\"/features/2024/12/11/israel-attack-syria-explainer\">widespread air attacks</a> around the country. On December 10, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had destroyed 80 percent of Syria’s strategic military capabilities. In the last year, Israel attacked Syria <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/israel-attacked-syria-more-than-600-times-over-the-past-year\">more than 600 times</a>.</p><p>“With Israel having destroyed much of Syria’s conventional land, aerial, and naval military equipment in the initial days after al-Assad’s fall, along with the fact that the new administration has purged many regime-era officers and soldiers from its ranks, the new Syrian Army is, in many ways, starting from scratch,” Rose said.</p><p>Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has dissolved the former army. His group, <a href=\"http://Who%20are%20Hayat%20Tahrir%20al-Sham%20and%20the%20Syrian%20groups%20that%20took%20Aleppo?%20|%20Syria's%20War%20News%20|%20Al%20Jazeera\">Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham</a> (HTS), which controlled the province of Idlib for years during Syria’s revolution and was the main fighting force that toppled al-Assad – along with other, smaller groups – makes up about 40,000 fighters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>With those numbers, the government would struggle to govern the entirety of Syria.</p><p>President al-Sharaa appointed military commanders and merged several anti-Assad factions into the new security apparatus and military. The Ministry of Defence now oversees the Syrian Armed Forces, while the Ministry of Interior oversees internal security forces such as the General Security. They also opened up recruitment to the general population, bringing in tens of thousands of new faces, which, according to analysts, brings two major problems.</p><p>The first was the breakneck speed of recruitment, due to the need for manpower, which meant vetting was sidelined. Thousands of young men in the 18-23-year-old age range sought these positions, at least, in part, because they were among the few economic prospects after years of sanctions, open conflict, and state pilfering destroyed Syria’s economy.</p><p>“It’s a very delicate balance to keep Syria’s security glued together,” Samy Akil, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s not about recruiting only; it’s about the merger of so many factions and no proper vetting process. I am sure after the one- or two-year benchmark, they can be more selective in the recruitment processes.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Also, a key problem for Syria’s new rulers is the issue of foreign fighters who played an integral part within numerous factions that fought against the al-Assad regime.</p><p>Western powers, including the US, had issued clear warnings to Damascus: No room for foreign fighters in any key military positions. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said on multiple occasions that those fighters will not assume key positions and ‘’will not pose any threat’’ to their countries.</p><p>The other major issue, according to analysts, is that there are still tens of thousands of officers or noncommissioned officers (NCOs) with military training who are unlikely to be integrated into Syria’s new security apparatus.</p><p>The Syrian defence minister has said that the army welcomed about 3000 regime-era soldiers back into its ranks after vetting. But analysts estimate that there is still a deficit of high and mid-level military officers with both conventional and irregular battlefield experience.</p><p>A report by the Washington, DC-based Middle East Institute quoted a Syrian military official as saying that about 70,000 Alawite officers and NCOs were in the Syrian army under al-Assad and were highly unlikely to be reinstated. Battle-hardened, military-capable men not serving in the country’s military could also pose a problem to Damascus.</p><p>On December 5, the Reuters news agency reported that Rami Makhlouf, a billionaire and al-Assad’s cousin, and Syria’s ex-intelligence chief Kamal Hassan “are spending millions of dollars in competing efforts to build fighting forces that would lead a revolt along Syria’s coast (al-Assad’s former stronghold)”. US media reports also indicated that Makhlouf is bankrolling a force made up of more than 160,000 Alawite and former army soldiers to revolt against the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"russia-or-the-us\">Russia or the US</h2><p>In the late years of al-Assad’s reign, Syria had become isolated internationally. Russia and Iran were among the few remaining allies, and analysts say that without them, al-Assad would not have been able to stay in power as long as he did.</p><p>But after al-Assad fled to Moscow in the early hours of December 8, Syria’s position in the international community quickly changed. Syria under al-Sharaa has gained crucial support from countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which had previously opposed al-Assad, while Iranian-Syrian relations were severed.</p><p>In November, al-Sharaa became the first Syrian president to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">visit the White House</a>, signalling warming ties between his country and the United States. But despite Russia’s support of al-Assad and providing him refuge, relations with the new Syrian government are not completely shattered.</p><p>“The biggest challenge the SAA faces is that it is essentially a Russian force in its doctrine and equipment,” Rob Geist Pinfold, a scholar of international security at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This means that whenever they need spare parts or more stock, it’s Russian equipment that they currently need to buy.</p><p>“This not only gives Russia some leverage over the government; it also creates problems for Syria-US relations, since the Trump administration wants to pry Damascus away from not just Tehran but Moscow as well,” Geist Pinfold added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203868\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203868\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203868\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25342311705237-1767098017.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Syria Assad Fall Anniversary\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203868\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fighters from the new Syrian army march with rocket-propelled grenade launchers during a parade [Omar Sanadiki/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to military equipment, a number of regional and international actors are working to bolster the Syrian military’s capabilities, analysts said.</p><p>“The US is most certainly playing a role in bolstering the Syrian Army’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) abilities through frequent intelligence exchange,” Rose, from the New Lines Institute, said.</p><p>“With Syria now in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, we should expect the US to foster a closer security relationship, sending advisers for training and guidance as Syria faces a potential resurgence from ISIS cells.”</p><p>In addition to the US, Turkiye signed a bilateral defence deal with Syria in August to provide training, advisory and technical support to the Syrian Armed Forces. Under the deal, 49 Syrian cadets (10 army, 18 navy and 21 air force) started undergoing training in Turkish academies, according to reports in Turkish media.</p><h2 id=\"integration-and-minorities\">Integration and minorities</h2><p>But even with international support, Syria’s security forces still need to build domestic legitimacy and gain trust.</p><p>Security forces were reportedly involved in sectarian massacres along <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/syria-launches-first-trial-over-coastal-violence-that-killed-thousands\">Syria’s coast</a> and in the southern region of <a href=\"/news/2025/8/3/tensions-high-as-new-violence-spirals-in-syrias-suwayda-despite-ceasefire\">Suwayda</a>. These incidents gained international attention but also eroded trust in the military among many inside the country.</p><p>“Opinion polls suggest most Sunni Arab Syrians still trust the army and the government. But minority communities do not,” Geist Pinfold said.</p><p>“For these groups, the SAA [Syrian Arab Army] is less an army and more a sectarian militia; they not only think it doesn’t protect them but is actively out to undermine their own interests and safety.”</p><p>That lack of trust also extends to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which control the country’s northeast. On March 10, the SDF and Damascus signed a deal to integrate SDF forces into the Syrian military before the end of 2025. Yet, tensions between the two sides are growing and at times <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">descending into clashes</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Supplies entering the besieged enclave are not meeting the nutritional needs of the people living there, the United Nations’ World Food Programme has said.

GDP per capita plummeted to $161, placing it among the lowest in the world.</p><p>Historically, the private sector in Gaza has been its largest economic engine, and it constitutes a large share of its GDP.</p><p>“It is the main driver in the Gaza Strip, where it used to contribute more than 52 percent of employment, relying on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the backbone,” explained Altabbaa, adding that the agricultural sector achieved self-sufficiency in many products, and the Gaza Strip contributed about 17 percent of the Palestinian GDP.</p><p>But the Strip’s economy was not great even before October 2023, since Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade in 2007.</p><p>Some local Palestinian estimates put poverty levels at more than 63 percent of the population before this war, and the British government estimated that about 80 percent of the population was dependent on humanitarian assistance beforehand.</p><p>The government in Gaza estimates that 90 percent of all sectors, including housing and infrastructure have now been wiped out. But it said it has plans to fix the economy and create jobs – but that will depend on multiple factors.</p><p>“Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they are best positioned to absorb the workforce in the short term, and regulating the market and preventing monopolies resulting from import restrictions – which have led to sharp price distortions and high inflation rates – are among the urgent needs to fix the situation,” Ismail al-Thawabta, the head of the Gaza Government Media Office, told Al Jazeera, estimating that total losses to the economy amounted to $70bn.</p><p>“We aim at building productive projects, not just relief efforts, as well as temporary and emergency employment programmes targeting youths, graduates and affected workers … in addition to building an accurate economic database to support decision-making and the development of future economic policies,” he said.

Let’s hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.”</p><p>Early on Saturday morning, Republican Senator Mike Lee questioned the legality of the attack. “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorisation for the use of military force,” he wrote on X.</p><p>Lee later said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him that US troops were executing a legal arrest warrant against Maduro.</p><p>“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” the senator said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dissent\">Dissent</h2><p>Republican Congresswoman <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/trump-ally-marjorie-taylor-greene-decries-genocide-in-gaza\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> was one of the few dissenting voices.</p><p>“Americans’ disgust with our own government’s never-ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,”  Greene wrote on X.</p><p>Greene, a former Trump ally who fell out with the US president and is leaving Congress next week, rejected the argument that Trump ordered Maduro’s “capture” because of the Venezuelan president’s alleged involvement in the drug trade.</p><p>She noted that Venezuela is not a major exporter of fentanyl, the leading cause of overdose deaths in the US.</p><p><span>She also underscored that, last month, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/juan-orlando-hernandez-freed-after-trumps-full-and-complete-pardon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump pardoned</a> former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a convicted drug trafficker who was serving a 45-year sentence in a US jail.</span></p><p>“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s [sic] tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene said.</p><p>Congressman Tomas Massie, another Republican, shared a speech he delivered in the House of Representatives earlier this month, warning that attacking Venezuela is about “oil and regime change”.</p><p>“Are we prepared to receive swarms of the 25 million Venezuelans, who will likely become refugees, and billions in American treasure that will be used to destroy and inevitably rebuild that nation? Do we want a miniature Afghanistan in the Western Hemisphere?” Massie said in the remarks.</p><p>“If that cost is acceptable to this Congress, then we should vote on it as a voice of the people and in accordance with our Constitution.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Massie and Greene are outliers in their party, Trump’s risky moves in Venezuela were a success in the short term: Maduro is in US custody at a minimal cost to Washington.</p><p>Similarly, few Republicans opposed the US war in Iraq when then-President George W Bush <a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">stood under</a> the “mission accomplished” sign on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln after toppling Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, in 2003.</p><p>But there is now a near consensus across the political spectrum that the Iraq invasion was a geopolitical disaster.</p><p>The fog of war continues to hang over Venezuela, and it is unclear who is in charge of the country, or how Trump will “run” it.</p><p>The US president has not ruled out deploying “boots on the ground” to Venezuela, raising the prospect of a US occupation and the possibility of another Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan.</p><p>“Do we truly believe that <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2026/1/3/what-are-the-implications-of-the-us-capture-of-nicolas-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a> will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in… Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie warned in his Congress speech.</p><p>“Previous presidents told us to go to war over WMDs, weapons of mass destruction, that did not exist.

The US president said Rodríguez had talked to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”.</p><p>However, Rodríguez criticised the US military action as “brutal aggression” on state television and called for Maduro’s immediate release.</p><p>Maduro has led Venezuela since 2013, succeeding an ideological ally, Hugo Chavez, who had been in office since 1999. Under both men, US relations with Venezuela frayed over foreign policy, oil and human rights.</p><p>In July 2024, Maduro declared victory after an election that international observers described as fraudulent. The country’s opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, reportedly received about 70 percent of the vote.</p><p>Tensions between Trump and Maduro escalated in September after the US government began attacking vessels off the coast of Venezuela, killing more than 100 people, in what Trump described as an effort to thwart drug smuggling.</p><p>When a reporter asked Trump during the Mar-a-Lago media event whether he had spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado “doesn’t have the support or the respect within the country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy in Venezuela, had a 72 percent approval rating from Venezuelans in a March 2025 poll by ClearPath Strategies.</p><p>Trump said, without evidence, that the US’s role in <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/3/live-loud-noises-heard-in-venezuelas-capital-amid-us-tensions\">governing Venezuela</a> “won’t cost us anything” because US oil companies would invest in new infrastructure in the oil-rich country. “It’s going to make a lot of money,” he said.</p><p>PolitiFact fact-checked Trump’s and Rubio’s statements from the news conference.</p><h2 id=\"rubio-it-s-just-not-the-kind-of-mission-that-you-can-pre-notify-congress-about-because-it-endangers-the-mission\">Rubio: “It’s just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify [Congress about] because it endangers the mission.”</h2><p><em>The Trump administration’s lack of warning to Congress bucks laws and precedents. </em></p><p>Rubio said that members of Congress were not notified in advance of the US actions on Venezuela. Trump said the administration was concerned about Congress potentially leaking news of the administration’s decision to capture Maduro.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, praised the operation as a “decisive action”.</p><p>But Congressional Democrats said that Congress should have been notified in advance. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, said, “Maduro is terrible. But Trump put American servicemembers at risk with this unauthorised attack.”</p><p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said Trump and his cabinet were not forthcoming about their intentions for regime change in Venezuela, so “we are left with no understanding of how the administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the US, and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation”.</p><p>The US Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time this happened was during World War II.</p><p>Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander-in-chief without an official declaration of war.</p><p>Since Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Resolution, the president has had to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing the US military into hostilities, and terminate the use of the military within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are granted for ending operations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In recent decades, congressional consent has usually been granted through an authorisation for the use of military force. But such an authorisation has not been passed for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/colombia-braces-with-alarm-after-maduros-removal-in-venezuela-by-us\">operations in Venezuela</a>. Kaine and other lawmakers have pursued legislation – so far fruitlessly –  to prohibit the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against Venezuela without congressional authorisation.</p><p>The Trump administration has whittled away at prior notification requirements. Under federal law, eight bipartisan senior members of Congress must receive prior notice of particularly sensitive covert actions. In June 2025, the administration told Republicans, but not Democrats, about a forthcoming US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. For the Venezuela operation, it appears no lawmakers were notified in advance.</p><h2 id=\"trump-each-us-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-saves-25-000-people\">Trump: Each US boat strike off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 people</h2><p>The Trump administration has struck at least 32 vessels, killing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/us-kills-three-in-attack-on-alleged-drug-boats-searches-for-survivors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 115 people,</a> in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean since September. Trump said previously that the boats were carrying drugs en route to the US, and during the news conference, he said the drugs on each boat would kill “on average, 25,000 people”.</p><p>However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact that the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the US. And the administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 73,000 US drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. This means that the drugs on 32 boats, which would have killed 800,000 people based on Trump’s claim, would be responsible for nearly 11 times the number of US overdose deaths in one year.</p><h2 id=\"trump-maduro-sent-savage-and-murderous-gangs-including-the-bloodthirsty-prison-gang-tren-de-aragua-to-terrorise-american-communities-nationwide\">Trump: “Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang Tren de Aragua, to terrorise American communities nationwide.”</h2><p>There is no evidence that Maduro sent members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua to the US.</p><p>The US Justice Department indictment against Maduro does not mention Trump’s statement.</p><p>An April report from the US National Intelligence Council contradicted Trump’s statements about links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua.</p><p>“While Venezuela’s permissive environment enables [Tren de Aragua, or TDA] to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” the report said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-venezuela-stole-us-oil-in-the-past\">Trump: Venezuela ‘stole’ US oil in the past.</h2><p>In the early 20th century, Venezuela’s long-serving hardline leader, Juan Vicente Gomez, allowed foreign companies almost exclusive access to the country’s oil resources.</p><p>In 1975, after decades of seeking greater control of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">its oil resources</a>, Venezuela nationalised its oil industry.</p><p>“Trump’s claim that Venezuela has stolen oil and land from the US is baseless,” Francisco Rodríguez, a Venezuelan economist at the University of Denver, told The Washington Post. “The US was much more interested in having Venezuela be a provider of oil — relatively cheap oil — than to have a production collapse in Venezuela,” Rodríguez added.</p><p>As a result, the change was “relatively uncontroversial” at the time, he said.</p><p>US oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil as well as Gulf, now Chevron, lost about $5bn each in assets, and were compensated $1bn each, according to news reports, The Washington Post reported.</p><p>But Rodríguez said the companies did not push for additional compensation at the time, in part because no forum existed to do so.</p><p>In general, experts have told PolitiFact that invading a country to take its oil would be both illegal and unethical. In 2016, Trump mused about how the US should have taken Iraq’s oil when it invaded to remove its then-leader, Saddam Hussein.</p><p>Experts pointed to the annex to The Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War, which says that “private property … must be respected [and] cannot be confiscated”. It also says that “pillage is formally forbidden”.</p><p>“If ‘to the victors go the spoils’ was legal doctrine, then we would have believed that [Saddam Hussein] should have been able to keep Kuwait City after he invaded [Kuwait]” in 1990, terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross told PolitiFact in 2016. “But we viewed that — quite rightly — as an act of aggression under the UN Charter.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The state of Roraima alone is home to 77,563 immigrants from the country. In all, some 8 million Venezuelans have fled their homes in the past decade, with more than 6 million resettling in other Latin American countries.</p><p>“I think it’s very possible that there will be an exodus of Venezuelans to Brazil, and, in fact, we are already seeing concrete signs of it,” Jessica Leon Cedeno, a Venezuelan journalist who lives in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Millions of people have left the country in search of better living conditions and opportunities.”</p><h2 id=\"lula-says-us-attacks-could-destabilise-the-region\">Lula says US attacks could ‘destabilise’ the region</h2><p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump’s actions <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-bombs-venezuela-us-captures-maduro-all-that-we-know\">inside Venezuela</a> were “unacceptable”.</p><p>“The bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” wrote Lula on X. “These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela’s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”</p><p>Brazil’s leader has urged restraint for months amid an increased US <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">military buildup</a> off Venezuela’s coast.</p><p>Analysts worry that Maduro’s removal could plunge Venezuela into chaos, potentially resulting in another wave of <a href=\"/news/2022/8/31/over-6-8-million-have-left-venezuela-since-2014-and-exodus-grows\">mass migration</a>, as it witnessed in 2019 after a failed attempt to remove Maduro.</p><p>Joao Carlos Jarochinski Silva, a professor of international relations at the Federal University of Roraima, said that a potential wave of migration would depend on multiple factors, including whether Washington continues its military campaign inside the country and whether what remains of Maduro’s regime will put up a fight.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What is the resilience capacity of Chavismo within Venezuela?” Jarochinski Silva said, referring to the political movement named after former President Hugo Chavez. “This could have consequences that are truly worrying, but given the current scenario, there is no context of fear.”</p><p>He added that Trump has so far focused on applauding his military’s action inside Venezuela and has not addressed key humanitarian concerns.
