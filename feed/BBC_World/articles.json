In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Darnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Was it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">No quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Luck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">None have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it.
