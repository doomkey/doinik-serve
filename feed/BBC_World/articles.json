class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The general in command of Venezuela's presidential honour guard, Javier Marcano Tábata, has been sacked days after Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was seized by US forces in a raid in Caracas and taken to New York to stand trial on narco-terrorism charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The presidential honour guard is the military force which provides the bodyguards tasked with protecting the head of state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Venezuelan government has not yet provided a detailed breakdown of casualties, members of the guard are thought to be among the dozens of people killed in the US operation to seize Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The order to replace Gen Marcano Tábata was issued by the new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez was sworn in by the National Assembly, which is dominated by government loyalists, on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She served as Maduro's vice-president and is considered to be a close ally of the jailed leader. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump said in the news conference following Maduro's seizure that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that the US was talking to Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also threatened that Rodríguez would face a \"fate worse than Maduro's\" if she did not comply with US demands, including those for oil, of which Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4grxzxjjd8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the US president said that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US</a>, but Venezuela's interim government has yet to comment on that statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez's tone has been alternating between defiant and conciliatory since she was designated interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She denounced the seizure of Maduro as an \"illegal kidnapping\" but has also said that her government had \"invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her actions are being watched closely both inside and outside of Venezuela to gauge what course she may steer now that she is in charge of the country and for signs of any potential rifts in her government.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sacking of Gen Marcano Tábata is one of the first changes to senior officials in her inner circle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as being in charge of the presidential guard, Gen Marcano Tábata also led Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit DGCIM. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DGCIM has played a key role in the repression of people critical of the Maduro government, according to the United Nations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission found that the counterintelligence unit had committed myriad human rights violations since 2013. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It documented scores of cases in which those detained were subjected to \"torture, sexual violence and/or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" in the DGCIM headquarters and a network of covert detention centres across the country</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, his sacking does not appear to be related to the repression carried out by the DGCIM under his helm as the man she has appointed to succeed him headed an intelligence service which faces similar accusations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo González López was in charge of Venezuela's national intelligence service, Sebin for many years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Sebin controls the notorious Helicoide prison in Caracas, where the UN documented abuses being carried out against \"opposition politicians, journalists, protesters, and human rights defenders\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan analysts think that Gen Marcano Tábata's dismissal is more likely to be related to the failure of the presidential honour guard to prevent the seizure of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela which has long provided security and intelligence services to Maduro, said that 32 of its nationals had been killed in the US raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of them are thought to have been embedded in the presidential honour guard.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What's at the heart of Cuba and Venezuela's

generals, were killed in the US strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some supporters of the government have said they felt \"humiliated\" by the way the US forces overpowered Venezuela's defence systems and Maduro's personal guard to seize the Venezuelan leader, who was later paraded before the cameras with his hands tied and in prison garb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Replacing Marcano Tábata could be an attempt by the interim president to surround herself with people she trusts at a time when the threat of another US strike hangs over her.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump said on Saturday that US forces had prepared a second wave of strikes but deemed it not necessary at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he has repeatedly said that non-compliance would mean Rodríguez would \"pay a very big price\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is not the only one in the interim government who could be targeted in a second strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reuters news agency reports quoting unnamed sources said to be familiar with the matter that Venezuela's hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, had been told by the Trump administration to fall into line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long accused Cabello of participating in a \"narco-conspiracy\", allegedly helping left-wing rebels ship cocaine to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January, the US state department increased its reward for information leading

Coalition aircraft launched strikes on the forces in response, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were \"unjustified\" and that Zubaidi was still in Aden.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, the STC's forces launched offensives to seize the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra from the government, saying they were necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south and combat the Houthis, al-Qaeda and Islamic State group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after the Houthis seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UAE expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, forces loyal to the government have largely retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In order to further diffuse tensions, Zubaidi and an STC delegation had been due to fly from Aden to Riyadh on Tuesday night for talks with the government. However, the coalition said the plane left three hours late without Zubaidi, who \"fled to an unknown location\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The legitimate government and the coalition received intelligence indicating that Zubaidi had moved a large force - including armoured vehicles, combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, and ammunition - from the Jabal Hadid and al-Solban camps [in Aden] towards al-Dhale,\" coalition spokesman Maj-Gen Turki al-Malki said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coalition forces, in co-ordination with legitimate government forces and the [Saudi-backed] National Shield Forces, launched limited pre-emptive strikes to disrupt these forces and thwart Zubaidi's attempts to escalate the conflict and extend it into al-Dhale,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 15 strikes hit al-Dahle early on Wednesday and at least four civilians were killed, two hospital sources told AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maliki also accused Zubaidi of distributing weapons to \"dozens of elements\" in Aden \"with the aim of creating unrest\", and said the coalition had asked STC deputy leader Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami, who is also a member of the presidential council, to impose security there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the presidential council issued a decree saying Zubaidi had been stripped of his membership and referred to the attorney general for prosecution on charges including \"high treason\", \"damaging the republic's military, political and economic standing\", and \"forming an armed gang and committing the murder of officers and soldiers of the armed forces\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been established that [Zubaidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,\" it alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC's foreign affairs authority said in a statement that it had sent a delegation led by its secretary-general, Sheikh Abdul Rahman al-Subaihi, to Riyadh because it was committed to \"engaging positively and responsibly with various political initiatives and dialogue efforts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the same time, President Aidarous Qassem al-Zubaidi continues to carry out his duties from the capital, Aden, alongside his people, closely following up on and directly supervising the work of the military, security, and civilian institutions,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said it had been \"taken by surprise\" by the coalition air strikes in al-Dahle, describing them as an \"unfortunate escalation that is inconsistent with the declared climate of dialogue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also expressed concern that no official information had been received about the whereabouts and circumstances of Subaihi's delegation in Riyadh, which it said \"raises serious questions that require urgent clarification\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Maduro has been brought to the US to face drug-trafficking and weapons charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president told NBC News on Monday: \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration this week, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place - and, even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued in recent days that US oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country has an estimated 303 billion barrels - the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan oil is also heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently operating in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ConocoPhillips, a major US oil company that no longer has a presence in Venezuela, \"is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability\", said spokesman Dennis Nuss.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A third company, Exxon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that the US's \"blatant military action against Venezuela, and its demand that Venezuela prioritise the US in disposing of its oil resources, is a typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and a grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added: \"I want to emphasise that the legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected... Co-operation between China and Venezuela is the co-operation between two sovereign states, which is under protection of international law and the domestic laws of the two countries.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vice-President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality is more complex. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976, and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7bn in compensation to ConocoPhillips for the move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" US oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ownership of natural resources by sovereign nations is considered a key tenet of international law.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

And its state media showed off the footage from that meeting to prove it: smiling men in suits, reviewing some of the 600 current agreements between their two countries - except the next photograph of Maduro was taken on board a US warship, blindfolded and handcuffed, in grey sweats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China joined many countries around the world in condemning Washington's stunning move against a sovereign state. It accused the US of acting like a \"world judge\" and insisted that \"the sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those stern words aside, Beijing will be making careful calculations not just to insure its foothold in South America, but also to manage an already tricky relationship with Trump and plot its next steps as the great power competition between the US and China takes a new, wholly unexpected turn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many see this as an opportunity for China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers. But there is also risk, uncertainty and frustration as Beijing tries to figure out what to do after Trump tore up the very international rulebook it has spent decades trying to play by.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing, which likes to play the long game, is no fan of chaos. That is certainly what it seems to be coming up repeatedly against in Trump's second term. It had planned ahead and weathered the on-again, off-again trade war. Xi will believe he showed the US and the world just how dependent they are on Chinese manufacturing and technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But now Beijing faces a new challenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's play for Venezuelan oil has likely strengthened China's deepest doubts about American intentions – how far would the US go to contain Chinese influence?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to NBC on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared: \"This is the western hemisphere. This is where we live – and we're not going to allow the western hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The not-so-hidden message was for Beijing: get out of our backyard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing is unlikely to listen. But it will wait to see what happens next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Beijing strongly condemned a US report that suggested Washington will order the acting Venezuelan president to sever economic ties with China and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters that this was a \"typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty and will do grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Nicolás Maduro is seen in handcuffs after landing at a Manhattan helipad, escorted by heavily armed Federal agents as they make their way into an armored car en route to a Federal courthouse in Manhattan on January 5, 2026 in New York City. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nicolás Maduro escorted by US federal agents after landing in New York city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some wonder if China is waiting and watching to see if it could do the same in Taiwan, the self-governing island which it views as a breakaway province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi has vowed that Taiwan will one day be \"reunified\" with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. And some nationalists on Chinese social media are asking: if the US can unilaterally act in Caracas, what is stopping Beijing from snatching the Taiwanese president?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For one, Beijing might not see those parallels because it considers Taiwan an internal matter, and not a concern of the international order. But more important, if Xi decides to invade the island, it will not be because the US has set a precedent, according to David Sacks from the Council on Foreign Relations. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/trumps-strikes-venezuela-will-not-embolden-china-invade-taiwan\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">He writes that China doesn't have the \"confidence that it can succeed at an acceptable cost\".</a> </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Until that day comes, though, China will continue with its strategy of employing coercion to wear down Taiwan's people, with the aim of forcing Taiwan to the negotiating table. The US strikes on Venezuela do not change this dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rather, they are a challenge China did not need and does not want - and they risk its long-term plan to win over the Global South.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The relationship between Beijing and Caracas was fairly simple. China needed oil. Venezuela needed cash. From around 2000 to 2023 Beijing provided more than $100bn to Venezuela to finance railways, power plants and other infrastructure projects. In exchange, Caracas gave Beijing the oil it needed to fuel its booming economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 80% of Venezuelan oil was sent to China last year. That's still only 4% of the country's oil imports. So, when it comes to China's financial risks in Caracas, \"it's important to keep some perspective\", says Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chinese firms like CNPC and Sinopec are among the largest players there and there is a risk of those assets either being nationalised by the Venezuelans, under the direction of the US or otherwise marginalised amid the chaos.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also around $10bn of outstanding loans that Venezuela owes Chinese creditors, but again, Olander urges caution as it's unclear if any investments in the country are currently at risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it could warn off future investors. \"Chinese enterprises need to fully assess the risks and extent of potential US intervention before investing in related projects,\" Cui Shoujun, from the School of International Relations at Renmin University, said on Chinese state media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing will not want to jeopardise the fragile trade truce it just signed with the US, but it won't want to lose its foothold in Latin America either. Striking that balance is going to be hard, especially with someone as unpredictable as Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The concern for China is that other countries across South America start to worry about significant Chinese investments \"out of concern of attracting unwanted US attention\", Olander says. \"This region is a critical source of food, energy and natural resources to China with two-way trade now topping half a trillion dollars.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also made it clear it wants the Panamanian government to cancel all Chinese port holdings and investments related to the Panama Canal, which, he adds, is  \"undeniably concerning for China\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So Beijing may have to win the battle in Washington's backyard in other ways.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) and Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro Moros (L) walk side by side in black suits during a welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of People on September 22, 2013 in Beijing, China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Xi and Maduro in Beijing in 2013</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has shown patience and persistence in wooing South America. The Global South is a group of countries that have signed up to  \"a community with a shared future\" and urge opposition to \"unilateral bullying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This message resonates with governments that have grown wary of the West and, in particular, Washington under Trump. China is usually explicit from the start about what it wants from its partners - they recognise the \"One China\" principle and Taiwan is treated as an \"integral part\" of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing has had considerable success in persuading Latin American states to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, with Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras all siding with the $19tn economy's talk of strategic partnership over the last 20 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast, Trump has shown that a relationship with Washington can be volatile. And that could play into China's hands, as it seeks to project Xi as a stable leader, now more than ever before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important because the situation in Venezuela could easily descend into chaos,\" Olander says. \"Also, don't forget the lesson from Iraq, where the US also said the country's oil reserves would pay for the reconstruction of the economy. That did not happen and China is now the largest buyer of Iraqi crude. Something similar could easily happen in Venezuela.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the US was urged by China hawks in Congress to counter Beijing's influence across South America. It has made its move but what no-one seems sure of is what comes next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything about this is a gamble – and Beijing, by all accounts, hates to gamble.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That's what the southern state of Karnataka is betting on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, legislators passed a bill which aims to prevent hate speech and hate crimes that fuel communal tension or target individuals and groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hate speech is not new in India, but it has intensified in recent years as social media has spread and television channels amplify comments and reactions. A report last year found hate speech against minorities - mainly Muslims - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx9942x72o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">rose 74%</a> in 2024, peaking during the national elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's why the Karnataka government - led by the Congress party - says the move is necessary, arguing that hate speech can lead to real-life violence. But critics warn this could come at the cost of civil liberties and free speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Karnataka Hate Speech and Hate Crimes (Prevention) Bill, 2025, which still needs the state governor's sign to become law, sets out how hate speech cases should be investigated and prosecuted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It defines hate speech as any \"expression which is made, published, or circulated… in public view\" verbally, in print, television or social media. But it also defines a hate crime as the \"communication of hate speech\", without specifying whether it needs to lead to violence or not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill gives the state government the power to order social media and digital platforms to take down content it deems hate speech, something only the federal government can do currently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India doesn't have a federal law against hate speech but a number of provisions across laws prohibit certain forms of speech, writing and actions as exceptions to free speech. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This includes criminalisation of acts that could promote \"enmity between different groups on grounds of religion\" and \"deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"DIPR, Karnataka G Parameshwara in the Karnataka legislative assembly defending the hate speech and hate crime bill\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">DIPR, Karnataka</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara says the new bill closes loopholes in existing laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BJP, which governs nationally but is in the opposition in Karnataka, has said that bringing in a separate law is unnecessary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara told the assembly the bill would close loopholes in existing law, making hate speech and hate crimes non-bailable and giving the state wider powers to act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also raises punishments. If passed into law, those convicted of hate crimes would face non-bailable jail terms of one to seven years and fines of 50,000 rupees ($550; £410), with tougher penalties for repeat offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief minister of neighbouring Telangana state, also governed by the Congress, has said that they will introduce a similar bill as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BJP, often accused of coming down sharply on dissent nationally and in states it governs, has been protesting against the bill, saying it could curb free speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Through this law, the state government is taking away people's right to free speech guaranteed by the constitution, and putting opposition leaders and the media behind bars,\" opposition leader R Ashoka told the assembly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Legal experts and free speech activists echo the concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Hegde warns that the law could be misused by political parties across the spectrum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One party's hate speech is another man's political propaganda and vice versa. Just because you dislike some speech, it does not become hate speech,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alok Prasanna Kumar, advocate and co-founder of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, says that while the intent behind the law might be good, there is \"enormous scope for misuse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate has also raised a more fundamental issue around how hate speech and crime are defined by law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is an attempt by a state to define hate speech as a term in the law, which expands beyond existing provisions on promoting enmity and outraging religious feelings, to include speech targeting caste, religion and other identities,\" said Siddharth Narrain, assistant professor at National Law School of India University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he says the bill blurs the line between hate speech and hate crime. Hate speech, he argues, should be prosecuted because it can lead to violence, but the current wording treats communication itself as a hate crime even when no violence follows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts also cite a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that laws criminalising speech must be precise, not vague or overly broad, to avoid a \"chilling effect\" in which people self-censor for fear of prosecution.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man looks at his mobile phone in Manajipet village in the district of Gadwal, Telangana, India, on Monday, June 11, 2018. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The problem of hate speech has worsened in recent years with social media becoming ubiquitous</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BJP leaders and some activists have urged the governor not to pass the bill but to instead send it to the Indian president for consideration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Advocate and social activist Girish Bhardwaj, who has written to the governor, says the bill regulates citizens rather than hate speech. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues it gives excessive discretion to \"executive agencies\" - senior police and administrative officers - to decide what speech falls under the law, raising the risk of conflicts of interest, especially when the government is being criticised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a senior Karnataka government official told the BBC, on condition of anonymity, that the bill would empower police by removing the need for government permission to file chargesheets, ruling out abuse of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The police will have to approach the court directly and face consequences for inaction or mistakes,\" the official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This also means the accused can be tried regardless of political affiliation, the official added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If a party worker indulges in hate speech or a hate crime, the ruling party may not sanction prosecution.

He is set to meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It marks the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. Bilateral ties had soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi, meanwhile, has appeared keen to shore up ties with South Korea amid a diplomatic row between China and Japan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea is a US security ally - like Japan - but also relies on China for trade. Experts say Lee is expected to keep walking a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit marks the second time the two leaders have met since November when Xi visited South Korea for a regional economic summit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday Lee stated that the visit was \"a crucial opportunity\" for the \"full-scale restoration of South Korea-China relations\", reported South Korean newspaper Chosun. \"We want to usher in a new phase in the development of South Korea-China relations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Government officials and companies from both countries signed a series of cooperation agreements on technology, trade and environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee also took selfies with Xi, using a Xiaomi phone that the Chinese president had gifted him last year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The image quality is certainly good, right?\" Lee posted on X along with the photos.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi noted that the \"international situation is becoming more turbulent and complex\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting followed the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi urged Lee to \"firmly stand on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices\", China's official Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also brought up the two countries' shared history of resisting Japan militarism, saying that China and South Korea should now \"work hand in hand to safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War Two and uphold peace and stability in Northeast Asia\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his four-day trip to China, Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while South Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on \"viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue \"constructive\" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another item high on Lee's agenda is<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson similarly told reporters on Tuesday that both sides have agreed to \"carry out orderly, healthy, and beneficial cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
