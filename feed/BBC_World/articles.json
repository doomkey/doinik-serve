something Kyiv has long-maintained it will never do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The talks in Moscow on Tuesday come hours after Russian officials claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, and the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials made no acknowledgement that either city had fallen to Russia and open-source intelligence projects monitoring the front lines of the war suggested neither Vovchansk nor Pokrovsk had yet been fully captured by the Russian army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said it seemed Russia's main aim was to ensure all the pressure in the US peace plan was put on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has spent almost a year and a half trying to capture Pokrovsk and released a video showing Putin visiting a command post at the weekend in which he was quoted as saying Russia has made progress in \"an important area, we all understand just how important\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also held talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Zelensky and Ukraine's new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, while several key European leaders virtually joined the Zelensky-Macron meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the draft peace deal had \"been very much refined\", adding: \"I think the administration feels very optimistic.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued: \"But as for the details, I will let the negotiators negotiate. But we do feel quite good, and we're hopeful that this war can finally come to an end.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Putin said he had seen a draft peace plan proposed by the US, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Kremlin officials later cast doubt over whether it would accept the proposal after Kyiv and European allies said they had secured changes to it.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">initial US-Russia draft peace plan</a> circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billion in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62np269qv9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">frozen Russian assets</a> currently held in European financial institutions should be invested, as well as setting the terms for Ukrainian market access in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\", and insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Macron said the question of territorial concessions could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\", and pointed out that questions around frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and Ukraine's accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French leader also praised efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, followed by a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said this week could be \"pivotal\", but that Moscow only wanted to negotiate \"with those who are just offering them something on top of what they already have\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued: \"I'm afraid all the pressure will be put on the weaker side because that is the easier way to stop this war when Ukraine surrenders, but this is not in anybody's interest.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months Moscow has at times appeared to engage with US attempts to mediate an agreement to end the war, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia vehemently opposes this and Trump has also ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The second strike was reportedly done after two people survived the initial blast and were clinging to the burning vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report and vowed congressional reviews of the strikes.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President (Donald) Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,\" Leavitt said during the Monday press briefing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The press secretary neither confirmed the first strike left two survivors, nor that the second attack was intended to kill them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Media reports that Hegseth had given the directive to kill all those on board the vessel during the 2 September strike have renewed concerns about the legality of US military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hegseth has pushed back against accusations in the report, calling them \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". On Monday, he tweeted that Admiral Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean and carried out a series of lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in international waters off Venezuela and Colombia, as part of what it calls an anti-narcotics operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes since early September. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks have also significantly ramped up tensions with Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said he is considering the deployment of US ground forces into the country. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: White House defends Venezuela boat strikes, says Admiral Bradley acted legally</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also led to increased scrutiny among US lawmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts\" related to the strikes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the \"admiral that was in charge of the operation\". He added that it was also seeking audio and video to \"see what the orders were\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body of the highest-ranking US military officers, met both the House and Senate's armed services committees over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Discussions centred around the operations in the region and \"the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks\", the group said. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under former-President Barack Obama, the US military came under scrutiny for firing multiple rounds from drones, in a practice <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24557333\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">known as the \"double tap\"</a>, that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the 2 September strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with BBC Newsnight on Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Trump's allegations stem from \"great envy\" for the country's natural resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also called for a direct dialogue between the US and Venezuelan governments, \"to clear the toxic atmosphere we have witnessed since July of last year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had held a brief phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in which he pressured him to resign and leave Venezuela with his family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to reports, during the call last month, Trump told Maduro that he could go to a destination of his choosing, but only if he agreed to depart immediately. After he refused, Trump posted on social media that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro requested amnesty for his top aides, and that he be allowed to continue control of the military after giving up the government. Trump refused both demands,  according to The Miami Post and Reuters, reporting the BBC has not confirmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of a \"terrorist\" organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking.

The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose \"serious endangerment\" to telecom cyber security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,\" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an \"abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be \"readily visible and accessible\" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Smartphone makers must also \"make an endeavour\" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The design - making the app impossible to disable - would also weaken the safeguards that normally stop one app from accessing another's data, the group said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, it adds, effectively turns the app into \"a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Technology analyst and writer Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,\" Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, told Reuters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

in a \"technical tie\" on Monday, with a razor-thin margin separating them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As of Monday afternoon, there were just 515 votes separating right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura from his nearest challenger, Salvador Nasralla, a former TV host standing for the country's centrist party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of the electoral commission called for \"patience and prudence\" while the result was tallied, but officials have not released an update since, leading to confusion and growing tensions among voters about the status of the race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The website of the electoral council has also collapsed, adding to public fears about problems with the count.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday night, US President Donald Trump, who is a vocal backer of Asfura, claimed counting had \"abruptly stopped\", and accused officials of \"trying to change the results\" of the election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\", having previously threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if Asfura was not elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The President of the National Electoral Council (CNE) Ana Paola Hall has not released an update since around 13:00 local time, when 57% of the vote had been counted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that update, Hall said the process was continuing to play out but has not commented since.</p></div><figure><div

years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The outgoing president, Xiomara Castro of the left-wing Libre party, was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term. She backed Rixi Moncada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said turnout was expected to be strong among the 6.5m registered voters, but no official figures have yet been released.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Hondurans had a sense that this would not be an entirely straightforward election but few would have foreseen the vote count being this close.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The collapse of the official election website, apparently due to high traffic, has only compounded fears among voters of problems with the count. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People are keen to avoid an extended period of uncertainty or legal challenges over the result, which could be the case if the numbers remain close.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly before casting their ballots, voters at a farmers' market in Tegucigalpa spoke of their desire for change.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nicole Castillo said it was time to forget party loyalty and vote for change</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People must vote based on reality in front of us, and not stay blindly loyal to any party colours,\" insisted walnut-seller Nicole Castillo, adding that she believed that meant acknowledging the ingrained corruption in Honduran politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nolvy Oriales, who owns a cheese counter nearby, said that her main motivation for voting was also to stamp out corruption and cronyism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we need to try someone new, someone who hasn't been in power before, because these last few years have been very, very tough,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the person who represents a new start is Nasralla of the Liberal Party, who has portrayed himself as the man who will put an end to corruption in Honduras if he is elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although he was the vice-president for a time alongside incumbent Xiomara Castro, the two fell out and he resigned. Most know him best from his work as a television sports presenter.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nolvy Oriales's priority is for corruption and cronyism to be tackled</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other option in front of those who wanted a break with the governing Libre  party was Asfura, the candidate favoured by Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the US would be \"very supportive\" if centre-right candidate Asfura won the presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the US president's last-minute intervention angered many as they went to the polls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Casting his ballot at a school in Tegucigalpa, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Octavio Pineda told the BBC that President Trump's social media posts amounted to meddling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's totally electoral interference by the US president and we have publicly denounced it as such. We heard his words, but we don't share his views.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one social media post, Mr Trump also controversially promised to pardon the disgraced former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who is currently serving 45 years in a US prison for smuggling drugs and weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Remember, it wasn't even the Honduran justice system which tried and sentenced our ex-president for drug trafficking. It was the US Attorney General's office itself,\" recalls Minister Pineda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Asfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has \"no ties\" with the ex-president, and that \"the party is not responsible for his personal actions\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the vote count goes on, and the tension in Honduras continues to rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People have bad memories of street violence following disputed election result in 2017 when Juan Orlando Hernández claimed victory in a vote count which was questioned by international observers and the Organisation of American States (OAS). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pitched battles between protesters and the police lead to at least 20 deaths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No-one wants a repeat of those dark days, and people remain hopeful that calm will prevail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet some shop owners have reportedly boarded up their businesses and some employees are staying away from work, at least until the drama of the vote count is over, and the name of the president-elect is clear.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's legal team is now hoping to convince a judge to exclude evidence

Mr Mangione wore a grey suit and shirt, and court employees removed his hand restraints before he sat, as his lawyers requested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week's hearing focuses on whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c7vez5y57y8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Mangione when they arrested him</a> in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and whether it should be excluded as a result.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence attorneys are seeking to suppress some of Mr Mangione's statements he made to police after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found in Mr Mangione's backpack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family who graduated from an Ivy League university - had

two critical pieces of evidence - that point to a murder weapon and motive - would be a big win for Mr Mangione's legal team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the chances of that happening are \"virtually non existent\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney in New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that's because there are a number of exceptions to constitutional rules that law enforcement must obtain a warrant for personal searches, including some that may cover this case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a case like this where there's a manhunt for a violent suspect who committed this alleged crime in plain view in New York City, nobody's getting a warrant,\" Mr Shakhnevich said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When they get him, they're going to search him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors say they have other key evidence against the defendant, including <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqlj130rxpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">DNA or fingerprints</a> on items discarded near the crime scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30qlr528elo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seeking the death penalty</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occuring in the future\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Firemen get ready after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday.

world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His final performance was at the

Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">CBS News</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> reported</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. </p></div></div></body></html>"

now climbed to 631 on Tuesday, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.5 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About one million people have been evacuated, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been \"like a tsunami\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as

In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lasha Shergelashvili Lasha wearing army fatigues and a cap standing on an armoured vehicle and resting his arm on a mounted rifle \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Lasha Shergelashvili</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lasha Shergelashvili used to be in charge of weaponry for Georgia's riot police</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas.

These were simply listed as \"Chemical liquid UN1710\" and \"Chemical powder UN3439\", along with instructions for how they should be mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We wanted to check whether this inventory was authentic, so we showed it to another  former high-ranking police officer from the riot police who confirmed it seemed genuine. He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our next step was to work out what these chemicals were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Shutterstock Hundreds of people demonstrating in the Georgian capital - massing on the street in the darkness with the parliament lit up to the side.

Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Camite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards. Ms Edwards has previously written to Georgia's government regarding allegations of police violence and torture during the protests.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The UN's Alice Edwards: \"Populations should never be subjected to experiments\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of strict regulation around the use of chemicals in water cannon is a problem she would like addressed: \"It does lead me to consider [this practice] as an experimental weapon. And populations should never be subjected to experiments. This is absolutely in violation of human rights law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She stressed that any effect of a riot control measure should be temporary under international law, and that the symptoms described \"are beyond what would be considered temporary and acceptable. So all of those cases should be investigated, including under the rubric of torture or other ill-treatment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia's authorities described our findings as \"deeply frivolous\" and \"absurd\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said that law enforcement had acted \"within the bounds of the law and constitution\" when responding to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue have dwindled in their size since the government increased fines and jail terms, but not in their frequency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208w378gg7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Almost every night for the past year</a>, demonstrators have called for the resignation of a government they accuse of rigging elections, siding with Russian interests, and passing increasingly draconian legislation against civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling Georgian Dream party denied the government or the party's honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, are either pro-Russian or pursuing Russian interests.

They have not yet been asked to plead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The arrests are the first since the South African government said in November that 17 citizens had \"seemingly\" been lured to join mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police told the BBC that at this stage, they are not linking the two cases.  </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mantula, 39, is a presenter of The Morning Bliss, a show on the SABC's SAFM radio station.  Neither she nor SABC has commented on her arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her arrest, along with four others, follows the dramatic resignation from parliament last Friday of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma, who has been accused of duping the 17 South African men - including some of her relatives - into fighting for Russia, an allegation she denies. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that Mantula had been arrested with four men, aged between 21 and 46.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They each face a charge of contravening the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said the arrests followed a tip-off from police at South Africa's main international airport in Johannesburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were \"intercepted\" as they attempted to travel to Russia via the United Arab Emirates, and \"were removed from the boarding gate after being deemed suspicious\", it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said it was further alleged that Mantula \"had been facilitating the travel and recruitment of her co-accused into the Russian Federation military\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mantula and her co-accused appeared briefly at the Kempton Park Magistrates' Court near Johannesburg on Monday, and were remanded in custody.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said it was \"committed to ensuring that individuals who violate the laws of the country are held accountable and will continue to work with other law-enforcement partners to protect the integrity and security\" of South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accused are due to make their next court appearance on 8 December for a bail application. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, South Africa's government said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who were trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region after joining mercenary forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it was working through \"diplomatic channels\" to bring them back, but this has not yet happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The men were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said, adding that it condemned \"the exploitation of young vulnerable people by individuals working with foreign military entities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%, which is even higher among young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Sambudla's resignation as an MP came after her half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, filed a complaint with police, accusing her of tricking the 17 men to fight for Russia as mercenaries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Mncube said that eight of them were members of her family, and they had been \"handed to a Russian mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, said the case was being investigated by its officers who focus on \"crime against the state\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Sambudla, who became a member of parliament for the largest opposition party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), last year, has said in an affidavit that she thought the men were going to Russia for \"lawful\" training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MK says it was her decision to resign as she wants to focus her efforts on ensuring the return of those trapped in a war zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Kenyan police said they had rescued more than 20 people from a suspected trafficking ring that had lured them with job offers in Russia but intended to send them to fight in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has previously said that it was holding citizens of various countries - Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka - at prisoner-of-war camps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, Senegal's foreign ministry said it had summoned Kyiv's ambassador to demand the withdrawal of an embassy post on Facebook urging foreigners to enlist for its war effort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, Nigeria also warned that it would not tolerate Ukraine's recruitment drive, forcing it to back-pedal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So this is trial by media, which is deeply unfair.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Hasina's regime was overturned, prosecutors in Bangladesh have launched a number of wide-ranging legal cases against the former leader, her past associates and family members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trial involving Siddiq - who <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk2e7x42zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">quit as a Treasury minister in January over controversy</a> around her ties to her aunt - has been playing out in Dhaka since August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq continues to face a number of outstanding charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents included claims that Siddiq \"forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A prosecutor for Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) previously said Siddiq was tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as authorities had obtained her Bangladeshi passport, ID and tax number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq's lawyers have disputed she is a Bangladeshi citizen, telling the Financial Times she has \"never had\" an ID card or voter ID, and \"has not held a passport since she was a child\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620). If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me.

It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq was not compelled to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant. </p></div></div></body></html>"

The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All eyes are on this case,\" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People found it hard to believe at first \"because something of this scale had not happened before,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,\" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. \"We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese.

These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,\" says Prof Chan. \"The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African governments are \"not always getting it right\", he says, however \"this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was \"grossly unfair\" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,\" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ed-habershon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ed Habershon</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He managed to get to the village of Gurni, a few kilometres from el-Fasher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gurni was the first stop for many who fled the city, including Mohammed Abbaker Adam, a local official in the nearby Zamzam camp for displaced people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Adam retreated to el-Fasher when Zamzam was overrun by the RSF in April, and left the day before they captured the city in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He grew a white beard to make himself look older, hoping that it would lead to more lenient treatment. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The road here was full of death,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They shot some people directly in front of us and then carried them and threw them far away.

But the UN says less than half of the 260,000 people estimated to have been in the city before it fell have been accounted for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid agencies believe many people did not get very far - unable to escape because of danger, or detention, or the cost of buying their way out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Adam said the fighters also raped women, corroborating widespread accounts of sexual violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They would take a woman behind a tree, or take her far from us, out of sight, so you wouldn't see with your own eyes,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But you would hear her shout: 'Help me, help me.'

Her father, a soldier, had been killed in battle. Her mother was not in el-Fasher when it fell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the three siblings escaped the city on foot with their grandmother, but she died before they reached Gurni, leaving them to carry on alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hadn't taken enough water because we didn't know the distance was so far,\" said the young woman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We walked and walked and my grandmother passed out. I thought it might be lack of food or water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I checked her pulse, but she didn't wake up, so I found a doctor in a nearby village.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man in white clerical garb talks to a man in a black business coat. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ghaith-solh\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ghaith Solh</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It sees the Sun transition from calm to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - massive bubbles of fire that blow out of the Sun's outermost layer called corona.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Made up of charged particles, a CME can weigh up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth. At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three CMEs a day,\" says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). \"Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it gathers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Studying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of India's maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images The aurora borealis glows above rural Monroe County as a strong geomagnetic storm from recent solar activity pushes the Northern Lights unusually far south on November 12, 2025, in Bloomington, Indiana.

Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a \"medium-sized\" one. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space. They will also help us gain a better understanding of near-Earth space,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feta has to be made of at least 70% sheep's milk, with the remainder being goat's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Small dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep's milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market,\" says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. \"The shop is closed,\" he says bitterly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. \"I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The day they were culled, I was here.

Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such vaccination is allowed in an emergency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/animal-diseases/diseases-and-control-measures/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under EU rules,</a> and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Tassos Manakas says he is closed for business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

They'll come to your house and take you into the bush,\" one of them told the BBC.  For his safety, the BBC is not identifying him and is calling him Aliyu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His young son is one of more 300 students abducted when armed men stormed the grounds of St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri village in the central state of Niger in the early hours of 21 November. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the children taken are as young as five years old. About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide. We know where they are, but we can't go there ourselves, it's too dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is desperate with worry - especially as vulnerable captives kept in forest hideouts have died during previous abductions, whether from sickness or because ransoms have not been paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel so bitter and my wife hasn't eaten for days...

We need someone to help us to take action.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Remote boarding schools, like this one in Papiri, are seen as soft targets by groups seeking a large ransom</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two days after the Papiri kidnapping, 12 teenage girls were abducted from Mussa District in the north-eastern Borno state, long the flashphoint of a jihadist insurgency in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nigerian army says the girls were seized by the Islamic State of West Africa (Iswap) group while harvesting crops on their family farmlands, and were subsequently rescued following an \"intelligence-led\" operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a few days before the Papiri kidnapping, 25 girls were taken from their school in Maga, which is 200km (125 miles) further north in Kebbi state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the students escaped before the rest were rescued by the security forces last week from what the authorities said was a \"farm settlement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandits tend to live in cattle camps deep in the bush. The gangs are largely composed of ethnic Fulani people, who are traditionally nomadic herders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No details have been released about whether a ransom was paid to free the girls from Maga.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, it is illegal to pay ransoms in Nigeria. However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Katsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open. In addition, the community requested a guarantee that they would not be attacked and that bandits would not enter the community with guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the bandits in Jibia, they requested access to clean drinking water and safe passage for their cattle as they moved to new grazing pastures. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also requested that their women be allowed to buy and trade in local markets.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP/Getty Images A Fulani man in silhouette in northern Nigeria tending cattle with long horns.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Cows are prized possessions for ethnic Fulanis, who walk for hundreds of miles to find pasture for them</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High on the agenda - for both sides - was the release of those kidnapped. The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Audu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Access to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult. It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life had become expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-chris-ewokor-in-abuja\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetuses</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of Dublin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact.

Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drink</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Temple Bar pub and street area in Dublin, Ireland, with people gathered outside\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028.
