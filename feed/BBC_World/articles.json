And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The '90 deals in 90 days' deadline</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars.

But as consumer goods giants such as Unilever and Adidas start to put numbers on the cost increases involved, some sticker shock, price rises, loom – potentially enough to delay Trump's desired rate cut – and possibly a dent to consumer spending.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/26c8/live/b5937e80-6e1b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein A close up of Donald Trump\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">If the current tariffs trigger a foundational realignment, the results may not ultimately break in favour of the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Forecasts are always uncertain, of course, but this represents a very real political threat for a president who promised to lower consumer prices, not take actions that would raise them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump and other White House officials have floated the idea of providing rebate checks to lower-income Americans – the kinds of blue-collar voters who have fuelled the president's political success – that would offset some of the pocketbook pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such an effort could be unwieldy, and it would require congressional approval.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's also a tacit acknowledgment that simply boasting of new federal revenue to offset current spending and tax cuts, and holding out the prospect of future domestic job and wealth creation is politically perilous for a Republican party that will have to face voters in next year's midterm state and congressional midterm elections.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The deals yet to be hammered out</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Complicating all this is the fact that there are many places where a deal is yet to be hammered out – most notably Canada and Taiwan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US administration has yet to pronounce its decisions for the pharmaceuticals and steel industry.

But Israel has insisted that there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is \"no starvation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite that, four days ago it implemented measures that it has said are aimed at helping the UN and its partners collect aid from crossings and distribute it within Gaza, including daily \"tactical pauses\" in military operations in three areas and the creation of what it calls \"designated humanitarian corridors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday that 43 aid packages containing food for residents in southern and northern Gaza had been airdropped, and \"it would continue to work in order to improve the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip, along with the international community\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian office has said the tactical pauses do not allow for the continuous flow of supplies required to meet the immense needs of the population, and that desperately hungry crowds continue to offload supplies from lorries as they pass through Israeli crossings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The director of al-Shifa hospital, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told the BBC on Thursday morning that it had received the bodies of 54 people who were killed in the incident in the Zikim area on Wednesday, as well as 412 injured people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday night, the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told AFP news agency that at least 30 people were killed when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd waiting for aid there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its al-Saraya field hospital and al-Quds hospital in Gaza City had received a total of six dead and 274 injured from the same incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IDF said in a statement that \"dozens of Gazans was identified gathering around aid trucks in northern Gaza, and in close proximity to IDF troops operating in the area\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The troops fired warning shots in the area, not directed at the gathering, in response to the threat posed to them,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"According to an initial inquiry, the IDF is not aware of any casualties as a result of IDF fire. The details of the incident are still being examined.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">International journalists are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so it is difficult to verify what happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, one man interviewed by a local freelance journalist working for the BBC said he knew a teenage boy who was killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In the current situation, there is no food or water. People go to get food from the Zikim area, where they are targeted. He went to bring flour but came back carried in the flour bag,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What was his fault? They sniped him in the middle of his head. He wasn't carrying a rock, or a weapon, or doing anything wrong. His only fault was being Palestinian and living in Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Abu Taha al-Kafarneh, a unemployed father of two who was the main breadwinner for his family, was also among the dead, another man told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He went to get a bag of flour to secure his food for the day... He didn't want to trade it, sell it, or profit from it like many of the looting merchants,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added: \"They [Israel] claim they let food in, but instead increase the number of those killed and martyred as much as they can. The morgue is full.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday morning, hospital sources told the BBC that six people were killed near an aid distribution centre run by GHF in the Rafah area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IDF told the BBC a \"gathering of suspects\" it said posed a threat to its troops were told to move away, and subsequently the army fired \"warning shots\" at a distance of \"hundreds of metres away\" from the site.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The military also said that \"an initial review suggests that the number of casualties reported does not align with the information held by the IDF\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The GHF said no killings took place at or near its sites on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the UN human rights office, at least 1,373 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get food aid since the GHF began operating in late May. It said most of them were killed by the Israeli military. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The office said on Thursday that at least 859 of them had been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another 514 people had been killed along the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It said the office had \"no information that these Palestinians were directly participating in hostilities or posed any threat to Israeli security forces\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Each person killed or injured had been desperately struggling for survival, not only for themselves, but also for their families and dependents,\" it said, adding that an increasing number of Palestinians were \"dying from malnutrition and starvation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The GHF has said the UN is using \"false\" figures from Gaza's health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The organisation has said it has handed out more than 98 million meals over the past two months and that it stands ready to work with the UN to deliver aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the UN has refused to co-operate with the GHF's system, saying it is unsafe and violates the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 60,249 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 111 over the past day, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

impose sanctions on the Palestinians' self-governance organisation as well as the body that represents it on the international stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sanctions affect both the Palestinian Authority (PA) which was established by the Oslo peace accords, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) which was recognised after the same process as the official representative of the Palestinian people in return for it recognising Israel and renouncing violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The State Department said it would deny visas to PLO members and PA officials.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The timing and language of the statement suggest it is the Trump administration's response to this week's French-Saudi led conference at the United Nations held to rally support for a future two state solution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The meeting came as France, the UK and Canada committed to recognising an independent, demilitarised Palestinian state later this year, in some cases subject to certain conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US castigated these moves, having privately warned of diplomatic consequences if those attending the UN conference made \"anti-Israel\" declarations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its sanctions announcement, the State Department accused the PA and PLO of taking actions to \"internationalise its conflict with Israel such as through the International Criminal Court (ICC) and International Court of Justice (ICJ)\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also referred to a series of long-standing complaints by the US and Israel that the PLO and PA had continued \"to support terrorism including incitement and glorification of violence (especially in textbooks), and providing payments and benefits in support of terrorism to Palestinian terrorists and their families\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Trump administration earlier this year lifted sanctions on violent Israeli settlers who have killed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One leading Palestinian politician described the sanctions move as \"revenge\" by the US for the commitments to recognise Palestinian statehood by a growing number of countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The PA appeared to echo that sentiment in a statement released on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These campaigns have been escalating in response to the significant and successive achievements of Palestinian diplomacy,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Particularly the recent recognitions of the State of Palestine by key countries, the successful United Nations conference in New York, and the historic declaration issued therein.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div

welcomed the sanctions and thanked US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for imposing them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This important action by [President Trump] and his administration also exposes the moral distortion of certain countries that ran to recognise a virtual Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to its support for terror and incitement,\" said foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The PA has always rejected complaints around \"salaries\" saying the payments are stipends to the families of all Palestinian prisoners held under Israel's military occupation, many of whom are not given any due process and are held in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians see all those detained by Israel and jailed by its military courts, which have a 99 per cent conviction rate, as political prisoners. French officials said last week the PA had expressed its willingness to end these payments in response to France's commitment to recognise a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This week's UN conference further isolated the US in its support for the way Israel has continued the war in Gaza, which many countries criticised at the meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The conference exposed a strategic vacuum being left by Washington that had traditionally led diplomatic efforts towards a viable longer-term peace between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The travel ban on Palestinian officials may be meant as a more limited broadside than a full range of financial sanctions. It is already a complex and lengthy process for PA and PLO officials to obtain visas to travel to the US, requiring special exemptions which are rarely given. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not yet clear whether the move would affect any officials working for the Palestinian mission to the United Nations in New York. The current Palestinian ambassador to the UN and his deputy are both US citizens.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Other countries are still racing to finalise deals with the US to avoid sweeping levies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But since news of the US-EU deal was announced last weekend, not only has criticism mounted, but it has become clear many details are yet to be ironed out, there are several discrepancies between the two sides and some EU countries will be disproportionately affected.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Only a first step?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Few European leaders rejoiced at the announcement that a 15% tariff would be applied on most EU exports to the US - an improvement on the 30% tariff initially threatened by Trump, but still a substantial hike from the former 4.8% average rate.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet, while expressing regret that the EU had not adopted a tougher negotiating stance, many begrudgingly agreed the deal had at least brought a semblance of certainty and predictability to Europe's businesses after a number of fraught months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I would have wished for a different outcome,\" Germany's finance minister Lars Klingbeil said. \"Still, all in all, it is good that there is an agreement with the US, that there are no further escalations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of Thursday, a joint statement had yet to be released, although the Commission has emphasised it will not be a legally binding document but a \"set of political commitments\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"From there will flow the additional negotiated exemptions that we're looking to bake into our agreement with the US,\" Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/sv/qanda_25_1930\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Commission's general outline</a> of the deal stressed it was not legally binding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/what-they-are-saying-landmark-u-s-eu-trade-deal-is-another-big-win-for-americans/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">White House fact sheet</a> on the agreement presents none of these caveats and says it achieves \"historic structural reforms\", but US Commerce chief Howard Lutnick admitted on Wednesday that talks would continue and that EU and US officials were still discussing some aspects of the framework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This isn't the end of the story and we won't leave it at that,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"It's the first step in a negotiation process that will continue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trade agreements usually take between 18 and 24 months of bilateral negotiations, says Cinzia Alcidi of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. \"To give some certainty to the industry and private sectors now, the 15% blanket tariff will apply – but then there will be efforts to get some goods a different deal,\" she says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Key discrepancies and interpretations</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the White House, <b id=\"pharmaceuticals-and-semiconductors\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">pharmaceuticals and semiconductors</b> will fall under the 15% tariff, with no mention of that number being the upper limit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the EU says the two sectors will remain on the current 0% rate for now and until new global tariff rates are agreed. Any future tariffs, according to the EU, will be capped at 15%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tariffs on <b id=\"steel-and-aluminium\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">steel and aluminium</b>, according to the US, will remain at 50%. The EU says Brussels and Washington will work to cut that number and that they will be replaced by a quota system to come beyond 1 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the most glaring discrepancies can be found in the language used by the two sides to describe <b id=\"the-eu's-investment-commitments\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">the EU's investment commitments</b>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Where the US statement says the EU \"will\" purchase $750bn (£568bn) in US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear energy products, the EU says only that it \"intends\" to do so as it weans itself off Russian gas and oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only is it unclear whether the US can even provide such amounts to the EU, says Cinzia Alcidi, but the EU cannot decide purchases on behalf of the private sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Similarly, the US says the EU will invest $600bn by the end of Trump's second term – but the EU states simply that \"companies have expressed interest\" in investing that sum by 2029. As Brussels cannot force private firms to invest in the US, there is technically no guarantee that amount can or will be reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the US, the EU has \"agreed to purchase significant amounts\" of<b id=\"us-military-equipment\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> US military equipment</b>. There is no mention of this in the EU statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly 80% of the EU's defence investment already goes to the US, and scaling up further may not be possible; besides, such a commitment would be at odds with von der Leyen's recent ReArm Europe plan, which calls for investments in Europe's domestic defence industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while negotiations continue, the US will also apply a 15% tariff on wine and spirits, the Commission said on Thursday, adding it would continue to try and achieve a carve-out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, Macron said the agreement had the merit of offering \"predictability in the short term\" - but also called for Europe to be firmer with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In order to be free you have to be feared. We weren't feared enough,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Given the amount of detail that still needs hammering out, the next phase of negotiations is set to continue for some time - and after the backlash the Commission received this week, European negotiators may feel under greater pressure to stand their ground.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b88b/live/edb1f630-6e1f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A factory worker peers under the bonnet of a black car and holds a mechanical arm in place as he works\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The German automotive industry will face billions in extra costs from the new tariffs</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Which countries will be worse off?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the 15% tariffs will hit all European countries, they will affect them in different ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Germany, Ireland and Italy are particularly exposed due to the nature of their partnerships with the US. For Germany's carmakers, the US represents 13% of their exports worth €34bn (£29bn). Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said the new tariffs would be a costly burden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among EU countries, Ireland is the most reliant on the US as an export market. In particular it manufactures and exports pharmaceuticals worth $50bn a year – so Dublin welcomed the EU-US agreement through gritted teeth. \"It is what it is and we move on,\" said Neale Richmond, a minister of state in Ireland's foreign affairs department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Italy's agricultural, pharmaceutical and automotive sectors will also suffer and the country's gross domestic product (GDP) could take a 0.2% hit as a result of the 15% levy, according to the Italian Institute of International Political Studies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cristiano Fini of the Italian Confederation of Farmers said the deal with the US felt more like \"a surrender\" than an agreement. Several Italian trade associations are now already clamouring for compensation from the EU to make up for the predicted losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that is exactly what the EU needs to resist, says Cinzia Alcidi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Blanket compensation for EU exporters would end up costing taxpayers, she believes, \"and that would constitute a great victory for Trump because it would mean that, ultimately, Europeans are paying the price of his tariffs\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Ms Pierce told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120769/exclusive-record-breaking-baby-born-embryo-over-30-years-old/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">MIT Technology Review</a> her family thought \"it's like something from a sci-fi movie\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth. The previous record-holder was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63718914\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">a pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the time, Ms Archerd initially created four embryos. One became her now-30-year-old daughter, and the other three were left in storage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite separating from her husband, she did not want to get rid of the embryos, donate them for research or give them to another family anonymously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said it was important that she was involved with the baby, as they would be related to her adult daughter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Archerd paid thousands of dollars a year for storage until she found a Christian embryo adoption agency, Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which runs a programme known as Snowflakes. Many of these agencies consider their programmes to be saving lives. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The programme used by Ms Archerd allows donors to choose a couple, meaning they can state religious, racial and nationality preferences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Archerd's preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US, as she didn't want to \"go out of the country\", she told MIT Technology Review. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She ultimately matched with the Pierces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IVF clinic in Tennessee at which the couple underwent the procedure, Rejoice Fertility, said its aim was to transfer any embryo it received, no matter the age or conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Pierce said she and her husband did not set out to \"break any records\", but just \"wanted to have a baby\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Archerd told MIT Technology Review she had not met the baby in person yet, but could already see a resemblance with her daughter. </p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly half of the company's products are made in Asian countries which recently agreed trade deals with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing its latest results, Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said the tariffs \"will directly increase the cost of our products for the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He admitted that the company still does not know what the impact will be on customer demand \"should all these tariffs cause major inflation\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two largest source countries for Adidas goods are Vietnam, which makes 27% of the sportswear brand's products, and Indonesia, which makes 19%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this month, the US struck trade deals with both countries, agreeing to impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 19% tariff on Indonesian-made products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US companies that ship in Adidas products to sell in America have to pay the tariff. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sportswear giant, which makes the popular Gazelle and Samba trainers, had previously warned that it cannot produce most of its products in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Its rival Nike in May also said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing for US customers from June, and later warned the tariffs could <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d6gpnmvq6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">add about $1bn (£730m) to its costs</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Adidas boss Mr Gulden said US tariffs have already impacted the company but he said the latest indications point to tariffs directly increasing \"the cost of our products for the US with up to €200m during the rest of the year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite the impact of tariffs, Adidas reported a 7.3% increase in sales to €12.1bn in the first half of the year with pre-tax profit jumping from €549m to €1bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Footwear sales increased by 9% in the second quarter of the year between April and June while clothing revenue rose by 17%.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump introduced higher tariffs on nearly all its global trading partners to encourage more companies to manufacture in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, Trump sealed a deal with the European Union (EU) to impose 15% tariffs on all imports, including cars ahead of a 1 August deadline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has previously threatened a 30% US tariff on goods from the EU. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, while the eventual tax is lower, major EU economies including Germany have spoken out against the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz is it would hit the US and cause \"considerable damage\" to his country.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, two of Germany's best-known carmakers outlined how US tariffs had hit their businesses so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mercedes-Benz said the tariffs, which the company expects to cost it nearly €420m this year, were largely to blame for second-quarter profit falling by nearly 70%.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fellow luxury car brand, Porsche said it had increased prices by up to 3.6% to cover the cost of higher import taxes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile in the UK, Aston Martin warned its profits would be marginal this year due to the levy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this month, Stellantis which owns including Vauxhall, Jeep and Peugeot said the tariffs <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gd1rdp45go\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">had already cost it €300m</a>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Vietnam is by far the most exposed economy, its exports to the US totalling $137bn, making up about 30% of its GDP. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No surprise then that the Vietnamese government was first off the block to negotiate with the US, and the first in the region to do a deal to cut the punishing 46% rate Trump had imposed on them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the US president, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gd66q0q7go\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the deal cuts the tariffs to 20%, </a>while he claims Vietnam will now impose no tariffs at all on any imports from the US. Tellingly, the Vietnamese leadership has said nothing about the deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are no details, no written or signed documents, and some reports suggest Vietnam does not agree with Trump's numbers. But they set the bar for other countries in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Indonesia and the Philippines followed with deals reducing their tariffs to 19%, although neither country depends much on exports to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand does export a lot to the US.

Thailand also has a weak and fractious coalition government, beholden to a range of vested interests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Worse still, decisions it took which were entirely unrelated to trade angered the US side. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February it sent 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers who had been stuck in Thailand for more than a decade back to China, defying warnings by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. One Thai trade official told the BBC the US negotiators were still bringing up the Uyghurs as a grievance at tariff talks in May. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then a regional army commander filed a lèse-majesté complaint against a US academic, resulting in him being jailed and then forced to leave Thailand. So, far from being at the front, Thailand found itself at the back of the queue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The other difficulty facing the Thai trade team was what the US was asking for in return for cutting the tariff rate, in particular access to Thailand's agricultural market, which is heavily protected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Food is big business in Thailand.

The company makes the basic components that go into everything in our digital lives: printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, RFID tags for pricing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Han says only about 12% of his products go to the US directly, but like SK Polymer the proportion that goes indirectly, as part of other manufactured goods, is much higher. But it is not just the tariff number that worries him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His concern is trans-shipment, the US charge that China is avoiding tariffs by routing its production through South East Asia. Already Vietnam, according to President Trump, will pay 40% - double the new tariff rate - on goods the US judges to be trans-shipped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both Thailand and Vietnam saw foreign investment increase significantly after tariffs were imposed on China in the first Trump term, and their exports to the US rose as well. Some of that was Chinese companies moving production; some was products using a lot more Chinese-made components.

It would be a lot more expensive. But it would be virtually impossible for Thailand or Vietnam or the Philippines or Malaysia to get a very high threshold, say 50-60%, made within that country.

Despite President Trump claiming he has got zero percent tariffs for US goods coming into the Philippines and Indonesia, both those countries have said this is not correct, and that much still needs to be negotiated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the Thai government, having started so late, and struggled to meet US demands, just getting a deal will have been a relief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They will worry about how to make the deal work later, as the details are worked out, which typically takes years. And in that, they are far from alone – rich and developing economies alike are scrambling to keep up with Trump's mercurial tariff policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At some point this has to stop.

In April, four of them helped rescue children trapped in a shophouse after a fire broke out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their recent actions have revived a debate on the rights – or lack thereof – of low-wage labourers in Singapore.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Singapore's fast-growing economy is built on the backs of these workers who make up nearly three quarters of the country's foreign workforce.  Many of them work in sectors like construction, marine shipyards and manufacturing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Singapore has no minimum wage for migrant workers which means some can earn as little as S$300 ($233; £175) a month according to advocacy groups. They live in crowded dormitories that are often situated away from residential areas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are also often subject to abuses by recruitment agencies and their employers, including overwork, unpaid labour and poor living conditions. These issues are well-documented, but activists say little has changed over the years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today, you celebrate them. Tomorrow, you will go back to generalising them as cheats, liars and dirty,\" social worker Suraendher Kumarr wrote on Instagram, in response to the sinkhole incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During the Covid pandemic in 2020, their living conditions were laid bare after worker dormitories emerged as a virus hotbed, with hundreds of workers testing positive daily. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It sparked a public discussion about their conditions - which advocates had for decades warned about – and authorities later took action to improve dormitory standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another persistent issue, on which the sinkhole incident has again cast a spotlight, is the use of flat-bed trucks to ferry these workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is something poignantly poetic about the fact that migrant workers, likely transported on the backs of lorries, went out of their way to save a Singaporean in her car,\" said Mr Kumarr, who is a member of rights group Workers Make Possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Singapore laws prohibit people from travelling on the cargo decks of such trucks – except in medical emergencies. But it is allowed if they are employed by the owners of the trucks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sometimes, as many as 12 workers get packed into the back of a flat-bed truck with no seatbelts on. This is an economical option for many employers who also use the trucks to transport goods. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this has led to multiple accidents, some involving deaths. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In April 2021, two foreign workers died and more than a dozen were wounded after the lorry they were in crashed into a stationary flat-bed truck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2024, at least four workers were killed and more than 400 injured in similar accidents.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b586/live/eeff8340-6dbb-11f0-8245-6f93c3128690.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Gavin Butler A group of migrant workers sitting at the back of a lorry in Singapore\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/Gavin Butler</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Activists have for years lobbied to ban the practice of ferrying workers on lorries</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Activists have long lobbied to ban this mode of transportation – the issue has also been debated time and again in parliament – but little has changed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Singapore government repeatedly says that while it has been encouraging companies to transport workers on buses, an outright ban on such trucks is not feasible for small businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Many of them could be forced to shut down, causing workers, both local and foreign, to lose their jobs,\" a senior minister of state told parliament in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will also lead to delays for critical projects like [public housing], schools, hospitals and [train] lines, and result in higher costs for Singaporeans.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Activists criticise authorities for reducing the workers' rights to mere economic considerations, noting that other countries that rely heavily on migrant workers, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have outlawed transporting people on trucks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The levies collected from foreign workers could be used to subsidise other modes of transport without passing costs on to businesses and consumers, Mr Kumarr suggested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The government's rhetoric \"preserves the status quo [and] places disproportionate power in the hands of employers, over the lives and livelihoods of migrant workers,\" said Jaya Anil Kumar, senior researcher with the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics, another organisation that advocates for migrants' rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A ban on lorry rides is just one in a list of changes advocates have been calling for, which include a living wage, stronger whistleblower protections, and subsidised healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite dedicating decades of their lives to Singapore, these workers also have no way of putting down roots because of the type of work permit they hold, which are different from that of foreign professionals and executives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They cannot qualify for permanent residency, no matter how long they've worked in the country.

Some called for them to be granted monetary rewards and even permanent residency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Singapore's manpower ministry said in a statement to the BBC that it is \"encouraged to receive feedback calling for more forms of appreciation\" for migrant workers but did not address the specific suggestions raised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Their everyday acts of care and bravery deserve to be acknowledged and celebrated as part of who we are as a community,\" the ministry's spokesman said in response to queries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Migrant rights group Its Raining Raincoats has raised S$72,000 ($55,840; £41,790) from its own fundraiser, which will be divided equally among the seven men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So many times, we have seen how these migrant workers risk their own lives to rescue many citizens, including children, from dangerous situations,\" said AKM Mohsin, who runs an activity centre for Bangladeshi workers in central Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They make the news and are held up as excellent examples of humanitarian work, but their own humanity and human rights are constantly being violated at their workplaces, in how they are transported, and how they live,\" Mr Mohsin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, there has been an increased awareness around migrant workers issues over the years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Advocacy groups and the government have organised activities that bring workers and the broader community together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Mohsin, for instance, runs a space for migrant workers to write, dance, and play music – Singaporeans have helped translate and publish their works, and often provide an audience for their performances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But some activists say most in the country still see migrant workers as a class that is separate and inferior to the local community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many live and work in industrial areas that are often further away from the city's residential regions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2008, some 1,400 residents in Serangoon Gardens, an upper middle-class neighbourhood, petitioned against the construction of a migrant worker dormitory near their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To placate them, authorities reduced the size of the dormitory and built a separate road for workers to access the dormitory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We basically see them as a different class of people.

It is funded by private donations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The UK is home to some of the best paediatric facilities in the world, yet while countries like the US, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and many others have stepped up to help, the UK has yet to do the same,\" Project Pure Hope says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Majd's arrival in the UK comes less than a week after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5v5568mzro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">promised to evacuate</a> more badly injured children, although the government has released few details of the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Majd's medical team – all working for free – will include craniofacial, plastic and orthodontic surgeons, with hospital bills paid for by private donations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If we're able to give him a face and a jaw which he can use then it won't be completely normal, but hopefully he'll be able to feed himself and speak, and his facial expressions will be better,\" says lead surgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a professor of Paediatric Neurosurgery at Great Ormond Street.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hopefully that's going to make a big impact on how he lives and on his future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our hope is that we will be able to help many more children like him in the coming months.

No Israeli re-occupation of Gaza after the war ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. A future governance that must be Palestinian-led, involving the internationally backed Palestinian Authority. No role for Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The principles were intended to generate support from America's allies in Europe and parts of the Arab world - even if Israel objected to many of them. Few probably remember <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67355319\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Blinken declaring his Tokyo Principles</a> - least of all the Trump administration, which immediately jettisoned them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the ideas are still supported by many US allies, who travelled to the United Nations in New York this week for a French-Saudi-led conference calling for a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp5z1vvj5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">rekindling of the two-state solution. </a></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: How did Gaza get to the brink of starvation?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The conference made headlines as France, then the UK, committed to recognising a Palestinian state later this year under certain conditions. On Wednesday afternoon, Canada followed suit. But the Trump administration boycotted the meeting, viewing it as anti-Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The United States will not participate in this insult but will continue to lead real-world efforts to end the fighting and deliver a permanent peace,\" said US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, deriding the conference as a \"publicity stunt\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, a chasm has opened up between the US and its traditional allies on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This raises a question: Does the Trump administration have a vision for the future governance of Gaza and longer-term permanent peace?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is becoming increasingly clear that it doesn't - at least not one of its own. Earlier this month, I asked Ms Bruce what the administration's vision was for the future governance of Gaza, beyond its requirement that Hamas cannot exist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She responded that \"countries, our partners in the region\" were working to implement \"new ideas\" the president had asked for. When I pressed her on what this involved she said: \"I won't exactly tell you today.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">No Gaza 'riviera' - but another plan uncertain</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, President Trump declared that the US would take over the Gaza Strip and build a<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk0r3kvxyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"> \"riviera of the Middle East\"</a> in a plan that involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory, which the US and Israel later tried to claim meant \"voluntary\" emigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whilst the idea was clearly unfeasible and would be in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z32y12jpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">violation of international law, </a>it appeared to be Trump's post-war plan. It would presumably have involved Israeli military occupation of the strip to facilitate it. It was not clear how any continuing insurgency by Hamas or aligned armed groups would have been defeated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, the plan has been slowly, quietly dropped - at least in its fuller form. Asked on Tuesday about his plan to move Palestinians Trump described it as \"a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people, but also some people didn't like it\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latter was probably a reference to rejection by Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, which Trump visited in May for a lavish trade tour to take in gilded palaces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The administration prefers to talk about the immediate issue: freeing hostages and getting a ceasefire. When Trump was again asked to look beyond that, during a recent White House visit from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he immediately deferred to the Israeli leader to answer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It amounts to a growing evidence that the Trump administration's strategy on Gaza increasingly parallels that of its Israeli ally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Netanyahu rejects any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in future governance of Gaza, where his forces now control some two-thirds of the territory. The far-right flank of his coalition demands permanent military occupation, the expulsion of Palestinians and the building of Jewish settlements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel and the US have attempted to take control of the food supply for Palestinians, within militarised zones, while Israel also arms Palestinian militiamen who rival Hamas. The international body that monitors famine, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), said there is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvxgl5zxpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">mounting evidence of widespread starvation</a>, malnutrition and disease in Gaza. Israel has blamed Hamas and the UN for the crisis, but said it is facilitating more aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many European nations have watched aghast. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told me on Wednesday: \"We have seen the most horrific scenes. The global community is deeply offended by children being shot and killed as they reach out for aid.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Starvation appears to be an inflection point for European countries - a moral impetus to drive their divergent diplomacy. Domestic pressures in Britain and France also mounted to recognise a Palestinian state under certain conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Without a coherent, internationally backed plan for future governance, Gaza faces the prospect of increasing chaos. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb60/live/b64e9060-6d87-11f0-98fc-31c75321b3a0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun Smoke rises from Gaza as the sun sets, as seen from the Israeli side of the Israel-Gaza border\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Smoke rises from Gaza as the sun sets, as seen from the Israeli side of the Israel-Gaza border, July 30</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Blinken was aware of this risk from early in the war, and shuttled between Arab states trying to get them to sign up for a future plan involving parts of the Palestinians Authority and Arab countries providing security forces. He also intervened on at least three occasions, forcing Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, twice using the threat of restricting US weapons to make his point. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has been no such pressure by the Trump administration, which accelerated arms to Israel since January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US has left what amounts to a strategic vacuum on Gaza's long-term plan. The Europeans, working with Gulf Arab counties, spent this week trying to fill it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For them, without effective aid, governance and a long-term peace plan, the impact on the ground will only deteriorate. They called this week for urgent aid intervention, backing the Palestinian Authority, and reviving work towards a two-state solution - even without the US signed up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It upends years of convention by which major Western powers would recognise a Palestinian state only at the end of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Importantly, their combined statement meant Saudi Arabia, a leader of the Arab and Muslim world, was joining the condemnation of Hamas and call for its disarmament.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now they're hoping their move, supported by Arab countries, pressures Trump back towards a more established diplomatic process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But their conference - which will meet again in September - is working against all odds.

Eighty percent of the world's earthquakes occur along the ring, according to the British Geological Survey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just off the coast of the Peninsula, the Pacific plate is moving north-west at about 8cm (3in) per year - only about twice the rate that your fingernails grow, but fast by tectonic standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There it comes into contact with another, smaller plate - called the Okhotsk microplate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Pacific plate is oceanic, which means it has dense rocks and wants to sink beneath the less dense microplate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the Pacific plate sinks towards the centre of the Earth, it heats up and begins to melt, effectively disappearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this process is not always smooth.

One man remains in critical condition in hospital.  </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A man 'sprays' gunfire in a busy Manhattan neighbourhood</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just moments before the chaos, at around 18:30 EST (23:30 BST), a 27-year-old drove into one of the busiest areas in Manhattan, completing a cross-country car ride through the states of Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Officials say Shane Tamura, of Las Vegas, double-parked his black BMW on Park Avenue - just blocks from tourist destinations Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wearing a jacket, a button-down shirt and sunglasses, he wielded an assault-style rifle with his right arm, marching with determination toward the skyscraper where  he knew the National Football League (NFL) was headquartered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he would never make it to that office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, as he reached the doors of 345 Park, which stretches an entire New York City block, he began \"spraying\" the lobby with gunfire, according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At first, Tamura walked right past a stationed officer. But then he turned to the right, saw him and fired, killing 36-year-old New York police officer Didarul Islam, who leaves behind two children and a pregnant wife, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He was slain in the entryway to the right as soon as he entered the building,\" Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura wasted little time before firing at another woman taking cover behind a pillar, making his way through the lobby and continuing to shoot, authorities say. Wesley LePatner, who worked upstairs at financial firm Blackstone, was killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our prayers are with her husband, children and family,\" the company said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An NFL employee was \"seriously injured\" in the attack, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote to staff. Craig Clementi, who worked in the finance department, was on his way home when he was shot, his father-in-law Robert Hunter told the New York Daily News. He is now recovering from surgery.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Mayor: New York gunman left note blaming NFL for brain injury</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A mistaken elevator ride</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the gunfire continued to ring out, another security guard tried in vain to activate an alarm system to disable the elevators, potentially preventing more carnage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the guard, Aland Etienne, was \"assassinated\" as he took cover behind the counter, Adams said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After that, the gunman headed to an elevator. As he waited for the lift, a woman emerged and somehow was allowed to exit unscathed, police said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the lift he boarded would not take him where he intended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He had gone to the wrong elevator bank and arrived, not at the NFL offices, but at the 33rd floor offices of the real-estate company that owned the building, Rudin Management. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: People seen evacuating NYC building with their hands raised</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Frantic emails and a run for help</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As chaos unfolded in the lobby, employees in the building sent frantic messages over email and Microsoft Teams that there was a shooter downstairs, a Blackstone worker told the Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Chen told ABC News that she was watching a presentation on the second floor of the skyscraper with about 150 other people when they heard the first shots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Some went out in the back door, out onto the street,\" she said. \"Other people, including me, we ran into the conference room.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A photo circulating on social media appears to show Blackstone employees piling couches, desks and other furniture in front of a door in a panic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those in the NFL offices, meanwhile, received messages from the league warning them of gunfire, according to ESPN. Told to switch their phones to silent and hide until law enforcement arrived, they waited for a shooter who would never make it to his target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the plaza outside the Park Avenue tower, law enforcement flooded the scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nekeisha Lewis could hear the sounds of rapid gunfire from inside the skyscraper, while seated nearby with a friend. She could see the gunman through the glass, she told NBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before she knew it, someone ran from the building \"really hard\" toward them and began crying out for help, saying he'd been shot, Ms Lewis said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Because of how strongly he was running, I couldn't believe it. He had what looked like … an exit wound in the back.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She joined others, taking cover behind a wall. As they waited, dozens of workers gradually rushed from the building holding their hands above their heads as they evacuated.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'Study my brain please'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, inside, Tamura was roaming the 33rd floor, firing rounds \"as he travelled\", Ms Tisch said. He shot and killed his last victim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then, authorities said, he walked down a hallway and shot himself in the chest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura used an AR-15-style rifle he had assembled with a lower receiver - or gun frame - that an associate purchased for him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With teams in two states, investigators are still working to trace Tamura's trip  from Las Vegas to New York City. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A rambling three-page note was found on his body.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The gunman wrote he was suffering from CTE, a brain disease triggered by head injuries like those suffered in military combat and contact sports like American football. Officials also said Tamura had \"a documented mental health history\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura, who played football as a teenager - though not professionally, according to friends -  \"seemed to have blamed the NFL\", Mayor Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Study my brain. I'm sorry,\" the note said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It added: \"Intentional harm to civilians, especially children, is strictly prohibited.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Layan and Mira are just two of more than 160 cases of children shot in the war in Gaza, for whom we have gathered accounts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We found that in 95 of these cases, the child had been shot in the head or chest. In 59 of those, we obtained testimony from eyewitnesses, either directly or via human rights organisations and medics. The witnesses alleged that 57 of these children were shot by the IDF, and two were shot by Palestinians - one in celebratory gunfire and the other in a gang conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the remaining 36 out of the 95 cases, we have no account of what happened.
