It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when President Trump gave approval but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Good luck and Godspeed'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EDT on Friday. \"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: Go,\" Trump himself told Fox &amp; Friends on Saturday in the hours after the overnight raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said to us, and we appreciate it… good luck and Godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-hour and twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence… it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f40/live/d92ed9d0-e8e0-11f0-bfa4-bd930904d461.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Donald Trump / TruthSocial Image shows CIA Director John Ratcliffe, President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Donald Trump / TruthSocial</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump watched a live stream of the operation from his Florida estate</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months, thousands of US troops have deployed to the region, joining an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships in the largest military build-up in decades as President Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Loud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time, and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. \"I heard a huge sound, a loud bang,\" reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. \"It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Smoke, bangs and helicopters in Caracas</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas,\" one witness. Daniela, told the BBC. \"Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, although he did not specify how. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,\" he said. \"It was dark and it was deadly.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'They knew we were coming'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a heavily fortified military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas. \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the American helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Secretary of State Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless,\" said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Briefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump added. \"This would not be good.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The US struck several locations around Caracas, including Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Maduro's compound, as elite US troops flooded in, Trump said the Venezuelan president - who has reportedly increased his reliance on Cuban bodyguards in recent months - attempted to flee to a safe room. \"He was trying to get to a safe place, which wasn't safe, because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 seconds,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He made it to the door. He was unable to close it,\" Trump said. \"He got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that [room].\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked if the US could have killed Maduro, an authoritarian leader who took over the presidency in 2013, if he had resisted arrest, Trump said: \"It could have happened.\" On the US side, \"a couple of guys were hit\", he said, but no US service members were killed. The Venezuelan authorities have not confirmed any casualties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had previously offered a $50m reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.

So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supporters of Maduro's government have also been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c5yqygxe41pt?post=asset%3A1c86abcb-cdc7-4ae2-8412-7cebe1230fdd#post\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">rallying in the streets</a> of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said of Trump. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, is that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos, which are pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela, roaming the streets with weapons yesterday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jorge added that he's worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said of Cabello. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is skeptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\", — which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is only the beginning; we know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"tom-bateman-and-kristina-volk-contributed-to-this-report.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Tom Bateman and Kristina Volk contributed to this report.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Venezuela is not mentioned as a country of origin for fentanyl in the DEA's 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has designated two Venezuelan drug gangs, Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles, as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTOs) and has alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months, US forces <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8484p7ggmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">carried out more than two dozen strikes</a> in international waters on boats they allege were used to traffick drugs.

But that doesn't make Saturday's events straightforward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, is a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains deeply unclear what comes next inside Venezuela itself. Trump has claimed the US will now \"run\" Venezuela but has not clarified what he means by that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Will the US try to push for fresh elections? Will it try to depose further senior members of the government or the military and force them to face justice in the US?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he was not afraid of putting \"boots on the ground\" and hinted bigger strikes could come if deemed necessary.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More surprisingly, he also said the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado didn't have the \"support or respect\" in Venezuela to take power. She frequently praised Trump and they were allies. Many expected him to back her in any power transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he insinuated he could instead work with Maduro's deputy Delcy Rodriguez saying she was essentially \"willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Rodriguez was part of Maduro's regime. Trump appears to be suggesting they're keen to work with her on a negotiated transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could this mean leaving power in exchange for not facing the same fate as Maduro? Or assuming power but allying with the US, including for example allowing more access to its vast oil reserves? And if so, how would other Maduro allies who have long-accused the US of imperialist tendencies, and Venezuela's opposition who loathe Maduro's regime, react to that?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Machado has said the opposition's 2024 election candidate Edmundo Gonzalez should \"assume\" the presidency and heralded this action as a day of \"freedom\" for Venezuela. There were celebrations among some Venezuelans in the country and overseas who feel this could mark the end of an authoritarian rule and pave the way for a much freer country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not everyone aligned with the opposition agrees though. Some may be fierce critics of Maduro, but also deeply sceptical of US intervention in the country – not least because of the US's record of backing coups and regime change, some of which led to dictatorships and human rights abuses themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others warn this would not also be simple given the government's grip on power in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as \"colectivos\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some fear US intervention could trigger violent fragmentation and a prolonged power struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Maduro's closest allies, Saturday's events raise urgent questions and fears about their own futures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many may not want to give up the fight or allow a transition unless they feel they could receive some kind of protection or reassurance from persecution themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Trump, his administration has become increasingly muscular in the region with its financial bailout for Argentina, tariffs on Brazil to try to influence the coup trial of Trump ally and former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now the military intervention in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He benefits from having more allies in the region now - with the continent shifting rightwards in recent elections in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. But while Maduro has few allies in the region, some regional powers such as Brazil and Colombia do not support US military intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And some of Trump's own MAGA base in the US are also not happy at his growing interventionism after promising to put \"America First\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

The first attack - on 2 September - has drawn particular scrutiny as there was not one but two strikes, with survivors of the first hit killed in the second.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign more generally fell into the category of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9kgqwnk8wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, the White House said it had acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in October, Trump said he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also threatened strikes on land against what he described as \"narco-terrorists\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the first of such strikes had been carried out on 24 December, though he gave little detail, just stating that it had targeted a \"dock area\" where boats alleged to carry drugs where being loaded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prior to Maduro's capture, Trump repeatedly said that Maduro \"is no friend of the US\" and that it would be \"smart for him to go\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also increased the financial pressure on Maduro by declaring a \"total naval blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Oil is the main source of foreign revenue for the Maduro government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also deployed a huge military force in the Caribbean, whose stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as targeting vessels they accuse of smuggling drugs, the force has also played a key role in the US naval

relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report from 2020, almost three quarters of the cocaine reaching the US is estimated to be trafficked via the Pacific with just a small percentage coming via fast boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most of the early strikes the US has carried out were in the Caribbean, more recent ones have focused on the Pacific.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Trump told US military leaders that the boats targeted \"are stacked up with bags of white powder that's mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fentanyl is a synthetic drug which is 50 times more potent than heroin and has become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 December, Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction\", arguing that it was \"closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The kidults</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience.

In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it.

Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt.

She has even considered \"quitting the pit\" - Chinese slang for retiring a hobby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is so difficult to buy them,\" Stella says. \"Our daily life is not easy already and why should we make things harder for ourselves?\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

as is the bar's safety record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify has been examining videos taken by survivors and onlookers and speaking to fire safety experts to find clues about what went wrong.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bottles with sparklers held in the air</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two striking images shared widely online show people carrying champagne bottles with lit sparklers above their heads, with a crowd around them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One image shows flames starting to gather on the ceiling above people holding five of these bottles aloft.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second image is a closer-up angle, showing a person wearing a crash helmet and holding a bottle with a lit sparkler, sitting on the shoulders of another person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sparks from this bottle appear to be closer to the ceiling.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify determined these images were taken after midnight on 1 January by confirming there were not earlier versions and matched them against public photos of Le Constellation - using details including the bar design and distinctive pipework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there was no evidence the images had been ​​manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other videos we verified from the night of the fire, some people in the bar can be seen filming the flames as loud club music thumps in the background. In one video, some people start to hurry for an exit stairwell while shouting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Béatrice Pilloud, the attorney-general of the Valais region, said everything led investigators to believe the fire had started from sparklers attached to bottles of champagne that were \"moved too close to the ceiling\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Questions about foam padding on ceiling</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another focus is on foam-like padding on the bar's ceiling and whether it was compliant with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two fire safety experts told BBC Verify that the materials visible in photos and videos of Le Constellation appeared to show \"egg box foam\", a type of sound-absorbing material made from polyurethane (PU).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the photo of the bottles being held up, flames are visible on a part of the ceiling with a foam-like covering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">PU foam is often treated with fire-retardant before being installed as a noise dampener in factories and entertainment venues. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But untreated, it can be highly flammable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once ignited, polyurethane acoustic foam can exhibit rapid flame spread across its high-surface-area profile and produce dense, toxic smoke, significantly accelerating fire growth and reducing available escape time,\" said Dr Peter Wilkinson of Loughborough University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Edwin Galea, from the University of Greenwich, said the effectiveness of retardant treatment on PU foam can wear off over time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Swiss authorities say they cannot confirm what type of foam-padding was used in the bar and whether or not it complied with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c8xdxvj2qjdt\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In Friday's press conference</a>, officials talked about a \"flashover\" happening in the bar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Galea explained this is what happens when hot gases rise to the ceiling, reach a critical temperature and then ignite the room near instantaneously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Michael Klippel, a fire safety expert at ETH Zurich University, \"survival after flashover is very unlikely\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authority responsible for overseeing fire safety inspections in Crans-Montana is the Office Cantonal du Feu (OCF) of the Canton of Valais. The inspections are carried out by local officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities said in a press conference that inspections on a building the size of Le Constellation should have been carried out each year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has contacted the OCF to request access to previous inspection documents.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Exit routes from the bar</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say they will also focus on exit routes at the bar, which sits across two levels - a ground floor and a basement.

Over the last year, an unprecedented 18 condo projects were cancelled in the city, with experts expecting that number will grow as demand continues to plummet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The downturn has reignited debate over whether developers catered too much to real estate investors by building smaller, more affordable units that minimised square footage to keep prices low in areas where land values are high, and which were often designed to be rented out or flipped for profit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investors own the majority of condos under 600 sq ft in Toronto, according to national database Statistics Canada. Construction of these small units skyrocketed in 2016, and they now make up 38% of condos built in the city, compared with only 7.7% before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These units have not exploded in the same way in the US, where they represent a very small share of the market, though Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, said \"their prevalence has roughly doubled over the past decade\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With so much inventory on the market in Canada, some micro-condos that had sold for half a million dollars a few years ago are now reselling for C$300,000 ($217,000; £163,000) or less – a price recently unthinkable in downtown Toronto, which is often cited as one of the most unaffordable cities in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a race to the bottom getting these things sold,\" said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, an organisation that has been tracking the high-rise market in Toronto for decades. (Shaun Hildebrand is not related to Ms Hildebrand.)</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why are so many condos sitting empty?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The condo slump is not unique to Toronto, with Vancouver experiencing a similar –albeit smaller – downturn since 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are a few reasons for this, experts tell the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First is an overabundant supply. Thousands of units were  built over the last two years, in part to meet an unprecedented surge in Canada's population driven largely by immigration, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the number of newcomers dropped sharply following a shift in Canada's immigration policies, made partly to address the housing crunch. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://economics.bmo.com/en/publications/detail/8b9b865f-94ef-4161-a81f-bad7ad8c3fd4/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report released in December by the Bank of Montreal</a> shows that Canada's population saw its largest decline in 2025 on record since the 1940s, barring the 2020 Covid pandemic, driven mainly by new immigration caps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a turn-around that developers could not have predicted, and resulted in more than 60,000 new units completed in recent years to meet a demand that no longer exists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Simply put, \"the market just got way too ahead of itself\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second reason is pricing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's central bank lowered interest rates during the pandemic to stimulate the economy, and investors, looking to buy in a real estate market that had seemed like a sure bet for decades, assumed prices could only continue to rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a while they did, spiking \"to a level that really made no sense\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, the Bank of Canada began to increase rates to battle post-pandemic inflation. Combined with oversupply, that sure bet became less certain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, some investors are having trouble closing on units they bought pre-construction at those inflated prices. Many have been forced to try and sell them at a significant loss. Others are too spooked to enter the market or are waiting for prices to drop even further, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is some speculation that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64082923\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Canada's 2022 freeze on foreign home buyers</a>, brought in to help tackle the housing affordability crisis, also played a role. Numbers show that they represent a small fraction of owners – around 2% to 6% – but Mr Hildebrand said it is possible it has sent a signal that Canada is closed for business.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Maggie Hildebrand shares on TikTok what it's like to live in a micro condo</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The condo crash and the housing market</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One clear winner from the downturn of the condo market is renters like Ms Hildebrand, who now have more options due to greater supply and slightly better deals on rent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Hildebrand paid C$2,200 a month for her micro-condo. She has since moved to a larger, 700 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in an older building with a leafy backyard for only C$200 more. She credits the move to a big improvement in her quality of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My birthday is tomorrow, and I'm having a party and hosting 25 people,\" she told the BBC in December. \"A year ago, that was not possible.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hildebrand said the slump will likely change who developers see as their main customer, shifting from short-term investors seeking quick profits towards longer-term investors and people who plan to settle in the condo they're buying,</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've learned our lesson here,\" he said. The units won't be phased out altogether, he noted, because there is still demand for affordability, \"but we went way too far\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some buyers are benefiting, too. Alex Cruz, a Toronto-based estate agent at Ari Zadegan Group Realty, told the BBC that smaller units were being purchased by those looking for a bargain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there is a good deal per square foot, people will buy it,\" Mr Cruz said, adding it had given some \"an opportunity to get into the market\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The slump comes as Canada grapples with a housing crisis that has become a central political issue for all levels of government. Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to double the rate of new homes built in the next decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the construction of thousands of units now put on hold or cancelled, there will be fewer units entering the market by the end of the decade. This could exacerbate Canada's housing crunch, Mr Hildebrand said, as condos are heavily relied on to boost supply in big cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Mr Hildebrand and others warn that the low prices will be short-lived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The question now is how long do we stay here, and what are the implications going to be for the housing supply in the next decade?\" Mr Hildebrand said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

His pitch to lead the most expensive US city included big changes, such as universal childcare, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the mayor is likely to encounter several challenges in trying to deliver on these promises, and he'll need to keep on board other important political stakeholders - beginning on his first full day in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He'll put all of his political and other might behind getting these things accomplished,\" said Patrick Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University. But, he said, New York City is \"a big place, it's a complicated place, and so, all bets are off about whether these things can happen or not\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">1. Paying for policy promises </h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani outlines policy promises during his inaugural address</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's lofty policy platform has centred on cost-of-living issues, including freezing rent hikes for subsidised housing units and providing universal free childcare. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He will be able to accomplish some of his policy goals on his own and without significant expense, government experts said. For instance, if he wants to freeze rents for subsidised housing, he can appoint people aligned with this policy on the city's rent control board.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But finding the funding to make other goals a reality when the state and city face budget shortfalls will prove complicated, government experts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to provide free bus service and free child care, these kinds of things cost money,\" said Robert Shapiro, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. \"The big roadblock for the things he'd like to do are the state of the New York, the financial capacity of the state and the political willingness of the governor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has said some funding would come from new taxes. He believes taxes on the wealthy could raise as much as $9bn (£6.6bn), with pledges to raise the corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mamdani needs the support of the state government to make tax changes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The more moderate Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed him in the race last year as well as some of his affordability goals. But Hochul, who is making her own political calculations as she runs for re-election this year, has already indicated she may not support Mamdani's broader tax plan. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">2. Avoiding White House intervention </h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What Trump and Mamdani have said about each other</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For weeks leading up to the New York City mayoral election, President Donald Trump took to social media and news briefings to attack Mamdani, a rising Democratic star, as a \"communist\" mayor who threatened the future of the largest US city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump threatened to withhold billions of federal dollars to the city if Mamdani was elected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the first meeting between the future mayor and the president last November proved much more amicable than expected. The two men frequently smiled at each other and shared praise, with Trump telling Mamdani he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the two politicians' diametrically opposed policy positions could lead to conflict as Mamdani takes over City Hall. Immigration may be a point of tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, New York has not been a target of Trump's efforts to send in National Guard troops, as he has done in several Democrat-led cities across the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Trump administration did ramp up immigration raids in New York as part of its enforcement efforts in several cities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor pledged in his victory speech that New York would \"remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and  ... led by an immigrant\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">3.

The now-mayor reached out to his opponents in the business world to hear their concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani pledged to meet with leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who later said he would offer his help if Mamdani was elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani also met with real estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who described him as \"personable\" and \"smart\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Gural and others in the business community continue to express their concerns that the 34-year-old lacks the experience to lead the nation's largest city - and that his plans to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy people will drive some of them to leave New York. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Egan said it remains to be seen whether a \"spirit of cooperation\" will persist between business leaders and Mamdani as he forges ahead with an agenda that is ideologically at odds with some of their goals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any mayor of New York needs cooperation from business leaders, and in particular finance and real estate that play big roles here in New York City,\" he said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">4.

But some experts and community leaders say those efforts failed to adequately address homelessness and mental health crises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson, a counselor to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said he and others will judge Mamdani first and foremost on how the city is policed, and how shoplifting and quality of life crimes are handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani won over some business leaders and members of the public with his decision to ask Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who served in Adams' administration, to stay on as police chief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Public safety is really kind of the prerequisite for success or failure,\" Mr Wolfson previously told the BBC. \"I think if people feel safe here, they can tolerate an awful lot of other challenges. And if they don't, then there's not a lot of other challenges that they will be willing to tolerate.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But last year, Bollywood's violent, male-driven action thrillers dominated the domestic box-office and cultural conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last weeks of 2025, Indian social media was swamped with discussions about a single juggernaut: <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5pygel84o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Dhurandhar, an espionage thriller</a> set in the backdrop of India-Pakistan tensions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Packed with graphic violence and gangland politics, the film became the defining hit of the year, cementing its place in a crop of aggressive, hypermasculine films that drove popular discourse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend was a stark contrast to 2024, when a number of films made by women - Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, Shuchi Talati's Girls Will Be Girls and Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies - got global attention and praise. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What 2024 established was that Indian women filmmakers are not marginal voices, but leading global ones,\" says film critic Mayank Shekhar, calling it \"a moment of truth\" rather than a trend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hope was that richer, more textured stories about women would grow both in number and popularity. Instead, in 2025 the top 10 box-office hits - five of them from Bollywood, a small relief for a Hindi film industry still struggling to regain its footing after the pandemic - were dominated by larger-than-life, hypermasculine heroes, from the historical epic Chhaava to the action spectacle War 2. The only film on the list led by a woman was an outlier: the Malayalam-language superhero film Lokah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wasn't just action thrillers that put men at the centre. Blockbuster romance Saiyaara followed a troubled male rockstar who ultimately \"rescues\" his partner who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Even mythical spectacles such as Kantara: Chapter 1 (Kannada) and Mahavatar Narsimha (dubbed into several languages) doubled down on traditional male heroism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The year's most talked-about films were dominated by images of men performing pain, power and vengeance at full volume.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"T Series Films In a poster for Tere Ishk Mein, actors Dhanush and Kriti Sanon are seen with bloody bruises on their faces\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">T Series Films</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tere Ishk Mein was southern superstar Dhanush's biggest Hindi film hit</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of the top 10, one of the year's most debated hits was Tere Ishk Mein, which features an angry, volatile male protagonist and a high-achieving woman whose ambitions are eclipsed by his obsessive love. Despite criticism for romanticising toxic masculinity, the film became actor Dhanush's highest-grossing Hindi release, earning more than 1,550m rupees ($17.26m, £12.77m) worldwide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another surprise hit was Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat, a relatively small-budget romance drama with a hero who, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/ek-deewane-ki-deewaniyat-movie-review-harshvardhan-rane-sonam-bajwa-film-revives-misogynistic-toxicity-of-darrs-anjaams-tere-naams-10318933/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">as a review put it</a>, is \"an obsessive lover who refuses to take no for an answer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">2024 offered \"a glimpse of what's possible\", says Priyanka Basu, a senior lecturer in Performing Arts at King's College London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She points out that Hindi cinema has historically marginalised women protagonists, adding that the male-centred industry has long had stark inequalities in casting, pay and opportunities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just one year to change that is unrealistic. We need more such years, and more stories that put women front and centre,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indian cinema's, and especially Bollywood's, fixation with the macho hero goes back to Amitabh Bachchan's \"angry young man\" image of the 1970s. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even the romantic era of superstars like Shah Rukh Khan offered only a brief detour - one he has since abandoned in favour of action-heavy blockbusters such as Pathaan and Jawan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend has carried onto streaming platforms as well - once seen as alternative spaces where women-centric storytelling could succeed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent report by media research company Ormax analysing 338 Hindi shows on streaming platforms showed that action and crime thrillers, mostly male-led, now make up 43% of the titles; female-led stories have fallen from 31% in 2022 to just 12% in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At some point, OTT (over-the-top, or streaming) platforms began chasing box-office logic,\" Mr Shekhar says. \"Streaming now mirrors theatrical trends instead of challenging them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Wayfarer Films Actor Kalyani Priyadarshan seen in a red and black vest with bruises on her arm.

Will that change overnight? No. But as the world order changes, so will our films,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's also the economic reality. Producers, distributors and exhibitors control the number of screens, marketing and visibility any film gets - and that often depends on the bankability of the male star. Independent and women-led films face an uphill battle, particularly if they are not fronted by big stars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Films nowadays are also going through a \"period of performative, exaggerated misogyny\", says screenwriter Atika Chohan, whose work includes women-led films Chhapaak and Margarita With a Straw.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of this, she thinks, is a response to the accountability demanded by women during the MeToo movement of 2017-19.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the movement exposed widespread abuse within the film industry, its impact was uneven. Some of the accused faced temporary setbacks, but most returned to work and structural power imbalances largely remain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as these [hypermasculine] films make money, they aren't going anywhere,\" Ms Chohan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as always, there are signs of hope, mostly from smaller, regional film industries and independent filmmakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new generation of independent filmmakers in India is making \"riveting, viable cinema\" instead of \"mass entertainers,\" Ms Choudhary points out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sharp indies such as Sabar Bonda and Songs of Forgotten Trees dug into complex social and political layers and told sensitive stories of relationships. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Telugu film The Girlfriend told the story of a woman in a toxic relationship learning to free herself, while Bad Girl (Tamil) was hailed as a successful coming-of-age drama told through a woman's lens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Malayalam cinema, Feminichi Fathima - with \"Feminichi\" a social-media distortion of \"feminist\" - used humour to follow a Muslim housewife's quiet rebellion against patriarchy. On the streaming side, The Great Shamsuddin Family has been praised for capturing the everyday resilience and complexities of modern Muslim women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a quieter movement, working from the margins,\" says Ms Choudhary. \"And it isn't going to disappear.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
