Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\"  Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The repression has not been confined to media workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One woman described how there are \"military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that \"the regime is not allowing news to come out of here.\" They added that \"there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for \"treason\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/middle-east/iran-update-january-5-2026/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reports of protests in a further 11 provinces</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 50 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 100 videos which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was \"very telling\" and amounted to evidence that the government's \"base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing \"improper hijab\" - more than <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3kl56z2l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">550 people were allegedly killed by security forces</a>, according to human rights groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2057md3gvro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he said that \"rioters must be put in their place\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would \"listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added that they would \"deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people\". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple verified videos filmed in the nearby Ilam city show security forces firing shots towards Imam Khomeini Hospital in the centre of the city later on Saturday. Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security forces have also been firing on protestors in other cities. In Fasa in the south-western Fars province, forces wearing military and riot gear were seen firing towards demonstrators.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Police fire shots towards protesters in Fasa, Iran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces -  who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders,\" Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most of the footage featuring violence seen by the BBC was carried out by security forces, a few clips have also shown demonstrators attacking government forces. In Qom, one video showed officers riding motorbikes being pelted with rocks as they sped past a small gathering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the western city of Azna, demonstrators appeared to start a fire outside a police station after security forces opened fire on protesters earlier.

They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has claimed in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country has an estimated 303bn barrels, the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. Additionally, Venezuelan oil is heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently working in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" Turenne added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ConocoPhillips, a major US oil company that no longer has a presence in Venezuela, \"is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability\", said spokesman Dennis Nuss.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,\" Nuss said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A third company, Exxon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vice President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality is more complex. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for this 2007 move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" American oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69qnvj6nlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> \"Spider Web\" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russian territory</a>. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked  to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, political analyst for Ukrainian media outlet Grunt, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mykhailo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Using a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-volodymyr-lozhko-and-anastasiia-levchenko\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Anastasiia Levchenko</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The venues should have been checked annually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters A woman kneels on the floor lighting a candle next to a pile of tributes including flowers and other lit candles outside Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fire</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjdjl303zxlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under criminal investigation</a>, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Its annual Belgian edition often features ambitious, creative stages and wild parties that draw music lovers from across the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Organisers are expecting more than 50,000 attendees each day in the Thai beach town Pattaya from 11 to 13 December. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pre-registration for tickets begins on 8 January. A \"full madness pass\" covering all three days of the festival will cost 12,500 baht ($400; £300) while a single-day pass is going at 5,100 baht.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More details on the festival's theme and line-up will follow soon, organisers said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the Tomorrowland group has held events in some Asian cities, this is the first time it will be holding an entire festival in the continent, and one that is similar to the scale of what it does in Belgium.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand finalised an agreement with Tomorrowland to host the event for five years and expects it to generate 21bn baht ($673m; £497m) over the period, Thai media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Expanding Tomorrowland to a new continent is a milestone we approach with great respect and excitement... This is the beginning of a long-term story,\" said Tomorrowland's chief executive officer Bruno Vanwelsenaers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, Thailand has become a strong contender in the live music scene. Last year, it played host to international music festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and Creamfields. Bangkok was also a stop on K-pop band Blackpink's world tour last October. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the country's homegrown music and arts festival Wonderfruit is emerging as a hot destination on the festival circuit, drawing tens of thousands of people each year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They drove her to a deserted place where they raped her and then threw her out of the speeding vehicle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A police spokesman said they had acted swiftly and arrested the two men and seized the vehicle.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The woman was discharged by the hospital on Monday night following treatment and surgeries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior police official Mukesh Kumar told the BBC that they have approached the court to allow her to visit the prison for an \"identification parade\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once the court order comes, she would be asked to pick out the two suspects from a crowd of men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police said the crime took place on the intervening night of 29th and 30th December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The incident took place between 12.30 and 02:00. One stood outside the van and kept an eye on the surroundings while the other raped the woman inside the van,\" Yashpal Yadav, public relations officer of Faridabad police, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police had questioned the suspects, who were later produced in court and sent to prison, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor at the hospital where the survivor was treated had said that the woman was brought in \"at around 05:30 on 30 December... she had a lot of injuries\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shalini Chopra, a social worker and an opposition politician, who spoke to the survivor after she was discharged from the hospital told the BBC that the woman was \"better but still in pain\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case has provoked anger and outrage in India and drawn comparisons with the horrific gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That crime had made global headlines, led to huge protests in Delhi and several other cities and forced the government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws that included the death penalty for the most gruesome attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51969961\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">were hanged</a> in 2020. One of the rapists died in prison while a juvenile was freed after spending time in a reform centre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite the heightened scrutiny of sexual crimes since then, tens of thousands of rapes and sexual assaults continue to be reported every year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to latest police records, 29,670 rapes and 2,796 attempted rapes were reported in 2023. In addition, police also recorded 849 cases of child rapes and 94 cases of attempted rapes of children.</p></div></div></body></html>"

countries' shared history of resisting Japan militarism, saying that China and South Korea should now \"work hand in hand to safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War Two and uphold peace and stability in Northeast Asia\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

eZyhnA\">But while South Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on \"viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue \"constructive\" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another item high on Lee's agenda is<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson similarly told reporters on Tuesday that both sides have agreed to \"carry out orderly, healthy, and beneficial cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's  elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9r0eyw0jno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. </a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards.

Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months.

Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for \"taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Cuba is ready to fall,\" retorted Trump on Air Force One.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Asked whether the US would carry out an operation targeting Colombia, Trump replied, \"It sounds good to me\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Historically, Colombia has been a close ally in Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter cartels.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iran</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran is currently facing <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3kl56z2l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mass anti-government protests</a>, and Trump warned overnight that the authorities there would be \"hit very hard\" if more protesters died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're watching it very closely.

That felt magical,\" says Nitesh Singh, who is based just outside Delhi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Reddy, he thought that the flower had much more potential in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was here for thousands of years, but nobody knew it could become clean, healthy food,\" adds Singh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, in 2018 he founded Blue Tea, hoping to grow an Indian brand, with Indian butterfly peas. To start with, it did not go well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Initially, we had to import because we couldn't find good quality flowers in India. The flowers here had fewer petals, and once sun-dried, nothing would remain. We needed a flower with more pigment, more petals, to retain colour after drying.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past seven years, Singh has been working with farmers to raise the quantity and quality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having started with five farmers, he now works with 600 across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Training and quality control are the biggest challenges,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plucking the flowers is a key part of the process.

About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland's economy is mainly based on fishing, and it receives large subsidies from the Danish government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. These may become more accessible as global warming leads to the melting of the massive ice sheet that covers the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Valuable mineral resources have been a key focus of Trump elsewhere in the world, including in his dealings with Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US president has said: \"We need Greenland for national security, not minerals.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also said that \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What has Trump said about the US controlling Greenland?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump repeated previous calls for the US to take over Greenland following the US military raid on Venezuela, during which its president Nicolás Maduro and his wife were seized and removed to New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying \"that's enough now\", describing the idea of US control as a \"fantasy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump and his allies went on to reiterate their threats. The president said he was \"very serious\" about his plans, adding that Greenland was important for European as well as American security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of his top aides, Stephen Miller, said \"nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland\". He argued that seizing the territory would benefit Nato, the Western military alliance to which both the US and Denmark belong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said: The US is the power of Nato.
