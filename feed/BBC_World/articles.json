The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards, and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday.

His horses - muscular and dynamic - remain some of the most prized and instantly recognisable paintings in contemporary art, sold for millions of dollars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An artist who was often described to have a nomadic and bohemian disposition, he dabbled seamlessly with Cubist-inspired modernism and traditional Indian themes, creating bold and vibrant canvases with scenes from history and mythology. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His signature style earned him the moniker of \"the Picasso of India\".

Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In May, the department estimated in its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025-06/fy26bibentire-book508060125_0.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">budget proposal</a> for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential.

It'd be up to the platforms to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure account-holders were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to $49.5m (US$33m, £25m) for the most serious breaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\" Anthony Albanese said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy – limited versions of which have been attempted with little success by other jurisdictions around the world – would help free children from addictive algorithms exposing them to harmful content like violence, pornography and misinformation, proponents said. It would also reduce cyber-bullying and online child exploitation. It would force kids outside, help them sleep better, improve their physical and mental health, it was suggested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noticeably absent from Albanese's announcement was a plan on exactly how the government was going to do this – it gave itself a year to work that out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Within weeks, it had rushed a skeletal bill through parliament, after allowing less than 48 hours for the public to make submissions on the law.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How will it be enforced?</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 seconds</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, and days out from the official start of the law, questions remain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government-funded, industry-run trial looked at the main methods of age assurance and earlier this year reported all were technically possible – but none were foolproof and all carried risks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Verification using IDs was the most accurate approach, but that requires users to hand over sensitive and important documents when polling shows most Australians don't trust social media firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Age inference, which draws conclusions based on users' online activity, and facial assessment technology both lacked the precision to be reliably applied to teenagers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the accuracy of face scans – already rolled out by Meta and Snapchat for suspected underage users – falters for people two to three years either side of 16; the intended target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the report found age assurance technologies can be \"private, robust and effective\", especially when layered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you go to a bottle shop and they look you up and down and go, 'Mmm not really sure', they ask you for some ID… It's the same principle,\" says Tony Allen, who heads the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme and ran the trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its findings weren't without controversy. Two former advisory board members levelled accusations of bias and \"privacy-washing\". And though the trial considered ways teenagers might bypass barriers, it was not tasked with testing them.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4d1/live/1bbc3c30-d1a7-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man holds a phone showing how to sit an age estimation check from the company Yoti\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A facial scan is one of the age check methods offered</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tips have flooded social media: everything from signing up with a parent's email and moving to platforms not explicitly named on the government's hit list, to using VPNs, which can disguise a user's location. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn72ydj70g5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">There was a temporary surge in VPN use in the UK after it introduced tougher age checks for pornography</a> earlier this year, and experts are expecting the same here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polling conducted for the government in May indicated a third of parents intended to help their kids circumvent the ban, and an experiment by the University of Melbourne showed that a $22 Halloween mask was enough to defeat facial assessment technology in some cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Proponents of age assurance contend that the technology to thwart circumvention exists.

Two teenagers have already filed a case in the nation's highest court, alleging the law is unconstitutional and Orwellian. Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, is also apparently considering its own challenge. Human rights groups and a smattering of legal experts have raised their hackles too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the government has insisted the social media companies have the money and the technology to make the ban happen, it has at the same time sought to manage expectations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through. Big reforms always do,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells has said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The key question is not can children get around it, Mr Allen says; that answer is yes. But will enough of them be bothered to?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To be a successful policy, it doesn't have to get to a point where 100% of children aren't on social media,\" he says. \"It only really has to get about 80% of them and the rest will follow.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some exasperated parents just want to be able to say it is illegal. They don't want their kids to feel entitled – or pressured – to access social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've always said, whether the law was enforceable or not, our main aim in all of this was to establish a new social norm,\" Mr Elachi says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will it reduce harm?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putting aside the question of whether it can be done, many are still asking: should it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First, there is concern that this policy pushes children into darker parts of the web.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Will it be gaming site chatrooms, which the Australia Federal Police have warned are hotbeds for radicalisation but are excluded from the ban?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Will it be sites like Omegle, which previous generations turned to when told they were too young for mainstream social media? It allowed users to video chat randomly selected strangers and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67485561\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was shut down two years ago over its failure to protect minors from predators</a>. Copycats have quickly replaced it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children can also still browse on several of the apps, like TikTok and YouTube, without accounts, a potentially riskier minefield of unfiltered content and advertisements - several platforms currently limit these on minors' accounts. \"This law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" a spokesperson for the company said this week.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's plenty of criticism of big tech over moderation, but few dispute that these large platforms do it better than their smaller peers. Facebook, for example, has systems which set off alarms bells if an adult is messaging a child frequently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're not stopping behaviour, you're just moving that behaviour to other platforms,\" says Tim Levy, head of online safety company Qoria and one of the trial advisers who quit. \"Telling the concerned Australian parents that it's all good now is a very dangerous message.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The science on social media and health is complex and still evolving too. Alongside the studies linking it to poor outcomes is also evidence it can be a lifeline for some children, particularly for those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've heard very little officially about what is being done to address the unmet needs of these more vulnerable children who for positive reasons have sought help or a sense of belonging and connection online,\" former children's commissioner Anne Hollonds tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her term finished just a few weeks ago, but Ms Hollonds has spent years lobbying the government on greater online guard-rails for kids and was surprised, frustrated even, to learn this \"blunt\" tool was the one they've chosen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What could be achieved if this regulatory effort and attention was used to pull other levers, she wonders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many have suggested the focus should be on forcing socials to better police harmful content and limit the power of algorithms, while also preparing children for the reality of life on the web.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 140 leading Australian and international experts signed an open letter raising these concerns, among others, before the legislation passed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's nothing magical about the age of 16,\" Ms Hollonds says. \"[This] really does nothing on its own.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/855d/live/e63dd7e0-d1af-11f0-83cd-5b415fb0080a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Anika Wells, wearing a blue top and white jacket, speaks at a lecturn while a blond woman in a pink jacket watches on\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Australia's top eSafety official (right) once advocated against a ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before her agency was officially charged with implementing this policy, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant made similar arguments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water, but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\" she said in June last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To that, Minister Wells counters: \"We can police the sharks\" – a biting reference to social media firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the critics are right about the challenges ahead, she told the BBC.

Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous.

The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis.

He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Strong solar storms can cause the Earth's atmosphere to expand out into space, which creates more drag for satellites. This can cause them to slow down enough for some to deorbit and fall back to Earth. </p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This is not just a theoretical risk - in February 2022 a solar storm <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5193/\" class=\"ssrcss-16fdtb5-InlineLink e1kn3p7n0\">led to the loss of 38 satellites<span class=\"visually-hidden ssrcss-1f39n02-VisuallyHidden e16en2lz0\">, external</span></a>.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Orbital changes of satellites also increase the risk of collision and space weather can also play havoc with sensitive electronics on board, causing malfunctions.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Radio communications can be badly impacted with GPS systems lost or disrupted for many days - so your car sat-nav could stop working, creating gridlock in cities. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans. From here, they continue to countries like Germany, France, and the UK.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Barbara Zanon/Getty Image A man hands out takeaway food to a line of men in coats and hats, outside in a square in Trieste (February 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Barbara Zanon/Getty Image</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most migrants who arrive in Trieste via the Balkan route are male</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After four months of being exploited in Libya, Esther escaped and crossed the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy from which she was rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to the island of Lampedusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She claimed asylum three times before she was granted refugee status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asylum seekers from countries viewed as safe are often rejected. At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"International Rescue Committee 3 women sitting in a room, smiling.

Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first.

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.

Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Try to remain civil'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
