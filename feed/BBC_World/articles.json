It was always the most likely and, in the absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, perhaps the most desirable outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But US President Donald Trump's pivot away from the need for an immediate ceasefire, which he said beforehand he wanted, will have caused profound dismay in Kyiv and around Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's position has long been that a ceasefire can only come in the context of a comprehensive settlement taking account of Russia's interests - and inevitably implies Ukraine's capitulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That's the position that Trump, once again, appears to have endorsed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only that, but it's been widely reported that Russia's demands include the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from areas of the eastern Donbas not currently held by Russia, in exchange for a willingness to freeze the lines further south, in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"is to go directly to a peace agreement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ceasefires, he noted, \"often times do not hold up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This appears to fly in the face of Ukraine's main demand, endorsed by all its European backers: that an unconditional ceasefire has to come first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Crucially, it also buys Russia's Vladimir Putin time on the battlefield, where he is convinced he's winning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If Putin's military objective was to avoid immediate constraints on Russian operations in Ukraine then he appears to have succeeded,\" says Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform and a former British diplomat, said Moscow's territorial demand was a non-starter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If Trump thinks that Zelensky is going to agree to give up the fortress cities of the Donetsk oblast, just to get Putin to stop making war on him, he's out of his mind,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It shows how little he still understands about the situation and the geography of Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At their brief press appearance last night, Putin warned Ukraine and the Europeans not to \"throw a wrench\" in the works of the unspecified progress he and Trump had made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that, for Kyiv and its allies, is precisely what Trump has done, undoing the achievements of what they had all hoped was a successful preceding week of frantic diplomacy aimed at influencing the outcome in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a reminder, as if one were needed, of Trump's tendency to echo the views of the last person to have his ear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a short while this morning, European leaders will have held their breath, waiting to see if their efforts had borne fruit or been cast aside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">True to his word before the summit, Trump got on the phone to Zelensky. The two men spoke for an hour, before being joined by European leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said the call was \"long and substantive\" and that he would travel to Washington on Monday for his first visit since the disastrous Oval Office encounter in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A lot has happened since then, with Kyiv's European allies working assiduously

Prosecutors contest this claim, and cited occasions when she travelled alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US attorney Michael Simpson said their relationship did not constitute a crime, but reflected \"a years-long fraud scheme that used public money for personal ends by exploiting their power and their authority\", according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At an undisclosed point in their relationship, a member of the public took photos of Cantrell and Mr Vappie dining together while the latter was said to be on duty. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cantrell filed a police report and sought a restraining order against the individual, prosecutors claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two are also accused of intimidating subordinates, lying to FBI agents and committing perjury by making false statements to a grand jury - which decide whether charges should be brought in certain cases in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If found guilty, any of the charges could bring multi-year prison sentences and fines of up to $250,000 (£184,000).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first female mayor of New Orleans in the city's 300-year  history, having served since 2018.

Its Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh described it as \"the epitome of psychological, moral and physical terrorism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/itamarbengvir/status/1956253014848663910\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">13-second-long video clip</a> is the first time that Barghouti has been publicly seen in years. He appears aged and gaunt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's national security minister, Ben Gvir, tells him: \"You will not win. He who messes with the people of Israel, he who will murder our children, he who will murder our women, we will wipe him out\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Barghouti tries to interject, Ben Gvir adds: \"You need to know this, throughout history.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13628771\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Marwan Barghouti</a>, 66, was jailed by Israel more than 20 years ago after he was convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. He is serving five life sentences plus 40 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA). He was targeted by Israel due to his leading role in the Second Palestinian Intifada or uprising from 2000-05.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The video originally surfaced on messaging groups for Ben Gvir's supporters on Thursday but has now been reposted on his X account.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minister says that having read how \"all sorts of \"senior officials\"\" in the PA did not like what he said, he will \"repeat it again and again without apologising\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian prisoner rights organisations say that Barghouti has been placed in solitary confinement since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. Last year they accused guards of \"brutally assaulting\" him in his cell which the Israeli prison service denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to the new video, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, Abdullah al-Zaghari accused Israel of seeking \"to eliminate him and assassinate the leaders languishing in its prisons\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Barghouti is one of the prisoners whose release Hamas is believed to have sought as part of an exchange deal for the remaining hostages it is holding. However, it is thought very unlikely that Israel would free him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the video, as Ben Gvir speaks, Barghouti – who is fluent in Hebrew – can be seen nodding and trying to break in, but the short clip ends before he does.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His wife, Fadwa, recommended to her husband's followers that only one still be used from the video which she believed showed his strength.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians widely see Barghouti as the leader who could best unify different political factions and negotiate peace with Israel.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And nowhere is this clearer than in Singapore, where ethnically Chinese people make up more than three-quarters of the multicultural population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trend is not surprising given that Chinese soft power seems to be on the rise – think viral Labubu dolls, humanoid robots and futuristic cities that are impressing travellers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Centuries-old and sophisticated, Chinese cooking is not among Beijing's list of priorities for turning the country into \"a powerhouse in culture\" by 2035.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, as an increasingly authoritarian China tries hard to win the world over, a sumptuous table may just be its most effective, and underrated, draw.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">First stop: Singapore</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Luckin, China's answer to Starbucks, opened its first overseas store in Singapore in March 2023. Two years on, there are more than 60. Last month, the chain made its US debut with two New York stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five major Chinese brands, Luckin included, currently run 124 outlets in Singapore, double the number they owned in 2023. It's hard to miss the evidence: huge, bright ads of chilli-laced dishes and, sometimes, Chinese idioms, in malls, buses and subway stations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From established chains to mom-and-pop stores and chic restaurants that challenge tired stereotypes, they have all been taking off here before leapfrogging further afield, to elsewhere in South East Asia and then across the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Succeeding in Singapore is \"a proof of concept for later expansion, convincing potential investors that the chain is ready to go global,\" says Thomas DuBois, a historian of modern China.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Singapore's Liang Seah Street is chock-a-block with Chinese food</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's an easy enough place for new restaurants to set up shop. And it is diverse, which makes it a great test kitchen for very different palates, from South Asian to European.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And importantly, Singapore is a travel hub where, Mr Dubois says, eating is almost like a national pastime: \"People go to Singapore to eat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And what they will find is menus that go beyond the ubiquitous dumplings and hot pot. The entrepreneurs behind the new Chinese culinary wave want to show people just how vast and diverse China is. And they cannot fake it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the visitors to Singapore are ethnic Chinese – not just from China, but from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Jakarta and so on – with a sophisticated understanding of Chinese cuisine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no one kind of fiery, says Claire Wang, the marketing manager for Nong Geng Ji, a chain from Hunan in central China, which is famous for its spicy dishes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hunan's fare has \"a tangy aftertaste achieved through fermented chilli peppers\", she says, unlike \"Sichuan's numbing-spicy or Guizhou's sour-spicy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After launching more than 100 restaurants in China, Nong Geng Ji opened its first overseas stop in Singapore in late 2023. It has since set up six more here, five in Malaysia, one in Canada, and is now eyeing opportunities in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's certainly proof of the growing appetite for chillies, especially the Chinese kind – a trend that would please China's former leader Mao Zedong. Born and raised in Hunan, he believed, \"You can't be a revolutionary if you don't eat chillies\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Finally, 'proper' Chinese food</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the less revolutionary among us, there is plenty more on the table: steamed buns, red meats, preserved vegetables, rice, seasonal stir-fries and delicately-flavoured seafood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's quite the spread compared to the \"Chinese food\" much of the world has become used to, especially in the West – food cooked up by Chinese immigrants in the 19th and 20th Centuries, whose scrubby, nondescript restaurants were often seen as low-brow.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A crowded street of restaurants and bars in New York City's Chinatown.

Ms Dunlop, a British food writer, has spent her career cooking in China's kitchens and studying its food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there is the stereotype, dubbed the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, a partly xenophobic myth that the food can make people feel sick because of supposedly high concentration of additives, particularly the flavouring agent MSG. New research suggests MSG does not make you sick, and while older Chinese restaurants probably used shortcuts to flavour, they were hardly unique in using additives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, a growing diaspora is making it possible for Chinese restaurants to stay true to their roots, knowing they have customers demanding \"proper Chinese food\".

Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">type 2 diabetes</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

(A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango.

Pair them with protein or fibre, and avoid combining with other carbs or sugary forms, such as juices and milkshakes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beyond its metabolic impact, the mango occupies a far larger place in Indian life - a fruit that opens doors both literally and figuratively, carrying cultural, social and even diplomatic significance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mango diplomacy\" is a familiar phrase across the subcontinent, where carefully chosen crates of the fruit can grease political deals, strengthen alliances or smooth over tense negotiations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images  Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen (L) hands a basket of Indian mangoes to US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns at a ceremony celebrating the opening of mango trade between the United States and India at the Commerce Department in Washington 01 May 2007. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Former Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen presents a basket of Indian mangoes to the then US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns during a 2007 ceremony</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mango festivals pop up across Indian cities, celebrating the fruit's cultural and economic significance. The fruit is, at once, a favourite indulgence and a quietly powerful social currency. \"Most Indians have a personal favourite mango and parochial regional loyalties have long fuelled heated ranking debates,\" says Pushpesh Pant, a Delhi-based historian and culinary expert.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Good mangoes are not just to be eaten; they are adornments like jewellery. The rules of the mango push the best produce towards those willing to pay the highest price,\" writes Sopan Joshi in Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, a magisterial account of the fruit and its admirers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are more than 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India. Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering. Poet Ghalib called the mango a \"a sealed glass of honey\", and hundreds of books have been written celebrating its allure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Part indulgence, part icon, the mango continues to delight and inspire - now with a surprising nod from science.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was a rare example of a failed summit coming as a relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the absence of any real developments, attention in Ukraine turned to the presentational aspects of the summit – the \"optics\", in political speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin, the man responsible for the devastating war of aggression against Ukraine, had received the warmest welcome possible in Alaska. American soldiers knelt to literally roll out the red carpet for him. Trump applauded him as he approached and offered a friendly handshake. The two leaders rode together alone in Trump's presidential limousine and Putin could be seen laughing as the car pulled away.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the Russian president, who has been shunned internationally since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the greeting marked the beginning of a remarkable return to the global diplomatic stage and set a tone that would continue throughout the day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Ukraine, it was not a welcome sight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Red carpets and this level of ceremony are normal at international events, but in this case – for an aggressor responsible for the deaths of millions – it should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova, 40, a lawyer in the capital Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Drachova, who woke up and watched the footage over breakfast, said it appeared as though \"the entire event was staged to please Putin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The rational world is behaving irrationally by giving him this welcome,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"It should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova of the warm welcome for Putin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin's plane had been escorted into the airbase in Alaska by four American fighter jets and as he strolled down the red carpet, talking jovially with Trump, an American B-2 bomber flew overhead flanked by four more jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainians who had stayed up late to watch the spectacle were seeing the \"legitimisation of a war criminal at the highest level\", said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian writer and political analyst.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There was no need for this pomp at all,\" Kovalenko said. \"This is a meeting that should have been conducted in a much more restrained way – minimalistic, without this level of respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the greetings, Trump and Putin sat down in front of a gaggle of reporters at Elmendorf Air Force Base, under a banner that read \"Pursuing Peace\". A question was shouted at Putin: \"Will you you stop killing civilians?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Russian leader appeared to smirk, and gestured to his ear to suggest he couldn't hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Along with the smiles, laughter, and general good will on show, the gesture struck a very sour note in Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands have been killed and wounded in Russia's war of aggression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When I saw what happened I felt crushed,\" said Serhii Orlyk, 50, from the eastern province of Donetsk, which has been largely seized by Russian forces and seen some of the most intense fighting of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I lost my home twice, in Sloviansk and in Donetsk.

On Friday, it expected to scrap 500 flights, affecting 100,000 passengers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With the strike in effect, the airline announced it would halt flights on its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the cancellations mounted, the Canadian government used its powers to force the airline and the union into binding arbitration, in an effort to minimise disruptions for travel and the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here's what you need to know about the strike.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why is Air Canada cancelling flights?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline, which operates in 64 countries and has a fleet of 259 aircraft, warned that a \"complete cessation of flying\" would begin on Saturday, if the labour issues were not resolved. Air Canada Express flights, which carry about 20% of Air Canada's daily customers, are not affected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Still, a shutdown could affect 130,000 daily customers, including 25,000 Canadians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Upon receiving the strike notice, Air Canada issued its own 72-hour lock-out notice and began winding down operations, delaying and cancelling flights over those three days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chief Operations Officer Mark Nasr explained the airline's system was complex and not something \"we can start or stop at the push of a button\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: Moment Air Canada ends news conference after union activists disrupt event</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What led to the strike?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Canadian Union of Public Employees (Cupe), representing 10,000 Air Canada attendants, has asserted that it bargained in good faith with the airline for more than eight months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline said it recently offered flight attendants a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, with a 25% raise in the first year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the union said the offer was \"below inflation, below market value, below minimum wage\" and would leave flight attendants unpaid for some hours of work, including waiting at airports ahead of flights or during the boarding process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They said wages had not kept up with inflation, so Air Canada's suggested pay increase was \"in effect, a pay cut\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Almost all of the attendants - 99.7% - voted to strike earlier this month. The company asked the government to intervene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Government representatives had facilitated some of the negotiations already, but the carrier went further and asked Canada's jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, to refer the matter for binding arbitration.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How has the government responded?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday,  Hajdu ordered Air Canada and Cupe into binding arbitration by invoking Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Despite significant supports from the government, these parties have been unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner,\" Hadju said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I am exercising this authority because it is critical to maintaining and securing industrial peace, protecting Canadians and promoting conditions to resolve the dispute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cupe has responded by accusing the of Liberal Party of \"violating our charter rights\". They allege that forcing a bargain to end the strike will \"ensure unresolved issues will continue to worsen by kicking them down the road\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, Air Canada proposed having a third party step in to develop an agreement through what is called \"binding arbitration\", but the union rejected this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It then asked the government to force the parties into binding arbitration, pointing to recent government interventions in negotiations in the rail and port sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In binding arbitration, an independent third party sets the terms of a contract in an agreement that is legally enforceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The union said in a statement on Friday that it had requested that Hajdu not intervene and, instead, allow \"the parties to reach a resolution through free and fair negotiations, without undue interference\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There was growing pressure from other parts of Canada, as well. The Board of Trade for the Toronto region had called<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>for government intervention, while the province of  Newfoundland and Labrador released a statement describing the impact of a strike as \"catastrophic\" for the tourism industry during the summer season.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How long will the strike last?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That's unclear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Air Canada pilots went on strike in September 1998 for 13 days, all of the carrier's more than 600 daily flights were grounded, stranding passengers and costing the airline C$133m ($96m; £71m) before a deal was reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent years, the federal government has stepped in during labour disputes involving Air Canada workers by blocking strikes and imposing agreements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hadju's intervention may alter the timeline for the two parties reaching an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The union said imposing arbitration would stop the first strike by the carrier's flight attendants since 1985.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What to do if your flight is cancelled</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Air Canada has said it will notify passengers if there is a change to the flight's scheduled departure time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of Saturday, Air Canada was \"strongly advising\" passengers not to go to the airport unless they had tickets with other airlines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Customers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and will receive a full refund, the airline said. The company has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide customers alternative travel options.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If it's a round trip, return flights are not automatically cancelled in case the passengers reaches the destination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those bookings can be cancelled with no fees.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Russia now controls rather less territory - down from about 27% in the spring of 2022 to around 20% now. In the east, Russian forces are advancing, but very slowly and at great cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now. European allies also insist on a halt in fighting. US President Donald Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin,  Trump has talked instead about territorial swaps. That has sent shockwaves across Kyiv and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows:</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Kyiv, such a concession would be a bitter pill to swallow. For Moscow, whose losses have been even more catastrophic, it would be seen as victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine \"could not\" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pushing hard, and making progress, near the town of Dobropillya. But it's not yet clear whether this marks a significant strategic move or just an effort to show Trump that Moscow has the upper hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What about Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, captured in 2022? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here, it's reported, Russia is offering to halt its offensive and freeze the lines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But would Russia be prepared to give any of it back? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Trump talked vaguely about \"ocean-front property\" – presumably a reference to some of this shoreline, along the Sea of Azov or Black Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is all part of Putin's strategically vital land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's hard to see the Russian leader agreeing to give any of it up. Like Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin regards these places as part of Russia, and illegally annexed them three years ago in four referendums widely regarded as a sham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine, and Europe, territorial swaps – at this very early stage of the talks – are a non-starter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A discussion about future borders may eventually come, but only when the war has stopped and Ukraine's security has been guaranteed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There were friends that were like, 'He's actually an amazing guy, he's so great'. There was a lot of people whispering in my ear about you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said it was exactly the moment she had \"been writing songs about, wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was wild, but it worked...
