Peace is possible. We need an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian officials welcomed Macron's decision, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move \"rewards terror\" following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack in Israel. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US \"strongly rejects\" Macron's announcement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, calling the decision \"reckless\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The G7 is a group of major industrialised nations, which alongside France includes the US, the UK, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his Thursday post on X, Macron wrote: \"True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We must also guarantee the demilitarisation of Hamas, and secure and rebuild Gaza. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Finally, we must build the State of Palestine, ensure its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the Middle East. There is no alternative.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Macron also attached a letter to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas confirming his decision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to Macron's announcement, Abbas' deputy Hussein al-Sheikh said, \"This position reflects France's commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people's rights to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state\", according to the AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Netanyahu wrote in a post on X: \"We strongly condemn President Macron's decision to recognise a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the 7 October massacre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel -  not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" Netanyahu added.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas said France's decision was a \"positive step in the right direction\" and urged all countries of the world \"to follow France's lead\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently, the State of Palestine is recognised by more than 140 of the 193 member states of the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few European Union countries, including Spain and Ireland, are among them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Israel's main supporter, the US, and its allies including the UK have not recognised a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62d2gj75dro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">In a statement on Thursday</a>, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he will hold an \"emergency call\" with French and German leaders on Friday to discuss \"what we can do urgently to stop the killing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Statehood is an \"inalienable right of the Palestinian people\", Starmer said, adding that a ceasefire would \"put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry praised France's decision, saying it \"reaffirms the international community's consensus on the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 59,106 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble since then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier on Thursday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyxy5k70rzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that one in five children in Gaza City was now malnourished</a> and cases were increasing every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation in the Gaza Strip - pressing for governments to take action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into the Palestinian territory, has repeatedly said that there is no siege, blaming Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.</p></div></div></body></html>"

\"Hulk\" nickname came from comparisons to the comic-book hero portrayed on TV at the time, while \"Hogan\" was the invention of promoter Vince McMahon, who was keen for Irish representation in the WWF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He first competed in the WWF in 1979, but became a mainstay and fan favourite in the mid-1980s alongside Andre the Giant and 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper.</p><p

character was an all-American hero, and his magnetic personality helped attract millions of viewers and turn wrestling into a revenue juggernaut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His brand of \"Hulkamania\" transferred to the small and big screens, with roles in films such as Rocky III, No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny, Santa With Muscles, and a 1996 episode of Baywatch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rocky actor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMf2FJasNZG/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Sylvester Stallone said on Instagram</a> that Hogan was

and Muppets From Space, and lent his voice to episodes of Robot Chicken and American Dad!</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 1985, Hogan became the star of his own cartoon series on CBS, Hulk

There have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, too – in 2008 and 2011, clashes on a similar scale saw 40 people killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, these were de-escalated relatively quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even as recently as this May, after an incident in which a Cambodian soldier was killed, both sides looked keen to prevent more violence, with meetings between army commanders from each country aimed at easing the tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on Thursday, it erupted. Thai authorities said at least 14 people, all civilians apart from one, had been killed so far, as fighting continued on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it suffered any casualties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So why has this particular border skirmish – which kicked off after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Wednesday – spread into something so much larger?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply last month, when Cambodia's senior leader Hun Sen deeply embarrassed Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by leaking a phone conversation between them about the disputed border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the conversation, Paetongtarn called him \"uncle\", and criticised one of her own military commanders, sparking public anger. She has since been suspended as prime minister and Thailand's Constitutional Court is considering a petition for her dismissal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not clear why Hun Sen chose to do this, burning a close personal relationship between their two families that goes back decades.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d97d/live/1b620d70-68dc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"EPA Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is surrounded by journalists after a cabinet meeting at Government House in Bangkok, Thailand, 01 July 2025.

She appeared to believe that she could resolve their differences by appealing to his friendship with her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past that friendship was used by Thaksin's opponents to charge him with putting Cambodia's interests above those of Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2014, when a government headed by Thaksin's sister Yingluck was deposed by a military coup, Hun Sen allowed scores of his supporters to seek sanctuary in Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries have also cooperated in more shadowy areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last November, Thailand sent six Cambodian dissidents, together with a young child, back to Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed. All were recognised by the United Nations as refugees.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2020, a young Thai activist who had fled to Cambodia, Wanchalerm Satsaksit, was abducted and disappeared, it is presumed by Thai operatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And the January gunning down of a Cambodian opposition leader in broad daylight in central Bangkok was also seen by activists as an outcome of this understanding between the two countries' security services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Against this background, the leaking of Paetongtarn's conversation appears to have caught the Shinawatra family completely off-guard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The responses from both Thaksin and Paetongtarn reveal a sense of betrayal. This has led to an increasingly bitter war of words between the two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it is more than just words.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thai police have also begun investigating powerful Cambodian business figures alleged to be linked to underworld gambling and scam centres, while trade worth billions of dollars a year has stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the border itself, there is a heightened risk of more serious clashes between the two armies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But rather than back off, Cambodia's Hun Sen seems to have jumped at the opportunity to ramp up rhetoric against Thailand and the Shinawatra family in particular. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He claims to be in possession of secret documents that would incriminate Thaksin – documents he claims could even prove that he insulted the monarchy, an offence which comes with a hefty prison sentence in Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Thai government responded by expelling the Cambodian ambassador on Wednesday and recalling its own envoy, setting the stage for the latest confrontation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2e01/live/99c46c80-6873-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Hun Sen (l) holds the arm of Thaksin Shinawatra (R) as they sit on a grey sofa with beige and grey cushions.

In both countries, there is a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to compromise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Prime Minister Hun Manet, Cambodia has the inexperienced son of a former strongman who does not yet have his own authority, while in his father Hun Sen it also has a man who appears willing to push this conflict further in order to burnish his own nationalist credentials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the Thai side, the shaky coalition government centred on Thaksin's party is dealing with a stagnant economy and reeling from the threat of punitive US tariffs. It cannot afford to show weakness in standing up to Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia too is dealing with a struggling economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It never fully recovered from the pandemic and tourism - a pillar of its economy - has suffered from the absence of Chinese visitors staying away for fear of being kidnapped and forced to work in scam centres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And - as with Thailand - now there is the threat of punishing US tariffs impacting the economy further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both countries do have experienced politicians in Hun Sen and Thaksin who almost certainly can, when they are both ready, find a way out of this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We will also have to see whether other members of Asean weigh in on this conflict and try to persuade both countries to de-escalate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That was originally Asean's primary purpose - to avoid conflict among its members - and it will be a priority for some of the Asean states at the moment to help these two countries resolve the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What remains a mystery at this point though is why Hun Sen decided to burn this friendship and inflame this conflict. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps it was Thailand's decision to put pressure on scam centres this year, or Thaksin's ambition to legalize gambling, threatening Cambodia's own lucrative casino industry. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Or perhaps it was something simpler: a Machiavellian move by one of Asia's wiliest political survivors, to abandon an ally in Thaksin who has lost much of his influence in Thailand, while at the same time burnishing his nationalist credentials in the eyes of his own people.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In 1978 and again in 1982 Israel invaded south Lebanon to combat Palestinian fighters based there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Abdallah's group decided to hit Israeli and US targets in Europe, and carried out five attacks in France. In 1982 its members shot and killed US diplomat Charles Ray in Strasbourg, and Israeli diplomat Yakov Barsimantov in Paris. In addition a car bomb blamed on LARF killed two French bomb-disposal experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Abdallah was arrested in Lyon in 1984. Tailed by French intelligence officers, he thought he was being followed by Israeli assassins and gave himself in at a police station. Initially he was charged only with having false passports and criminal association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A short time later a French citizen was kidnapped in northern Lebanon, and the French secret service entered a negotiation via Algeria to engineer an exchange.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The French citizen was freed, but just before Abdallah was to be released police in Paris found a cache of weapons at his flat, including the gun used to kill the diplomats. This made his liberation impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two years later in the run up to his trial, Paris was hit by a spate of terrorist attacks which killed 13 people. These were blamed by politicians and the media on allies of Abdallah trying to pressurise France into freeing him. Later it was established that in fact they were the work of the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, under instructions from Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the trial, Abdallah denied involvement in the murders but defended their legitimacy. He was given a life sentence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/03d1/live/9d9de2e0-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Georges Abdallah sits in handcuffs on a court bench between two police officers.

But in 2013 then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote to the French government expressing the hope that it could find a \"way to contest the legality\" of a court decision to free Abdallah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her message was later made public by WikiLeaks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Interior Minister Manuel Valls then refused to sign the expulsion order on which Abdallah's liberation was contingent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This year the appeal court decided that the length of Abdallah's detention was \"disproportionate\", and that he no longer posed a threat. It said again that his release must immediately be followed by expulsion from France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is a victory for justice, but it is also a political scandal that he was not released before, thanks to the behaviour of the United States and successive French presidents,\" said his lawyer Jean-Louis Chalanset.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among the people who campaigned for his release was the 2022 Nobel literature prize winner Annie Ernaux, who said he was a \"victim of state justice of which France should be ashamed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yves Bonnet, the intelligence chief who tried to negotiate Abdallah's exchange in 1985 and is now a member of the far-right National Rally, said he was \"treated worse than a serial killer\" and that \"the United States was obsessed with keeping him in jail\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to a report in Le Monde newspaper, no Palestinian prisoner – even those condemned to life imprisonment in Israel – has served more than 40 years in jail.

Two months ago, he signed up with a campaign group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has never done these things before. \"Previous social movements were important, but to be honest they didn't make me this angry,\" the 39-year-old photographer told the BBC. \"We are citizens... and we need to make sure our society sticks to its democratic systems and spirit.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, that anger is reaching a turning point. On Saturday Taiwan will hold a vote to decide whether to kick out more than two dozen lawmakers accused of being too close to China, in what has been called \"dabamian\", or the Great Recall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The unprecedented vote may alter the balance of political power in Taiwan. But already it has deepened political divisions, with both sides of the debate claiming to be the saviour of Taiwan's sacred democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It began with last January's elections, when voters chose the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) William Lai as their president, but gave the opposition the dominant presence in the parliamentary Legislative Yuan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the following months, the main opposition party Kuomintang worked together with the smaller Taiwan People's Party and independents to block DPP bills and pass controversial pieces of legislation. This included limiting the constitutional court's powers, cutting the government's budget, and raising the threshold for holding recall votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These moves provoked significant outrage among some Taiwanese, who saw them as stymying the DPP government while strengthening the opposition's parliamentary power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2024, thousands began holding protests in what became known as the Bluebird movement, named partially after the Taipei street where many had gathered.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A wide shot of thousands of protesters sitting on a boulevard in Taipei at night, holding up protest signs.

All these seats are held by the Kuomintang - and if enough are successfully recalled, it could mean the DPP eventually gains the majority in the legislature.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Taiwan has held recall votes before, it has never seen so many within such a short space of time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday, citizens in 24 districts will vote on a simple yes or no question: whether they agree to boot out their legislator. Another round of voting will be held in August for the remaining recall cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In each district, if the number of votes exceeds 25% of registered voters and more than half approve the recall, the seat will be vacated and a by-election must be held within three months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This means that voter turnout is crucial for the Great Recall's success - and it is the reason why civic groups have been relentlessly flooding social media and pounding the streets canvassing for votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On a recent weekday night, Deng Pu and several members of his civic group stood outside a Taipei subway station. Some held up banners and chanted slogans, while others distributed paper fans and tissue packets emblazoned with the words  \"Let's go out together to vote\" and \"Say yes to the recall\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Deng acknowledged that with several of the recall votes taking place in Kuomintang strongholds, even if they did succeed, the party could be re-elected in  by-elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even so, the Great Recall would still be worth it, he insisted, as it was a way to \"correct our democracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the result may be, it would \"send a strong signal to all the political parties you must respect the latest wishes of Taiwan's citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Deng acknowledged that many in the Bluebird movement were DPP supporters, but denied that the civic groups were funded by the party – a theory heavily pushed by the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't care whether DPP wins the by-elections. What's more urgent to us is that we hope to have a normal parliament, one that is not close to China and the Chinese Communist Party.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also took issue with what he saw as a weak response from the DPP, saying: \"From the first recall petition till now, the civic groups have been telling the DPP that the citizens are here and there are many of us... We are strongly calling on the DPP to join us.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC / Tessa Wong A man with salt and pepper hair wearing wire-rimmed glasses and a face mask poses for the camera.

But eventually it showed its support, with Lai stressing that the DPP \"must align with the power of the people\" and ordering party officials to assist pro-recall groups to \"protect the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has inevitably fueled the opposition's accusation that the DPP has secretly engineered the Great Recall and Bluebird movement, pointing to the fact that the DPP could reap the most political gain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It not only stands a chance of winning a permanent majority in the legislature. Even if the Kuomintang eventually wins in the by-elections, the DPP would have held the majority for a few weeks, giving it enough time to push through crucial laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Anti-recall protests organised by the Kuomintang and other opposition parties have drawn thousands. At one such rally in the New Taipei district of Banqiao last weekend, supporters showed up waving banners and chanting \"No to the vote\" while crossing their arms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As they took to the stage, speaker after speaker condemned the Great Recall while characterising William Lai as a fascist and authoritarian traitor of Taiwan's democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Large screens played videos of Lai doctored to make him look like Adolf Hitler with the words \"Fuhrer Lai\", as well as the slogan \"Green Terror\" – a reference to the DPP's party colour and the White Terror, a period of authoritarian rule and political repression under the Kuomintang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rhetoric echoed that of Beijing, which has waded into the debate while watching from afar. Its Taiwan Affairs Office has accused Lai of \"engaging in dictatorship under the guise of democracy\" and \"using every means possible to suppress the opposition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The recall lawmakers were chosen by the majority of voters in their districts. If they are not good enough, they can be voted out in the next election,\" said rally attendee Mu Zili. \"Why should we be using this evil way of getting rid of them?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 68-year-old night shift worker insisted that the lawmakers were being targeted simply because they belonged to the Kuomintang, and that the Bluebird activists were working for the DPP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can't have one party take down the other one in one big recall, this is not democratic,\" Ms Mu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I side with blue,\" she added, referring to the Kuomintang's party colour. \"But I don't oppose green. I'm here not because I support the Kuomintang, but to protect democracy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are also many Taiwanese who are on the fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Watching the anti-recall rally from the sidelines was Banqiao resident Peggy Lin. Like several other bystanders the BBC spoke to, she was bewildered by the fuss over the Great Recall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I don't know what it's about really, I haven't followed the debate at all… so I don't have an opinion,\" said the 43-year-old childcare worker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I will vote after I read more into it and decide based on how I feel on that day about it.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC / Tessa Wong Crowds of people seated at a daytime anti-recall rally in New Taipei hold up large red inflatable sticks, crossing them to indicate their opposition to the Great Recall.

Legislators have brawled in parliament over the political deadlock, while activists have faced doxxing and abuse. Mr Deng told the BBC that while out canvassing, he and his team mates had been assaulted or pushed around by residents opposing the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vote has also not gone without scandal: officials have discovered numerous forged signatures, many of deceased voters, in recall petitions against both DPP and Kuomintang lawmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vote \"will cement the notion of four year terms as not a given but as conditional on performance and subject to periodic reviews. Political polarisation will likely get worse before it gets better,\" said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University's Taiwan Studies programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the Great Recall is also \"creating space for renewed political activism\", especially for DPP supporters, added Dr Sung, which he characterised as an overall boon to the resiliency of Taiwan's civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar with Carnegie China, said if many of the recall votes succeed, \"one signal it would send to politicians in Taiwan is that they should be careful with how far they push the line in public sentiment… they can't stray too far as there would be consequences\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But if it fizzles out, then it emboldens politicians to do what they want,\" he noted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will intensify the polarisation… and it would be easy for politicians to write off the Great Recall as yet another civil society movement that doesn't get enough momentum beyond a certain part of the population.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If there was a close but not conclusive result overall, however, it may mean \"the Kuomintang and DPP will have to ultimately seek compromise and work together\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This, added Dr Chong, \"may not be a bad thing for Taiwan\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, he says, \"Climate change has had an impact: without it, temperatures over the last two weeks would have been lower\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Jeff Weller, University of the Arctic Research Chair at the University of Oulu, agrees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Heatwaves and extreme weather events in summer and winter alike have become so frequent that they can only have been caused by fundamental changes to the climate system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All over the world, every day, climate change is manifested in extreme heat and extreme precipitation events,\" says Prof Weller. \"The fingerprint of climate change is upon us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Heatwaves are becoming more common due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Extreme hot weather will happen more often – and become even more intense – as the planet continues to warm, it has said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The extreme heat is also affecting Lapland's famed reindeer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Celebrated worldwide as Santa's sleigh-pullers at Christmas, reindeer here roam freely across forests and fells. But as they're hounded by mosquitoes – which thrive in hot weather – reindeer are now fleeing to roads and villages in search of relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For reindeer the only option would be to go to higher, windier elevations but in Finnish Lapland the highest elevation is only about 1,000m (3,300 ft),\" says Prof Weller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that because more extreme and longer heatwaves will occur more frequently in the Arctic in the future, \"reindeer herders might end up having to build big barns to provide shade for their animals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's not just Santa and his reindeer who are struggling. Lapland is traditionally known as a cool tourist destination – but this year, visitors are puzzled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's super-hot here – 30C is killing me. I came to escape the heat,\" says Silvia, a tourist from Prague visiting Santa's holiday village in Rovaniemi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I expected much colder weather and packed the wrong clothes.
