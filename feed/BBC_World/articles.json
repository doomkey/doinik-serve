A European Commission official stressed that was not the case and it would be a matter for the 27 member states at the summit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Slovakia's Robert Fico has also opposed using the Russian assets, if it means the money being used to procure weapons rather than for reconstruction needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the pivotal vote does finally take place, it will require a majority of about two-thirds of member states to go through. Whatever happens, European Council President António Costa has promised not to go over the heads of the Belgians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not going to vote against Belgium,\" he told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. \"We'll continue to work very intensively with the Belgian government because we don't want to approve something that might not be acceptable for Belgium.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belgium will also be aware that ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on a negative watch, partly because of \"low\" legal risks to its balance sheet from the European Commission's plans to use the Russian assets.

In recent years, he built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announcing his decision in a social media post on Wednesday, he said: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you.

After taking office he pushed to make the investigation, which Attorney General Bondi said had \"languished\", a priority for the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, a man with no known ties to the government was arrested, nearly six years after the pipe bombs were discovered outside the national headquarters for the Republican and Democratic parties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">FBI Director Patel, in a social media post on Wednesday praising Bongino's tenure, said he had \"served as the people's voice for transparency, and delivered major breakthroughs in long unsolved cases like the pipe bomb investigation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"> \"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino also appeared to change his mind about the death of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once he became a leader at the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a commentator, he had questioned whether Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Then, in May, Bongino<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>said: \"I have seen the whole file.

Like major studios, cable networks have faced issues as the public has opted for streaming services instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube winning rights to the Academy Awards further suggests that reliance on streaming sites will continue.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote that Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the recent US actions, Venezuela - home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed about 100 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another ship accused of drug trafficking was destroyed by the US military on Wednesday. US officials say four men were killed in the strike, which took place in the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Russia had already annexed Crimea in 2014. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It now occupies most of Luhansk, and is understood to demand Ukraine's withdrawal from all of Donetsk, too, even though Ukraine still controls up to 23% of the eastern region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said the goals of what he calls \"the special military operation\" would be achieved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he preferred to do it through diplomacy, before warning that, \"if the opposing side and their foreign patrons refuse to engage in substantive discussions, Russia will achieve the liberation of its historical lands by military means\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his interview with the BBC Radio 4's PM programme, the Nato secretary general said it was \"insane\" that Putin's pursuit of his \"historical idea that you want to regain access to Ukraine\" - or over the entire territory that used to constitute the former Soviet Union - had caused the death or serious injury to 1.1m of his people.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Rutte praised Trump's efforts to find an end to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US envoys have been conducting intense negotiations with Ukrainian officials over a Trump-proposed peace plan whose initial draft was seen as favouring Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It envisages ceding control of territory in the east of the country to Russia, as well as security guarantees for Kyiv to forestall future Russian aggression.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials say Washington is ready to offer Ukraine guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nato chief told the BBC that \"Russia will see that, with the security guarantees in place, he should never ever try again to attack Ukraine because our reaction will be devastating and that's exactly what we are now discussing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies who met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday in the German capital, Berlin, said a European-led force was also envisaged to \"assist in the regeneration of Ukraine's forces, in securing Ukraine's skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has opposed any such ideas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also warned that Russia does not seek conflict with Europe, but is ready \"right now\" if Europe wants to - or starts a war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar reassurances were given by Moscow in 2022, just before 200,000 Russian troops crossed the border and invaded Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The war is nearing its fourth anniversary and Kyiv's European allies have been discussing increasing economic pressure on Moscow to stop the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For months, EU leaders have grappled with the idea of using Russian assets frozen days after the start of the invasion to finance Ukraine's military and economic needs.

At the time, she had one cub, which scientists tagged for study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the fall, she was seen again, but this time with two cubs - the original cub that had been tagged and another without a tag. Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said. </p></div></div></body></html>"

It would get a huge library of films and TV shows, including Harry Potter, the MonsterVerse, Friends and the HBO Max streaming service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mike Proulx from research firm Forrester said the battle for control of Warner Bros will take months more to be resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's unfolding now feels like a real-life, far more consequential episode of HBO's Succession,\" he said. \"And if you think you know how this plot ends, think again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the film industry have criticised the plan to merge all or part of Warner Bros with a rival. The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, arguing that it would result in lower wages and job cuts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The volume of content for viewers would also be reduced, it said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Nothing, zero, nothing\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the other figures that Wiles commented on was JD Vance, a one-time critic of Trump who has since become a close ally and vice-president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles suggested that Vance's shift in perceptions was \"sort of political\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Vance said he had not read the article, but that he only believes in conspiracy theories that are \"true\" - citing reports of former President Joe Biden's ill-health as an example. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her strongest comments were reserved for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge - before leaving the government in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly thereafter, Musk and Trump had a public spat that saw the two men trade barbs and insults over social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles described Musk as an \"avowed Ketamine [user]\" who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB\", the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" she said. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking back on Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Wiles said that she was against the gutting of the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, saying she was \"initially aghast\" at the idea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she recalled. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"With that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning - hours after the Vanity Fair article was published - Wiles took to X, accusing the magazine of a \"disingenuously framed hit piece\" aimed at her, Trump and other cabinet members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When contacted for comment on the story, the White House also defended Wiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to the BBC, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt added. \"The entire administration is grateful to her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing later in the day, Leavitt accused Vanity Fair of \"bias of omission\" by excluding other interviews conducted with White House staff and taking Wiles' words \"wildly out of context\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk has yet to comment on the Vanity Fair piece. </p></div></div></body></html>"

But the start-up is now producing 200 drones a day. Its FP1 and FP2 drones, each the size of a small aeroplane, have carried out 60% of Ukraine's long-range strikes. Each drone costs around $50,000 – three times cheaper than a Russian Shahed drone. Russia is still producing nearly 3,000 of those a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine still needs outside help, not least with intelligence, targeting and money.

That was soon stopped under President Trump – instead he has set up a scheme to allow European Nato to purchase US weapons. The US is no longer Ukraine's biggest military backer, and Europe has struggled to fill the gap left by America or to match its previous support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Concerns about future US support spills over into talk of future US security guarantees – a key issue of the current peace talks.

From 2003 to August 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-avian-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region-15-october-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reported</a> 990 human H5N1 cases across 25 countries, including 475 deaths - a 48% fatality rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US alone, the virus has struck more than 180 million birds, spread to over 1,000 dairy herds in 18 states, and infected at least 70 people - mostly farmworkers - causing several hospitalisations and one death. In January, three tigers and a leopard died at a wildlife rescue centre in India's Nagpur city from the virus that typically infects birds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Symptoms in humans mimic a severe flu: high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and, at times, conjunctivitis. Some people have no symptoms at all. The risk to humans remains low, but authorities are watching H5N1 closely for any shift that could make it spread more easily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That concern is what prompted new peer-reviewed modelling by Indian researchers Philip Cherian and Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which simulates how an H5N1 outbreak might unfold in humans and what early interventions could stop it before it spreads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words, the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> model </a>published in the BMC Public Health journal uses real world data and computer simulations to play out how an outbreak might spread in real life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The threat of an H5N1 pandemic in humans is a genuine one, but we can hope to forestall it through better surveillance and a more nimble public-health response,\" Prof Menon told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A bird flu pandemic, researchers say, would begin quietly: a single infected bird passing the virus to a human - most likely a farmer, market worker or someone handling poultry. From there, the danger lies not in that first infection but in what happens next: sustained human-to-human transmission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because real outbreaks start with limited, messy data, the researchers turned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BharatSim</a>, an open-source simulation platform originally built for Covid 19 modelling, but versatile enough to study other diseases.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images A worker at National Zoological Park sprays pesticides at the entrance gate to sanitize the premises as bird flu spread in the zoo area on 1 September, 2025 in New Delhi, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A bird flu outbreak in a Delhi zoo shut down the facility for a few days in August</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The key takeaway for policymakers is how narrow the window for action can be before an outbreak spirals out of control, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paper estimates that once cases rise beyond roughly two to 10, the disease is likely to spread beyond primary and secondary contacts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Primary contacts are people who have had direct, close contact with an infected person, such as household members, caregivers or close colleagues. Secondary contacts are those who have not met the infected person but have been in close contact with a primary contact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If households of primary contacts are quarantined when just two cases are detected, the outbreak can almost certainly be contained, the research found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time 10 cases are identified, it is overwhelmingly likely that the infection has already spread into the wider population, making its trajectory virtually indistinguishable from a scenario with no early intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To keep the study grounded in real-world conditions, the researchers chose a model of a single village in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu - the heart of India's poultry belt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Namakkal is home to more than 1,600 poultry farms and some 70 million chickens; it produces over 60 million eggs a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A village of 9,667 residents was generated using a synthetic community - households, workplaces, market spaces - and seeded with infected birds to mimic real-life exposure. (A synthetic community is an artificial, computer-generated population that mimics the characteristics and behaviours of a real population.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the simulation, the virus starts at one workplace -  a mid-sized farm or wet market - spreads first to people there (primary contacts), and then moves outward to others (seconday contacts) they interact with through homes, schools and other workplaces.  Homes, schools and workplaces formed a fixed network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By tracking primary and secondary infections, the researchers estimated key transmission metrics, including the basic reproductive number, R0 - which measures how many people, on average, one infected person passes the virus on to. In the absence of a real-world pandemic, the researchers instead modelled a range of plausible transmission speeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then they tested what happens when different interventions - culling birds, quarantining close contacts and targeted vaccination - kicked in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were blunt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Culling of birds works - but only if done before the virus infects a human. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If a spillover does occur, timing becomes everything, the researchers found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Isolating infected people and quarantining households can stop the virus at the secondary stage. But once tertiary infections appear - friends of friends, or contacts of contacts - the outbreak slips out of control unless authorities impose much tougher measures, including lockdowns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Targeted vaccination helps by raising the threshold at which the virus can sustain itself, though it does little to change the immediate risk within households.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Chicks at a poultry farm in Kachhawa village, near Karnal, Haryana, India.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">India's poultry industry is one of the world's largest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The simulations also highlighted an awkward trade-off. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quarantine, introduced too early, keeps families together for long stretches - and increases the chance that infected individuals will pass the virus to those they live with. Introduced too late, it does little to slow the outbreak at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say this approach comes with caveats. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The model relies on one synthetic village, with fixed household sizes, workplaces and daily movement patterns. It does not include simultaneous outbreaks seeded by migratory birds or by poultry networks. Nor does it account for behavioural shifts - mask-wearing, for instance - once people know birds are dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Atlanta-based Emory University, adds another caveat: this simulation model \"assumes a very efficient transmission of influenza viruses\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Transmission is complex and not every strain will have the same efficiency as another,\" she says, adding that scientists are also now starting to understand that not all people infected with seasonal flu spread the virus equally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says emerging research shows that only a \"subset of flu-positive individuals actually shed infectious influenza virus into the air\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This mirrors the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51447143\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">super-spreader phenomenon</a> seen with Covid-19, though it is far less well characterised for flu - a gap that could strongly influence how the virus spreads through human populations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What happens if H5N1 becomes successful in the human population?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Lakdawala believes that it \"will cause a large disruption likely more similar to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-%28h1n1%29-outbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2009 [swine flu] pandemic</a> rather than Covid-19\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is because we are more prepared for an influenza pandemic. We have known licensed antivirals that are effective against the H5N1 strains as an early defence and stockpiled candidate<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations/zoonotic-influenza-viruses-and-candidate-vaccine-viruses\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> H5 vaccines</a> that could be deployed in the short term.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But complacency would be a mistake. Dr Lakdawala says if H5N1 becomes established in humans, it could re-assort - or intermingle - with existing strains, amplifying its public-health impact. Such mixing could reshape seasonal influenza, triggering \"chaotic and unpredictable seasonal epidemics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indian modellers say the simulations can be run in real time and updated as data come in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With refinements - better reporting delays, asymptomatic cases - they could give public-health officials something priceless in the early hours of an outbreak: a sense of which actions matter most, before the window for containment snaps shut.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US sanctions targeting Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA have made exporting oil difficult for the Venezuelan government, leading them to resort to a fleet of \"ghost ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what do we know about these vessels and how they operate?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Total and complete blockade'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry as far back as 2019, during his first term as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That year, Venezuelan crude exports fell by more than half from roughly 1.1 million barrels per day in January to about 495,000 by the end of 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six years later, the sanctions remain in place but Venezuela's oil exports have grown again to around 920,000 barrels per day as of November, according to the news agency Reuters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While this falls far short of the country's peak level of oil exports of 3 million barrels per day in 1998, this partial recovery indicates that the sanctions against Venezuela are not working as the US hoped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It indicates that the government of Nicolás Maduro has found new ways to sell Venezuelan oil with the \"ghost fleet\" at their centre.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Not unique to Venezuela</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ghost fleets are a growing phenomenon, used not just by Venezuela but also by two other oil-producing countries under Western sanctions - Russia and Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial intelligence firm S&amp;P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of these, 10% carry only Venezuelan oil, 20% carry Iranian oil, while 50% are exclusively dedicated to Russian oil. The remaining 20% are not tied to any particular country and can transport oil from more than one of these nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oil sanctions aim to discourage countries or companies from buying or dealing with crude oil from sanctioned nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies and nations caught buying oil from sanctioned countries like Venezuela risk being sanctioned themselves by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctioned countries offer their oil at steep discounts so that companies or nations are willing to take the risk of buying it whilst applying tricks to disguise its origin.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">False flags and name changes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the most common strategies ghost tankers use is to frequently change their name or flag - sometimes several times in a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the tanker seized this Wednesday is called The Skipper, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ship has been sanctioned by the US Treasury since 2022 for its alleged role in an oil-smuggling network that helps finance Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At that time, the tanker was named Adisa, but it was originally called Toyo. It was one of the vessels linked to Russian oil tycoon Viktor Artemov, who is also under sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper is a 20-year-old vessel - another common trait among ghost fleet tankers. Major shipping companies usually dispose of ships after 15 years of service, and after 25 years they are typically scrapped.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coast</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Zombie ships'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another trick these ships use is to steal the identity of scrapped vessels by using their unique registration numbers assigned by the International Maritime Organization – similar to criminals using the identity of a dead person.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are known as \"zombie ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last April, a ship called Varada arrived in Malaysian waters after a two-month journey from Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raised suspicions because it was a 32-year-old boat and flew the flag of the Comoros, an island nation off east Africa, which is a popular choice among ships that want to avoid detection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a Bloomberg investigation, it was a zombie ship, as the real Varada had been scrapped in Bangladesh in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news agency compared satellite images with historical photos to detect four zombie ships carrying Venezuelan crude oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other common tactics include disguising the origin of crude oil by transferring it in international waters to legally compliant tankers with other flags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These then deliver the oil to its destination, presenting it as coming from a country that is not sanctioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This happened with Venezuelan oil exports to China during Trump's first term when sanctions were tightened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another common trick among these tankers is disabling the Automatic Identification System, which transmits data including the vessel's name, flag, position, speed or route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This allows ships to hide their identity and location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech says it believes The Skipper was \"spoofing its position for a long time\" - that is, transmitting a false signal, making it appear to be in a different location.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Planet Labs PBC / Reuters Two large oil tankers are connected side by side at sea \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Planet Labs PBC / Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A satellite image taken on 18 November off Venezuelan waters shows The Skipper, on the right, alongside another vessel</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a report in October by the anti-corruption NGO Transparencia Venezuela, there were 71 foreign tankers at the ports of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA - of which 15 are under sanctions and nine are linked to ghost fleets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It found that 24 tankers were operating under stealth, with their mandatory location signals deactivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NGO says it detected six ship-to-ship cargo transfers in waters off western Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the ships flew flags of countries considered regulatory havens with lax oversight of sanctions, including Panama, Comoros and Malta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many spent more than 20 days without docking at an oil terminal, unlike the Chevron-operated ships that the US has authorised in Venezuela, which load and leave within six days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The extended stay in port areas without directly reaching oil terminals raises serious doubts about the type of operations these vessels are conducting,\" said Transparencia Venezuela in its report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that the operation to seize the ship on 10 December came from the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier -
