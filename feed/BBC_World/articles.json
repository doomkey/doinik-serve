He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The STC's advances included the oil-rich Hadramawt province that borders Saudi Arabia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said the offensive was necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south.

It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added. Others will face slightly higher rates, up to 13.98%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement of their own, which was given to the BBC's US partner CBS News, a US commerce department spokesperson said: \"[Our] post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Trump tariffs that have recently been softened include a planned increase in the tax charged on imports of furniture items - which was postponed for 12 months shortly before it was due to take effect on New Year's Day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in November, the president signed an order that allowed certain key food products - including coffee, bananas and beef - to escape his tariffs.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, Tesla responded by launching<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9y3dvy491o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> <b id=\"lower-priced-versions-of-its-two-best-selling-models\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">lower-priced versions of its two best selling models</b></a> in the US in a bid to boost sales.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d3547npjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">who is already the world's richest man</a>, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package.

Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though there are <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c783qd14zl7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">big questions</a> surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Musk has since</a> stepped back from his role in the US government.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Shenzhen-based company's<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, BYD said the UK had become its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5jl2jgqwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">biggest market outside China</a>.

After scaring off the predatory cat, they checked the body and could find no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Kara Van Hoose said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was unclear whether one or multiple animals were involved in the attack, she added. Two mountain lions have been euthanised after an extensive search, and investigators are currently studying them for signs of human DNA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hikers had thrown rocks at the mountain lion to drive it away, Ms Van Hoose told a news conference. CPW officers responding to the scene shot the lion, which ran off. They then tracked it to euthanise it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A second lion was found in the area and was also euthanised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If neither lion appears to be the culprit, the search will resume for a possible attacker. Under CPW rules, wildlife that kills a human being must be euthanised for public safety reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The woman's body showed signs of a mountain lion attack, according to Ms Van Hoose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local sheriff's office has notified her next of kin, and will later disclose her identity, Ms Van Hoose told the BBC. She is believed to have been hiking alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Crosier Mountain Trail is north of Denver, near the Wyoming border, and close to Rocky Mountain National Park. It could be considered secluded, Ms Van Hoose said, adding that hikers often lose their phone signals there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Larimer County sheriff, police from the nearby city of Estes Park and volunteer firefighters have been assisting in the search.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A biologist conducting a deer survey by helicopter in the area helped look for the animal and transport personnel, according to CPW. Meanwhile, houndsmen brought dogs in to track scents, which Ms Van Hoose said was an often-effective way to locate mountain lions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mountain lion attacks - both fatal and not - are rare in the state, with CPW recording 28 total since 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mountain lions, also called pumas, cougars, catamounts or panthers, can be found throughout North America, but now are mostly in 15 western states, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are mostly solitary animals, who spend most of their time hunting, the foundation says.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the clinic warns that the risk of bleeding from aspirin also goes up with age. It says the daily dose for aspirin therapy is between 75mg and 325mg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, dropped out of the 2024 election race after a stumbling debate with Trump raised questions about his age and mental sharpness.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also been cracking down on <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g562vz34ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sanctioned oil tankers </a>entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Despite being treated by a local doctor, the child died within three days. Mr Sahu alleges that the tap water killed his son.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Avyan is among several people suspected to have died after drinking contaminated water in Indore's Bhagirathpura neighbourhood. Investigations are still going on but officials say that a pipeline leak led to sewage mixing with drinking water, leading to a diarrhoea outbreak in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exact death toll remains unclear. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said postmortem reports have so far confirmed four deaths linked to contaminated drinking water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the number is likely to increase. While state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya says he has heard about eight deaths so far, local journalists told BBC Hindi that the toll is close to 14. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 200 people have been admitted to hospitals in the city.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past week, around 40,000 residents of Bhagirathpura - a neighbourhood of largely poor and lower-middle income families - were screened by health authorities and around 2,450 cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were identified, said the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deaths in Indore - often ranked India's cleanest city - have sparked an uproar and put the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">District Magistrate Shivam Verma said the leak that caused the contamination has been fixed and officials are checking for others.

Eleven using Kali's illusion powers to make it seem as though she died before making a grand escape. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Netflix Brett Gelman, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Amybeth McNulty, Caleb McLaughlin, Winona Ryder and Linnea Berthelsen in Stranger Things\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Netflix</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he thinks she finally made it the place they talked about running off to – a land with three waterfalls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mike says it's what he likes to believe – and each member of their Dungeons and Dragons party – Will, Dustin, Lucas and Max – all agree that they, too, believe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a fitting end that leaves open the possibility that Eleven, too, has a happy ending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The epilogue takes us 18 months into the future after the Upside Down is demolished and Vecna – and the Mind Flayer – is defeated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We see Hopper and Joyce get engaged and the older crew of teens talk about their lives in university and in their careers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a happy ending for everyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even with such an epic finale, there are certainly holes in the story that weren't fully explained in the last episode. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's sure to be a finale that pleases some fans and has others wanting more.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Guests attend Stranger Things 5: The Finale Fan Screenings at The Park Theatre on December 31, 2025 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Several fans dressed up to attend the finale screenings -

A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC's Steve Rosenberg asks Russians what they are hoping for in 2026</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78v5dj3x39o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">secure full control of the industrial area</a> in any peace agreement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z615y443o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security guarantees for 15 years</a> - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Russian Defence Ministry A Russian defence ministry official sits in front of a large screen which shows a map, marked with the the alleged flight paths of the drones Russia says Ukraine launched at one of Putin's residences.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Russian Defence Ministry</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming -

His pitch to lead the most expensive US city included big changes, such as universal childcare, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the mayor is likely to encounter several challenges in trying to deliver on these promises, and he'll need to keep on board other important political stakeholders - beginning on his first full day in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He'll put all of his political and other might behind getting these things accomplished,\" said Patrick Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University. But, he said, New York City is \"a big place, it's a complicated place, and so, all bets are off about whether these things can happen or not\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">1.

For instance, if he wants to freeze rents for subsidised housing, he can appoint people aligned with this policy on the city's rent control board.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But finding the funding to make other goals a reality when the state and city face budget shortfalls will prove complicated, government experts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to provide free bus service and free child care, these kinds of things cost money,\" said Robert Shapiro, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. \"The big roadblock for the things he'd like to do are the state of the New York, the financial capacity of the state and the political willingness of the governor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has said some funding would come from new taxes. He believes taxes on the wealthy could raise as much as $9bn (£6.6bn), with pledges to raise the corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mamdani needs the support of the state government to make tax changes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The more moderate Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed him in the race last year as well as some of his affordability goals. But Hochul, who is making her own political calculations as she runs for re-election this year, has already indicated she may not support Mamdani's broader tax plan. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">2.

The two men frequently smiled at each other and shared praise, with Trump telling Mamdani he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the two politicians' diametrically opposed policy positions could lead to conflict as Mamdani takes over City Hall. Immigration may be a point of tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, New York has not been a target of Trump's efforts to send in National Guard troops, as he has done in Democratic-led cities across the US in response to anti-immigration protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Trump administration did ramp up immigration raids in New York as part of its enforcement efforts in several cities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor pledged in his victory speech that New York would \"remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and  ... led by an immigrant\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">3.

The now-mayor reached out to his opponents in the business world to hear their concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani pledged to meet with leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who later said he would offer his help if Mamdani was elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani also met with real estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who described him as \"personable\" and \"smart\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Gural and others in the business community continue to express their concerns that the 34-year-old lacks the experience to lead the nation's largest city - and that his plans to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy people will drive some of them to leave New York. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Egan said it remains to be seen whether a \"spirit of cooperation\" will persist between business leaders and Mamdani as he forges ahead with an agenda that is ideologically at odds with some of their goals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any mayor of New York needs cooperation from business leaders, and in particular finance and real estate that play big roles here in New York City,\" he said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">4. Addressing public safety</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani announces a new public safety plan in campaign ad</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As mayor, Mamdani will face a perennial challenge for New York City leaders, tackling crime and maintaining a sense of safety for New Yorkers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many big cities, New York saw an uptick in crime during the Covid pandemic, though in 2025, the rate of homocides and shootings in the city fell to a near-record low. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This decline in crime gives Mamdani \"a bit of wiggle room to think creatively\" about public safety in New York, including improving social services and support, Mr Egan said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has promised to create a Department of Community Safety that would invest in mental health programmes and crisis response as well as deploy outreach workers to subway stations across the city.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' administration also sent outreach workers to subway stations and established other housing and mental health programmes. But some experts and community leaders say those efforts failed to adequately address homelessness and mental health crises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson, a counselor to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said he and others will judge Mamdani first and foremost on how the city is policed, and how shoplifting and quality of life crimes are handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani won over some business leaders and members of the public with his decision to ask Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who served in Adams' administration, to stay on as police chief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Public safety is really kind of the prerequisite for success or failure,\" Mr Wolfson previously told the BBC. \"I think if people feel safe here, they can tolerate an awful lot of other challenges. And if they don't, then there's not a lot of other challenges that they will be willing to tolerate.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It made its manufacturer, the small South Korean label CosRX, go global. It is now owned by Amorepacific, the country's biggest cosmetics company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rapid spread of that sticky serum tells you just how wildly successful K-beauty has become. Fuelled by viral content and trends, it is one of the biggest industries in South Korea, where the pressure to look almost flawless has always been huge in a highly competitive society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The domestic market alone was valued at about $13bn (£9.6bn) in 2024, with sales of some products expected to grow at double-digit rates. And the rest of the world is just as obsessed with K-beauty - which is perhaps unsurprising given it's part of the Hallyu, or Korean Wave, which has made K-Pop and K-dramas a global phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">K-beauty brands now occupy whole sections at global retailers - from Sephora to Boots to Walmart. In the first half of 2025, South Korea overtook France, the birthplace of modern cosmetics, to become the world's second-largest exporter of beauty products, after the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Search for \"Korean skincare\" on TikTok, Instagram or YouTube and you'll be met with a deluge of content from influencers, some of whom have hundreds of millions of followers. They dissect ingredient lists, film unboxings and record \"Get Ready With Me\" videos built around ideas such as \"glass skin\", sheet masks and, of course, snail mucin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are so many products and brands, and a lot of times you're exposed to millions of them as a consumer - it's highly saturated and competitive,\" said Liah Yoo, a beauty influencer and founder of the US-based K-beauty brand Krave Beauty.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The formula behind the rise  </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of K-beauty's rise is a relentless pace of innovation. New formulations appear every few months, often designed to spark the next online obsession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ten-step skincare routines, overnight \"water sleeping masks\" and headline-grabbing ingredients such as salmon sperm were once viewed as niche or unappealing. Today, many are staples in bathroom cabinets from London to Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media has been central to this shift. Products launched in Seoul are on TikTok and Instagram feeds in the US, UK, India and Australia instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are however growing concerns about the social impact of beauty ideals, particularly on young people. Experts warn that constant exposure to skincare content online can fuel anxiety and excessive spending.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Sulwhasoo brand global ambassador, Yoona of girl group Girls' Generation poses for a photocall for the AMORE PACIFIC 'Sulwhasoo' holistic night party on April 14, 2025 in Seoul,\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">K-pop star Yoona promoting one of South Korea's best-known beauty brands     </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are fully aware that excessive use or misuse of social media can lead to backlash,\" said Kim Seung-hwan, Amorepacific's chief executive, adding that brands must strike a careful balance in how they use online platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The challenge will only grow as the industry expands to include Western multinationals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">L'Oréal acquired a South Korean conglomerate which included the brand Dr.G in late 2024, saying the deal would help meet rising demand for effective yet affordable K-beauty products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other global firms are increasingly incorporating popular ingredients associated with Korean brands such as centella asiatica and rice water into their own lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of South Korea's large beauty brands are part of the country's powerful conglomerates, or chaebols. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amorepacific accounts for roughly half of the domestic market. Its portfolio ranges from premium brands such as Sulwhasoo to global mass-market names like Laneige, environmentally focused labels such as Innisfree, and fast-growing independent brands. But even as a chaebol, Amorepacific says it looks to smaller independent brands for fresh ideas.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend Korean beauty event in New York, October 23, 2025.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend a Korean beauty event organised by Amorepacific and Sephora in New York</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Through the founder and the CosRX team, we were able to learn their approach to formula innovation and how to respond more quickly to consumer needs,\" Mr Kim from Amorepacific said. \"These lessons have since been integrated into our wider organisation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Amorepacific sold about $6.2bn of products.

The BBC visited a sprawling Amorepacific factory outside South Korea's capital Seoul, where a handful of workers oversaw fully automated production lines bottling Laneige's Water Sleeping Mask and CosRX's Vitamin C 23 Serum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speed, however, comes at a cost.

as is the bar's safety record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify has been examining videos taken by survivors and onlookers and speaking to fire safety experts to find clues about what went wrong.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bottles with sparklers held in the air</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two striking images shared widely online show people carrying champagne bottles with lit sparklers above their heads, with a crowd around them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One image shows flames starting to gather on the ceiling above people holding five of these bottles aloft.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second image is a closer-up angle, showing a person wearing a crash helmet and holding a bottle with a lit sparkler, sitting on the shoulders of another person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sparks from this bottle appear to be closer to the ceiling.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify determined these images were taken after midnight on 1 January by confirming there were not earlier versions and matched them against public photos of Le Constellation - using details including the bar design and distinctive pipework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there was no evidence the images had been ​​manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other videos we verified from the night of the fire, some people in the bar can be seen filming the flames as loud club music thumps in the background. In one video, some people start to hurry for an exit stairwell while shouting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Béatrice Pilloud, the attorney-general of the Valais region, said everything led investigators to believe the fire had started from sparklers attached to bottles of champagne that were \"moved too close to the ceiling\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Questions about foam padding on ceiling</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another focus is on foam-like padding on the bar's ceiling and whether it was compliant with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two fire safety experts told BBC Verify that the materials visible in photos and videos of Le Constellation appeared to show \"egg box foam\", a type of sound-absorbing material made from polyurethane (PU).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the photo of the bottles being held up, flames are visible on a part of the ceiling with a foam-like covering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">PU foam is often treated with fire-retardant before being installed as a noise dampener in factories and entertainment venues. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But untreated, it can be highly flammable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once ignited, polyurethane acoustic foam can exhibit rapid flame spread across its high-surface-area profile and produce dense, toxic smoke, significantly accelerating fire growth and reducing available escape time,\" said Dr Peter Wilkinson of Loughborough University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Edwin Galea, from the University of Greenwich, said the effectiveness of retardant treatment on PU foam can wear off over time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Swiss authorities say they cannot confirm what type of foam-padding was used in the bar and whether or not it complied with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c8xdxvj2qjdt\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In Friday's press conference</a>, officials talked about a \"flashover\" happening in the bar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Galea explained this is what happens when hot gases rise to the ceiling, reach a critical temperature and then ignite the room near instantaneously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Michael Klippel, a fire safety expert at ETH Zurich University, \"survival after flashover is very unlikely\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authority responsible for overseeing fire safety inspections in Crans-Montana is the Office Cantonal du Feu (OCF) of the Canton of Valais. The inspections are carried out by local officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities said in a press conference that inspections on a building the size of Le Constellation should have been carried out each year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has contacted the OCF to request access to previous inspection documents.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Exit routes from the bar</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say they will also focus on exit routes at the bar, which sits across two levels - a ground floor and a basement. The fire is thought to have started in the basement, where the two images referred to above were taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos filmed as the fire took hold show people trying to extinguish the flames before trying to get out of the basement up a narrow set of stairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Galea said staircase exits can be fatal bottlenecks with people tripping and getting trampled.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\"></figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said even if there were other fire exits, panicked people in unfamiliar spaces were more likely to go out the way they came in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials also confirmed there was more than one exit from the building, but added they were \"not currently able to say\" whether the emergency exit was open or closed at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Valais state councillor Stéphane Ganzer said: \"There is not just one door, even though at the time of the fire, it seems that most people left through the main entrance. But this building is a public place. It was obviously equipped with an emergency exit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pilloud told journalists that the two French managers of the bar had been interviewed as well as people who escaped the fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the bar's owners reportedly told local media the establishment had been inspected three times in the past ten years and that everything had been done according to regulations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Sparklers used before</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigators say they have also been analysing other videos of the venue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One video we found shows sparklers attached to bottles being used inside the bar as far back as 2024. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"YouTube An image taken from a YouTube video posted in 2024 which shows someone holding a bottle with a lit sparkler attached in the air in Le Constellation bar. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">YouTube</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A still image from a YouTube video posted in 2024 showing someone holding a bottle with a sparkler in Le Constellation bar. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It shows women dressed in distinctive crash helmets carrying the bottles and pyrotechnics to customers, before detaching them and pouring drinks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The footage was uploaded to YouTube in May 2024 by the account @ConstellationCransMontana, though we can't be certain when it was filmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Over the last year, an unprecedented 18 condo projects were cancelled in the city, with experts expecting that number will grow as demand continues to plummet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The downturn has reignited debate over whether developers catered too much to real estate investors by building smaller, more affordable units that minimised square footage to keep prices low in areas where land values are high, and which were often designed to be rented out or flipped for profit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investors own the majority of condos under 600 sq ft in Toronto, according to national database Statistics Canada. Construction of these small units skyrocketed in 2016, and they now make up 38% of condos built in the city, compared with only 7.7% before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These units have not exploded in the same way in the US, where they represent a very small share of the market, though Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, said \"their prevalence has roughly doubled over the past decade\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With so much inventory on the market in Canada, some micro-condos that had sold for half a million dollars a few years ago are now reselling for C$300,000 ($217,000; £163,000) or less – a price recently unthinkable in downtown Toronto, which is often cited as one of the most unaffordable cities in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a race to the bottom getting these things sold,\" said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, an organisation that has been tracking the high-rise market in Toronto for decades. (Shaun Hildebrand is not related to Ms Hildebrand.)</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why are so many condos sitting empty?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The condo slump is not unique to Toronto, with Vancouver experiencing a similar –albeit smaller – downturn since 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are a few reasons for this, experts tell the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First is an overabundant supply. Thousands of units were  built over the last two years, in part to meet an unprecedented surge in Canada's population driven largely by immigration, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the number of newcomers dropped sharply following a shift in Canada's immigration policies, made partly to address the housing crunch. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://economics.bmo.com/en/publications/detail/8b9b865f-94ef-4161-a81f-bad7ad8c3fd4/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report released in December by the Bank of Montreal</a> shows that Canada's population saw its largest decline in 2025 on record since the 1940s, barring the 2020 Covid pandemic, driven mainly by new immigration caps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a turn-around that developers could not have predicted, and resulted in more than 60,000 new units completed in recent years to meet a demand that no longer exists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Simply put, \"the market just got way too ahead of itself\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second reason is pricing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's central bank lowered interest rates during the pandemic to stimulate the economy, and investors, looking to buy in a real estate market that had seemed like a sure bet for decades, assumed prices could only continue to rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a while they did, spiking \"to a level that really made no sense\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, the Bank of Canada began to increase rates to battle post-pandemic inflation. Combined with oversupply, that sure bet became less certain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, some investors are having trouble closing on units they bought pre-construction at those inflated prices. Many have been forced to try and sell them at a significant loss. Others are too spooked to enter the market or are waiting for prices to drop even further, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is some speculation that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64082923\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Canada's 2022 freeze on foreign home buyers</a>, brought in to help tackle the housing affordability crisis, also played a role. Numbers show that they represent a small fraction of owners – around 2% to 6% – but Mr Hildebrand said it is possible it has sent a signal that Canada is closed for business.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Maggie Hildebrand shares on TikTok what it's like to live in a micro condo</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The condo crash and the housing market</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One clear winner from the downturn of the condo market is renters like Ms Hildebrand, who now have more options due to greater supply and slightly better deals on rent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Hildebrand paid C$2,200 a month for her micro-condo. She has since moved to a larger, 700 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in an older building with a leafy backyard for only C$200 more. She credits the move to a big improvement in her quality of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My birthday is tomorrow, and I'm having a party and hosting 25 people,\" she told the BBC in December. \"A year ago, that was not possible.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hildebrand said the slump will likely change who developers see as their main customer, shifting from short-term investors seeking quick profits towards longer-term investors and people who plan to settle in the condo they're buying,</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've learned our lesson here,\" he said. The units won't be phased out altogether, he noted, because there is still demand for affordability, \"but we went way too far\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some buyers are benefiting, too. Alex Cruz, a Toronto-based estate agent at Ari Zadegan Group Realty, told the BBC that smaller units were being purchased by those looking for a bargain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there is a good deal per square foot, people will buy it,\" Mr Cruz said, adding it had given some \"an opportunity to get into the market\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The slump comes as Canada grapples with a housing crisis that has become a central political issue for all levels of government. Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to double the rate of new homes built in the next decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the construction of thousands of units now put on hold or cancelled, there will be fewer units entering the market by the end of the decade. This could exacerbate Canada's housing crunch, Mr Hildebrand said, as condos are heavily relied on to boost supply in big cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Mr Hildebrand and others warn that the low prices will be short-lived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The question now is how long do we stay here, and what are the implications going to be for the housing supply in the next decade?\" Mr Hildebrand said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible.
